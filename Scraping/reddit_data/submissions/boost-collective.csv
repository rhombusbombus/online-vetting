TakeTurns document requests, or [file requests](https://help.taketurns.app/en/work-with-requests), are one feature that many of our users find useful. In some external collaborations, parties request documents when they need data and proof of its validity.

For example, I recently spoke to a mortgage broker who is using TakeTurns. As part of the mortgage application process, he collects a lot of documents from his clients. Before TakeTurns, his primary tool was email, and it was miserable. While the process always started cleanly (he emailed a file named checklist.pdf), the process got messy incredibly quickly. Clients invariably worked the checklist in a piecemeal fashion, blasting out multiple emails and creating a thicket of email threads. 

For a single application, this unstructured mess of email made it tough to determine what was missing, what needed to be corrected, and–if something was corrected or amended–which version of the document was correct. While this might be annoying for a single application, when you take a step back and look at the broker’s entire book of business and realize that this was the situation for nearly every client, you can feel the loss of productivity and understand his team’s frustration. 

By comparison, our users prefer TakeTurns file requests because it's a simple way to request documents or files in a way that’s structured and trackable. 

# Here’s how it works

### Step 1

* The broker invites his client to a collaboration. The participants can be an individual or multiple family members and can include 3rd parties such as the buyer's agent or attorney. 
* He creates a set of document requests with clear instructions and sends it to his client. The set of requests takes the place of a document checklist.

### Step 2

The client fulfills requests by uploading the corresponding documents and sending an update.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cgj0ue1zczfc1.png?width=1344&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb21e7b431ff34839245f60aa834eb0f33f53bb0

### Step 3

If some documents are missing or new requests are required, the broker can make updates and send it back. And at any time, the broker can chat with his client.

### Subsequent steps

This back-and-forth collaboration, or turn-by-turn exchange, goes on until the mortgage application is complete. The entire process takes place within one TakeTurns Collaboration and contains the full history.  

But that’s not all.  

When the collaboration is done, the mortgage broker and his clients can download the completed versions of all files (along with the supporting documentation!) in one click. That package can be sent for signature and records retention (archiving) if required.

And, because TakeTurns takes an ephemeral storage approach, after a user-defined period of time (the collaboration’s grace period) all the files are removed from TakeTurns.  In fact, the timely removal of an applicant’s personal data and documents is an important legal obligation for mortgage brokers.   Back when the broker was on email, this exercise took days. And while best efforts were made to remove all the PII, there was no guarantee since the process was completely manual.

,Entrepreneur,"This is a long one. I hope you enjoy it.  
  
Hi, I'm Stephen.—a digital enthusiast and fractional marketer. In 2017, I established my marketing agency to help brand owners with Digital advertising. We successfully scaled several brands using our methods. However, over time, I started noticing a gap in knowledge between ad platforms and business owners. Owners didn't have the time to keep up with the ongoing changes in the industry, and the platforms didn't have time to train the owners. So, naturally, I transitioned into a consulting role.  
  
Although I'd never documented my methods, I continued to apply them because I knew they worked.  
  
If you read until the end, you'll start to understand how to operate paid advertising platforms for your business.  
  
  
PRINCIPLES  
  
  
In 2019, I began working with an online retailer. After an initial sales call, I gathered the team and implemented each principle below. With these principles, we scaled the online retailer to the largest store in its category, growing 338.95% in 4 years. To put it in perspective, that's a brand going from 6 figures to mid-7 figures in under 5 years. We repeated the process several times with other online brands.  
  
When designing the framework, I noticed it resembled a solar system, with the 'unified goal' as the sun. The three planets closest to the sun are the 'systems,' and the three furthest away are the 'strategies'. None of the systems or strategies would exist without the sun, nor would they survive long without each other.  
  
The order of these principles is as follows.

Let’s go into a bit more detail.  
  
  
AUDIT  
  
  
The playbook begins with an audit. At this stage, I'm identifying problems and looking into the brand pricing, positioning, audience and value to determine whether investing money into digital advertising is worth it. I'm looking for an indication that the product is scalable. The quickest way to determine if it's the case is if the product generates organic revenue. I'll audit the technical side if the business is ready to grow. A technical audit evaluates the website, pixels, tracking, and email lists. To do this yourself, break the checks down into the following areas.  
  
  
\- CRO (Conversion Rate Optimisation) - This is how your website converts users.   
\- SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) - How your website is found in the search engine.   
\- Pixels and Tracking - Analytics and Data Collection.   
\- First-Party Data Collection - Email Lists and Sign-Up Pages.   
\- Catalogues and Product Feeds   
\- Billing   
\- Mobile Optimisation   
  
  
This process is commonly known as a SWOT analysis. Complete this section before moving on to the next stage.  
  
  
SIMPLIFY  
  
  
In the pursuit of performance, simplicity is my guiding principle. When I'm finished with an audit, I shift my focus towards brand goals. My aim is to find unified metrics to agree upon. This process is called 'unified goals'.   
  
  
One metric to measure for all advertising platforms.  
  
  
The idea behind unified goals is to establish a set of standardised metrics that can be applied across all channels, allowing for apples-to-apples comparisons. It prevents cross-pollination attribution between channels. It encourages businesses to rally behind a uniform goal. Examples of unified metrics include:  
  
  
\- Revenue  
\- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)  
\- Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)  
\- Lifetime Value (LTV)  
\- Conversion Rate (CR)  
  
  
Once you've agreed on a metric as your benchmark for performance, all management, staff and agencies become accountable to that goal. Discovering your unified goal will also lead to more efficient reporting. When you plug all your advertising channels into one place, combine the data and analyse the trends based on your goal, you'll notice patterns and areas of improvement.   
  
  
Even though it's still a good idea to look at the performance of each channel, creating a blended report will help with simplicity. This strategy has saved me countless times.   
  
  
Simplifying platforms  
  
  
The advertising channels you choose depend on two things. 1. your unified goal and 2. your familiarity with the platform. For context, each platform has a user base with its own behaviours. I've categorised them into two areas.   
  
  
\- Acquisition - Pattern Interruption (awareness and new customers)  
\- Conversions - Search Intent (purchases and existing customers)  
  
  
Each unified goal we set will align with one of these two behaviours (acquisition or conversions), and both work together.  
  
For example, Meta is an 'acquisition' platform that matches the uniform goal of 'revenue', whereas Google is a 'conversion' platform that matches the uniform goal of 'ROAS'. When these two platforms are combined, you get a mixture of Revenue and ROAS (acquisition and conversions).  
  
  
Here are more examples.   
  
  
\- Email - Conversions  
\- TikTok - Acquisition  
  
  
Whichever Uniform Goal you choose will require a balance between Acquisition and Conversions.  
  
  
When considering your uniform goal, think about which platforms your team are familiar with, or hire a team familiar with the platform needed to achieve your goal.  
  
  
Unified Campaigns  
  
  
The final part of the simplification process is campaigns. Now that you know your uniform goal, we can set up a simplified campaign structure optimised for that goal. We aren't looking for complex audience targeting and sophisticated funnels in the beginning. Our performance will result from how we execute the following two stages.  
  
  
CURATE  
  
  
After establishing a simplified foundation, my attention always shifts towards creatives. The success or failure of a digital strategy hinges on how creatives are tested and implemented.   
  
Throughout my years of auditing accounts, I still observe overly complex campaign structures, funnels, and testing methodologies, often featuring only one or two creatives. You need to recalibrate your approach, adopting a creatives-first policy. So, how do we achieve this? Firstly, it's worth shifting our perception.   
  
  
\- We must acknowledge the subjectivity of creatives and recognise a human at the end of the ad \_(with tastes different from our own.)  
\- Organic creatives are our friends; they perform as ads, too.  
\- Creatives demand optimisation and consistency. Once we find what works, stick with it. (I understand this might be a challenge for seasonal brands).  
  
  
As you eliminate subjectivity from the equation and redirect focus towards how customers interact with the ad, you'll unlock the potential for high-converting creatives. Surprisingly, the creatives I've seen yield the most results over the years are often the least expected.  
  
  
Armed with this understanding, how do we determine which creatives to use? While each advertising platform has its unique style, we'll require a mix of images and videos.   
  
Great, so let's organise our creatives into a folder to be distributed across each ad channel. From here, we want to test five to ten creatives at a time on each platform until we find the best-performing ads, which we'll review in more detail in the following stages.  
  
  
AUTOMATE  
  
  
Society loves automation. It fosters business growth and liberates time. Fortunately, leveraging automation for ads has become significantly easier.  
  
There are three key advantages to automating the digital ads process:  
  
  
\- Time Efficiency  
\- Improved Budget Allocation  
\- Lower Cost Per Result  
  
  
In the past, achieving these benefits required creating hundreds of automated 'rules' which demanded a half-decent media buyer. However, today, nearly all advertising platforms come equipped with built-in automation.  
  
Meta employs 'Advantage+ shopping automation, which eliminates the need for detailed audience targeting,' Google features Performance Max, which automates the bidding process' and TikTok offers 'Smart Campaigns, a beta version of Meta's adv+'.   
  
Embracing these options will allow you to capitalise on the platform's algorithms, streamlining your campaigns for optimal results. This approach enables budget consolidation into fewer, more optimised campaigns, saving time and enabling a sharper focus on creatives.   
  
In the words of Meta: ""Compared to manual campaigns, Advantage Plus shopping campaigns are optimised and demonstrate a lower cost per result, a 17% improvement in cost per acquisition, and a 32% increase in return on ad spend.""  
  
  
OPTIMISE  
  
  
When I first started online advertising, I struggled with optimisation. It took me a while to realise you could lift the performance of a campaign with specific tweaks.   
  
I discovered that optimisation makes or breaks campaigns and has the potential to make a founder rich. But only when done correctly.   
  
Before making changes to campaigns, consider two areas: budget and creatives (ads). I'll begin with creatives.   
  
Firstly, allow an ad to run and spend for a while, so you're only optimising ads with collected data.   
  
  
For example:   
  
  
An ad that's spent £5 for a product that costs £1000 wouldn't provide the necessary data to optimise. However, an ad that's spent £300 for a £1000 product would. To determine how long to let an ad run before making changes, figure out your average cost per acquisition (CPA) and multiply that by two. It will give you more of an understanding of how much to spend per ad before optimising.   
  
Now we've established our minimum threshold per ad, let's dive into how we optimise the ads.  
  
Metrics Using Facebook as an example, users engage with an ad by stopping, reading, liking, clicking through, and purchasing. So consider the following metrics.   
  
  
\- Thumb Stop Ratio  
\- CPC  
\- CTR \_(Link)\_  
\- Outbound CTR  
\- Cost per Add-to-Cart  
\- Cost per Purchase  
\- ROAS  
  
  
Thumb-stop ratio - is a 3-second video view divided by impressions and is your measurement of the number of people who have stopped a scroll to view your ad.   
  
  
CPC - is your cost per click on the ad. Any click, engagement or click-through will be registered in your CPC.   
  
  
CTR (Link - These are clicks on a link. These links might be to your website or an on-platform experience.   
  
  
Outbound CTR - Clicks that are off the platform to your website.   
  
  
Cost per add to cart - The number of browsers who have added to the cart and either purchased or abandoned it.   
  
  
Cost per purchase - the cost per purchase   
  
  
ROAS - The return for every dollar spent.  
  
  
With some clever maths, you can combine all of these metrics to produce a performance score, with weight on the most critical ones. I'll go into more detail on how you can do this in another guide.   
  
But for now, you can work out the performance of each ad by looking at these metrics yourself.   
  
  
Here's how I'd rank the importance of each metric.   
  
  
\- ROAS  
\- Cost Per Purchase  
\- Cost Per Add To Cart  
\- Outbound CTR  
\- CTR  
\- CPC  
\- Thumb Stop Ratio  
  
  
Budget  
  
As we make progress, optimising the budget becomes the next step.   
  
Budget increases work best in small increments. For instance, if you want to scale your campaigns from £100 to £1000, I recommend doing so by 20% daily. This approach avoids disrupting the algorithm and is applicable across most advertising platforms. A £100 budget would take 14 days to scale efficiently to £1000. You can also opt for a faster scale but anticipate a slight dip in results as your campaigns re-optimise.  
  
  
SCALE  
  
  
Once we've completed the earlier steps in the equation, we can scale our campaigns horizontally or vertically.   
  
  
Horizontal Scaling:  
  
Horizontal scaling boosts a budget by introducing new campaigns or platforms. Instead of increasing the budget for an existing campaign, you'd seek to reach new users by creating new ones. For example, if we're meeting our unified goal in a smaller market using TikTok, horizontal scaling would mean creating new campaigns on Google and targeting different audiences (e.g., users more likely to add items to their cart).   
  
  
Vertical Scaling:  
  
Vertical scaling is the process of increasing budgets on an existing campaign. The goal of this strategy is to extract the most value out of our existing audience. Scaling this way makes sense when your business operates in a larger market with a small budget.  
  
Both horizontal and vertical scaling offer unique benefits, and it makes sense to incorporate both into your strategy.   
  
There are some drawbacks to each one, however.   
  
Vertical scaling comes with the risk of an increased cost per result, and horizontal scaling comes with the challenge of unproven campaigns.   
  
I've witnessed both strategies work in different scenarios.   
  
Let's use a horizontal scaling example. A brand I worked with needed help scaling their business into different offers. Even though sales were good on their initial offer, the margins were much higher on their second, but they needed a plan to grow it. When I came in, I took the second offer through each stage of the playbook and set up a separate campaign for it. Within a few months, the ROAS was double that of the initial offer due to the higher average order value. By using horizontal scaling, we'd established two campaigns that we could scale vertically in the future.   
  
With scaling, you can push your brand to the limits of its potential. Examples of brands using this strategy include Shien, Temu, Zoe and Manscaped.  
  
  
CONCLUSION  
  
  
Congratulations! You've just taken the first step towards transforming your online advertising. In this guide, I've delved into the principles I use for successful digital advertising campaigns.   
  
I have an ebook version of this if you want to refer back to it. Reach out and let me know.",t2_t5obsygjl,False,,0,False,I wrote 6 principles for crafting and executing high-performance digital campaigns.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Best Practices'}]",r/Entrepreneur,False,6.0,blacknwhitesmall,0.0,,,True,t3_1ag9ohd,False,dark,1.0,,public,1.0,0.0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Best Practices,False,1,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,,1706789904.0,richtext,6.0,,,text,self.Entrepreneur,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a long one. I hope you enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi, I&amp;#39;m Stephen.—a digital enthusiast and fractional marketer. In 2017, I established my marketing agency to help brand owners with Digital advertising. We successfully scaled several brands using our methods. However, over time, I started noticing a gap in knowledge between ad platforms and business owners. Owners didn&amp;#39;t have the time to keep up with the ongoing changes in the industry, and the platforms didn&amp;#39;t have time to train the owners. So, naturally, I transitioned into a consulting role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I&amp;#39;d never documented my methods, I continued to apply them because I knew they worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read until the end, you&amp;#39;ll start to understand how to operate paid advertising platforms for your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PRINCIPLES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, I began working with an online retailer. After an initial sales call, I gathered the team and implemented each principle below. With these principles, we scaled the online retailer to the largest store in its category, growing 338.95% in 4 years. To put it in perspective, that&amp;#39;s a brand going from 6 figures to mid-7 figures in under 5 years. We repeated the process several times with other online brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When designing the framework, I noticed it resembled a solar system, with the &amp;#39;unified goal&amp;#39; as the sun. The three planets closest to the sun are the &amp;#39;systems,&amp;#39; and the three furthest away are the &amp;#39;strategies&amp;#39;. None of the systems or strategies would exist without the sun, nor would they survive long without each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The order of these principles is as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Audit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Simplify&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Curate&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Automate&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Optimise&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Scale&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s go into a bit more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AUDIT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The playbook begins with an audit. At this stage, I&amp;#39;m identifying problems and looking into the brand pricing, positioning, audience and value to determine whether investing money into digital advertising is worth it. I&amp;#39;m looking for an indication that the product is scalable. The quickest way to determine if it&amp;#39;s the case is if the product generates organic revenue. I&amp;#39;ll audit the technical side if the business is ready to grow. A technical audit evaluates the website, pixels, tracking, and email lists. To do this yourself, break the checks down into the following areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- CRO (Conversion Rate Optimisation) - This is how your website converts users. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) - How your website is found in the search engine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Pixels and Tracking - Analytics and Data Collection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- First-Party Data Collection - Email Lists and Sign-Up Pages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Catalogues and Product Feeds &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Billing &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Mobile Optimisation &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process is commonly known as a SWOT analysis. Complete this section before moving on to the next stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SIMPLIFY&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the pursuit of performance, simplicity is my guiding principle. When I&amp;#39;m finished with an audit, I shift my focus towards brand goals. My aim is to find unified metrics to agree upon. This process is called &amp;#39;unified goals&amp;#39;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One metric to measure for all advertising platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea behind unified goals is to establish a set of standardised metrics that can be applied across all channels, allowing for apples-to-apples comparisons. It prevents cross-pollination attribution between channels. It encourages businesses to rally behind a uniform goal. Examples of unified metrics include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Revenue&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Lifetime Value (LTV)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Conversion Rate (CR)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#39;ve agreed on a metric as your benchmark for performance, all management, staff and agencies become accountable to that goal. Discovering your unified goal will also lead to more efficient reporting. When you plug all your advertising channels into one place, combine the data and analyse the trends based on your goal, you&amp;#39;ll notice patterns and areas of improvement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though it&amp;#39;s still a good idea to look at the performance of each channel, creating a blended report will help with simplicity. This strategy has saved me countless times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simplifying platforms&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advertising channels you choose depend on two things. 1. your unified goal and 2. your familiarity with the platform. For context, each platform has a user base with its own behaviours. I&amp;#39;ve categorised them into two areas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Acquisition - Pattern Interruption (awareness and new customers)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Conversions - Search Intent (purchases and existing customers)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each unified goal we set will align with one of these two behaviours (acquisition or conversions), and both work together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Meta is an &amp;#39;acquisition&amp;#39; platform that matches the uniform goal of &amp;#39;revenue&amp;#39;, whereas Google is a &amp;#39;conversion&amp;#39; platform that matches the uniform goal of &amp;#39;ROAS&amp;#39;. When these two platforms are combined, you get a mixture of Revenue and ROAS (acquisition and conversions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are more examples. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Email - Conversions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- TikTok - Acquisition&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whichever Uniform Goal you choose will require a balance between Acquisition and Conversions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When considering your uniform goal, think about which platforms your team are familiar with, or hire a team familiar with the platform needed to achieve your goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unified Campaigns&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final part of the simplification process is campaigns. Now that you know your uniform goal, we can set up a simplified campaign structure optimised for that goal. We aren&amp;#39;t looking for complex audience targeting and sophisticated funnels in the beginning. Our performance will result from how we execute the following two stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CURATE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After establishing a simplified foundation, my attention always shifts towards creatives. The success or failure of a digital strategy hinges on how creatives are tested and implemented. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great, so let&amp;#39;s organise our creatives into a folder to be distributed across each ad channel. From here, we want to test five to ten creatives at a time on each platform until we find the best-performing ads, which we&amp;#39;ll review in more detail in the following stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AUTOMATE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Society loves automation. It fosters business growth and liberates time. Fortunately, leveraging automation for ads has become significantly easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three key advantages to automating the digital ads process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Time Efficiency&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Improved Budget Allocation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Lower Cost Per Result&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, achieving these benefits required creating hundreds of automated &amp;#39;rules&amp;#39; which demanded a half-decent media buyer. However, today, nearly all advertising platforms come equipped with built-in automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meta employs &amp;#39;Advantage+ shopping automation, which eliminates the need for detailed audience targeting,&amp;#39; Google features Performance Max, which automates the bidding process&amp;#39; and TikTok offers &amp;#39;Smart Campaigns, a beta version of Meta&amp;#39;s adv+&amp;#39;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embracing these options will allow you to capitalise on the platform&amp;#39;s algorithms, streamlining your campaigns for optimal results. This approach enables budget consolidation into fewer, more optimised campaigns, saving time and enabling a sharper focus on creatives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the words of Meta: &amp;quot;Compared to manual campaigns, Advantage Plus shopping campaigns are optimised and demonstrate a lower cost per result, a 17% improvement in cost per acquisition, and a 32% increase in return on ad spend.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OPTIMISE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first started online advertising, I struggled with optimisation. It took me a while to realise you could lift the performance of a campaign with specific tweaks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discovered that optimisation makes or breaks campaigns and has the potential to make a founder rich. But only when done correctly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before making changes to campaigns, consider two areas: budget and creatives (ads). I&amp;#39;ll begin with creatives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, allow an ad to run and spend for a while, so you&amp;#39;re only optimising ads with collected data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ad that&amp;#39;s spent £5 for a product that costs £1000 wouldn&amp;#39;t provide the necessary data to optimise. However, an ad that&amp;#39;s spent £300 for a £1000 product would. To determine how long to let an ad run before making changes, figure out your average cost per acquisition (CPA) and multiply that by two. It will give you more of an understanding of how much to spend per ad before optimising. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we&amp;#39;ve established our minimum threshold per ad, let&amp;#39;s dive into how we optimise the ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metrics Using Facebook as an example, users engage with an ad by stopping, reading, liking, clicking through, and purchasing. So consider the following metrics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Thumb Stop Ratio&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- CPC&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- CTR _(Link)_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Outbound CTR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Cost per Add-to-Cart&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Cost per Purchase&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- ROAS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thumb-stop ratio - is a 3-second video view divided by impressions and is your measurement of the number of people who have stopped a scroll to view your ad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CPC - is your cost per click on the ad. Any click, engagement or click-through will be registered in your CPC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CTR (Link - These are clicks on a link. These links might be to your website or an on-platform experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outbound CTR - Clicks that are off the platform to your website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost per add to cart - The number of browsers who have added to the cart and either purchased or abandoned it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost per purchase - the cost per purchase &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ROAS - The return for every dollar spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With some clever maths, you can combine all of these metrics to produce a performance score, with weight on the most critical ones. I&amp;#39;ll go into more detail on how you can do this in another guide. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for now, you can work out the performance of each ad by looking at these metrics yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s how I&amp;#39;d rank the importance of each metric. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- ROAS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Cost Per Purchase&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Cost Per Add To Cart&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Outbound CTR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- CTR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- CPC&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Thumb Stop Ratio&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Budget&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we make progress, optimising the budget becomes the next step. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Budget increases work best in small increments. For instance, if you want to scale your campaigns from £100 to £1000, I recommend doing so by 20% daily. This approach avoids disrupting the algorithm and is applicable across most advertising platforms. A £100 budget would take 14 days to scale efficiently to £1000. You can also opt for a faster scale but anticipate a slight dip in results as your campaigns re-optimise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SCALE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we&amp;#39;ve completed the earlier steps in the equation, we can scale our campaigns horizontally or vertically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Horizontal Scaling:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Horizontal scaling boosts a budget by introducing new campaigns or platforms. Instead of increasing the budget for an existing campaign, you&amp;#39;d seek to reach new users by creating new ones. For example, if we&amp;#39;re meeting our unified goal in a smaller market using TikTok, horizontal scaling would mean creating new campaigns on Google and targeting different audiences (e.g., users more likely to add items to their cart). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vertical Scaling:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vertical scaling is the process of increasing budgets on an existing campaign. The goal of this strategy is to extract the most value out of our existing audience. Scaling this way makes sense when your business operates in a larger market with a small budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both horizontal and vertical scaling offer unique benefits, and it makes sense to incorporate both into your strategy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some drawbacks to each one, however. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vertical scaling comes with the risk of an increased cost per result, and horizontal scaling comes with the challenge of unproven campaigns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve witnessed both strategies work in different scenarios. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s use a horizontal scaling example. A brand I worked with needed help scaling their business into different offers. Even though sales were good on their initial offer, the margins were much higher on their second, but they needed a plan to grow it. When I came in, I took the second offer through each stage of the playbook and set up a separate campaign for it. Within a few months, the ROAS was double that of the initial offer due to the higher average order value. By using horizontal scaling, we&amp;#39;d established two campaigns that we could scale vertically in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With scaling, you can push your brand to the limits of its potential. Examples of brands using this strategy include Shien, Temu, Zoe and Manscaped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You&amp;#39;ve just taken the first step towards transforming your online advertising. In this guide, I&amp;#39;ve delved into the principles I use for successful digital advertising campaigns. &lt;/p&gt;

,HFY,"I looked out into the black of the council chamber, to admit to collapsing in front of a lower species was to some races akin to incompetence but there was no outrage or cries for me to be charged with dereliction of duty, only silence.

  
“I awoke in my quarters a little later, my first officer and our shipboard medic both standing over me with worried looks on their faces as I had been unconscious for several hours, but I felt ok and reassured them that I was fine, my head hurt a little and I gingerly touched my head, to fine that it was clad in a soft bandage made of the strangest material.” 

  
“I was informed that once I had passed out the human representative had called over another human who had wrapped my head in this bandage, they had carried me to the airlock and set me down, my first officer and several others of my crew had carried me inside and to my surprise our medic, someone who was notoriously hard to impress had said that his human counterpart had done a good job on stopping the blood and bandaging me up.”

  
“I heard a strange metallic clank, then another and the ship began to shudder and lurched forward, What was going on I demanded as I rose from my bunk and made for the bridge, my first officer was trying to explain to me that the humans had a plan, they had called in all vessels in the area, big and small to come and attached themselves to our hull and they were dragging us towards the coast and shallower water so we wouldn’t sink any lower.”

  
“The humans had also delivered a larger amount of food and medical supplies, although the medical supplies were basic, they were effective. And the food…the human food had gone down especially well with my crew and passengers, it was delicious. I entered the bridge and was shocked to see the human representative standing at one of the windows, looking out at the vast armada or human vessels helping us, he turned to look at me as I approached him.”

  
“To think, there are vessels from multiple navies out there, all working together, some for the first time in history to help people we have only just met” he said with a smile on his lips. “By the way my name is Aden”.

  
“I cannot thank you enough I said to the human named as Aden, my name is Quelik, and this is my ship, the divine destiny” I replied.

  
“Over the coming days the humans managed to drag our ship as close as they possibly could to land, then they rather unexpectedly started on plans to lift our ship out of the water so we could repair the hull damage and become space worthy, all the while providing us with food and medicine, every nation on the planet had sent aid and delegates to meet us. Safe areas were created onshore for us to move the refugees and wounded from the ship, the humans provided clothes and shelter to us without asking for anything in return, they genuinely seemed happy to meet and interact with us, it seemed that confirming they weren’t alone in the universe made them much happier as a people, their children playing with our children, it was frankly quite overwhelming”.

  
“Then one day I was asked to attend a meeting of the UN council, the UN being the planets equivalent to this federation council, I travelled to the meeting with some trepidation as it is one of our greatest laws to not provide non FTL species with advanced technology, I was brought before the council and was asked a variety of questions, most important was how we came to crash on their planet and how our ship had been damaged.  I explained to increasingly worried faces that what had happened and that we were fleeing a Hasykk invasion and the people on my ship were refugees and that we meant them no harm and were grateful for all their help.”

  
“It was at this point I noticed the concerned looks on the faces of the assembled delegates, it was at this point I realised by crashing onto their planet we had, quite possibly alerted the Hasykk to their presence, and to a race of slavers like the Hasykk a planet of non FTL people would be easy prey. I was shocked with this realisation and continued to answer their remaining questions, it was only after I left the meeting and was back on my ship that my first officer asked what the humans had asked for in returns for their help, I looked at him and blankly stated the truth, they had asked for nothing, but in return we had quite possibly doomed them if the Hasykk had tracked our trajectory.”

  
“My first officer looked at me for a moment and then a wave of shock spread across his face as he came to terms with what I had just said, Fuck was his only reply.  It was safe to say that my crew and the refugees by this time had developed quite an affinity for the humans, who continued unabated in providing us with aid and helping us with our ship, the joint efforts of over 60 countries our ship was finally lifted from the water and 1000’s of human workers all volunteers, began fabricating replacement hull plating and assisting with the repair work, whilst doing this they even filled out our  holds with food, medicine and clothing in preparation for the day we finally could leave.”

  
“Over time we also noticed that the humans had begun accelerating their space program, they had unified the entire planet in one purpose, every nation on the planet contributing as best they could but they made hardly much progress, but they increased the number of primitive rockets sent into space, and it became difficult preventing members of my crew who became very fond of the humans from providing them with at least a boost up their technology.”

  
“The days of repair work turned into weeks and they came and went, we were introduced to the human holiday called Christmas, a planetary festival of one of their main religions in which presents are exchanged between families and friends, it was shocking that all the children we had with us received multiple presents from humans, what was even more shocking was that we adults also received presents as well. My human friend Aden providing me with a volume of Terry Pratchett’s work, a human whose literature is their planets finest and he was one of their planet’s greatest writers.”

  
“And then the day finally came when my chief engineer came up to me and informed me that all repairs had been completed as best we could with the resources and tools available but our long range communications were still not working due to us landing the ship on the communications array and leaving it on the bottom of the human ocean and that we would require fuel, I was reluctant to ask the humans for anything further as they had done so much for us already.”

  
“I approached Aden and informed him of our situation, he asked how they could help with the fuel situation, and I asked if they could provide us with as much liquid hydrogen as possible, we could get into space and start collecting our own fuel, he smiled and said that he would get what he could for us.”

  
“At this point I don’t know what I was expecting but the next day we had a massive delivery of liquid hydrogen, more than enough to completely fill our fuel tanks with plenty left over. At this point I cannot express my high regard of human ingenuity, the refuelling was always going to be tricky as the humans aren’t used to interstellar refuelling standards, but after a little time looking at our refuelling port and the long tubes that the humans had a female human engineer came up with a rather simple but extremely effective solution, using what the humans call chewing gum.” 

  
“So, after 20 days on the human world, we were ready to leave, I asked to address the UN council to express my gratitude and this was granted, the human leader gave me a box as a gift to the people of the federation, containing examples of human, music, literature, poetry, fashion, cuisine, basically everything they could of their culture.” 

  
“On my return to my ship I openly cried, the humans had shown us nothing, but kindness and we could have potentially damned them to slavery or worse, and all we could leave them with was that they weren’t alone in the universe, I watched despondent from my bridge window as another unmanned human rocket was blasted off into space.”

&lt;h2&gt;VizardAI Review: User Interface&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Dashboard Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When creating an effective dashboard design, it&amp;#39;s important to consider factors like visual hierarchy, data organization, and user interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An intuitive layout with clear, easily understandable data visualization is crucial for the end user to quickly grasp the information presented.&lt;/p&gt;

,SideProject,"I took an interview of a 15yo school-going boy building 2 SaaS projects. 

His future is going to be insane if he keeps going.  


Here's the interview  
  
He's Mehdi Khoudali, a 15-year-old student from Casablanca, Morocco, who started his journey by hacking mobile phones at the age of 13.  
  
He has now embarked on creating two innovative SaaS products, TagU and FeedbackLoop.  
  
In this exclusive interview, he shares his daily routine, the sparks of inspiration that ignited their startups, the hurdles they faced in the early days, and the genius strategies they used to bring their products to life.  
  
This is an epic tale of how Mehdi hustled for funding through pre-sales and the invaluable lessons he’s learned in his journey.  
  
This interview is like a backstage pass to the mind of a young trailblazer who’s preparing to shake up the entrepreneurial world.  
  
Tell us a little bit about your background and how did you end up with what you’re doing today.  
  
I’m a 15-year-old SaaS builder. I started by looking at how to hack mobile phones from my small room when I was 13, then started learning coding, did some little tinny projects, and now, I’m building 2 SaaS products with my friends.  
  
2. What does your day look like?  
  
I wake up at 5 am, have breakfast, and start working. I get 2 hours before going to school to work.  
  
During these 2 hours, I either work on my content and schedule more social media posts for both X/Twitter &amp; Linkedin, or I start coding if I have features to add or bugs to fix.  
  
My class starts at 8:30 am and gets over at 16:30 pm.  
  
When I get back home after class, I work a bit on coding for my products, content planning, or marketing.  
  
3. What does your startup do, and what inspired you to start it?  
  
I have two main products.  
  
One of them is still under development.  
  
It’s called TagU, and it aims to boost collaboration on the web by allowing team members to leave messages as sticky notes where they can either leave a screenshot or simply a message.  
  
The other one is up and running.  
  
It’s a 100% free tool I created mainly for myself, but I decided to make it public. It helps startups to collect bug reports from their users easily.  
  
It’s called FeedbackLoop.  
  
4. What’s your company’s revenue &amp; profit for last month, and what’s its valuation at the moment?  
  
Right now, both of them are fully free, but TagU was pre-sold before we even started building it.  
  
It generated 150$-200$ in pre-sales, which gave us the necessary funding to build it.  
  
FeedbackLoop is free, but we’ll be adding the paid plan soon.  
  
5. What were some of the biggest challenges and obstacles you faced in the early days of your startup? And How did you overcome those challenges?  
  
The main challenge I faced was the complexity of TagU.  
  
Fortunately, my senior dev friend helped me with it.  
  
And I had to learn a lot.  
  
6. Do you have a team? If yes, how did you build your team, and what qualities do you look for in team members?  
  
TagU’s team has 4 members. It’s my friend Rohan who reached out to me and two other co-founders for this project.  
  
The main role I look for in this is communication.  
  
7. What marketing strategies did you use or planning to use to acquire customers and grow your user base?  
  
For FeedbackLoop, which is currently on the market, I’m using blogging &amp; social media along with community building.  
  
With these marketing tactics, I got more than 100 users in less than one week.  
  
8. How did you get your first 10 and 100 customers/users?  
  
I wrote a Tweet about the launch of FeedbackLoop, which got 100 likes and many retweets.  
  
I also wrote 2 articles on Medium that got almost 2k views and brought the main traffic for the tweet.  
  
I also shared it in my community, SkyRing, and some others.  
  
9. How did you fund your startup, and what advice do you have for entrepreneurs seeking funding?  
  
I mainly funded TagU with pre-sales &amp; it’s by far the best way to fund a bootstrapped SaaS.  
  
It’s not necessary to look for VCs in the early stages.  
  
Pre-sales allows me to get both funding and idea validation from people, and I believe it’s way more motivating than someone pressuring you to make money.  
  
10. What are some of the most important lessons you’ve learned as a founder, and how have those lessons influenced your approach to entrepreneurship?  
  
SHIP FAST!  
  
You need to be fast and ignore details. You don’t need a logo or a big landing page.  
  
Just build the MVP fast and make it public rather than spending time designing little things.  
  
This idea of Shipping fast is what allowed me to get the first users on FeedbackLoop quickly, and I’ll do the same with TagU.  
  
With this approach, I can launch many products quickly and test which idea is good and worth building.  
  
11. How do you stay motivated and focused when faced with setbacks and obstacles?  
  
There’s no secret sauce to it.  
  
I always take a look at what I need to do and do it even if I don’t feel motivated.  
  
We’ll all face obstacles, things that will try to stop us, but at some point, we need to beat them.  
  
12. Looking back, what advice would you give to your younger self when you were just starting out on your journey?  
  
Don’t rely on following courses, build projects, join communities, build a social media presence, meet people and continue learning while building.  
  
Don’t try to find shady ways to make money; it will barely work.  
  
That's a wrap!  
  
I took this interview for a newsletter I started with the goal of helping visionary founders.

I have two main products.  
  
One of them is still under development.  
  
It’s called TagU, and it aims to boost collaboration on the web by allowing team members to leave messages as sticky notes where they can either leave a screenshot or simply a message.  
  
The other one is up and running.  
  
It’s a 100% free tool I created mainly for myself, but I decided to make it public. It helps startups to collect bug reports from their users easily.  
  
It’s called FeedbackLoop.  
  
4. What’s your company’s revenue &amp; profit for last month, and what’s its valuation at the moment?  
  
Right now, both of them are fully free, but TagU was pre-sold before we even started building it.  
  
It generated 150$-200$ in pre-sales, which gave us the necessary funding to build it.  
  
FeedbackLoop is free, but we’ll be adding the paid plan soon.  
  
5. What were some of the biggest challenges and obstacles you faced in the early days of your startup? And How did you overcome those challenges?  
  
The main challenge I faced was the complexity of TagU.  
  
Fortunately, my senior dev friend helped me with it.  
  
And I had to learn a lot.  
  
6. Do you have a team? If yes, how did you build your team, and what qualities do you look for in team members?  
  
TagU’s team has 4 members. It’s my friend Rohan who reached out to me and two other co-founders for this project.  
  
The main role I look for in this is communication.  
  
7. What marketing strategies did you use or planning to use to acquire customers and grow your user base?  
  
For FeedbackLoop, which is currently on the market, I’m using blogging &amp; social media along with community building.  
  
With these marketing tactics, I got more than 100 users in less than one week.  
  
8. How did you get your first 10 and 100 customers/users?  
  
I wrote a Tweet about the launch of FeedbackLoop, which got 100 likes and many retweets.  
  
I also wrote 2 articles on Medium that got almost 2k views and brought the main traffic for the tweet.  
  
I also shared it in my community, SkyRing, and some others.  
  
9. How did you fund your startup, and what advice do you have for entrepreneurs seeking funding?  
  
I mainly funded TagU with pre-sales &amp; it’s by far the best way to fund a bootstrapped SaaS.  
  
It’s not necessary to look for VCs in the early stages.  
  
Pre-sales allows me to get both funding and idea validation from people, and I believe it’s way more motivating than someone pressuring you to make money.  
  
10. What are some of the most important lessons you’ve learned as a founder, and how have those lessons influenced your approach to entrepreneurship?  
  
SHIP FAST!  
  
You need to be fast and ignore details. You don’t need a logo or a big landing page.  
  
Just build the MVP fast and make it public rather than spending time designing little things.  
  
This idea of Shipping fast is what allowed me to get the first users on FeedbackLoop quickly, and I’ll do the same with TagU.  
  
With this approach, I can launch many products quickly and test which idea is good and worth building.  
  
11. How do you stay motivated and focused when faced with setbacks and obstacles?  
  
There’s no secret sauce to it.  
  
I always take a look at what I need to do and do it even if I don’t feel motivated.  
  
We’ll all face obstacles, things that will try to stop us, but at some point, we need to beat them.  
  
12. Looking back, what advice would you give to your younger self when you were just starting out on your journey?  
  
Don’t rely on following courses, build projects, join communities, build a social media presence, meet people and continue learning while building.  
  
Don’t try to find shady ways to make money; it will barely work.  
  
That's a wrap!

&lt;p&gt;His future is going to be insane if he doesn&amp;#39;t stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the interview&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s Mehdi Khoudali, a 15-year-old student from Casablanca, Morocco, who started his journey by hacking mobile phones at the age of 13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has now embarked on creating two innovative SaaS products, TagU and FeedbackLoop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this exclusive interview, he shares his daily routine, the sparks of inspiration that ignited their startups, the hurdles they faced in the early days, and the genius strategies they used to bring their products to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an epic tale of how Mehdi hustled for funding through pre-sales and the invaluable lessons he’s learned in his journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This interview is like a backstage pass to the mind of a young trailblazer who’s preparing to shake up the entrepreneurial world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell us a little bit about your background and how did you end up with what you’re doing today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a 15-year-old SaaS builder. I started by looking at how to hack mobile phones from my small room when I was 13, then started learning coding, did some little tinny projects, and now, I’m building 2 SaaS products with my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does your day look like?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wake up at 5 am, have breakfast, and start working. I get 2 hours before going to school to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During these 2 hours, I either work on my content and schedule more social media posts for both X/Twitter &amp;amp; Linkedin, or I start coding if I have features to add or bugs to fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My class starts at 8:30 am and gets over at 16:30 pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I get back home after class, I work a bit on coding for my products, content planning, or marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking back, what advice would you give to your younger self when you were just starting out on your journey?&lt;/li&gt;

,Entrepreneur,"I took an interview of a 15yo school-going boy building 2 SaaS projects. His future is going to be insane if he don't stop.  
Here's the interview  
  
He's Mehdi Khoudali, a 15-year-old student from Casablanca, Morocco, who started his journey by hacking mobile phones at the age of 13.  
  
He has now embarked on creating two innovative SaaS products, TagU and FeedbackLoop.   
  
In this exclusive interview, he shares his daily routine, the sparks of inspiration that ignited their startups, the hurdles they faced in the early days, and the genius strategies they used to bring their products to life.   
  
This is an epic tale of how Mehdi hustled for funding through pre-sales and the invaluable lessons he’s learned in his journey.   
  
This interview is like a backstage pass to the mind of a young trailblazer who’s preparing to shake up the entrepreneurial world.  
  
1. Tell us a little bit about your background and how did you end up with what you’re doing today.  
  
I’m a 15-year-old SaaS builder. I started by looking at how to hack mobile phones from my small room when I was 13, then started learning coding, did some little tinny projects, and now, I’m building 2 SaaS products with my friends.  
2. What does your day look like?  
  
I wake up at 5 am, have breakfast, and start working. I get 2 hours before going to school to work.  
  
During these 2 hours, I either work on my content and schedule more social media posts for both X/Twitter &amp; Linkedin, or I start coding if I have features to add or bugs to fix.  
  
My class starts at 8:30 am and gets over at 16:30 pm.  
  
When I get back home after class, I work a bit on coding for my products, content planning, or marketing.  
  
3. What does your startup do, and what inspired you to start it?  
  
I have two main products.  
  
One of them is still under development.  
  
It’s called TagU, and it aims to boost collaboration on the web by allowing team members to leave messages as sticky notes where they can either leave a screenshot or simply a message.  
  
The other one is up and running.  
  
It’s a 100% free tool I created mainly for myself, but I decided to make it public. It helps startups to collect bug reports from their users easily.  
  
It’s called FeedbackLoop.  
  
4. What’s your company’s revenue &amp; profit for last month, and what’s its valuation at the moment?  
  
Right now, both of them are fully free, but TagU was pre-sold before we even started building it.  
  
It generated 150$-200$ in pre-sales, which gave us the necessary funding to build it.  
  
FeedbackLoop is free, but we’ll be adding the paid plan soon.  
5. What were some of the biggest challenges and obstacles you faced in the early days of your startup? And How did you overcome those challenges?  
  
The main challenge I faced was the complexity of TagU.   
  
Fortunately, my senior dev friend helped me with it.   
  
And I had to learn a lot.  
  
6. Do you have a team? If yes, how did you build your team, and what qualities do you look for in team members?  
  
TagU’s team has 4 members. It’s my friend Rohan who reached out to me and two other co-founders for this project.  
  
The main role I look for in this is communication.  
7. What marketing strategies did you use or planning to use to acquire customers and grow your user base?  
  
For FeedbackLoop, which is currently on the market, I’m using blogging &amp; social media along with community building.  
  
With these marketing tactics, I got more than 100 users in less than one week.  
8. How did you get your first 10 and 100 customers/users?  
  
I wrote a Tweet about the launch of FeedbackLoop, which got 100 likes and many retweets.   
  
I also wrote 2 articles on Medium that got almost 2k views and brought the main traffic for the tweet.  
  
I also shared it in my community, SkyRing, and some others.  
  
9. How did you fund your startup, and what advice do you have for entrepreneurs seeking funding?  
  
I mainly funded TagU with pre-sales &amp; it’s by far the best way to fund a bootstrapped SaaS.  
  
It’s not necessary to look for VCs in the early stages.  
  
Pre-sales allows me to get both funding and idea validation from people, and I believe it’s way more motivating than someone pressuring you to make money.  
  
10. What are some of the most important lessons you’ve learned as a founder, and how have those lessons influenced your approach to entrepreneurship?  
  
SHIP FAST!  
  
You need to be fast and ignore details. You don’t need a logo or a big landing page.   
  
Just build the MVP fast and make it public rather than spending time designing little things.  
  
This idea of Shipping fast is what allowed me to get the first users on FeedbackLoop quickly, and I’ll do the same with TagU.  
  
With this approach, I can launch many products quickly and test which idea is good and worth building.  
  
11. How do you stay motivated and focused when faced with setbacks and obstacles?  
  
There’s no secret sauce to it.  
  
I always take a look at what I need to do and do it even if I don’t feel motivated.  
  
We’ll all face obstacles, things that will try to stop us, but at some point, we need to beat them.  
  
12. Looking back, what advice would you give to your younger self when you were just starting out on your journey?  
  
Don’t rely on following courses, build projects, join communities, build a social media presence, meet people and continue learning while building.  
  
Don’t try to find shady ways to make money; it will barely work.

  
That's a wrap!

,GilbertSyndrome,"Hey GS fam

Ive posted once before but thought id come back and share some health tips &amp; habits that have greatly improved my control over GS and related symptoms.

Disclaimer first, Obviously its my personal experience so I cant guarantee effectiveness for everyone, but I believe it is worth a try if you feel out of balance.

Tip 1: Hydration

Proper water intake &amp; maintaining hydration levels is extremely important for keeping blood levels stable. Since bilirubin primarily circulates  in the blood &amp; liver, thicker or less hydrated blood will push the liver into overdrive, through increased serum concentrations leading to jaundice.

My approach: 2 litres a day is my minimum though some days I may go up higher. How dark your pee is in the morning &amp; the volume, is a good indication of how much you may need to adjust.

Note: Type of water consumed matters. Avoid tap &amp; plastic bottled water. Opt for filtered or natural spring water from a source you can collect. Putting spring water in single use plastic, defeats the purpose due to the petro-chemical leaching.

Tip 2: Sunlight

Another good one for jaundice/ yellowing is Sunlight. Im not completely sure of the mechanics behind the benefits, my best theory is that Vit D &amp; its analogues produced via the UVB+cholesterol reaction in the skin, helps with liver detoxification along with the antioxidant effects that would aid in proper liver function. There also could be something related to the light spectrum response to the bilirubin pigment itself, similar to, eg: infrared/ mitochondria or UVA/ Melanin responses.

My approach: In summer (here in Aus currently) I try and get as much as I can daily to store the Vit D (guess where Vit D is stored😉) for winter I try to get sun when I can, but if my levels drop I will supplement with 20000iu daily until spring/ UV returns.

Note: Vit D supplements &amp; Vit D from sunlight are completely different. Supplements highlight the main Vit D analogue (Vit D3 or cholecalciferol) but forget the 2499 other analogues of Vit D produced when you get it from sunlight. Natural is always best if you can get it that way.

Tip 3: Rest

This affects everyone as sleep is needed for all, but I believe GS is affected more, due to the cortisol/liver/ serum bilirubin relationship. We’re more sensitive to a poor nights rest or inadequate rest &amp; prolonged exhaustion as our serum bilirubin levels rise, the less energy we have to function metabolically especially when the liver uses a lot of daily energy, just to maintain overall balance.

My approach: I try to get a minimum of 7-8 hours per night. A hour before bed, no electronics and if you can all lights, except candles. On my off days, having a nap (siesta time is perfect) for 60-90 mins helps to catch up with rest.

Note: Rest is the MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR for GS control. It doesnt matter how much water you drink, how healthily you eat or exercise. Rest is where everything happens, prioritise it.

Tip 4: Physical exercise

Physical fitness benefits the body in many different ways, in general helping to increase your metabolic capacity so you gain more energy overtime. With GS the act of moving is a great way to increase baseline blood circulation. Better circulation = smoother flow through the liver + filtering of blood including bilirubin.

My approach: I lift 4-5 times a week mixing power lifting, calisthenics, martial arts &amp; various accessory movements for flexibility. My thought is that the more variation in movement you add, the deeper you can clean your body through said movements. I also go for a 15 min walk when I rise &amp; before rest.

Note: If you struggle with physical exercise my advice is to start somewhere, anywhere. I didnt get to where I am overnight, in fact ive spent many years learning and trying including, having prolonged off periods that lasted years. What ive learnt is consistency and the willingness to do even a bit for yourself, is how you begin your health journey. Remember, this is for you.

Tip 5: Cupping therapy

This is my latest addition (for the past 4 months) &amp; perhaps the one that has surprised me with the benefits. Cupping has long been used as medicine to promote healing &amp; detoxification. Upon some research Ive learnt that cupping increases the liver detoxification function/ pathway, as a response to the cupping process. Even more intriguing is that this function seems genetic in origin (pretty sweet that we have this built into us), thus its a 100% natural way to boost your health.

My approach: I get my entire back done once a week to 10 days depending on how quickly the marks disappear.

Note: I recommend that you dial in the above 4, before adding this to your process. Foundation matters, especially with cupping because proper recovery from this form of therapy requires that you have the above 4 dialled in.

Bonus tip: Supplements

This is for anyone who is already doing the above. Supplements can aid and boost function/ overall health. A few that have stood out to me are listed below

- NAC+
- Choline
- Inositol
- Curcumin + Pipperine combo (Turmeric is not the same, containing only 3% in volume)
- Taurine

Thats it. There some other stuff I can speak about, however, the basics really is where everything begins.

If you have any questions related to the above, feel free to ask.

,u_ecompapi2," An age-old dilemma echoes through company halls like an unresolved spell: Facebook Ads or Organic Reach? In the dynamic world of digital marketing, where algorithms craft the story of success, the answer is always changing. Here, rather than just a decision, is a production playing out before your eyes; a social media marketing agency is the stage manager, PPC services are the performers, and your prospective customers are the audience members. In this fascinating narrative of marketing art, sponsored promotion and organic development intertwine like the dance floor on a digital stage, and as the lights go down, we enter the amazing effects narrative.  


**Finding a Combination: Facebook Ads vs. Organic Reach**

Every company wants to be the star of their own online show when the curtains go up on the online stage. Introducing Facebook Ads, the innovative spark that can transform every cent into a precious asset. With their guaranteed quick results, tailored audience reach, and quantifiable return on investment (ROI), sponsored promotions are hard to resist. While PPC agency emerge as masters of modern digital campaigns, crafting accuracy with every click, social media marketing agencies swing their strategic wand with carefully designed campaigns.

However, organic reach is quietly performing in the background, waiting for its day to shine. Unheralded character, organic reach depends on sincere connections, original material, and genuineness. Discovering the ideal balance between sponsored marketing and spontaneous development is the real art.  


**Striking the Perfect Balance: Paid and Organic Reach**

Consider the digital marketing environment to be an extensive workshop, and the mix of Facebook Ads and organic reach to be the success cure. PPC advertising, the instant gratification force, enters the stage, driving enterprises into the forefront. The art, however, does not stop there. Organic reach, like a slow-cooking potion, works in collaboration to establish long-term relationships and build a community around your business.

The key is to strike a fine balance between the two. Excessive dependence on paid promotion may drain your budget; too little, and your organic development may decline. The connection between a social media marketing agency's targeted ad placements and the production of original content for organic interaction is the key to finding the digital success rock.

PPC services are key in the grand movements of digital marketing, moving and turning perfectly with each click. The appeal of immediate visibility is highly captivating, as organisations allocate resources towards paid promotion in order to establish a prominent presence in the minds of their target audience.

An expertly managed pay-per-click (PPC) campaign, which has been diligently coordinated, has the potential to bring your brand to popularity. Ad copy that is persuasive, visually appealing graphics, and precise targeting collectively function as an arrangement that engrosses the audience. PPC's brilliance resides in its adaptability; real-time adjustments guarantee that the performance remains in step with the constantly changing dynamics of the digital stage.

As with any major performance, though, the price to get in can be pretty high. You have to pay for [**PPC services**](https://ecompapi.com.au/ppc-services/), and for firms that are tight on funds, the question of whether or not they can keep going is significant. Here, organic reach whispers a gentle reminder: paid ads are sure to shine right away, but don't forget about the long-lasting beauty of organic growth.  


**Growing Your Business Online: Boosting Your Organic Reach**

Businesses go on their search for connection in the vast field of organic reach, where authenticity shines first. In this case, the foundation created by a social media marketing agency extends beyond the area of ad spending. The driving force becomes content, which resonates through the digital platforms.

Think about a well-written blog post, an image that people want to share, or an interesting video that gets people talking. Organic impact works best when the material speaks to the audience and makes people want to do more than just read it. People who like, share, and comment on your posts will help spread the word about your brand, creating a natural ensemble that goes far beyond PPC advertising.

The great thing about spontaneous reach is that it can build trust. People are more likely to interact with content that seems like a real chat than with content that looks like an ad. As brand trust grows, you'll see the long-term benefits, which will make your business an important part of the digital world.  


**Finding the Right Balance: How to Make the Perfect Tune**

Now that you know about these two important factors, the challenge is to find the right balance—that hard-to-find mix that turns marketing into a song of success. When businesses start out on this stage tour, it's important not to pit Facebook Ads against random reach, but to let them work together to make a sound that hits home with the audience.

The secret is to use smart pay-per-click (PPC) ads to get people to see your site, along with a strong organic growth strategy that builds relationships that last. The ultimate magic happens when the two work together, giving you the best of both worlds: quick exposure and long-term connection.  


**Rejoicing in Success: The Encore**

As the big finale of this digital show, companies need to understand how important both Facebook ads and organic reach are. The stage is set for an engaging display where PPC advertising and real interaction go hand in hand. To be successful, you need to understand the specifics of each and put them together in a way that fits your brand's style.  


**Wrapping Up**

Finding the right balance between Facebook Ads and organic reach is more important than either one alone, so keep that in mind when the spotlight rolls down and the acclaim echoes. The digital world is vast, and progress is constant. So, let your business rise to new heights with the help of Facebook Ads and organic reach working in perfect balance.

In the dynamic world of digital marketing, where algorithms craft the story of success, the answer is always changing. Here, rather than just a decision, is a production playing out before your eyes; a social media marketing agency is the stage manager, PPC services are the performers, and your prospective customers are the audience members. In this fascinating narrative of marketing art, sponsored promotion and organic development intertwine like the dance floor on a digital stage, and as the lights go down, we enter the amazing effects narrative.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding a Combination: Facebook Ads vs. Organic Reach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every company wants to be the star of their own online show when the curtains go up on the online stage. Introducing Facebook Ads, the innovative spark that can transform every cent into a precious asset. With their guaranteed quick results, tailored audience reach, and quantifiable return on investment (ROI), sponsored promotions are hard to resist. While PPC agency emerge as masters of modern digital campaigns, crafting accuracy with every click, social media marketing agencies swing their strategic wand with carefully designed campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, organic reach is quietly performing in the background, waiting for its day to shine. Unheralded character, organic reach depends on sincere connections, original material, and genuineness. Discovering the ideal balance between sponsored marketing and spontaneous development is the real art.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Striking the Perfect Balance: Paid and Organic Reach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the digital marketing environment to be an extensive workshop, and the mix of Facebook Ads and organic reach to be the success cure. PPC advertising, the instant gratification force, enters the stage, driving enterprises into the forefront. The art, however, does not stop there. Organic reach, like a slow-cooking potion, works in collaboration to establish long-term relationships and build a community around your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key is to strike a fine balance between the two. Excessive dependence on paid promotion may drain your budget; too little, and your organic development may decline. The connection between a social media marketing agency&amp;#39;s targeted ad placements and the production of original content for organic interaction is the key to finding the digital success rock.  &lt;/p&gt;

Beast IV: Beast of Consumption and Conflict, the Fanged King in White, Kimba

“Hunt, kill, consume. Absolve, spare, enlighten. Humanity must be destroyed. Nature must be destroyed. We must become more bestial. We must become more civilized. We must fall. We must ascend. We must be the falling angel. We must be the rising ape.”

A seldom incarnated aspect of Beast IV, fueled by humankind’s ever growing expansion and devouring of resources, the Beast of Consumption is by its own nature inclined to be destructive, but the Fanged King in White is uniquely dangerous due to the nature in which its host views the world and everything in it. Where most incarnations of Beast IV derive their destructive nature from mistreatment or devastation, the Fanged King in White’s destruction is steeped in incalculable depths of hatred, contempt, and sadness for having to live in two worlds that cannot coexist as one.

The host vessel of Beast IV, and the driving force behind the Fanged King in White’s actions, is a white lion known as Kimba, the last surviving scion of a royal family of bone white lions granted unnatural strength, speed, mana, and wisdom from potions and draughts crafted by a fallen Ascended Being who sought to create a higher form of life. The lineage of Kimba had been dedicated solely to this purpose, and before his death Kimba’s father, Kaiser, passed on his desire to attain this ascension beyond ascension. 

Kimba, for his part, interpreted this goal as taking the lifestyle and civilization of humanity, the dominant species on Earth and closest to this ascended state, but warlike and flawed, and teaching the uncivilized but peaceful animals of his jungle domain to behave in an educated and refined manner like the best of humanity.

Kimba’s attempts were fraught with failure and misery, and in the end his noble line was cut short with bullets, betrayal, and the inability of beasts and men to become as one. Humans were greedy and wasteful. Animals were stupid and indolent. His kingdom burned, and one by one all that remained of his family burned with it. With his dying breath, all that Kimba could achieve was a petty detente.

And as the first and last human he would ever respect wandered down an icy mountain side, flocked by his foolish son and idiot friends, Kimba could not help but think…

“…I hate them all.”

In the depths of Africa now lies a vast, twisted, and chaotic Innate Domain, a vast sea of skyscrapers hewn of gigantic jungle trees. Animals who speak like humans and humans that behave like animals walk the sandstone streets. Violent creatures roam the wilds and take life, but not one scrap of meat is eaten. A grotesque caricature of humanity and nature alike, nothing grows or dies or lives beyond his will. And above it all sits the furious king, with seven crowns set upon a troubled brow, who eats, destroys, and rebuilds towards an ever further and further shining city, always just beyond reach.

Passive Abilities:

Independent Action:

Madness Enhancement: 

Oblivion Correction: 

Avenger: 

Nega-Skill:

Nega-Skill: Nega-Growth: the Ascent of Civilization. A Nega-Skill corrupted and twisted by the innate conflict and hatred in Kimba for all living things that do not meet his mad standards. In its default state Nega-Growth carves and hews apart the expanse of human civilization, and replace it with animal life, but under Kimba’s influence it devours and slaughters all life absorbed by the Innate Domain, and repurposes that life into a fallen human or ascended beast. Only those actively directly touched by Alaya, Gaia, or an Ascended Being, or a being who combines the traits of man and beast, can resist its effects.

Active Skills: 

Seven Crowns: Civilize: A unique version of the Seven Crowns aspect that allows Kimba to subjugate those that enter his kingdom, applying a similar magical effect to a Command Seal activation to either a human or an animal. Once under his sway Kimba can artificially “ascend” the creature, augmenting their physical, mental, and magical abilities, so long as these augmentations are used to further Kimba’s vision.

Hides of the Will of Phrates: At will, Kimba can call upon the collective wisdom and power of his one thousand white lion ancestors, who journeyed the ancient lands and beyond for centuries, ruling as kings, wizards, and gods everywhere they went. This power takes the form of lion hides, fused to Kimba to boost his strength, and the more hides are fused the stronger he becomes. With all one thousand hides Kimba can temporarily tap the knowledge, wisdom and crafts of the Ascended Being Phrates, permitting him to control nature and create draughts and potions to permanently bolster his strength.

Charisma (Kaiser): Calling upon the natural charisma of his lineage and layering it upon the love for his father Kaiser held by all animals, Kimba can draw on the love and devotion of his animal and human followers and either lead them to battle or take their woes and strengths unto himself. This is the third state of being required to take the true mantle of his Beast Form.

Noble Phantasm: Ulimwengu-Simba: The Fanged King in White

With Kimba’s Innate Domain fused with a Reality Marble, the hides of his ancestors, the support of his subjects, and a strong, rooted civilization, Kimba can mature and grow into the true form of the Beast of Consumption under his control: Ulimwengu-Simba, the Fanged King in White. As the Fanged King, Kimba can create civilization with a touch, and as he walks his created civilization expands and grows as would a Lostbelt. All that comes before him is devoured; all that fails him in his domain is crushed and recycled. He strides aside the land like a vast behemoth hewn of thunderclouds, immutable, unstoppable…enraged. All that see the Fanged King collapse under the weight of his vast, crushing, and unimaginable hate, the air thick with despair and wrath and fallen and failed dreams. The Fanged King in White, in its fullest state, is the end of a dream, crawling through the lands as the dreamer wakes. All that can silence the Fanged King is a contrast or contradiction greater than his own, a civilization where animals and humans live in peace or another being born of hate that fights for humanity somehow. Without these the Fanged King wanders, hunting for the dreams of centuries of pain and regret.",t2_109x26xf,False,,0,False,"Fan Beast: Beast IV: Beast of Consumption and Conflict, the Fanged King in White, Kimba","[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Fanservant'}]",r/grandorder,False,6.0,b,0.0,,,True,t3_1ag3irm,False,light,1.0,,public,1.0,0.0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Fanservant,False,1,,False,False,default,False,,[],{},,,False,,1706765268.0,richtext,6.0,,,text,sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beast IV: Beast of Consumption and Conflict, the Fanged King in White, Kimba&lt;/p&gt;

One such advancement that has attained paramount importance is Virtual Private Networks. More simply known as VPNs, these tools can strengthen your digital fortress, especially with the right app. So buckle up, little one, because today we&amp;#39;re diving into what is the &lt;a href=""https://covermevpn.com/apps-how-to-install/""&gt;Best VPN App for iPhone&lt;/a&gt; in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/t8a8wq08fwfc1.png?width=1080&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4c75a266efb527f8f14be28aade30087a28eb116""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/t8a8wq08fwfc1.png?width=1080&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4c75a266efb527f8f14be28aade30087a28eb116&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Understanding VPNs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you’re at school and you don&amp;#39;t want anyone to know you’re trading your green veggies for a lovely slice of chocolate cake at the cafeteria. A friend helps you by walking between you and everyone else, so no one sees what you&amp;#39;re doing. That&amp;#39;s what VPNs do! They hide what you&amp;#39;re doing online from other people, including serious stuff like hackers who want to steal your private data or even your cake – your online cake, we mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why do we need the Best VPN App for iPhone?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not just any VPN app? Well, the reason is as simple as why you wouldn&amp;#39;t want just any chocolate cake, but the best! The best VPN apps protect you better and work more smoothly. iPhones are like digital unicorns – beautiful and rare. To match this, you need a unicorn of a VPN app – something that would provide the best protection and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Best VPN App for iPhone - The Reigning Champion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;#39;s talk about our star player here – CoverMeVPN. Simply put, it is the best VPN App for iPhone in 2024. It&amp;#39;s like the fastest, shiniest, and most robust spaceship in the universe of internet browsing. CoverMeVPN encrypts your internet traffic, making it unreadable to anyone who might be sneaking a peek. It&amp;#39;s like it turns your chocolate cake exchange into an alien language that only you and your friend can understand!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides low latency rates, which mean faster browsing speeds, CoverMeVPN has a wide range of servers spread all over the world. Imagine you have secret doorways all over the school, leading directly to the cafeteria; no matter where you are, you&amp;#39;re never too far from the chocolate cake!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Highlighting the Superpowers of CoverMeVPN&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what makes CoverMeVPN the best VPN App for iPhone in 2024? Well, just like a superhero has numerous superpowers, CoverMeVPN has a plethora of standout features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;Zero-Log Policy&amp;#39;, which is just like a friend who forgets everything you tell them right after you&amp;#39;ve said it, ensuring no one else finds out. CoverMeVPN does not track, collect, or share your private data. It’s like having an extra layer of invisibility over your sweet little cake swapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next comes ‘Auto Connect’. Imagine if your super friend could tell exactly when you were heading to the cafeteria and met you there every time. That&amp;#39;s what Auto Connect does! It will automatically kick into action as soon as you connect to the internet, wrapping you up in its protective embrace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;Kill Switch&amp;#39;, which is a bit like a plan B. If for any reason your super friend can&amp;#39;t meet you at the cafeteria, they make sure no one else can see your cake swap by calling off the operation immediately. In tech terms, if you lose connection to your VPN, Kill Switch immediately stops any data from being sent over the internet, keeping your info safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Eyeing the Future with CoverMeVPN&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, CoverMeVPN aims to continue being the best VPN app for iPhone by always evolving and adapting. Just like how our dreams of having chocolate cake every day becomes a reality, CoverMeVPN is constantly looking at ways to improve. They plan to extend their network coverage, boost their already impressive speeds, and innovate even more features for enhanced user experience and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Comparing Competitors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, other apps have also taken strides in strengthening your digital fortress. Let’s take a glance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NordVPN&lt;/strong&gt; – This ‘wizard’ in the VPN world has been around for ages and is known for impressive security features. However, its speed can sometimes be a little slower than CoverMeVPN&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;spaceship’, especially for iPhones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ExpressVPN&lt;/strong&gt; – Another seasoned warrior in the VPN battleground. It boasts excellent speeds, but in terms of server spread, it falls a little short compared to CoverMeVPN’s global network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GreenNet VPN&lt;/strong&gt; - A strong contender, known for its user-friendly interface. However, when it comes to overall performance and security for iPhones, it&amp;#39;s like a shooting star that burns bright but not for long, especially when compared to our Champion, CoverMeVPN.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Summing Up the Digital Race&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum it up, a good VPN for your iPhone is like your secret lunchtime friend who helps you with the cake swap. And among the many players in the field, CoverMeVPN emerges as the super-friend who not only helps with the swapping but does it faster and with style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember:&lt;/strong&gt; when you&amp;#39;re hunting for the best VPN App for iPhone in 2024, look for thorough security, speed, and a good network of servers. As our hands-down winner, CoverMeVPN checks all these boxes and does one better with a host of unique features tailored for Apple&amp;#39;s tech uniqueness. Enjoy your safe, secure, and fast cake swapping (ahem, we mean internet browsing) with CoverMeVPN, the shiniest spaceship in the VPN universe! &lt;/p&gt;

,askportland,"Please sound off in the comments. My arguments against it are as follows.

**1)** **Baseball is dying.** The sport has been declining in popularity since the 1950s when football replaced it as America's favorite sport. This trend has accelerated in recent decades, where almost the entirety of the American sports world revolves around pro/college football and basketball. The current Gen Z-Millennial cohort also favors the NBA, soccer, or F1 - if they even follow sports at all. League attendance and TV ratings are nowhere near what they were 15 years ago &amp; the majority of fans are baby boomers who will be dead in 20 years. It just seems like a bad investment for the future.

**2) Baseball is boring.** Long known as a simple, slow, pastoral game, baseball has been long criticized for its 3-4 hour slogfests and limited action. In an age of TikTok, Youtube, streaming, and other dopamine-grabbing things, baseball simply will not hold anyone's attention in the modern age. It is a relic from a bygone era before TV and electric light. It succeeded because there simply wasn't anything else better to do. 

**3) Baseball has tried and failed to set up shop Portland before.** The Portland Beavers were a minor league team that came and left a good 3-4 times, mostly due to low attendance and lack of revenue. I remember efforts at getting a major league team going all the way back into the 1990s. Yet there was not enough actual demand at any point to come close to realizing such a plan.

**4) Building a stadium is exorbitantly expensive and bad for taxpayers/the local economy.** The MLB uses your taxpayer money to subsidize the funding of these stadiums while they sit back and collect all the profits. They will claim that building a stadium will boost tourism, revitalize neighborhoods, and help local businesses thrive. Numerous studies have been done on this and it's basically a complete lie. Any economic incentive of is barely tangible at best. The area will likely sit vacant for 6 months out of the year.

**5) Our infrastructure cannot support what is being proposed.** Has anyone seen some of these Portland Diamond Project proposals? They're car-centric, transit-opposed and utterly opposed to what many Portlanders would want in a potential sporting arena. This newest one at RedTail takes the cake. 217 is bad enough as it is. Nobody in their right mind is going to drive out there for a fucking baseball game. It would be an absolute nightmare.

**6) The culture of Portland is at odds with Major League Baseball.** Portland has its own unique culture. We love the Blazers. We love the Thorns. We're quirky, hipster, progressive, and proud of it. Baseball just gives like... old conservative white man vibes. It's the sort of thing people care about in New York City or Boston or something, not here.

**7) The Portland Pickles, Hillsboro Hops, and Seattle Mariners are enough to satiate any existing baseball fans.** Even with all the transplants, I just don't get the sense that there's an underlying baseball fandom in Portland. But for those few who into really into it, the Hops cover the suburbs, the Pickles cover inner Portland, and the Mariners are just a few hours away if you want an MLB level game. And they never really sell out, if that gives you an indication of their popularity...

**8) The Portland Diamond Project seems like a scam.** I'm convinced they only exist to hawk their own merch and use Portland as a fake bargaining chip in various MLB relocation/expansion discussions. Every ""plan"" they've come out with seems just like it was created with little thought by people who have never been to Portland before.

**TLDR; Ethereum is looking for significant growth in the first half of 2024, ready to outshine Bitcoin after a \~2% growth in January. Investors are shifting their focus to Ethereum and its alts, anticipating the upcoming Dencun upgrade and the potential approval of the very first Spot Eth ETF.**

## The new champion

While Bitcoin and its ETFs dominated last month, Eth is getting attention. Investors are turning towards Ethereum with its network upgrades and the potential ETF approval coming soon. As the market becomes more stable, the action will most likely shift towards Eth.

February has historically been a strong month for it, finishing with green candles 6 times since its inception. The recent pump to a 20-month high, post Bitcoin ETF approval, is a testament to its growing premise. 

# The next move

Ethereum is set to push the limit, with the upcoming Dencun upgrade, aiming to make Layer 2 transactions cheaper and faster. The rising popularity of altcoins, many of which run on the Ethereum blockchain, further boosts its growth.

# Beyond Money: Vitalik's vision

Vitalik Buterin envisions Ethereum as more than just a financial platform. He defends it's a new way of online interactions free from the control of big companies like Silicon Valley. He also mentioned Ethereum's historical use of rudimentary democratic governance mechanisms, emphasizing the need for tools enabling collective decision-making.

Additionally, Vitalk also explores the use of zero-knowledge proofs, to safeguard privacy while authenticating identities online. This approach fixes online privacy breaches and identity theft. 

Lastly, he urges the developer community to broaden their perspective beyond traditional tech hubs, identifying opportunities in regions like Argentina, Turkey, or Zambia to balance financial disparities.

# Future outlook

Ethereum's bullish outlook is supported by strong technical indicators and on-chain metrics.

While facing resistance at the $2,400 leve, if it breaks above it, it could potentially hit $2,700 and possibly go even higher.

,PokemonSleep,"I've seen a few posts on theory crafting about potential new gold subskills that could exist going forwards, and wanted to share my two cents on the topic.

Instant effects:
I think that one of the main limitations for any skill would be if it had any sort of instant effect. This would mean, you could switch them into the party, gain a bonus from it, and then switch them out again.

Any example of this would be, berries up s: all berries are 5% stronger, or cooking power up a: all dishes are 5% stronger etc..

These are abilities that can be switched into the team to get the bonus, and then swapped out again right after the fact. Berries are more debatable since you can do the strength calculation when you collect the berry instead of when you eat, which would avoid this.

BERRY:
Honestly bfs is already kinda broken so I don't think we need anymore berry favouring skills right now.

ING:
An obvious idea is ingredient finder s: eveytine you find an ing, get an extra +1. My one concern with this is pot size. Having an extra berry is almost always great, outside very niche inventory situations, but an extra ingredient isn't always useful. For many players who are constantly at maxed out bag, the cooking pot size is the limiting factor on making dishes stronger. It allows you to run ingredient mons for shorter periods of time and swap to berry mons, but that can be very awkward with energy recovery if you don't nap. Having a skill that boosts pit size, however, runs into the instant effect issue I talked about above... No ending thought to this, still lost on this myself.

SKILL:
Just buff skill level up s and m to go above skill cap.
So an example of this would be, if you have a Jiggly at level 6 main skill, and skill level up s, it would be level 7 main skill (which would be unobtainable without the skill). If you had one with no skill level ups, it would be at level 2, the same as the current behaviour. This would make the skill relavent for people who have skill seeds again as it would be crazy good to cap out skill mons. 
This has the problem where it would be a headache to balance, but it sounds fun so

Creative License- Flashlights and generators are your lifeline. When near a generator and holding a flashlight, hold down the secondary action button to use the Flashlight to repair the generator. Basic flashlights repair an extra .5/.75/1% per charge, for 1c/s. Higher quality flashlights will repair more quickly, and add-ons that affect Flashlight charges and brightness increase their repair length and speed, respectively.

Safe Haven- You know how to make generators both protector and weapon. When the generator you’re working on is 90/85/80% completed and the Killer is 6/12/18 meters away, gain a 10/15/20% generator repair speed boost, and if a generator you’re working on is completed within 8/9/10 meters of the Killer, the generator will unleash an explosion of light that blinds the Killer for 5 seconds.

Boon Totem: Departure- Write your escape. Blessing a totem spawns 5 collectible manuscript pages that only you and the Killer can see. The Blessed Totem does not emit any sound or screen effects, but can only be spawned twice; any effects acquired before the associated Boon Totem has been disabled are kept permanently. Collecting manuscript pages grants the following advantages:
1 Page: Make your red scratch marks 10/20/30% less bright and last 1/2/3 seconds less. 
2 Pages: See auras of generators within 8/10/12 meters of you. 
3 Pages: Move at 150% speed for 3 seconds after blinding the Killer. Afterward, enter the Exhausted state for 60/50/40 seconds. 
4 Pages: See the Auras of the two generators closest to the exit gates, even after they’re completed.

TLDR -  

### A federal court in the Northern District of Texas has ordered officials at the U.S. CDC to release approximately 7.8 million text responses from the V-safe COVID-19 vaccine safety monitoring system

  


 **A federal court in the Northern District of Texas has ordered officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to release approximately 7.8 million text responses from the V-safe COVID-19 vaccine safety monitoring system following a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed by the Freedom Coalition of Doctors Choice.**

The Freedom Coalition of Doctors Choice, which represents 91 medical and public health professionals, journalists and scientists, is a non-profit organization working to obtain and disseminate to the public data from the “free-text fields” in the CDC’s V-safe database.  


 

### V-Safe Was Created to Monitor the Safety of the COVID Shots

The CDC created V-safe as a real time surveillance system to monitor the safety of the COVID shots after the FDA granted vaccine manufacturers an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to distribute COVID vaccines, which had been fast tracked under the Operation Warpspeed program facilitated by the public private business partnership between the federal government and the pharmaceutical industry. .

V-safe is a smart-phone based surveillance system that allows users to access web-based surveys monitoring COVID shot adverse events and report reaction symptoms via text message to the government. In the week after getting a COVID shot, V-safe users received daily text messages asking about their health status. The messages contain a link to V-safe which allows users to answer follow-up questions including a checkbox of 12 symptoms, as well as provide a text message of not more than 250 characters. CDC officials have collected approximately 7.8 million text responses from COVID shot recipients through V-safe.  


The check-the-box information collected through V-safe has already been released to the public due to a previous FOIA request by the Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN). The released data showed that 25 percent of the V-safe responders missed work, school or other everyday activities due to vaccine adverse events, and eight percent sought medical attention including hospitalization after getting a COVID shot. The data showed that 71 million symptoms were reported, including four million reports of joint pain.   


 

### Plaintiffs File FOIA Request to Get V-Safe Text Messages

In this case, plaintiffs sought the release of the 7.8 million text messages collected by the CDC through V-safe. CDC officials initially denied the request to expedite the information and requested an extension of time to respond. Ultimately, the CDC issued a final determination to withhold the text messages by claiming they contained personal identifiable data, such as names and social security numbers. Plaintiffs appealed the final determination and, when the CDC failed to resolve the dispute within the time limit, brought a summary judgment motion before the court.

A summary judgment motion is brought when one party alleges that a trial is not necessary as the other side has no valid claims or defenses for the judge or jury to consider. The moving party argues that they are required to a judgment as a matter of law due to there being “no genuine issues as to any material fact.  


 

### FOIA Requests Meant to “Promote the Disclosure of Information”

Judge Matthew J. Kacsmaryk made it clear that federal courts ruling on FOIA summary judgment motions should consider that the purpose of a FOIA is to “pierce the veil of administrative secrecy, open agency action to the light of public scrutiny and promote the disclosure of information, not to inhibit it.”

The court emphasized that the CDC originally intended for V-safe data to be made public through FOIA requests but changed its mind when the increasing number of booster doses caused the collected data to be more burdensome than originally anticipated. The CDC’s denial of the FOIA request stems from their assertion that the government agency has limited resources to sort through the data in the text messages and redact personal information. CDC FOIA Officer Roger Andoh provided his opinion that it would take 59 years for a single analyst to separate the personal  information from the rest of the text messages in V-safe.   


 

### CDC Must Respond to FOIA Request and Release Text Message Data

The court disagreed that producing this data would prove unduly burdensome to the government and, instead, found it was not unreasonable to segregate the personal information in the text messages.

The court found:

&gt;*\[T\]he requested records are not so voluminous; only a small percent of records will require any redaction; the redaction process is largely straightforward and capable of automated assistance; and blanket exemption claims covering a mass of records are impermissible. For those reasons, Defendants are not absolved of their responsibility to produce the redacted free-text responses.*

Ordering the CDC to release the free text messages, Judge Kacsmaryk emphasized that 93 percent of the messages did not need information redacted. The court set forth a time table for the messages to be released, with the first set of a minimum of 390,000 messages to be released by Feb. 15, 2024.

Plaintiffs appealed the final determination and, when the CDC failed to resolve the dispute within the time limit, brought a summary judgment motion before the court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A summary judgment motion is brought when one party alleges that a trial is not necessary as the other side has no valid claims or defenses for the judge or jury to consider. The moving party argues that they are required to a judgment as a matter of law due to there being “no genuine issues as to any material fact.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;FOIA Requests Meant to “Promote the Disclosure of Information”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judge Matthew J. Kacsmaryk made it clear that federal courts ruling on FOIA summary judgment motions should consider that the purpose of a FOIA is to “pierce the veil of administrative secrecy, open agency action to the light of public scrutiny and promote the disclosure of information, not to inhibit it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The court emphasized that the CDC originally intended for V-safe data to be made public through FOIA requests but changed its mind when the increasing number of booster doses caused the collected data to be more burdensome than originally anticipated. The CDC’s denial of the FOIA request stems from their assertion that the government agency has limited resources to sort through the data in the text messages and redact personal information. CDC FOIA Officer Roger Andoh provided his opinion that it would take 59 years for a single analyst to separate the personal  information from the rest of the text messages in V-safe.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;CDC Must Respond to FOIA Request and Release Text Message Data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The court disagreed that producing this data would prove unduly burdensome to the government and, instead, found it was not unreasonable to segregate the personal information in the text messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The court found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[T]he requested records are not so voluminous; only a small percent of records will require any redaction; the redaction process is largely straightforward and capable of automated assistance; and blanket exemption claims covering a mass of records are impermissible. For those reasons, Defendants are not absolved of their responsibility to produce the redacted free-text responses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ordering the CDC to release the free text messages, Judge Kacsmaryk emphasized that 93 percent of the messages did not need information redacted. The court set forth a time table for the messages to be released, with the first set of a minimum of 390,000 messages to be released by Feb. 15, 2024.   &lt;/p&gt;

,KenaBridgeOfSpirits,"I am writing my opinions here both for debate and as a feedback for others who might want to try the game. **Beware of spoilers ahead!** A friend of my friend also worked on the project so I wanted to give it a try with a little positive bias. Some things were really frustrating for me which I want to get off my chest. ***SKIP TO THE END FOR TLDR.***

On the positive side, graphics and cinematics were so cool! Lighting and landscape along with nice music and vfx were all truly enjoyable. Rots with hats were a nice touch. Lore wise connecting the game elements and characters were also a cool idea which didn't feel detached from the Spirit Guide lifestyle. Special abilities were actually the rot we saved and helped. 

But core gameplay loop and the graphics are what makes a game worth playing rather than graphics. I can't endure unfun core game mechanics just to be rewarded few seconds of cinematics or graphics. The game designer made a main character with a staff but decided to make majority of bosses unattackable with the staff even though it is the first and initial ability we acquire. Which is cool and all but somehow they thought making majority of bosses immune to melee damage a good idea afterwards. Then you shoot Wood Knights, unreachable monkeys which position atop tree branches to death since you can't melee them which is frustrating because I don't want to be forced to play what game wants me to rather than be free to choose my own playstyle. At least not for majority of the game. Wood Knight is a boss which slaps you back after you parry it so even if you parry it efficently you either have to stab him once and dodgeback or parry it again. By the end of the game on Master difficulty this turned me into a parry god just like FromSoftware did but it didn't feel rewarding. It felt like it is punishing me for parrying instead of using the bow which is the issue. Anyway, after this, I unlocked the bomb and now I am forced to both use the nade, shoot the nade, shoot the pores of a Stone Guardian to make it vulnerable to melee. Then came the flying archer, the final boss which is also immune to all but arrows. The game beater strategy was to use timeslowing nades and melee enemies to death on repeat. So from half to the end of the game I was playing an archer with nades and shield. The moment time slowing nades became a spammable thing, the enemies had zero counterplay and I was basically some sort of time-stopping spam god like Chronos.

Other than this issue, everything I collected and spent time doing didn't reward me a single cosmetic except the trials. Not a single boost to stats, not a single cosmetic for the player (apart from hats for rots). Distribution of cosmetics being solely locked behind trials is quite disappointing.

Even after completing the entirety of map to a %100 completion, you still lack karma points to unlock all your abilities and charms. Worst part is, arrow count is an ability and final boss is all about arrows to the shining spots. Just as I am fuming because final boss is basically a legolas simulator, I realized that I have to go play NG+ to unlock new stuff. But NG+ bugged out as soon as I got out of the initial tutorial cave. The twins were just dancing eternally behind a giant log and the cutscene never triggered so I farmed a mob till I farmed 400 karma points.

Finally, the devs surely didn't play their own game on Master Difficulty themselves surely yet put it as an achievement + all cursed chests. I dare challenge anyone to kill the triple chest in the end of the game in less than 1 min 20 seconds. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenaBridgeOfSpirits/comments/pxc92u/how_do_i_beat_the_last_cursed_chest_in_village_in/) are some other players complaining about it. There were many chests like these but they just brushed it under ""It's masters so its supposed to be hard"" logic. Majority of simple and easy battles that have a time limit turns into a stressful event when the Master difficulty is on.

Long story short, I believe artistry of Kena is impeccable. Graphics and effects are cool but game is an archer simulator and Master difficulty is untested properly. It is just enemies on steroids, no new attack patterns or anything. Even cursed chest in the village is a simple example of how untested Master difficulty is yet they made it into a trophy/achievement as if it is a ""must experience"" thing.

,FrontiersOfPandora,"I see so many posts that say “Game too hard! What am I doing wrong?”

I don’t want to be reductive or try to brag about how much of a *gamer* I am, but this game is kinda like, way too simple and easy. 

The combat is dry as hell. The AI is easily tricked and avoided. You can run up to a level 20 AMP suit with a shotgun and shoot it 3 times.

On these posts, the comments are full of people suggesting that the OP play on easy, to which the OP replies “I am! 😡”

I just don’t understand what they are struggling with? Humans die in 1 shot. AMP suits die in a few arrows. I feel invincible when I am playing!

Are they just not crafting? Are they not collecting health boosts? Has this game attracted a lot of people who have never played a game before? 

When I get spotted clearing a base, I have to go **out of my way** to try and die so I can restart. It’s a chore. I can sit and facetank everything around for a good 10 seconds before I go down. Sometimes, I look down at my health bar and wonder what is tickling me only to find out a sniper has been shooting me for a solid 3 minutes.  

There’s 0 challenge in the whole game. Even the Laser Core left me feeling like “that’s it?” It said I should go there at 20, so I did. And everything fell over in 3-4 shots. 

When I see these posts, I swear we are playing a different game. I love Avatar, so I gave the game a good playthrough. However, it’s painfully simple and the combat loop is very unsatisfying and unchallenging. So when I come across this community, I thought I’d see a lot of the same criticisms. Come to find out, there’s a lot of people here struggling with the combat. I am bewildered.

&lt;p&gt;When I get spotted clearing a base, I have to go &lt;strong&gt;out of my way&lt;/strong&gt; to try and die so I can restart. It’s a chore. I can sit and facetank everything around for a good 10 seconds before I go down. Sometimes, I look down at my health bar and wonder what is tickling me only to find out a sniper has been shooting me for a solid 3 minutes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s 0 challenge in the whole game. Even the Laser Core left me feeling like “that’s it?” It said I should go there at 20, so I did. And everything fell over in 3-4 shots. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I see these posts, I swear we are playing a different game. I love Avatar, so I gave the game a good playthrough. However, it’s painfully simple and the combat loop is very unsatisfying and unchallenging. So when I come across this community, I thought I’d see a lot of the same criticisms. Come to find out, there’s a lot of people here struggling with the combat. I am bewildered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a humble brag. I am not trying to impress anyone about the (mostly) single player game we enjoy. I am truly confused as to why people are having difficulty when my experience is so far the other way.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;Though slightly underwhelming, it’s worth noting that the RTX 4080 SUPER remains an excellent card for gaming. When it comes to pure rasterization, the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX may lead by a slim margin (we do not have one to test), but the 4080 SUPER compensates with far better RT performance. Nonetheless, NVIDIA has utilized the full potential of the GPU, avoiding any limitations on its units, although higher clock speeds and power limits might have yielded additional, albeit small, improvements.  
&gt;  
&gt;There is zero reason to consider a RTX 4080 at this time. If there is a steep sale with remaining stock or a used card you may find success there and will not miss out on much. We are very surprised that the RTX 4080 SUPER mostly ends up at 1%-4% on average over the RTX 4080 FE. Now that Nvidia’s “SUPER” refreshes are complete we still believe the RTX 4070 SUPER is the card of choice for 90% of gamers if you must have the latest and greatest or an 7800XT.

# Digital Foundry Video - TBD

&gt;In performance terms, there's a law of diminishing returns to the excitement level surrounding the arrival of each new Super, from the generally positive reaction to the RTX 4070 Super to the more muted response to the RTX 4070 Ti Super - and now, ambivalence with the 4080 Super improvement. The truth is, it's a pricing adjustment dressed up in a marketing announcement and this is generally fine overall - but how much of a value enhancement are we actually getting?  
&gt;  
&gt;The cost per frame values for the 4080's predecessor - RTX 3080 - are $12.52 ($12.47 normalised), so while relative value only slightly tips towards the RTX 4080 Super, at least we're looking at something fairer. In effect, this looks very much like the kind of top-end pricing that the RTX 4080 should have had at launch. If you're looking for proportionately better value, the 4070 Super is clearly worth taking a look at, based on the table above.  
&gt;  
&gt;There's one more thing I'd like to point out though. We can't ignore that reaching a certain performance threshold makes more experiences viable, especially at 4K resolution, and that may be worth paying the premium. Path-traced Alan Wake and Cyberpunk 2077 are doing things that the RX 7900 XTX never will. It's that simple. DLSS spatial upscaling, DLSS 3 frame generation temporal upscaling, DLSS ray reconstruction - they're combining to make special things happen.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ultimately, I can't help but think that if you're 'dropping' a grand on a new GPU, you should have access to top-tier experiences at 4K resolution. AMD's value is clear and present, but I think this is all worth taking into consideration. In the gallery above, you'll note that even on a top-tier AMD sponsored game - Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - the RTX 4080 Super is ahead of the RX 7900 XTX and DLSS quality mode is delivering improved image quality over its FSR2 equivalent.  
&gt;  
&gt;In summary then, RTX 4080 Super does what it needs to do in delivering the kind of price/performance/features we didn't get at launch. Similar to the RTX 4070 Ti Super, it feels like the kind of package it should have been back in the day: expensive but not egregiously so. The price is improved then, but it arrives 14 months on from the 4080's launch and while there is a slightly better level of proportionate value compared to the rightly celebrated RTX 3080, it's still hard not to feel that this is still a pretty steep asking price for an 80-class product. At least now there is a gap for a 4080 Ti, but with the AI boom, it does feel less likely we'll ever get one.

# [eTeknix](https://www.eteknix.com/nvidia-rtx-4080-super-founders-edition-graphics-card-review/)

&gt;So what do we think? I think it’s clear to see that the 4080 SUPER is a step up in everything but performance. Sure, some games can utilise the extra specs that the 4080 SUPER has, but at such a small amount, it’s still within the margin of error, and the silicon lottery comes into play too. So you could argue, why didn’t NVIDIA just price cut the 4080 and while they’ve not confirmed anything with us, we do have our theories.  
&gt;  
&gt;When NVIDIA place an order for the silicon from their partners, they are paying a specific price based on the fabrication process, and the 4080 non-SUPER never saw that change, whereas the 4080 SUPER is slightly different, as per the GPU variants naming structure, so NVIDIA has found a way to refine the process, and in turn, it’s likely costing them less money.  
&gt;  
&gt;Their costs go down, and therefore they can afford to pass those savings on, whereas simply cutting the price of an existing product that’s been made under a more expensive fab process and has already been paid for, is a completely different kettle of fish.  
&gt;  
&gt;So I’m all for this, and like I said earlier. It does seem that gamers are happy to pay more for an NVIDIA card, as seen by how much of the market NVIDIA have, and the fact that AMD has even been rumoured to say that they may stop making high-end GPUs, much like we saw with the 5000 series which topped out as the 5700 series. They simply can’t compete. That’s not to say in terms of rasterisation, high frame rate numbers, but more in terms of features, and of course Ray Tracing.  
&gt;  
&gt;So that all puts NVIDIA in a really good position and allows them, yes, to charge more money, but also to do these mid-cycle changes where money and savings can be passed on. Sure we’d all like to see it cheaper, but the 4080 SUPER is still likely to outsell both the 7900 XT and 7900 XTX by a huge margin, much like the more expensive 4080 non-SUPER already has.  
&gt;  
&gt;So definitely some food for thought. I always had my feelings about how the 4080 was too expensive, but at $1000, it’s definitely a card that really has no competition when you factor in all elements including performance, Ray Tracing, upscaling, streaming and all of the other features that separate AMD and NVIDIA.

&gt;The performance metrics are clear, the GeForce RTX 4080 series (yes both 4080 and 4080 SUPER) stands out, particularly in gaming performance and rendering quality. This card offers better value compared to the 4090, achieving high-level performance that facilitates 4K resolution gaming. It's ideal for enthusiast gamers who use Ultra-Wide HD (UWHD), Quad HD (QHD), or Ultra HD (UHD) monitors. The RTX 4080 features an advanced rasterizer engine that surpasses previous performance limits, thanks in part to its 10k Shading processors. Additionally, the RTX 40 series introduced a new generation of Ray tracing and Tensor cores, which have proven to be significantly more powerful. The core counts of RT and Tensor should not be the sole focus; their performance efficiency is what truly matters. Located near the shader engine, these cores have become more efficient, a fact that is evident in their output. While Tensor cores are often challenging to quantify, our observations indicate robust performance, as evidenced by the impressive results with DLSS3 technology. The GeForce RTX 4080 is versatile, delivering super performance (pardon the pun) at resolutions ranging from 2K (2560x1440) to 4K (3840x2160).  
&gt;  
&gt;Here's the reality for the GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER, its hardware and performance are commendable but the performance differential towards the existing RTX 4080 is often within a 1-2% baseline, e.g. close to nothing. While it has more shaders and faster memory, both cards are tied towards the very same 320W TGP mainly resulting in that close to NIL performance differential. The biggest benefit of the series thus is pricing. The ADA GPU architecture of the 4080 SUPER demonstrates proficient performance. It boasts about 1.5 times the raw shader performance compared to its predecessors, along with enhanced Raytracing and Tensor core capabilities. Technologies like Shader Execution Reordering (SER) and DLSS 3 further enhance the capabilities of the Series 4000, making it a standout product. Add to that features like DLSS 3.5 with ray Reconstruction and Frame generation and you are bound to be able to use this graphics card for years. The GeForce RTX 4080 is notable for its impressive performance numbers. It is particularly suitable for gamers who use Ultra HD or have a minimum monitor resolution of 2560x1440. For those who can afford it, the 4080 SUPER is a valuable addition to any high-end gaming setup. For instance, games like Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, when combined with DLSS 3.0, achieve over 100 FPS at high resolutions. Similarly, Cyberpunk in  UHD, raytracing, and DLSS 3.5, exceeds 100 FPS. The recent move towards Ray reconstruction also moved NVIDA into that sweet spot. The card excels in Ultra HD gaming, whether using standard shading or a combination of hybrid ray-tracing and DLSS 3.0/3.5. The 4080 SUPER at $999 is now more affordable than the 4080, it still represents a significant financial commitment, offering a very nice performance.

# [Hot Hardware](https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-super-review)

&gt;NVIDIA set out to do a few things with its [GeForce RTX 40 SUPER lineup](https://hothardware.com/news/nvidia-rtx40-super-ces2024). The ultimate goals were to improve performance, refresh its Founders Edition boards with a fresh aesthetic, and offer more value to gamers with reduced introductory price points versus the original models. Although the performance deltas separating the GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER from the original RTX 4080 are relatively small in comparison to the RTX 4070 and 4070 Ti SUPERs, it is still faster than the original. The GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER also arrives with a $999 MSRP, 20% below the RTX 4080’s $1,199 introductory price. A cool grand is not chump change, of course, but more performance at a lower price point is a good thing and we have to give kudos to NVIDIA for the move.  
&gt;  
&gt;The GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER may also put some additional pressure on AMD. Reference clocked Radeon RX 7900 XTX cards can be [found for about $960 - $980](https://amzn.to/3SD3iuF) as of this publication, which may or may not require adjustment depending on your point of view. The GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER is faster overall, for only slightly more money – assuming street prices actually hit MSRP. The Radeon RX 7900 XTX will likely be faster with many titles that don’t use ray tracing, but the scales tip in favor of the GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER once ray tracing is factored into the mix. Many rendering and compute workloads also perform better on the GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER, and the GeForce is more power efficient too. We’ll have to see how things shake out in the next few weeks, but AMD may want to run some promos at the very least, to improve the Radeon RX 7900 XTX’s current value proposition in light of today’s launch.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the end, NVIDIA’s brought its second fastest GPU down into the sub-$1,000 price bracket. That’s not cheap, but it’s a positive development nonetheless and we welcome it. The GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER is fast, power efficient, we dig the all-black aesthetic, and it is ultimately a better value for enthusiasts shopping for a high-end GPU.

# [Igor's Lab](https://www.igorslab.de/en/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-super-founders-edition-16gb-vs-msi-geforce-rtx-4080-super-expert-16-gb-review/)

&gt;How do you make a product cheaper and more attractive without directly lowering the price and entering into a price war that you can’t (and don’t want to) win? You create a super-adequate product, even add some performance on top, sacrifice some efficiency, but can use significantly more chips in order to significantly reduce the price. The result is a new, “improved” recipe that is even cheaper than the new products from the relevant food companies. And with more content. Well, a few calories will be added to the price, but that’s peanuts compared to the purchase price.  
&gt;  
&gt;What sounds like the reverse of the daily criticism of cheat packs in the shops is certainly also calculated. In over a year, NVIDIA has certainly collected enough chips for the GeForce RTX 4080 Super and at the same time increased the yield to proudly position this product as a replacement for the GeForce RTX 4080 Non-Super. An average of 1 to 2.5 percent more performance compared to the non-Super card with a good 5% more shaders doesn’t sound so exhilarating, but at least the range outside any measurement tolerances can be proven.  
&gt;  
&gt;Of course, things that were previously unplayable are not suddenly playable, but it is at least a certain benefit that customers are happy to accept, especially as the price of the so-called RRP cards has fallen significantly. However, the board partners come into play again at this party and if you want something nicer and brighter, the price can quickly rise by 100 to 300 euros. Then the advantage is gone again and you will have to think about where to set your priorities. The first impression of the GeForce RTX 4080 Super is therefore quite positive. For the first time in a long time, NVIDIA is once again offering a card that is cheaper than the older comparison model and still remains at the top of the field in terms of efficiency. The approximately 80 percentage points compared to an even slightly slower GeForce RTX 3090 Ti are still shockingly high and they also show what the Ada generation is capable of, even if you open the tap a little further.

# [Kitguru Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imnin79vcSI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=KitGuruTech)

&gt;As the last of three [RTX 40-series Super](https://www.kitguru.net/tech-news/featured-tech-news/matthew-wilson/ces-2024-nvidias-rtx-40-super-launch-ai-laptops-and-more/) launches this month, there is no doubt the **Nvidia** **RTX 4080 Super** is the least interesting of the lot, for the simple reason that it brings no tangible performance benefit over the outgoing RTX 4080. The refreshes started strongly with the [RTX 4070 Super](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-4070-super-review/) coming in a good 15% faster than the 4070, while the [RTX 4070 Ti Super](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-4070-ti-super-review-ft-msi/) delivers performance that's a bit faster than the RTX 4070 Ti but with VRAM and memory bandwidth increased by a third. Today we've assessed the RTX 4080 Super and found it to be… 1% faster than the RTX 4080.  
&gt;  
&gt;That's right, across twelve games at 4K resolution, the RTX 4080 Super came in 1% faster on average. Nine of the twelve games tested showed a difference of less than 2%, while we saw a performance increase of more than 3% in just a single game. The differences are so marginal that the silicon lottery could well mean a higher-performing RTX 4080 would actually *outperform* a slightly below-par RTX 4080 Super, and in fact that's exactly what we did find in [our review of the Palit JetStream OC](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/palit-rtx-4080-super-jetstream-oc-review/).  
&gt;  
&gt;As lame as that is, it's important to remember we are still talking about a very fast GPU here – it may be an entirely uninteresting difference compared to the original 4080, but it is nonetheless a very capable 4K card, averaging 73FPS across the twelve games tested. It is also second only to the RTX 4090 when looking at ray tracing, admittedly by quite a distance, but the reality is AMD has nothing that can compete in this segment if you value RT performance, given the 4080 Super proved 30% faster than the 7900 XTX over the eight ray traced games we tested.  
&gt;  
&gt;Clearly, the RTX 4080 Super is all about the new lower price-point, rather than the almost non-existent performance improvements over the RTX 4080. As a reminder, [RTX 4080 launched in November 2022](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-4080-founders-edition-review/) for £1269/$1199, while the 4080 Super is now hitting the market at £959/$999. Offering the same performance for a price that's £310 lower doesn't sound too bad, and it does improve the cost per frame by 26% over the RTX 4080 when looking at the launch MSRPs.

# [LanOC](https://lanoc.org/review/video-cards/8957-nvidia-rtx-4080-super-founders-edition)

&gt;As far as the 4080 SUPER goes Nvidia did improve on the performance we saw with the RTX 4080 but this isn’t a huge step up in performance between the two cards, I saw an average of 3.8% improvement in our 4k gaming tests, and in some of the synthetic tests I saw less and other tests I saw up to 5%. This did help it catch up to the RX 7900 XTX at 1080p and 1440p but the XTX was still a few FPS higher at 4K. That is before we figure in DLSS 3 with frame generation and the overall ray tracing capabilities of the RTX 4080 SUPER Founders Edition which were both a big plus for the 4080 SUPER. For power efficiency, the RTX 4080 SUPER Founders Edition did drop down slightly compared to the original RTX 4080 but it was still in a different class compared to the competition from AMD. The RTX 4080 SUPER Founders Edition impressed in our noise testing, especially when under load and its cooling performance was better than I expected as well. The only downside there is that there isn’t much headroom in the cooler when it comes to cranking the fans up but as it sits I wouldn’t have any reason to want to do that anyhow.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the end, like always, it comes down to pricing. Nvidia has the RTX 4080 SUPER priced with an MSRP of $999 and the RTX 4080 SUPER Founders Edition because it comes from them directly will be at that price point. The RTX 4080 that this replaces launched at $1199. While the RTX 4080 SUPER Founders Edition isn’t a drastic step forward in performance it does offer a step up while coming down $200. Most people, myself included, weren’t a fan of the pricing of the RTX 4080 last year but I can say without a doubt that the RTX 4080 SUPER and the RTX 4080 SUPER Founders Edition with it is what the original RTX 4080 should have been. A capable performer and while not cheap you are getting high-level performance at a price that fits that is competitive. The RX 7900 XTX is right in that same price range right now and while the raster performance of the 7900 XTX was a touch higher than the 4080 SUPER at 4K Nvidia’s tech like DLSS 3 and its ray tracing capabilities help add a lot of value and push me into the 4080 SUPER camp.

&gt;Summing up this whole Nvidia refresh has been akin to trying to nail a jelly to the wall. Theoretically easy, hard in practise. With the RTX 4070 Super we felt it was a victim of previous Nvidia decisions about their product range and pricing. More recently, the RTX 4070 Ti, we felt, was fast enough to justify the Super tag, but affordable enough to not be offensive. Today with the RTX 4080 Super we have nothing but good things to say.  
&gt;  
&gt;Firstly we like how Nvidia have beefed up the hardware. Clock speed increases aren’t enough to justify a new model. By giving us more hardware, it makes the product more palatable. Secondly, there wasn’t a RTX 4080 Ti, so the range was less muddled to begin with. It gives the RTX 4080 Super a place in their range. Above the vanilla card, below the RTX 4090. Easy. Thirdly, the extra clock speed, and extra hardware have combined to bring more performance to the table. By pricing the Super aggressively, under a thousand pounds, it brings gaming to the enthusiast without breaking the bank.

# [PC Perspective](https://pcper.com/2024/01/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-super-founders-edition-review/)

&gt;There you have it, another SUPER launch is in the books, and we have a very slight performance edge over the original version of the card. When comparing the new RTX 40 Series SUPER cards, by far this is the smallest performance uplift compared to the original. HOWEVER, **this card is nearly 17% less expensive than the version it is replacing**. When does this ever happen?  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m sure top YouTubers are already out there with their pensive, disapproving, disappointed, or pseudo-angry face thumbnails just killing the low single-digit increases with the RTX 4080 SUPER over its non-SUPER predecessor, but to me this launch is [All About the Benjamins](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278295/). All two of them, as a matter of fact. Yes, for $200 United States Dollars ***less*** than the original card, you have a new card that’s just a little faster.  
&gt;  
&gt;The End.

# [PC World](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2222156/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-super-review.html)

&gt;While I couldn’t recommend the original RTX 4080 over the Radeon RX 7900 XTX at its chest-clutching $1,200 price, the GeForce RTX 4080 Super’s $999 price tag makes it much more competitive. In fact, I’d opt for Nvidia’s refreshed penultimate GPU over AMD’s champion now.  
&gt;  
&gt;The performance upgrades in the 4080 Super are perfunctory and negligible; it’s the price drop that matters. The Super and the 7900 XTx both deliver screaming-fast frame rates in traditional games, trading blows left and right. That’s what made the Radeon so appealing versus the original 4080, especially with Nvidia’s card having such an exorbitant markup. But by matching the 7900 XTX’s $1,000 MSRP, Nvidia’s extras help the 4080 Super claim dominance.  
&gt;  
&gt;The GeForce RTX 4080 draws *massively* less power than its AMD rival to deliver similar frame rates in traditional games. Flip on ray tracing and Nvidia holds a gargantuan lead, with stellar AI-powered features like DLSS, Frame Generation, and Ray Reconstruction pushing both speed and performance advantages to 11. Features like Nvidia Broadcast and Reflex hold deep practical appeal; RTX Video Super Resolution uses AI to make ugly videos beautiful. And Nvidia maintains a strong lead in most creative and machine learning/AI workloads if you like to put your GPU to work when you’re not playing — witness the dual AV1 encoders in the 4080 Super.  
&gt;  
&gt;Taken as a whole package — performance, ray tracing, power efficiency, features, even prosumer tasks — Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 4080 Super is the clear choice in its price range. This is the graphics card you want for 4K gaming without going over $1,000. You can often find the Radeon 7900 XTX on sale for $950 or so, but I’d still pick up the 4080 Super without hesitation given that option. At the high-end, where *everything* matters, I wouldn’t consider the AMD option unless it was on sale for $900 or (ideally) less, despite it being a fine 4K GPU in its own right.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you want 4K gaming, excellent ray tracing, and Nvidia features at a slightly lesser price, the [$799 GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsearchpage.jsp%3Fst%3D4070%2Bti%2Bsuper%26_dyncharset%3DUTF-8%26_dynSessConf%3D%26id%3Dpcat17071%26type%3Dpage%26sc%3DGlobal%26cp%3D1%26nrp%3D%26sp%3D%26qp%3D%26list%3Dn%26af%3Dtrue%26iht%3Dy%26usc%3DAll%2BCategories%26ks%3D960%26keys%3Dkeys&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Farticle%2F2222156%2Fnvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-super-review.html&amp;u1=2-1-2222156-1-0-0) is also worth considering now that it has 16GB of memory and a wider memory bus. It isn’t as fast as the 4080, obviously, but should still get the job done. Or if you want the ultimate gaming experience, there’s always the GeForce RTX 4090, though it’s priced at $1,600 and going for closer to $2,000 on the street.

# [Techpowerup](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-super-founders-edition/)

&gt;Averaged over the 25 games in our test suite, at 4K, we find the card only 1.5% faster than 4080 non-Super Founders Edition, which is MUCH less than expected. While NVIDIA never said ""+5%,"" I definitely expected more. It's not a power limit issue, running at max power yields another +1% only. These numbers are pretty constant across resolutions, and even with RT enabled, too. Looking at the individual games, the differences are 1 or 2 FPS, nothing you'd ever notice subjectively. While that's certainly a bit disappointing, the fact remains that RTX 4080 Super, just like the RTX 4080 non-Super, is a fantastic card for gaming. In a pure raster scenario, the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX is still a tiny bit faster, but NVIDIA's card makes up for that with much better RT performance. Still, I feel like beating the XTX across the board was one of the goals of RTX 4080 Super, and NVIDIA failed here. In NVIDIA's defense, the RTX 4080 Super leverages the full GPU, no units were held back, even though small additional gains could have been achieved with higher clock speeds and power limit. Compared to the RTX 4070 Ti Super, the performance uplift is 18%, the card is also 30% faster than RTX 4070 Ti non-Super. RTX 3080 Ti performance is roughly comparable to RTX 3090, which makes the gen-over-gen uplift a very solid 30%. NVIDIA's flagship, the RTX 4090 is still the undisputed king of the hill, offering almost 30% better performance.  
&gt;  
&gt;Taking a closer look at our test results, most of the games are in the 1.5% range—it's not that one game is 7% and the others are 0%, the gains are really small across the board. There is definitely some variations in GPU chip silicon quality, which affects performance due to the way NVIDIA's Boost algorithm works, but with my sample size of 9 cards tested, I think that I can confidently say that there's no way you're getting +5% out of the 4080 Super, unless you manually overclock it. Other reviewers have similar numbers, so it's not just me. Surprisingly, the RTX 4070 Super, initially considered the least exciting among the new releases on forums, showed the highest performance increase (+15%). In contrast, the RTX 4070 Ti Super, despite receiving a GPU upgrade and a 33% memory bandwidth increase, only saw a modest +5% in extra performance. Today's release could almost be labeled a ""rebrand,"" but the improved pricing certainly adds to its appeal.  
&gt;  
&gt;NVIDIA has set an MSRP of $1000 for the RTX 4080 Super and that's the real innovation here. Compared to the current $1200 for the RTX 4080 non-Super, this introduces a significant 20% discount. I have to applaud NVIDIA for that, especially, considering that there's not much competition in this segment. AMD is happy with their $970 price point for the 7900 XTX, but that changes today. RTX 4080 Super at $1000 means that RX 7900 XTX becomes unsellable unless its price is lowered considerably. The RTX 4080 Super offers superior RT performance, similar raster perf and support for DLSS—exactly what people in the premium segment are looking for. Even at $900 I'm not sure if I'd prefer 7900 XTX over a $1000 4080 Super, it's just a 10% delta. Still, $1000 is definitely not a steal for the RTX 4080 Super and what it offers—the 2024 GPU market is still expensive. If you want to save a bit of money, probably the most interesting alternative is RX 7900 XT, which currently sells for $710, but is considerably slower, which means lower detail settings or upscaling, but there's no DLSS on the card to help with that. NVIDIA has confirmed that the RTX 4080 non-Super is now end-of-life. You could potentially get a card at a good price; anything $950 and below is what I'd call ""interesting."" If it's higher, go for the Super model, also for its better resale value. If you really must have the best, then the RTX 4090 is what you want—that hasn't changed with the release of the RTX 4080 Super, but be prepared to pay for it: +80% for an almost 30% increase in performance is tough. At the end of the day, RTX 4080 Super is disappointing in terms of the changes it brings, but it redeems itself thanks to its greatly improved pricing. While I'm sure there will be a lot of drama about the minimal gains, what the GPU market really needs is lower prices, not marginally better performance for the same price. In this regard, the RTX 4080 Super can be considered a success.

# The FPS Review

&gt;TBD

# [Tomshardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-super-review)

&gt;Nvidia's RTX 4080 Super can be summed up in just a few words: It's like the RTX 4080, only less expensive. That's not to say it's *inexpensive*, as it still costs over $1,000 (after taxes), but $200 cheaper is at least something. Meanwhile, the performance side of the story is a gigantic snorefest. The RTX 4080 Super does technically offer more performance than the RTX 4080, but only by about 2\~3 percent on average. Even a piddly overclock of an RTX 4080 could improve performance at least that much.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you were on the fence and trying to decide between AMD's RX 7900 XTX and Nvidia's RTX 4080, with the latter costing on average $200 extra, the RTX 4080 Super effectively wipes away the price difference. The only real reason to opt for a 7900 XTX now — barring any price cuts — is if you specifically want AMD's top card, or you want any GPU that has more than 16GB of memory. Otherwise, the RTX 4080 Super is almost always the better option.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yes, there are exceptions, like a few rasterization games and certain professional applications, as well as workloads that need more than 16GB (but less than 24GB) of VRAM. If you're specifically interested in one of those use cases, that's fine, and AMD is still technically about $40 cheaper for the least expensive 7900 XTX cards. At the same time, you give up access to Nvidia's DLSS features and potentially lose a lot of performance in other use cases. In other words, you 'win' in a few specific cases and lose in a lot of other situations.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ultimately, the RTX 4080 Super delivered precisely what we expected to see. It's a cheaper and barely faster take on the RTX 4080. The price means it's now in direct competition with AMD's 7900 XTX, but either one still costs as much as an entire midrange gaming PC. It's fine for what it is but doesn't offer anything new other than a stealthier black aesthetic for the Founders Edition.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you're in the market for a top-tier graphics card and can't justify doubling the price and picking up an RTX 4090, the RTX 4080 Super now ranks as the second fastest GPU overall, and it's cheaper than the existing 4080. It's slightly faster and less costly than the 4080, but we were never particularly pleased with the $1,199 launch price of the 4080 in the first place. $200 represents a welcome and necessary price correction, and unlike the RTX 3080, which was generally selling at over $1,000 for the majority of its life cycle, the 4080 Super should at least be readily available.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though slightly underwhelming, it’s worth noting that the RTX 4080 SUPER remains an excellent card for gaming. When it comes to pure rasterization, the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX may lead by a slim margin (we do not have one to test), but the 4080 SUPER compensates with far better RT performance. Nonetheless, NVIDIA has utilized the full potential of the GPU, avoiding any limitations on its units, although higher clock speeds and power limits might have yielded additional, albeit small, improvements.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is zero reason to consider a RTX 4080 at this time. If there is a steep sale with remaining stock or a used card you may find success there and will not miss out on much. We are very surprised that the RTX 4080 SUPER mostly ends up at 1%-4% on average over the RTX 4080 FE. Now that Nvidia’s “SUPER” refreshes are complete we still believe the RTX 4070 SUPER is the card of choice for 90% of gamers if you must have the latest and greatest or an 7800XT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-super-review""&gt;Digital Foundry Article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Digital Foundry Video - TBD&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In performance terms, there&amp;#39;s a law of diminishing returns to the excitement level surrounding the arrival of each new Super, from the generally positive reaction to the RTX 4070 Super to the more muted response to the RTX 4070 Ti Super - and now, ambivalence with the 4080 Super improvement. The truth is, it&amp;#39;s a pricing adjustment dressed up in a marketing announcement and this is generally fine overall - but how much of a value enhancement are we actually getting?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost per frame values for the 4080&amp;#39;s predecessor - RTX 3080 - are $12.52 ($12.47 normalised), so while relative value only slightly tips towards the RTX 4080 Super, at least we&amp;#39;re looking at something fairer. In effect, this looks very much like the kind of top-end pricing that the RTX 4080 should have had at launch. If you&amp;#39;re looking for proportionately better value, the 4070 Super is clearly worth taking a look at, based on the table above.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s one more thing I&amp;#39;d like to point out though. We can&amp;#39;t ignore that reaching a certain performance threshold makes more experiences viable, especially at 4K resolution, and that may be worth paying the premium. Path-traced Alan Wake and Cyberpunk 2077 are doing things that the RX 7900 XTX never will. It&amp;#39;s that simple. DLSS spatial upscaling, DLSS 3 frame generation temporal upscaling, DLSS ray reconstruction - they&amp;#39;re combining to make special things happen.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I can&amp;#39;t help but think that if you&amp;#39;re &amp;#39;dropping&amp;#39; a grand on a new GPU, you should have access to top-tier experiences at 4K resolution. AMD&amp;#39;s value is clear and present, but I think this is all worth taking into consideration. In the gallery above, you&amp;#39;ll note that even on a top-tier AMD sponsored game - Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - the RTX 4080 Super is ahead of the RX 7900 XTX and DLSS quality mode is delivering improved image quality over its FSR2 equivalent.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary then, RTX 4080 Super does what it needs to do in delivering the kind of price/performance/features we didn&amp;#39;t get at launch. Similar to the RTX 4070 Ti Super, it feels like the kind of package it should have been back in the day: expensive but not egregiously so. The price is improved then, but it arrives 14 months on from the 4080&amp;#39;s launch and while there is a slightly better level of proportionate value compared to the rightly celebrated RTX 3080, it&amp;#39;s still hard not to feel that this is still a pretty steep asking price for an 80-class product. At least now there is a gap for a 4080 Ti, but with the AI boom, it does feel less likely we&amp;#39;ll ever get one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.eteknix.com/nvidia-rtx-4080-super-founders-edition-graphics-card-review/""&gt;eTeknix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do we think? I think it’s clear to see that the 4080 SUPER is a step up in everything but performance. Sure, some games can utilise the extra specs that the 4080 SUPER has, but at such a small amount, it’s still within the margin of error, and the silicon lottery comes into play too. So you could argue, why didn’t NVIDIA just price cut the 4080 and while they’ve not confirmed anything with us, we do have our theories.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When NVIDIA place an order for the silicon from their partners, they are paying a specific price based on the fabrication process, and the 4080 non-SUPER never saw that change, whereas the 4080 SUPER is slightly different, as per the GPU variants naming structure, so NVIDIA has found a way to refine the process, and in turn, it’s likely costing them less money.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their costs go down, and therefore they can afford to pass those savings on, whereas simply cutting the price of an existing product that’s been made under a more expensive fab process and has already been paid for, is a completely different kettle of fish.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m all for this, and like I said earlier. It does seem that gamers are happy to pay more for an NVIDIA card, as seen by how much of the market NVIDIA have, and the fact that AMD has even been rumoured to say that they may stop making high-end GPUs, much like we saw with the 5000 series which topped out as the 5700 series. They simply can’t compete. That’s not to say in terms of rasterisation, high frame rate numbers, but more in terms of features, and of course Ray Tracing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that all puts NVIDIA in a really good position and allows them, yes, to charge more money, but also to do these mid-cycle changes where money and savings can be passed on. Sure we’d all like to see it cheaper, but the 4080 SUPER is still likely to outsell both the 7900 XT and 7900 XTX by a huge margin, much like the more expensive 4080 non-SUPER already has.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So definitely some food for thought. I always had my feelings about how the 4080 was too expensive, but at $1000, it’s definitely a card that really has no competition when you factor in all elements including performance, Ray Tracing, upscaling, streaming and all of the other features that separate AMD and NVIDIA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.guru3d.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-super-review/""&gt;Guru3D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance metrics are clear, the GeForce RTX 4080 series (yes both 4080 and 4080 SUPER) stands out, particularly in gaming performance and rendering quality. This card offers better value compared to the 4090, achieving high-level performance that facilitates 4K resolution gaming. It&amp;#39;s ideal for enthusiast gamers who use Ultra-Wide HD (UWHD), Quad HD (QHD), or Ultra HD (UHD) monitors. The RTX 4080 features an advanced rasterizer engine that surpasses previous performance limits, thanks in part to its 10k Shading processors. Additionally, the RTX 40 series introduced a new generation of Ray tracing and Tensor cores, which have proven to be significantly more powerful. The core counts of RT and Tensor should not be the sole focus; their performance efficiency is what truly matters. Located near the shader engine, these cores have become more efficient, a fact that is evident in their output. While Tensor cores are often challenging to quantify, our observations indicate robust performance, as evidenced by the impressive results with DLSS3 technology. The GeForce RTX 4080 is versatile, delivering super performance (pardon the pun) at resolutions ranging from 2K (2560x1440) to 4K (3840x2160).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the reality for the GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER, its hardware and performance are commendable but the performance differential towards the existing RTX 4080 is often within a 1-2% baseline, e.g. close to nothing. While it has more shaders and faster memory, both cards are tied towards the very same 320W TGP mainly resulting in that close to NIL performance differential. The biggest benefit of the series thus is pricing. The ADA GPU architecture of the 4080 SUPER demonstrates proficient performance. It boasts about 1.5 times the raw shader performance compared to its predecessors, along with enhanced Raytracing and Tensor core capabilities. Technologies like Shader Execution Reordering (SER) and DLSS 3 further enhance the capabilities of the Series 4000, making it a standout product. Add to that features like DLSS 3.5 with ray Reconstruction and Frame generation and you are bound to be able to use this graphics card for years. The GeForce RTX 4080 is notable for its impressive performance numbers. It is particularly suitable for gamers who use Ultra HD or have a minimum monitor resolution of 2560x1440. For those who can afford it, the 4080 SUPER is a valuable addition to any high-end gaming setup. For instance, games like Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, when combined with DLSS 3.0, achieve over 100 FPS at high resolutions. Similarly, Cyberpunk in  UHD, raytracing, and DLSS 3.5, exceeds 100 FPS. The recent move towards Ray reconstruction also moved NVIDA into that sweet spot. The card excels in Ultra HD gaming, whether using standard shading or a combination of hybrid ray-tracing and DLSS 3.0/3.5. The 4080 SUPER at $999 is now more affordable than the 4080, it still represents a significant financial commitment, offering a very nice performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-super-review""&gt;Hot Hardware&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA set out to do a few things with its &lt;a href=""https://hothardware.com/news/nvidia-rtx40-super-ces2024""&gt;GeForce RTX 40 SUPER lineup&lt;/a&gt;. The ultimate goals were to improve performance, refresh its Founders Edition boards with a fresh aesthetic, and offer more value to gamers with reduced introductory price points versus the original models. Although the performance deltas separating the GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER from the original RTX 4080 are relatively small in comparison to the RTX 4070 and 4070 Ti SUPERs, it is still faster than the original. The GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER also arrives with a $999 MSRP, 20% below the RTX 4080’s $1,199 introductory price. A cool grand is not chump change, of course, but more performance at a lower price point is a good thing and we have to give kudos to NVIDIA for the move.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER may also put some additional pressure on AMD. Reference clocked Radeon RX 7900 XTX cards can be &lt;a href=""https://amzn.to/3SD3iuF""&gt;found for about $960 - $980&lt;/a&gt; as of this publication, which may or may not require adjustment depending on your point of view. The GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER is faster overall, for only slightly more money – assuming street prices actually hit MSRP. The Radeon RX 7900 XTX will likely be faster with many titles that don’t use ray tracing, but the scales tip in favor of the GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER once ray tracing is factored into the mix. Many rendering and compute workloads also perform better on the GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER, and the GeForce is more power efficient too. We’ll have to see how things shake out in the next few weeks, but AMD may want to run some promos at the very least, to improve the Radeon RX 7900 XTX’s current value proposition in light of today’s launch.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, NVIDIA’s brought its second fastest GPU down into the sub-$1,000 price bracket. That’s not cheap, but it’s a positive development nonetheless and we welcome it. The GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER is fast, power efficient, we dig the all-black aesthetic, and it is ultimately a better value for enthusiasts shopping for a high-end GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.igorslab.de/en/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-super-founders-edition-16gb-vs-msi-geforce-rtx-4080-super-expert-16-gb-review/""&gt;Igor&amp;#39;s Lab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you make a product cheaper and more attractive without directly lowering the price and entering into a price war that you can’t (and don’t want to) win? You create a super-adequate product, even add some performance on top, sacrifice some efficiency, but can use significantly more chips in order to significantly reduce the price. The result is a new, “improved” recipe that is even cheaper than the new products from the relevant food companies. And with more content. Well, a few calories will be added to the price, but that’s peanuts compared to the purchase price.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What sounds like the reverse of the daily criticism of cheat packs in the shops is certainly also calculated. In over a year, NVIDIA has certainly collected enough chips for the GeForce RTX 4080 Super and at the same time increased the yield to proudly position this product as a replacement for the GeForce RTX 4080 Non-Super. An average of 1 to 2.5 percent more performance compared to the non-Super card with a good 5% more shaders doesn’t sound so exhilarating, but at least the range outside any measurement tolerances can be proven.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, things that were previously unplayable are not suddenly playable, but it is at least a certain benefit that customers are happy to accept, especially as the price of the so-called RRP cards has fallen significantly. However, the board partners come into play again at this party and if you want something nicer and brighter, the price can quickly rise by 100 to 300 euros. Then the advantage is gone again and you will have to think about where to set your priorities. The first impression of the GeForce RTX 4080 Super is therefore quite positive. For the first time in a long time, NVIDIA is once again offering a card that is cheaper than the older comparison model and still remains at the top of the field in terms of efficiency. The approximately 80 percentage points compared to an even slightly slower GeForce RTX 3090 Ti are still shockingly high and they also show what the Ada generation is capable of, even if you open the tap a little further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the last of three &lt;a href=""https://www.kitguru.net/tech-news/featured-tech-news/matthew-wilson/ces-2024-nvidias-rtx-40-super-launch-ai-laptops-and-more/""&gt;RTX 40-series Super&lt;/a&gt; launches this month, there is no doubt the &lt;strong&gt;Nvidia&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;RTX 4080 Super&lt;/strong&gt; is the least interesting of the lot, for the simple reason that it brings no tangible performance benefit over the outgoing RTX 4080. The refreshes started strongly with the &lt;a href=""https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-4070-super-review/""&gt;RTX 4070 Super&lt;/a&gt; coming in a good 15% faster than the 4070, while the &lt;a href=""https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-4070-ti-super-review-ft-msi/""&gt;RTX 4070 Ti Super&lt;/a&gt; delivers performance that&amp;#39;s a bit faster than the RTX 4070 Ti but with VRAM and memory bandwidth increased by a third. Today we&amp;#39;ve assessed the RTX 4080 Super and found it to be… 1% faster than the RTX 4080.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s right, across twelve games at 4K resolution, the RTX 4080 Super came in 1% faster on average. Nine of the twelve games tested showed a difference of less than 2%, while we saw a performance increase of more than 3% in just a single game. The differences are so marginal that the silicon lottery could well mean a higher-performing RTX 4080 would actually &lt;em&gt;outperform&lt;/em&gt; a slightly below-par RTX 4080 Super, and in fact that&amp;#39;s exactly what we did find in &lt;a href=""https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/palit-rtx-4080-super-jetstream-oc-review/""&gt;our review of the Palit JetStream OC&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As lame as that is, it&amp;#39;s important to remember we are still talking about a very fast GPU here – it may be an entirely uninteresting difference compared to the original 4080, but it is nonetheless a very capable 4K card, averaging 73FPS across the twelve games tested. It is also second only to the RTX 4090 when looking at ray tracing, admittedly by quite a distance, but the reality is AMD has nothing that can compete in this segment if you value RT performance, given the 4080 Super proved 30% faster than the 7900 XTX over the eight ray traced games we tested.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the RTX 4080 Super is all about the new lower price-point, rather than the almost non-existent performance improvements over the RTX 4080. As a reminder, &lt;a href=""https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/nvidia-rtx-4080-founders-edition-review/""&gt;RTX 4080 launched in November 2022&lt;/a&gt; for £1269/$1199, while the 4080 Super is now hitting the market at £959/$999. Offering the same performance for a price that&amp;#39;s £310 lower doesn&amp;#39;t sound too bad, and it does improve the cost per frame by 26% over the RTX 4080 when looking at the launch MSRPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://lanoc.org/review/video-cards/8957-nvidia-rtx-4080-super-founders-edition""&gt;LanOC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as the 4080 SUPER goes Nvidia did improve on the performance we saw with the RTX 4080 but this isn’t a huge step up in performance between the two cards, I saw an average of 3.8% improvement in our 4k gaming tests, and in some of the synthetic tests I saw less and other tests I saw up to 5%. This did help it catch up to the RX 7900 XTX at 1080p and 1440p but the XTX was still a few FPS higher at 4K. That is before we figure in DLSS 3 with frame generation and the overall ray tracing capabilities of the RTX 4080 SUPER Founders Edition which were both a big plus for the 4080 SUPER. For power efficiency, the RTX 4080 SUPER Founders Edition did drop down slightly compared to the original RTX 4080 but it was still in a different class compared to the competition from AMD. The RTX 4080 SUPER Founders Edition impressed in our noise testing, especially when under load and its cooling performance was better than I expected as well. The only downside there is that there isn’t much headroom in the cooler when it comes to cranking the fans up but as it sits I wouldn’t have any reason to want to do that anyhow.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, like always, it comes down to pricing. Nvidia has the RTX 4080 SUPER priced with an MSRP of $999 and the RTX 4080 SUPER Founders Edition because it comes from them directly will be at that price point. The RTX 4080 that this replaces launched at $1199. While the RTX 4080 SUPER Founders Edition isn’t a drastic step forward in performance it does offer a step up while coming down $200. Most people, myself included, weren’t a fan of the pricing of the RTX 4080 last year but I can say without a doubt that the RTX 4080 SUPER and the RTX 4080 SUPER Founders Edition with it is what the original RTX 4080 should have been. A capable performer and while not cheap you are getting high-level performance at a price that fits that is competitive. The RX 7900 XTX is right in that same price range right now and while the raster performance of the 7900 XTX was a touch higher than the 4080 SUPER at 4K Nvidia’s tech like DLSS 3 and its ray tracing capabilities help add a lot of value and push me into the 4080 SUPER camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summing up this whole Nvidia refresh has been akin to trying to nail a jelly to the wall. Theoretically easy, hard in practise. With the RTX 4070 Super we felt it was a victim of previous Nvidia decisions about their product range and pricing. More recently, the RTX 4070 Ti, we felt, was fast enough to justify the Super tag, but affordable enough to not be offensive. Today with the RTX 4080 Super we have nothing but good things to say.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly we like how Nvidia have beefed up the hardware. Clock speed increases aren’t enough to justify a new model. By giving us more hardware, it makes the product more palatable. Secondly, there wasn’t a RTX 4080 Ti, so the range was less muddled to begin with. It gives the RTX 4080 Super a place in their range. Above the vanilla card, below the RTX 4090. Easy. Thirdly, the extra clock speed, and extra hardware have combined to bring more performance to the table. By pricing the Super aggressively, under a thousand pounds, it brings gaming to the enthusiast without breaking the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://pcper.com/2024/01/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-super-founders-edition-review/""&gt;PC Perspective&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you have it, another SUPER launch is in the books, and we have a very slight performance edge over the original version of the card. When comparing the new RTX 40 Series SUPER cards, by far this is the smallest performance uplift compared to the original. HOWEVER, &lt;strong&gt;this card is nearly 17% less expensive than the version it is replacing&lt;/strong&gt;. When does this ever happen?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure top YouTubers are already out there with their pensive, disapproving, disappointed, or pseudo-angry face thumbnails just killing the low single-digit increases with the RTX 4080 SUPER over its non-SUPER predecessor, but to me this launch is &lt;a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278295/""&gt;All About the Benjamins&lt;/a&gt;. All two of them, as a matter of fact. Yes, for $200 United States Dollars &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; than the original card, you have a new card that’s just a little faster.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The End.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.pcworld.com/article/2222156/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-super-review.html""&gt;PC World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I couldn’t recommend the original RTX 4080 over the Radeon RX 7900 XTX at its chest-clutching $1,200 price, the GeForce RTX 4080 Super’s $999 price tag makes it much more competitive. In fact, I’d opt for Nvidia’s refreshed penultimate GPU over AMD’s champion now.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performance upgrades in the 4080 Super are perfunctory and negligible; it’s the price drop that matters. The Super and the 7900 XTx both deliver screaming-fast frame rates in traditional games, trading blows left and right. That’s what made the Radeon so appealing versus the original 4080, especially with Nvidia’s card having such an exorbitant markup. But by matching the 7900 XTX’s $1,000 MSRP, Nvidia’s extras help the 4080 Super claim dominance.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GeForce RTX 4080 draws &lt;em&gt;massively&lt;/em&gt; less power than its AMD rival to deliver similar frame rates in traditional games. Flip on ray tracing and Nvidia holds a gargantuan lead, with stellar AI-powered features like DLSS, Frame Generation, and Ray Reconstruction pushing both speed and performance advantages to 11. Features like Nvidia Broadcast and Reflex hold deep practical appeal; RTX Video Super Resolution uses AI to make ugly videos beautiful. And Nvidia maintains a strong lead in most creative and machine learning/AI workloads if you like to put your GPU to work when you’re not playing — witness the dual AV1 encoders in the 4080 Super.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken as a whole package — performance, ray tracing, power efficiency, features, even prosumer tasks — Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 4080 Super is the clear choice in its price range. This is the graphics card you want for 4K gaming without going over $1,000. You can often find the Radeon 7900 XTX on sale for $950 or so, but I’d still pick up the 4080 Super without hesitation given that option. At the high-end, where &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; matters, I wouldn’t consider the AMD option unless it was on sale for $900 or (ideally) less, despite it being a fine 4K GPU in its own right.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want 4K gaming, excellent ray tracing, and Nvidia features at a slightly lesser price, the &lt;a href=""https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsearchpage.jsp%3Fst%3D4070%2Bti%2Bsuper%26_dyncharset%3DUTF-8%26_dynSessConf%3D%26id%3Dpcat17071%26type%3Dpage%26sc%3DGlobal%26cp%3D1%26nrp%3D%26sp%3D%26qp%3D%26list%3Dn%26af%3Dtrue%26iht%3Dy%26usc%3DAll%2BCategories%26ks%3D960%26keys%3Dkeys&amp;amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;amp;exclusive=1&amp;amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Farticle%2F2222156%2Fnvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-super-review.html&amp;amp;u1=2-1-2222156-1-0-0""&gt;$799 GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super&lt;/a&gt; is also worth considering now that it has 16GB of memory and a wider memory bus. It isn’t as fast as the 4080, obviously, but should still get the job done. Or if you want the ultimate gaming experience, there’s always the GeForce RTX 4090, though it’s priced at $1,600 and going for closer to $2,000 on the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;TechGage&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Averaged over the 25 games in our test suite, at 4K, we find the card only 1.5% faster than 4080 non-Super Founders Edition, which is MUCH less than expected. While NVIDIA never said &amp;quot;+5%,&amp;quot; I definitely expected more. It&amp;#39;s not a power limit issue, running at max power yields another +1% only. These numbers are pretty constant across resolutions, and even with RT enabled, too. Looking at the individual games, the differences are 1 or 2 FPS, nothing you&amp;#39;d ever notice subjectively. While that&amp;#39;s certainly a bit disappointing, the fact remains that RTX 4080 Super, just like the RTX 4080 non-Super, is a fantastic card for gaming. In a pure raster scenario, the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX is still a tiny bit faster, but NVIDIA&amp;#39;s card makes up for that with much better RT performance. Still, I feel like beating the XTX across the board was one of the goals of RTX 4080 Super, and NVIDIA failed here. In NVIDIA&amp;#39;s defense, the RTX 4080 Super leverages the full GPU, no units were held back, even though small additional gains could have been achieved with higher clock speeds and power limit. Compared to the RTX 4070 Ti Super, the performance uplift is 18%, the card is also 30% faster than RTX 4070 Ti non-Super. RTX 3080 Ti performance is roughly comparable to RTX 3090, which makes the gen-over-gen uplift a very solid 30%. NVIDIA&amp;#39;s flagship, the RTX 4090 is still the undisputed king of the hill, offering almost 30% better performance.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a closer look at our test results, most of the games are in the 1.5% range—it&amp;#39;s not that one game is 7% and the others are 0%, the gains are really small across the board. There is definitely some variations in GPU chip silicon quality, which affects performance due to the way NVIDIA&amp;#39;s Boost algorithm works, but with my sample size of 9 cards tested, I think that I can confidently say that there&amp;#39;s no way you&amp;#39;re getting +5% out of the 4080 Super, unless you manually overclock it. Other reviewers have similar numbers, so it&amp;#39;s not just me. Surprisingly, the RTX 4070 Super, initially considered the least exciting among the new releases on forums, showed the highest performance increase (+15%). In contrast, the RTX 4070 Ti Super, despite receiving a GPU upgrade and a 33% memory bandwidth increase, only saw a modest +5% in extra performance. Today&amp;#39;s release could almost be labeled a &amp;quot;rebrand,&amp;quot; but the improved pricing certainly adds to its appeal.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA has set an MSRP of $1000 for the RTX 4080 Super and that&amp;#39;s the real innovation here. Compared to the current $1200 for the RTX 4080 non-Super, this introduces a significant 20% discount. I have to applaud NVIDIA for that, especially, considering that there&amp;#39;s not much competition in this segment. AMD is happy with their $970 price point for the 7900 XTX, but that changes today. RTX 4080 Super at $1000 means that RX 7900 XTX becomes unsellable unless its price is lowered considerably. The RTX 4080 Super offers superior RT performance, similar raster perf and support for DLSS—exactly what people in the premium segment are looking for. Even at $900 I&amp;#39;m not sure if I&amp;#39;d prefer 7900 XTX over a $1000 4080 Super, it&amp;#39;s just a 10% delta. Still, $1000 is definitely not a steal for the RTX 4080 Super and what it offers—the 2024 GPU market is still expensive. If you want to save a bit of money, probably the most interesting alternative is RX 7900 XT, which currently sells for $710, but is considerably slower, which means lower detail settings or upscaling, but there&amp;#39;s no DLSS on the card to help with that. NVIDIA has confirmed that the RTX 4080 non-Super is now end-of-life. You could potentially get a card at a good price; anything $950 and below is what I&amp;#39;d call &amp;quot;interesting.&amp;quot; If it&amp;#39;s higher, go for the Super model, also for its better resale value. If you really must have the best, then the RTX 4090 is what you want—that hasn&amp;#39;t changed with the release of the RTX 4080 Super, but be prepared to pay for it: +80% for an almost 30% increase in performance is tough. At the end of the day, RTX 4080 Super is disappointing in terms of the changes it brings, but it redeems itself thanks to its greatly improved pricing. While I&amp;#39;m sure there will be a lot of drama about the minimal gains, what the GPU market really needs is lower prices, not marginally better performance for the same price. In this regard, the RTX 4080 Super can be considered a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The FPS Review&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-super-review""&gt;Tomshardware&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia&amp;#39;s RTX 4080 Super can be summed up in just a few words: It&amp;#39;s like the RTX 4080, only less expensive. That&amp;#39;s not to say it&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;inexpensive&lt;/em&gt;, as it still costs over $1,000 (after taxes), but $200 cheaper is at least something. Meanwhile, the performance side of the story is a gigantic snorefest. The RTX 4080 Super does technically offer more performance than the RTX 4080, but only by about 2~3 percent on average. Even a piddly overclock of an RTX 4080 could improve performance at least that much.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were on the fence and trying to decide between AMD&amp;#39;s RX 7900 XTX and Nvidia&amp;#39;s RTX 4080, with the latter costing on average $200 extra, the RTX 4080 Super effectively wipes away the price difference. The only real reason to opt for a 7900 XTX now — barring any price cuts — is if you specifically want AMD&amp;#39;s top card, or you want any GPU that has more than 16GB of memory. Otherwise, the RTX 4080 Super is almost always the better option.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are exceptions, like a few rasterization games and certain professional applications, as well as workloads that need more than 16GB (but less than 24GB) of VRAM. If you&amp;#39;re specifically interested in one of those use cases, that&amp;#39;s fine, and AMD is still technically about $40 cheaper for the least expensive 7900 XTX cards. At the same time, you give up access to Nvidia&amp;#39;s DLSS features and potentially lose a lot of performance in other use cases. In other words, you &amp;#39;win&amp;#39; in a few specific cases and lose in a lot of other situations.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the RTX 4080 Super delivered precisely what we expected to see. It&amp;#39;s a cheaper and barely faster take on the RTX 4080. The price means it&amp;#39;s now in direct competition with AMD&amp;#39;s 7900 XTX, but either one still costs as much as an entire midrange gaming PC. It&amp;#39;s fine for what it is but doesn&amp;#39;t offer anything new other than a stealthier black aesthetic for the Founders Edition.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re in the market for a top-tier graphics card and can&amp;#39;t justify doubling the price and picking up an RTX 4090, the RTX 4080 Super now ranks as the second fastest GPU overall, and it&amp;#39;s cheaper than the existing 4080. It&amp;#39;s slightly faster and less costly than the 4080, but we were never particularly pleased with the $1,199 launch price of the 4080 in the first place. $200 represents a welcome and necessary price correction, and unlike the RTX 3080, which was generally selling at over $1,000 for the majority of its life cycle, the 4080 Super should at least be readily available.&lt;/p&gt;

——————————————————

*Talking points that the public might not care so much about:

1. Saving time, energy, and money (it’s more powerful to approach these points as a collective, not just as an individual. See next paragraph)

2. Being able to live outside of Sacramento for various reasons such as caring for a family member in need

3. Freeing up more time to address child care needs. (Be extra cautious when discussing your personal child care needs, as it could potentially become a weapon used against us)


Talking points that appeal more to the general public: 

1. Contributing to reduced traffic on the roads. This not only saves time for others but also minimizes emissions and pollution, which aligns with the [Visions of CalEPA](https://calepa.ca.gov/about/). (wink-wink)

Check out the [Telework Dashboard published by DGS](https://www.reddit.com/r/CAStateWorkers/s/AS7oJj2IcY). It shows how much telework is saving on emissions, hours commuted and related costs.

2. Saving taxpayers money. Not just small things like office supplies, equipments, or utilities, but potentially huge things like leases. This also aligns with the “goals” of DOF. (According to this [Sac Bee article](https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/the-state-worker/article283027878.html), DOF just announced an expenditure freeze that applies to everything from non-essential travel to printer replacements, and office supplies.)

(Wow, how much you care about “non-essential travel” at your expense! Us having to drive our laptop to work..)

3. Initiating a movement to transform commercial buildings across the state into housing and recreational structures could be one of the best solutions for the ever-rising homelessness issues. (See more details here: https://www.reddit.com/r/CAStateWorkers/s/eXYsaWrCLd )

4. Even if not repurposing these buildings, releasing more commercial estates to the supply market can bring down the rent cost for other businesses/lessees. Less rent = less $ to run a business = potentially less $ asked of end customers/taxpayers 

5. Allowing more individuals with disabilities to benefit from fully remote opportunities, thanks to reduced physical and accommodation barriers.

6. Removing barriers for Californian parents, especially women, to enter the workforce, as they are often constrained by their child's schedule. (An example of a seemingly small but highly realistic problem is the unfriendly drop-off and pick-up times at both public and private schools for working parents.)


Some additional responses to the “reasons for RTO:”

1. Contributing to the economy of downtown Sacramento. I believe the businesses in my area deserves my monetary support as well. After all, the sales tax I pay goes into the state's pocket, doesn't it?

2. Fostering collaboration. What types of collaboration cannot be achieved online? Does seeing a real face boost motivation at work? I'd say RTO will instead bring down the morale we've built up over the years of successful teleworking. Want in-person meetings or potlucks? Sure, schedule these base on needs, rather than enforcing set in-office days!
(Remember, they will likely not stop at 2 days per some insider info shared on this sub).

,Guildwars2,"TLDR: Webtool, that helps you reach the magic find cap.

[**Link to the Website**](https://magicfind.henahax.de/)  


I made a barebones Version of this tool 2 years ago to help my guild and myself reach our magic find caps for our opening envelopes session.  
It is based on the ""[maximizing magic find](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Magic_Find#Maximizing_magic_find)""-section in the official wiki.  


In reality, it ended up being more about being ~~cheaper~~ ""more efficient"" about our boosters, so they could collect even more dust until next year.  
I rewrote the tool recently as a learning project and I might as well share it.

It is based on the &amp;quot;&lt;a href=""https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Magic_Find#Maximizing_magic_find""&gt;maximizing magic find&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;-section in the official wiki.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, it ended up being more about being &lt;del&gt;cheaper&lt;/del&gt; &amp;quot;more efficient&amp;quot; about our boosters, so they could collect even more dust until next year.&lt;br/&gt;
I rewrote the tool recently as a learning project and I might as well share it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://github.com/Henahax/GW2-MagicFind-Checklist""&gt;Sourcecode&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck opening envelopes! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

## 5 Effective Baldness Treatments That You Can Trust

[Dermatology Centre in Sarjapur Road | SK Truderma](https://www.sktruderma.com/)

Hair fall is becoming more and more prevalent among men and women irrespective of age. Often, it starts with a few strands falling while combing, and before you know it you would be losing hair in clumps. In most cases, ignored hair fall leads to baldness.

For many years, baldness was thought to be irreversible. However, today, things have changed for the good. Baldness can also be reversed with the right treatment. Here are 5 advanced treatment options that you can consider for baldness by the Best Dermatology Centre in Sarjapur Road:

### PRP Therapy

Platelet-rich plasma therapy is a safe, non-surgical hair loss treatment that can successfully reverse the early stages of patterned hair loss or androgenetic alopecia in men and women.

During this procedure, the blood sample is collected and centrifuged to obtain [platelet-rich plasma](https://www.sktruderma.com/facilities/hair-care-services/prp-platelet-rich-plasma-for-hair-thinning/), which is later treated with activating agents to activate the growth factors present in it. This PRP with activated growth factors is injected into the affected area using microneedles.

Benefits:

* Activates the hair follicles and promotes hair growth
* Long-lasting therapy for hair loss
* Shows results in less duration
* Least side effects

### GFC Therapy

GFC therapy is a refined version of PRP therapy. It is one of the most trusted hair growth restoration techniques.

During this procedure, blood samples are collected and centrifuged to obtain a highly-effective Growth Factor Concentrate (GFC). GFC is later injected into the scalp using microneedles.

Benefits:

* Reduces hair fall and improves hair volume
* Stimulates hair growth in the safest way
* Optimum results due to a high concentration of appropriate growth factors
* Reduced risk of infections and other side effects

### Stem Cell Hair Transplant

Hair transplant is not a new treatment – however, stem cell hair transplant is. Stem cell hair transplant is a non-invasive and safe treatment for hair loss and baldness. This treatment uses the body’s own stem cells to restore hair growth.

During this procedure, stem cells are extracted from adipose (fat) tissue and concentrated before being injected into the scalp, where they can reverse hair follicle shrinkage and boost hair growth.

Benefits:

* Makes hair follicles thicker and healthier
* Improves hair volume
* The results are long-lasting
* Least scarring and pain and no serious side effects

### Laser Treatment

During low-level laser therapy, photons are irradiated into scalp tissues. This procedure has been shown to improve circulation and stimulate hair follicles, stimulating hair growth. It is found to be an effective [hair loss treatment in Sarjapur Road](https://www.sktruderma.com/hair-transplantation/) option for both men and women.

Benefits:

* Stimulates cell growth and restores hair growth
* Improves the hair volume
* Improves the overall appearance of hair
* Painless treatment with the least side effects

### Newly-researched Medications/ Supplements

There has been constant research happening in the field of hair growth medicine. A good number of bioactive compounds and phytonutrients with hair growth-promoting properties have been discovered in recent years. Minoxidil and finasteride are two medications approved by USFDA.

Phytonutrients like caffeine, phytosterols and specific phenolic compounds are found to be promising in restoring hair growth. If you want to know more about medications and supplements that can support hair growth, you can talk to your dermatologist.

Those were some of the advanced [treatments for baldness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77pYmgWCGbE&amp;list=PLWw1hcjzQCWJ456vL5Qg6YJVIgDjdKWgm) that you can consider. However, it is relatively easier to restore hair growth if you visit your dermatologist when you think you have a hair fall problem.

I’m a big fan of Maslow’s pyramid. If you’re not familiar check it out but the gist is you need to satisfy your basic building blocks before you’re able to ascend up the pyramid to self -actualization. So first thing to do: 

If you haven’t already book an appointment with a therapist. While friends and family may have good intentions they are not therapists and may give you bad advice. I truly believe every single person in the world can benefit from therapy.

Venture over to r/hobbies and sort through the top posts, there should be a link to over a thousand hobbies and their respective subreddits. Go through the list and subscribe to every single one that remotely interests you; while stamp collecting is great aim to pick at least several that will require you to get out of the house and socialize. The benefit here is twofold, firstly you won’t be ruminating on your recent breakup because you’ll be too busy practicing archery/ running/ yoga (great way to meet women by the way) and secondly you will become a much more interesting person mainly for yourself but with the added benefit of standing out from the rest of the guys around you. I can’t tell you how boring the majority of people are, but you won’t be, not anymore. 

Next, if you aren’t already start staying as active as you can be. While present you might be in a funk with little to no desire to leave the house, future you will be so thankful you put in that work when you did. Begin focusing on your nutrition, Dr. Rhonda Patrick has an amazing smoothie recipe that I drink everyday for all my nutritional needs without having to take any supplements. 

 Now that you’ve got your social/physical/health building blocks down it’s time to move onto mental. Head on over to r/podcasts and search for a list of the most interesting ones. I started listening to Invisibilia on my commute to work and wow I didn’t think a podcast was capable of stimulating my mind so much and giving me so many talking points with friends and coworkers. 

Every morning devote time to meditating and just taking it all in. The Japanese have a concept called forest bathing which researchers have proven helps boost your mood, aim to spend as much time in nature as you can.

Focus on your sleep patterns and adequate sunlight/Vitamin D intake.

Journal as frequently as possible, you will see how relieving it is to take your thoughts to paper with no judgment. 

Create an active document on your phone (I like to use Notepad) with subcategories and bullet points under each one : Important Things/ Fun Things both short term and long term and see how good it feels to check off the bullet points at the end of a succcesful, productive day. 

If you’re still feeling lost, the Japanese have another useful concept known as Ikigai; research it and fill out the Venn diagram to see how you can truly achieve self-improvement.

&lt;p&gt;Create an active document on your phone (I like to use Notepad) with subcategories and bullet points under each one : Important Things/ Fun Things both short term and long term and see how good it feels to check off the bullet points at the end of a succcesful, productive day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re still feeling lost, the Japanese have another useful concept known as Ikigai; research it and fill out the Venn diagram to see how you can truly achieve self-improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do all this consistently and marvel at who you were, who you are and who you’re becoming!&lt;/p&gt;

,korea,"A supporter sent me a copy of an extremely interesting wartime propaganda book published in April 1944 by the Imperial Japanese colonial regime which ruled Korea at the time. The 80-page book entitled '新しき朝鮮' (The New Korea) was in remarkably good condition and clearly legible for something that was published 80 years ago. It appears to have been published by the Information Department of the Office of Governor-General [Koiso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuniaki_Koiso), who was arguably one of the most religiously fanatical of all the Governor-Generals who ever ruled Korea during the Imperial Japanese colonial period. As such, it is a very rare and important snapshot of the official propaganda that was imposed upon the Korean people as of April 1944, during a period of Imperial Japanese colonial rule when the intensity of Japanese-Korean Unification propaganda and [State Shinto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Shinto) religious propaganda reached their peak.

 'The New Korea' reads like a desperate appeal to the Korean people to rally them to the colonial regime's side, touting the accomplishments of the colonial regime since [Annexation in 1910](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan%E2%80%93Korea_Treaty_of_1910), including agriculture, industrial development, infrastructure, transportation, communications, military development, education, literacy, natural preservation, etc. Many of the arguments presented in this book about these accomplishments sound remarkably similar to modern Japanese far-right historical revisionist arguments defending Imperial Japanese colonial rule over Korea, which suggests that, perhaps, the propaganda published by the colonial regime in Korea was also used to indoctrinate people in mainland Japan.

However, the part of the book that diverges significantly from the modern Japanese far-right narratives is the Japanese-Korean Unification propaganda, which modern Japanese far-right activists generally feel embarrassed about and prefer to avoid as much as possible. The promotional book starts off with the following preface which rants a Japanese-Korean Unificationist historical narrative touting the historical links between Japan and Korea from ancient mythological times through the medieval period, highlighting the various times throughout history when Japan absorbed Korean migrants who eventually became naturalized Japanese people. It essentially politicizes Japanese-Korean history to justify the colonization of Korea by Imperial Japan. Thus, this preface, which was otherwise meant to be a morale booster for the Korean people in the midst of a desperate war, might have actually been highly offensive and demoralizing to Korean readers at the time. For example, I would guess that the passage which celebrates the disappearance of the Arirang, a beloved Korean folk song, would not have been well received by the Korean readership.

In his [February 1944 speech](https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/11jha67/the_korean_people_were_allegedly_descendants_of/), Koiso actually argued that the Korean people were descended from the Shinto god [Susanoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susanoo-no-Mikoto), but that line appears to have been quietly walked back in this April 1944 book. Nevertheless, Susanoo is still mentioned in this book to demonstrate the close connection between Korea and Japan. The historical narratives contained in the 1943 articles about [Buyeo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buyeo) ([April 19/20 articles](https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/129pyx2/buyeo_former_capital_of_baekje_was_used_by_the/), [April 21 article](https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/12gnbh7/tourist_groups_visiting_the_historical_sites_of/)) also appear to have made their way into this book in condensed form.

**Chapter One: Introduction**

**The Robust Frontline**

*""Can a country so sad be made, with its continuous mountains of red clay and bald hills?""*

As once lamented by a certain poet, the impression and sad reality of Korea, up to twenty years ago or even just a decade ago, was of reddish clay bald mountains and women in white clothes doing laundry. However, how has it changed? In the few decades that followed, not only did the bald mountains turn green, but the rapid transformation of world history and the leap forward in the construction of the [Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_East_Asia_Co-Prosperity_Sphere) under the Imperial Japanese guidance, leading the billion people of Asia, has completely changed Korea. Korea has risen up as a part of this grand holy work, being nurtured as a logistic base for our continental operations, altering not only its robust appearance but even the very nature of the Korean Peninsula.

Instead of the women in white clothes who once made laundry their day's work, there are now sincere women of the ""Village Labor Service Corps"" under its flag, unwaveringly pulling weeds in the fields and cleaning Shinto shrines. In place of the sorrowful melody of ""[Arirang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arirang)"" flowing through the streets at dusk, brave military songs now march through the cities, accompanied by the firm footsteps of the youth corps. The once desolate hills on the outskirts have been cultivated into factories spewing black smoke from their chimneys. The remaining red clay mountains with their layers are now the battlegrounds for important underground resource development, tirelessly striving day and night for the annihilation of Britain and America. Students and youths, who once lost sight of their hopes in a blurred vision and recklessly sought the opium of misguided thoughts, have now had their souls cleansed by the fierce waves of the holy war. For the first time, they find infinite hope in offering their blood for loyalty only as Japanese people, enjoying the pride of being a leading core nation among the billion people of East Asia. Holding onto the excitement of the day when conscription was announced, they continue to diligently train day and night, preparing for the day they are called, to achieve the honorable position promised to them in the future through their efforts and the fulfillment of their noble duties.

What would the poet who once called Korea a ""sad country"" now write, facing the fierce spirit and robust reality of this fighting Korea?

Korea is advancing. Its sole goal is ""Together with the endless development of Imperial Japan.""

Korea is advancing. Let us momentarily lend our ears to the powerful, majestic, and tidal-like advancing footsteps of the 26 million compatriots.

**The Relationship between Japan and Korea**

Without even needing to spread out a map, it is evident that Korea is a continental peninsula extending from the Japanese mainland across the [Genkai Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genkai_Sea) to the Asian continent and Manchuria. However, when examining the histories of both sides, it becomes clear how inseparably connected Korea and the Japanese mainland have been since the divine era three thousand years ago. From the Korean perspective, the true history of Korea arguably begins with its relationship with the Japanese mainland, rather than the adjacent Asian continent. Korea has grown under Japan's constant protection and has finally returned to the bosom of its nurturing parent.

**The legend is well-known…** The tale of [Susanoo-no-Mikoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susanoo-no-Mikoto) in the ""[Nihon Shoki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihon_Shoki)"" is famous. Susanoo, banished from [Takamagahara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takamagahara), descended to the land of [Silla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silla) with his son, [Isotakeru](https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Isotakeru.html), and lived in Soshimori. Later, he crafted a boat from clay and crossed the Eastern Sea to reach the land of [Izumo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izumo_Province) (Regarding the location of Soshimori, there are two theories based on the pronunciation in Korean: one places it at [Mount Udu](http://www.koreasanha.net/san/udu.htm) in [Chuncheon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuncheon), Gangwon Province, and the other at [Seorabeol](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%84%9C%EB%9D%BC%EB%B2%8C), i.e., [Gyeongju](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeongju) in North Gyeongsang Province, which was once the capital of Silla). [Shinra Myōjin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinra_My%C5%8Djin) of [Ōtsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Ctsu), revered by [Shinra Saburō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minamoto_no_Yoshimitsu) who is known as the ancestor of the [Kai Genji](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%94%B2%E6%96%90%E6%BA%90%E6%B0%8F) warrior class in our country, is said to have worshipped [Manjushri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manjushri), who is said to have been Susanoo himself.

Furthermore, the [land dragging legend](https://www.japanesewiki.com/literature/Kunibiki%20Shinwa%20(Land%20dragging%20myth).html), as found in Japan's oldest geographical record, the ""[Izumo Fudoki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fudoki),"" is well known. It is also widely known that in the era following [Emperor Suinin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Suinin), a prince of [Silla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silla) named [Amenohiboko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amenohiboko), yearning for the holy land of Japan, abdicated his throne to his younger brother, came to Japan, and settled in the province of [Tajima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajima_Province). Similarly, Korea has many legends like this. One interesting story deeply related to the Japanese land dragging legend goes as follows:

This event occurred in the fourth year of the reign of [King Adalla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adalla_of_Silla), the eighth ruler of [Silla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silla). On the eastern coast lived a couple named [Yeonorang and Seonyeo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeonorang_and_Seonyeo). One day, Yeonorang went to the sea to collect seaweed and happened to climb onto a rock. This rock, with him on it, drifted all the way to Japan. The people of Japan, upon seeing him, declared, ""He is no ordinary man,"" and made him their king. Seonyeo, after waiting in vain for her husband's return, went to the shore and found his straw sandals left on the rock. The same rock then carried her to Japan, where she became the queen alongside Yeonorang.

However, after their departure, Silla lost the light of the sun and the moon and was plunged into darkness. It was said that the spirits of the sun and the moon, which had resided in the country, had departed for Japan. Consequently, the king of Silla urgently sent envoys to Japan to bring them back. But the couple refused to return, saying, ""Our coming here is a decree of the heavens."" Instead, they sent back a piece of silk fabric woven by Seonyeo, instructing that it be used to worship the heavens. When the envoys returned to Silla and conducted the celestial worship as instructed, the lost sunlight and moonlight returned as before. The place where this worship was performed was named Yeongilhyeon (영일현, 迎日縣).

**History Speaks…**

Beyond legends, the deep interactions between Japan and Korea, as clearly narrated by historical facts, have always been evident. Throughout the [Three Kingdoms period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Kingdoms_of_Korea), the [Unified Silla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Silla) period, the [Goryeo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goryeo) era, and up to modern times in Korea, it is apparent that the two have always had an inseparable relationship, akin to lips and teeth. This was not merely a diplomatic relationship bound by friendship or goodwill. Korea, constantly threatened by invasions from northern tribes on the continent, grew under the protection of Japanese power. Moreover, Japan's ideal of founding a nation encompassing all under heaven, with Korea solidly established as a forward base for continental operations, can be described as a relationship of shared destiny and blood ties.

For Japan, the Korean Peninsula has always been a bridge to the Asian continent. This is a geographical absolute, unchanged in the past and present. Now, as the grand project of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere steadily progresses, the Korean Peninsula's critical role as a logistic base is more apparent. It was natural for it to have played a role as the sole route of influx during the era of absorbing continental culture. Moreover, the direct and significant influence of Korea on Japanese customs, thoughts, industries, arts, and other aspects of life is an undeniable fact, evident without needing extensive evidence. Japan assimilated and digested these cultures on the basis of its consistent traditions, creating a unique and magnificent culture of its own.

Meanwhile, this led to a continuous influx of cultural figures from the Asian continent and people yearning for the beautiful peace and divine nation of Japan, resulting in their naturalization. Among them, the largest number of naturalized citizens were Koreans, which seems only natural given the geographical relationship. Especially after the collapse of [Baekje](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baekje) and [Goguryeo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goguryeo), which had integral ties with Japan, many of their people who refused to submit to [Tang China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_dynasty) or Silla sought asylum in Japan. According to our records, initially, the naturalized people from Silla, Goguryeo, and Baekje were settled in the eastern regions. In the third year of the reign of [Empress Genshō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Gensh%C5%8D) (717 c.e.), 1,799 people from Goguryeo scattered across the [Kanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kant%C5%8D_region) and [Chubu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%ABbu_region) regions were relocated to Musashino (in [Iruma District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iruma_District,_Saitama), Saitama Prefecture), and the [Koma District](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%AB%98%E9%BA%97%E9%83%A1) was established. The leader of these people from Goguryeo, [Go Yak'gwang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koma_clan), was granted the surname ""Ō (王)"" by [Emperor Monmu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Monmu) and was subsequently enshrined as the Fifth Shirahige Myōshin. The [Koma Shrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koma_Shrine) still exists in that area, and its current chief priest is the fifty-seventh descendant of Go Yak'gwang.

Furthermore, there are over 300 place names in mainland Japan named after these naturalized residents, and a considerable number of shrines are believed to enshrine Koreans. In the early [Heian period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heian_period), in the sixth year of [Emperor Saga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Saga)'s reign (815 c.e.), the newly compiled ""[Shinsen Shojiroku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsen_Sh%C5%8Djiroku)"" was created by Imperial command. It compiled the genealogies of 1,177 distinguished families in both capitals and the five provinces of [Kinai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinai). At that time, genealogies were broadly classified into three categories: [Imperial descent](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%9A%87%E5%88%A5) (descendants of emperors), [divine descent](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A5%9E%E5%88%A5) (descendants of deities from the age of the gods, excluding Imperial family members), and [foreign descent](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%AB%B8%E8%95%83) (naturalized people). Among these 1,177 families, the fact that 326 were of foreign descent illustrates how naturalized citizens were favored in our country. This shows that there have been many descendants of naturalized Koreans among the well-known figures of our country, from ancient times to the present.

**第一章 序説**

**逞しき前線**

禿山の赤土山の山つづき悲しき国をつくれるものかな

曾て某歌人が嘆いた如く、赭土色の禿山と洗濯する白衣婦人、これが二十年前或は十数年前までの朝鮮の印象であり悲しい現実でもあった。それがどうであろうか、其の後僅か十数年の時の流れが単に禿山を緑と化したばかりでなく、急激に転換する世界歴史の飛躍は、御稜威の下アジア十億の民を率いて起つ皇国日本の大東亜共栄圏建設という大いなる聖業の進展と共に、その一環として起ち上がった朝鮮を我が大陸経営の兵站基地として育て上げ、今やその逞しい姿だけでなく半島朝鮮の性格そのものまでも一変してしまったのである。

そこには洗濯を一日の仕事とした白衣婦人の代りに「部落勤労奉仕隊」旗の下に田の草取りや神祠の清掃にわき目もふらぬ婦人達の真摯な姿があり、また黄昏の街を流れるアリランの哀調に代って勇壮な軍歌が、青年隊の大地をしっかと踏みしめる靴音と共に市街を行進してゆく。郊外の荒廃した丘陵は切り拓かれて工場の煙突が黒々と煙を吐き、所々に残る赤土山の断層は、日夜ひたすら米英撃滅を目ざして敢闘する重要地下資源開発の生産戦場なのだ。曾ては自らの希望を混濁せる視野の中に見失い、誤れる思想の阿片を自棄的に求めた学生層と青少年達は、いま烈しい聖戦の荒浪に魂を洗われ、はじめて日本人として殉忠の血を捧げることによってのみ東亜十億の指導的中核民族たるの誇りを享受し得るという無限の希望を見出し、将来に約束されたその栄誉ある地位を自らの努力と貴い義務の遂行によって獲得すべく、徴兵制実施に爆発させたあの日の感激を其の儘しっかと抱いて、召される日に備えて日夜たゆみなき錬成に精進を続けている。

曾て「悲しき国」と詠んだ歌人は、今この戦う朝鮮の烈しい気魄と逞しい現実を直視して果してなんと詠むであろうか。

朝鮮は前進する。その目標はただ一つ「皇国日本の無窮の発展と共に」

朝鮮は前進する。堂々とそして力強い二千六百万同胞の潮のような前進の跫音に、我々はしばし耳をすまそうではないか。

**内鮮の関係**

改めて地図を拡げてみるまでもなく、朝鮮は日本本土と玄海灘を距てて満州大陸に続く大陸半島である。然しその両方の歴史を繙いてみるときに三千年前の神代から現在に至るまで朝鮮と日本内地とが如何に一体不離の関係に結ばれてきたか。それを朝鮮側からみるときは、真の朝鮮史は寧ろ陸続きの大陸より海を距てた日本内地との関係にはじまり、絶えざる日本の庇護の下に成長して今日遂に育ての親の懐にかえった、ということが出来るのである。

**伝説にきく．．．**日本書紀に見える素戔嗚尊の説話は余りに有名である。高天原を追われになった素戔嗚尊がその子五十猛神と共に新羅の国に下り、曾尸茂梨に居られたが、後更に埴土を以て舟を作り東の海を渡って出雲の国に赴かれたというのである。（曾尸茂梨の地については、現在朝鮮語の発音から江原道春川の牛頭山という説と、蘇那伐、即ち昔時新羅の都であった慶尚北道慶州という説と二つある）我が国武門の名家甲斐源氏の祖として知られる新羅三郎が尊崇した大津の新羅明神は、この素戔嗚尊の本身文珠大士を祀ったものといわれる。

また日本で最も古い地理書である出雲風土記に見える国引の伝説や、垂仁天皇の後世新羅王子天日槍が、聖天子の国日本にあこがれて王位を弟に譲って来朝し、但馬の国に住んだという話は既に広く知られているが、一方朝鮮にもこれに似た伝説は可なり多い。その一つに、日本側の国引説と深い関係ある次のような興味ある話が伝えられている。

新羅の第八代阿達羅王の四年のことである。東海の浜に延烏郎、細烏女という夫婦が住んでいた。延烏郎はある日海に藻をとりに行った時ちょっと巌の上に乗ったところがその巌が彼を乗せた儘日本に行ってしまった。日本の人達は彼をみて「これは尋常な人ではない」と言ってその土地の王様にしてしまった。細烏女はいくら待っても夫が帰って来ないので海辺に行って見ると巌の上に夫の草鞋が脱いであった。その巌は亦彼女を日本に居る延烏郎の許に運び、細烏女はそこで王妃になった。ところがこの二人が去ると新羅は日や月の光がなくなり真っ暗になってしまった。その時「この国にあった日や月の精が日本に去ってしまったからだ」と言う者があったので、新羅の王は早速使を日本にやって二人を帰らせようとした。然し二人は「自分がここに来たのは天の命である」と言って遂に帰らず、細烏女の織った絹の布を渡して、これで天を祭るように言った。そこで使は新羅に帰ってこの旨を王に復命して言われた通りに天を祭ると、失われた日や月はまたもとの如く光り明るくなった。その祭った所を迎日県と名付けた。

**歴史は語る．．．**伝説以後に於ける日本と朝鮮の深い交渉は史実が判然りと物語る通り、三国時代、新羅一統時代、高麗時代を経て近世朝鮮に至るまで、その間幾多波瀾消長こそあれいつの時代を通じてみても常に両者は唇歯の関係にあったことは明らかである。それは単なる友好とか親善とかいう外交的関係に結ばれたものではなく、絶えず大陸からの北方民族の侵略に脅かされる朝鮮が、日本勢力の庇護によって生長し、また八紘を掩うて宇と為す日本肇国の理想が、その大陸経営の前進基地として朝鮮に確固たる根拠を置いたところの所謂同生共死の関係に結ばれた血縁であるといえる。

日本にとって朝鮮半島は大陸へのかけ橋である。これは昔も今も変わらない地理的絶対条件である。大東亜共栄圏建設の大事業が着々と進展する現在、その兵站基地たる重大使命を果たしつつある半島が、曾つて大陸文化の吸収時代にその唯一の流入ルートとしての役割を有したことはむしろ当然であろう。そして日本の風俗、思想、産業、芸術その他生活様式の一切に亙って朝鮮が直接的に大きな影響をもたらしたことは、幾多の考証を持ち出すまでもなく動かすことの出来ぬ事実である、日本は一貫する伝統の上にこれらの文化を摂取咀嚼し日本化することによって一つの偉大な日本固有の文化をつくり上げ、それを身につけたのであった。

一方これは大陸の文化人と、美しい平和と神の国日本に憧れる人々の続々たる来朝となり、その帰化をもたらした。その中でも朝鮮人の帰化者が最も多数を占めたことは、地理的関係からむしろ当然であろう。特に日本と一体的関係にあった百済や高句麗の滅亡後、唐や新羅に服することを潔としないその遺民が日本に亡命する者が多かった。我が国の記録によると新羅、高句麗、百済の帰化人を最初東国地方におかれたが、元正天皇の霊亀三年（1377年）には関東、中部地方に散在する高句麗人千七百九十九人を武蔵野（埼玉県入間郡）に移して高麗郡を建てさせたとある。この高麗人の統率者であった人が、文武天皇から「王」という姓を賜わり、従五位下白髭明神として祀られる王若光で、その地には今も高麗神社があり、現在同神社の神主は王若光より五十七代の後裔に当る。

この他内地各地には、これら帰化人の住んだことに因んで名付けられた地名が三百を超え、朝鮮人を祀ったと考えられる神社も相当にある。

また平安朝時代の初め、嵯峨天皇の弘仁六年（1475年）に勅命によって出来た新撰姓氏録は、左右両京及び畿内五ヶ国に籍を有する名家千百七十七氏が系図を作り、それを整理したものである。当時は系図を大別して、皇別（天皇より分かれたもの）、神別（神代の神々の後裔の内皇族を除いたもの）、諸蕃（帰化人）の三つとしていたが、その千百七十七氏の中、諸蕃が三百二十六氏を数えられることによっても如何に我が国に於いて帰化人が優遇されたかが判り、昔から現代に亙って我が国知名人に多数の帰化朝鮮人の後裔があるのである。

The 80-page book entitled &amp;#39;新しき朝鮮&amp;#39; (The New Korea) was in remarkably good condition and clearly legible for something that was published 80 years ago. It appears to have been published by the Information Department of the Office of Governor-General &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuniaki_Koiso""&gt;Koiso&lt;/a&gt;, who was arguably one of the most religiously fanatical of all the Governor-Generals who ever ruled Korea during the Imperial Japanese colonial period. As such, it is a very rare and important snapshot of the official propaganda that was imposed upon the Korean people as of April 1944, during a period of Imperial Japanese colonial rule when the intensity of Japanese-Korean Unification propaganda and &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Shinto""&gt;State Shinto&lt;/a&gt; religious propaganda reached their peak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;#39;The New Korea&amp;#39; reads like a desperate appeal to the Korean people to rally them to the colonial regime&amp;#39;s side, touting the accomplishments of the colonial regime since &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan%E2%80%93Korea_Treaty_of_1910""&gt;Annexation in 1910&lt;/a&gt;, including agriculture, industrial development, infrastructure, transportation, communications, military development, education, literacy, natural preservation, etc. Many of the arguments presented in this book about these accomplishments sound remarkably similar to modern Japanese far-right historical revisionist arguments defending Imperial Japanese colonial rule over Korea, which suggests that, perhaps, the propaganda published by the colonial regime in Korea was also used to indoctrinate people in mainland Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the part of the book that diverges significantly from the modern Japanese far-right narratives is the Japanese-Korean Unification propaganda, which modern Japanese far-right activists generally feel embarrassed about and prefer to avoid as much as possible. The promotional book starts off with the following preface which rants a Japanese-Korean Unificationist historical narrative touting the historical links between Japan and Korea from ancient mythological times through the medieval period, highlighting the various times throughout history when Japan absorbed Korean migrants who eventually became naturalized Japanese people. It essentially politicizes Japanese-Korean history to justify the colonization of Korea by Imperial Japan. Thus, this preface, which was otherwise meant to be a morale booster for the Korean people in the midst of a desperate war, might have actually been highly offensive and demoralizing to Korean readers at the time. For example, I would guess that the passage which celebrates the disappearance of the Arirang, a beloved Korean folk song, would not have been well received by the Korean readership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/11jha67/the_korean_people_were_allegedly_descendants_of/""&gt;February 1944 speech&lt;/a&gt;, Koiso actually argued that the Korean people were descended from the Shinto god &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susanoo-no-Mikoto""&gt;Susanoo&lt;/a&gt;, but that line appears to have been quietly walked back in this April 1944 book. Nevertheless, Susanoo is still mentioned in this book to demonstrate the close connection between Korea and Japan. The historical narratives contained in the 1943 articles about &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buyeo""&gt;Buyeo&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/129pyx2/buyeo_former_capital_of_baekje_was_used_by_the/""&gt;April 19/20 articles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/12gnbh7/tourist_groups_visiting_the_historical_sites_of/""&gt;April 21 article&lt;/a&gt;) also appear to have made their way into this book in condensed form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Translation]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapter One: Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Robust Frontline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Can a country so sad be made, with its continuous mountains of red clay and bald hills?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As once lamented by a certain poet, the impression and sad reality of Korea, up to twenty years ago or even just a decade ago, was of reddish clay bald mountains and women in white clothes doing laundry. However, how has it changed? In the few decades that followed, not only did the bald mountains turn green, but the rapid transformation of world history and the leap forward in the construction of the &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_East_Asia_Co-Prosperity_Sphere""&gt;Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere&lt;/a&gt; under the Imperial Japanese guidance, leading the billion people of Asia, has completely changed Korea. Korea has risen up as a part of this grand holy work, being nurtured as a logistic base for our continental operations, altering not only its robust appearance but even the very nature of the Korean Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of the women in white clothes who once made laundry their day&amp;#39;s work, there are now sincere women of the &amp;quot;Village Labor Service Corps&amp;quot; under its flag, unwaveringly pulling weeds in the fields and cleaning Shinto shrines. In place of the sorrowful melody of &amp;quot;&lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arirang""&gt;Arirang&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; flowing through the streets at dusk, brave military songs now march through the cities, accompanied by the firm footsteps of the youth corps. The once desolate hills on the outskirts have been cultivated into factories spewing black smoke from their chimneys. The remaining red clay mountains with their layers are now the battlegrounds for important underground resource development, tirelessly striving day and night for the annihilation of Britain and America. Students and youths, who once lost sight of their hopes in a blurred vision and recklessly sought the opium of misguided thoughts, have now had their souls cleansed by the fierce waves of the holy war. For the first time, they find infinite hope in offering their blood for loyalty only as Japanese people, enjoying the pride of being a leading core nation among the billion people of East Asia. Holding onto the excitement of the day when conscription was announced, they continue to diligently train day and night, preparing for the day they are called, to achieve the honorable position promised to them in the future through their efforts and the fulfillment of their noble duties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would the poet who once called Korea a &amp;quot;sad country&amp;quot; now write, facing the fierce spirit and robust reality of this fighting Korea?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Korea is advancing. Its sole goal is &amp;quot;Together with the endless development of Imperial Japan.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Korea is advancing. Let us momentarily lend our ears to the powerful, majestic, and tidal-like advancing footsteps of the 26 million compatriots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Relationship between Japan and Korea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without even needing to spread out a map, it is evident that Korea is a continental peninsula extending from the Japanese mainland across the &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genkai_Sea""&gt;Genkai Sea&lt;/a&gt; to the Asian continent and Manchuria. However, when examining the histories of both sides, it becomes clear how inseparably connected Korea and the Japanese mainland have been since the divine era three thousand years ago. From the Korean perspective, the true history of Korea arguably begins with its relationship with the Japanese mainland, rather than the adjacent Asian continent. Korea has grown under Japan&amp;#39;s constant protection and has finally returned to the bosom of its nurturing parent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The legend is well-known…&lt;/strong&gt; The tale of &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susanoo-no-Mikoto""&gt;Susanoo-no-Mikoto&lt;/a&gt; in the &amp;quot;&lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihon_Shoki""&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; is famous. Susanoo, banished from &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takamagahara""&gt;Takamagahara&lt;/a&gt;, descended to the land of &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silla""&gt;Silla&lt;/a&gt; with his son, &lt;a href=""https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Isotakeru.html""&gt;Isotakeru&lt;/a&gt;, and lived in Soshimori. Later, he crafted a boat from clay and crossed the Eastern Sea to reach the land of &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izumo_Province""&gt;Izumo&lt;/a&gt; (Regarding the location of Soshimori, there are two theories based on the pronunciation in Korean: one places it at &lt;a href=""http://www.koreasanha.net/san/udu.htm""&gt;Mount Udu&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuncheon""&gt;Chuncheon&lt;/a&gt;, Gangwon Province, and the other at &lt;a href=""https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%84%9C%EB%9D%BC%EB%B2%8C""&gt;Seorabeol&lt;/a&gt;, i.e., &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeongju""&gt;Gyeongju&lt;/a&gt; in North Gyeongsang Province, which was once the capital of Silla). &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinra_My%C5%8Djin""&gt;Shinra Myōjin&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Ctsu""&gt;Ōtsu&lt;/a&gt;, revered by &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minamoto_no_Yoshimitsu""&gt;Shinra Saburō&lt;/a&gt; who is known as the ancestor of the &lt;a href=""https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%94%B2%E6%96%90%E6%BA%90%E6%B0%8F""&gt;Kai Genji&lt;/a&gt; warrior class in our country, is said to have worshipped &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manjushri""&gt;Manjushri&lt;/a&gt;, who is said to have been Susanoo himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the &lt;a href=""https://www.japanesewiki.com/literature/Kunibiki%20Shinwa%20(Land%20dragging%20myth""&gt;land dragging legend&lt;/a&gt;.html), as found in Japan&amp;#39;s oldest geographical record, the &amp;quot;&lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fudoki""&gt;Izumo Fudoki&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; is well known. It is also widely known that in the era following &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Suinin""&gt;Emperor Suinin&lt;/a&gt;, a prince of &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silla""&gt;Silla&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amenohiboko""&gt;Amenohiboko&lt;/a&gt;, yearning for the holy land of Japan, abdicated his throne to his younger brother, came to Japan, and settled in the province of &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajima_Province""&gt;Tajima&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, Korea has many legends like this. One interesting story deeply related to the Japanese land dragging legend goes as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event occurred in the fourth year of the reign of &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adalla_of_Silla""&gt;King Adalla&lt;/a&gt;, the eighth ruler of &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silla""&gt;Silla&lt;/a&gt;. On the eastern coast lived a couple named &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeonorang_and_Seonyeo""&gt;Yeonorang and Seonyeo&lt;/a&gt;. One day, Yeonorang went to the sea to collect seaweed and happened to climb onto a rock. This rock, with him on it, drifted all the way to Japan. The people of Japan, upon seeing him, declared, &amp;quot;He is no ordinary man,&amp;quot; and made him their king. Seonyeo, after waiting in vain for her husband&amp;#39;s return, went to the shore and found his straw sandals left on the rock. The same rock then carried her to Japan, where she became the queen alongside Yeonorang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after their departure, Silla lost the light of the sun and the moon and was plunged into darkness. It was said that the spirits of the sun and the moon, which had resided in the country, had departed for Japan. Consequently, the king of Silla urgently sent envoys to Japan to bring them back. But the couple refused to return, saying, &amp;quot;Our coming here is a decree of the heavens.&amp;quot; Instead, they sent back a piece of silk fabric woven by Seonyeo, instructing that it be used to worship the heavens. When the envoys returned to Silla and conducted the celestial worship as instructed, the lost sunlight and moonlight returned as before. The place where this worship was performed was named Yeongilhyeon (영일현, 迎日縣).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History Speaks…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond legends, the deep interactions between Japan and Korea, as clearly narrated by historical facts, have always been evident. Throughout the &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Kingdoms_of_Korea""&gt;Three Kingdoms period&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Silla""&gt;Unified Silla&lt;/a&gt; period, the &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goryeo""&gt;Goryeo&lt;/a&gt; era, and up to modern times in Korea, it is apparent that the two have always had an inseparable relationship, akin to lips and teeth. This was not merely a diplomatic relationship bound by friendship or goodwill. Korea, constantly threatened by invasions from northern tribes on the continent, grew under the protection of Japanese power. Moreover, Japan&amp;#39;s ideal of founding a nation encompassing all under heaven, with Korea solidly established as a forward base for continental operations, can be described as a relationship of shared destiny and blood ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Japan, the Korean Peninsula has always been a bridge to the Asian continent. This is a geographical absolute, unchanged in the past and present. Now, as the grand project of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere steadily progresses, the Korean Peninsula&amp;#39;s critical role as a logistic base is more apparent. It was natural for it to have played a role as the sole route of influx during the era of absorbing continental culture. Moreover, the direct and significant influence of Korea on Japanese customs, thoughts, industries, arts, and other aspects of life is an undeniable fact, evident without needing extensive evidence. Japan assimilated and digested these cultures on the basis of its consistent traditions, creating a unique and magnificent culture of its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, this led to a continuous influx of cultural figures from the Asian continent and people yearning for the beautiful peace and divine nation of Japan, resulting in their naturalization. Among them, the largest number of naturalized citizens were Koreans, which seems only natural given the geographical relationship. Especially after the collapse of &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baekje""&gt;Baekje&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goguryeo""&gt;Goguryeo&lt;/a&gt;, which had integral ties with Japan, many of their people who refused to submit to &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_dynasty""&gt;Tang China&lt;/a&gt; or Silla sought asylum in Japan. According to our records, initially, the naturalized people from Silla, Goguryeo, and Baekje were settled in the eastern regions. In the third year of the reign of &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Gensh%C5%8D""&gt;Empress Genshō&lt;/a&gt; (717 c.e.), 1,799 people from Goguryeo scattered across the &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kant%C5%8D_region""&gt;Kanto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%ABbu_region""&gt;Chubu&lt;/a&gt; regions were relocated to Musashino (in &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iruma_District,_Saitama""&gt;Iruma District&lt;/a&gt;, Saitama Prefecture), and the &lt;a href=""https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%AB%98%E9%BA%97%E9%83%A1""&gt;Koma District&lt;/a&gt; was established. The leader of these people from Goguryeo, &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koma_clan""&gt;Go Yak&amp;#39;gwang&lt;/a&gt;, was granted the surname &amp;quot;Ō (王)&amp;quot; by &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Monmu""&gt;Emperor Monmu&lt;/a&gt; and was subsequently enshrined as the Fifth Shirahige Myōshin. The &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koma_Shrine""&gt;Koma Shrine&lt;/a&gt; still exists in that area, and its current chief priest is the fifty-seventh descendant of Go Yak&amp;#39;gwang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/1dliq8gjlqfc1.png?width=999&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=08619a394ddc4cce5d29be9e57171646e2d6b150""&gt;Original Caption: \&amp;quot;During the fall of Baekje, it is said that two thousand court ladies, sharing the fate of the dynasty, threw themselves into the water like falling flowers at the Buyeo self-warming platform and Naghwaam Rock by the Baekmagang River.\&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/w89y8qkmlqfc1.png?width=570&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9d6a9de2a8af98ce988eea1333cd9f16584079c7""&gt;Original Caption: \&amp;quot;Buddhist Statue from the Baekje Era (Identical to the Baekje Kannon statue in Nara&amp;#39;s Horyuji Temple)\&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there are over 300 place names in mainland Japan named after these naturalized residents, and a considerable number of shrines are believed to enshrine Koreans. In the early &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heian_period""&gt;Heian period&lt;/a&gt;, in the sixth year of &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Saga""&gt;Emperor Saga&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s reign (815 c.e.), the newly compiled &amp;quot;&lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsen_Sh%C5%8Djiroku""&gt;Shinsen Shojiroku&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; was created by Imperial command. It compiled the genealogies of 1,177 distinguished families in both capitals and the five provinces of &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinai""&gt;Kinai&lt;/a&gt;. At that time, genealogies were broadly classified into three categories: &lt;a href=""https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%9A%87%E5%88%A5""&gt;Imperial descent&lt;/a&gt; (descendants of emperors), &lt;a href=""https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A5%9E%E5%88%A5""&gt;divine descent&lt;/a&gt; (descendants of deities from the age of the gods, excluding Imperial family members), and &lt;a href=""https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%AB%B8%E8%95%83""&gt;foreign descent&lt;/a&gt; (naturalized people). Among these 1,177 families, the fact that 326 were of foreign descent illustrates how naturalized citizens were favored in our country. This shows that there have been many descendants of naturalized Koreans among the well-known figures of our country, from ancient times to the present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Transcription]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;第一章 序説&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;逞しき前線&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;禿山の赤土山の山つづき悲しき国をつくれるものかな&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;曾て某歌人が嘆いた如く、赭土色の禿山と洗濯する白衣婦人、これが二十年前或は十数年前までの朝鮮の印象であり悲しい現実でもあった。それがどうであろうか、其の後僅か十数年の時の流れが単に禿山を緑と化したばかりでなく、急激に転換する世界歴史の飛躍は、御稜威の下アジア十億の民を率いて起つ皇国日本の大東亜共栄圏建設という大いなる聖業の進展と共に、その一環として起ち上がった朝鮮を我が大陸経営の兵站基地として育て上げ、今やその逞しい姿だけでなく半島朝鮮の性格そのものまでも一変してしまったのである。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;そこには洗濯を一日の仕事とした白衣婦人の代りに「部落勤労奉仕隊」旗の下に田の草取りや神祠の清掃にわき目もふらぬ婦人達の真摯な姿があり、また黄昏の街を流れるアリランの哀調に代って勇壮な軍歌が、青年隊の大地をしっかと踏みしめる靴音と共に市街を行進してゆく。郊外の荒廃した丘陵は切り拓かれて工場の煙突が黒々と煙を吐き、所々に残る赤土山の断層は、日夜ひたすら米英撃滅を目ざして敢闘する重要地下資源開発の生産戦場なのだ。曾ては自らの希望を混濁せる視野の中に見失い、誤れる思想の阿片を自棄的に求めた学生層と青少年達は、いま烈しい聖戦の荒浪に魂を洗われ、はじめて日本人として殉忠の血を捧げることによってのみ東亜十億の指導的中核民族たるの誇りを享受し得るという無限の希望を見出し、将来に約束されたその栄誉ある地位を自らの努力と貴い義務の遂行によって獲得すべく、徴兵制実施に爆発させたあの日の感激を其の儘しっかと抱いて、召される日に備えて日夜たゆみなき錬成に精進を続けている。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;曾て「悲しき国」と詠んだ歌人は、今この戦う朝鮮の烈しい気魄と逞しい現実を直視して果してなんと詠むであろうか。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;朝鮮は前進する。その目標はただ一つ「皇国日本の無窮の発展と共に」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;朝鮮は前進する。堂々とそして力強い二千六百万同胞の潮のような前進の跫音に、我々はしばし耳をすまそうではないか。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;内鮮の関係&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;改めて地図を拡げてみるまでもなく、朝鮮は日本本土と玄海灘を距てて満州大陸に続く大陸半島である。然しその両方の歴史を繙いてみるときに三千年前の神代から現在に至るまで朝鮮と日本内地とが如何に一体不離の関係に結ばれてきたか。それを朝鮮側からみるときは、真の朝鮮史は寧ろ陸続きの大陸より海を距てた日本内地との関係にはじまり、絶えざる日本の庇護の下に成長して今日遂に育ての親の懐にかえった、ということが出来るのである。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;伝説にきく．．．&lt;/strong&gt;日本書紀に見える素戔嗚尊の説話は余りに有名である。高天原を追われになった素戔嗚尊がその子五十猛神と共に新羅の国に下り、曾尸茂梨に居られたが、後更に埴土を以て舟を作り東の海を渡って出雲の国に赴かれたというのである。（曾尸茂梨の地については、現在朝鮮語の発音から江原道春川の牛頭山という説と、蘇那伐、即ち昔時新羅の都であった慶尚北道慶州という説と二つある）我が国武門の名家甲斐源氏の祖として知られる新羅三郎が尊崇した大津の新羅明神は、この素戔嗚尊の本身文珠大士を祀ったものといわれる。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;また日本で最も古い地理書である出雲風土記に見える国引の伝説や、垂仁天皇の後世新羅王子天日槍が、聖天子の国日本にあこがれて王位を弟に譲って来朝し、但馬の国に住んだという話は既に広く知られているが、一方朝鮮にもこれに似た伝説は可なり多い。その一つに、日本側の国引説と深い関係ある次のような興味ある話が伝えられている。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;新羅の第八代阿達羅王の四年のことである。東海の浜に延烏郎、細烏女という夫婦が住んでいた。延烏郎はある日海に藻をとりに行った時ちょっと巌の上に乗ったところがその巌が彼を乗せた儘日本に行ってしまった。日本の人達は彼をみて「これは尋常な人ではない」と言ってその土地の王様にしてしまった。細烏女はいくら待っても夫が帰って来ないので海辺に行って見ると巌の上に夫の草鞋が脱いであった。その巌は亦彼女を日本に居る延烏郎の許に運び、細烏女はそこで王妃になった。ところがこの二人が去ると新羅は日や月の光がなくなり真っ暗になってしまった。その時「この国にあった日や月の精が日本に去ってしまったからだ」と言う者があったので、新羅の王は早速使を日本にやって二人を帰らせようとした。然し二人は「自分がここに来たのは天の命である」と言って遂に帰らず、細烏女の織った絹の布を渡して、これで天を祭るように言った。そこで使は新羅に帰ってこの旨を王に復命して言われた通りに天を祭ると、失われた日や月はまたもとの如く光り明るくなった。その祭った所を迎日県と名付けた。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;歴史は語る．．．&lt;/strong&gt;伝説以後に於ける日本と朝鮮の深い交渉は史実が判然りと物語る通り、三国時代、新羅一統時代、高麗時代を経て近世朝鮮に至るまで、その間幾多波瀾消長こそあれいつの時代を通じてみても常に両者は唇歯の関係にあったことは明らかである。それは単なる友好とか親善とかいう外交的関係に結ばれたものではなく、絶えず大陸からの北方民族の侵略に脅かされる朝鮮が、日本勢力の庇護によって生長し、また八紘を掩うて宇と為す日本肇国の理想が、その大陸経営の前進基地として朝鮮に確固たる根拠を置いたところの所謂同生共死の関係に結ばれた血縁であるといえる。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;日本にとって朝鮮半島は大陸へのかけ橋である。これは昔も今も変わらない地理的絶対条件である。大東亜共栄圏建設の大事業が着々と進展する現在、その兵站基地たる重大使命を果たしつつある半島が、曾つて大陸文化の吸収時代にその唯一の流入ルートとしての役割を有したことはむしろ当然であろう。そして日本の風俗、思想、産業、芸術その他生活様式の一切に亙って朝鮮が直接的に大きな影響をもたらしたことは、幾多の考証を持ち出すまでもなく動かすことの出来ぬ事実である、日本は一貫する伝統の上にこれらの文化を摂取咀嚼し日本化することによって一つの偉大な日本固有の文化をつくり上げ、それを身につけたのであった。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;一方これは大陸の文化人と、美しい平和と神の国日本に憧れる人々の続々たる来朝となり、その帰化をもたらした。その中でも朝鮮人の帰化者が最も多数を占めたことは、地理的関係からむしろ当然であろう。特に日本と一体的関係にあった百済や高句麗の滅亡後、唐や新羅に服することを潔としないその遺民が日本に亡命する者が多かった。我が国の記録によると新羅、高句麗、百済の帰化人を最初東国地方におかれたが、元正天皇の霊亀三年（1377年）には関東、中部地方に散在する高句麗人千七百九十九人を武蔵野（埼玉県入間郡）に移して高麗郡を建てさせたとある。この高麗人の統率者であった人が、文武天皇から「王」という姓を賜わり、従五位下白髭明神として祀られる王若光で、その地には今も高麗神社があり、現在同神社の神主は王若光より五十七代の後裔に当る。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;この他内地各地には、これら帰化人の住んだことに因んで名付けられた地名が三百を超え、朝鮮人を祀ったと考えられる神社も相当にある。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;また平安朝時代の初め、嵯峨天皇の弘仁六年（1475年）に勅命によって出来た新撰姓氏録は、左右両京及び畿内五ヶ国に籍を有する名家千百七十七氏が系図を作り、それを整理したものである。当時は系図を大別して、皇別（天皇より分かれたもの）、神別（神代の神々の後裔の内皇族を除いたもの）、諸蕃（帰化人）の三つとしていたが、その千百七十七氏の中、諸蕃が三百二十六氏を数えられることによっても如何に我が国に於いて帰化人が優遇されたかが判り、昔から現代に亙って我が国知名人に多数の帰化朝鮮人の後裔があるのである。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captions：&lt;/p&gt;

,IntegrityFrontline,"Title: The Clock's Ticking: Why Every Second Counts to Unite Against Trumpism 🕰️✊

Hey fellow advocates for change! 👋 You and I? We've seen the headlines, shook our heads in disbelief, and wondered: what's it gonna take? Enough is enough - it’s time to amplify our voice against Trumpism.

🚫📣 Picture this: Elections right around the corner. The sound of Trump's rhetoric echoes across the nation. But here's where we take a stand. Unity is our arsenal and every upvote, every share, every discussion we spark here is a ripple that turns to a wave. 🌊

Remember, we're not just a number scrolling through the feed. We're a force. Our engagement here is not a passive scroll, it's a ballot. It's a megaphone. It's a hug to someone out there feeling overwhelmed, hoping they’re not alone in this fight.

So let's make our stand count. 🗳️

- First, fact-check like a boss. Misinformation is their power; truth is ours. 💪📚
- Engage with content that shares our goal - comment to boost it, share to spread it. 👥💬
- Create and upvote threads that dissect policies, not people. Policies can be changed. 📃✅
- Volunteer, canvas, get involved in local elections. Trust me, every little local win adds up to a big national impact. 🗺️🏆
- And when it gets tough, remember why you started. You started because you believe in a future that celebrates diversity, inclusion, decency. 🌈🤝

#NoMoreTrumpChaos is more than a hashtag; it's the soundtrack of our movement. Each comment, each story, each meme that you share dusts off a little more darkness and shines a little more light. Don’t let it be drowned out.

And yes, humor is a weapon. 💣🤣 Deploy it wisely to expose the absurdity and lighten the battle-weary heart. But let's not forget our greatest armor of all - empathy. It bridges divides and reminds us We. Are. Not. Alone.

As you gear up to hit upvote or dive into the comments, imagine each interaction here is a cheer in a stadium full of kindred spirits (because it is). 🏟️ Your voice? Louder than you think. Your impact? More significant than you know.

So, ready to crank up our collective volume? Ready to transform angst into action? It's not just about stopping one man; it’s about safeguarding our tomorrow. And guess what - future generations are counting on us. Let’s not let them down.

Stand up. Speak out. Stay strong. We got this - together. 💪👐 #TogetherAgainstTrumpism #ActNow

P.S. Remember to shout out your local heroes, movements, and organizations combating Trumpism in the trenches. Let's give them the love and signal boost they deserve. 💖📢",t2_opcdxrh3f,False,,0,False,"""Join the Countdown: United Action to Dismantle Trumpism Before the Next Election Cycle""",[],r/IntegrityFrontline,False,,,0.0,,,True,t3_1afd161,False,dark,1.0,,public,1.0,0.0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,,1706689028.0,text,,,,text,self.IntegrityFrontline,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Title: The Clock&amp;#39;s Ticking: Why Every Second Counts to Unite Against Trumpism 🕰️✊&lt;/p&gt;

,Ryan_PapaDigi,"Twitter views are the number of times a video is played on Twitter.

Twitter Views are not the same as likes and retweets, which can be a great way to spread awareness about your brand or product. If you have an effective marketing strategy, however, it’s important to know how many people actually watched your video instead of just liking it and sharing it with their friends (which may or may not result in actual sales).

Twitter Views only count videos that have been played at least once during the last 24 hours – so if someone watches a video multiple times within one day but doesn't watch again for another 24 hours then no new metrics will be collected from them!

# Why Buying Twitter Views Matters?

,u_os_ishmael,"Low morale is akin to the dying of a candle flame.

It leaves us, our work, and our team in a place of darkness.

I recall in my agency days, a typical grey morning in a bustling office, the silence was palpable, much like being at a funeral.

In this corporate landscape, heads were bowed, not in grief, but seemingly under the weight of an invisible burden. The usual buzz of collaboration had faded into a murmur of disconnection.

Here, in this space of grey cubicles and flickering fluorescent lights, a different kind of mourning was taking place — the slow, steady decline of workplace morale.

As I weaved through the maze of desks, echoes of a funeral I recently attended resonated in my mind. The emptiness you feel of loss, to me, seemed as if this office had lost its soul.

The vibrant energy that once fueled innovation and teamwork had dwindled to a mere shadow. It was a place where the glow of passion and motivation had been dimmed, not by a singular tragic event, but by a gradual, creeping sense of disengagement.

The journey to revitalize this space wasn’t unlike paying respects to a beloved departed.

It demanded recognition, remembrance, and a rekindling of something lost. In this case, it was the spark of employee engagement, workplace satisfaction, and the collective spirit of a team striving towards a common goal.

### Unspoken Words, Unseen Impact

In the realm of the workplace, unspoken words often cast a shadow as profound and mysterious as the unvoiced thoughts and feelings at a funeral. Just as mourners may carry unexpressed sentiments of love, regret, or remembrance, so too do employees often bear silent testimonies of discontent, aspirations, and unfulfilled potential.

This silent undercurrent can be as impactful as the eulogies left unsaid, the accolades never given, echoing in the halls like the quiet steps in a procession of mourners.

In an office where effective communication is absent, it’s akin to walking through a graveyard of missed opportunities and unrealized dreams. Each unexpressed word of appreciation or unacknowledged effort lingers like an unvisited gravestone, unnoticed but deeply felt.

The absence of open dialogue and feedback creates a void, much like the empty chairs at a memorial service, representing the presence of what could have been but isn’t.

This silence, heavy with unspoken words, is where morale begins to wither, much like flowers on a neglected grave. The vibrant colors of enthusiasm and commitment fade into the monochrome of routine and disillusionment. In this space, the very essence of what once invigorated the team’s spirit — recognition, validation, connection — slowly decays under the weight of neglect.

As leaders, the task before us is not unlike tending to a garden of remembrance. It calls for tact, an appreciation of the nuanced aspects of human nature, and a realization that, under the surface of routine chores and obligations, are the hearts and minds of people who long for validation and meaning in their lives.

We can bring the workplace back to life and revitalize it by providing it with the sunlight of open communication and the water of real feedback. This will allow the workplace to become a place of vibrancy, growth, and fresh purpose.

### Echoes of Improvement

To counter this, leaders and managers need to adopt morale improvement strategies.

This involves not just recognizing the problem but actively engaging in solutions that resonate throughout the team dynamics and workplace environment:

* **Foster Open Dialogue:** Create a culture where every voice matters. Promote candid conversations and pay attention to the worries of your staff. Similar to a finely tuned band, each individual contributes significantly to the song of success.
* **Regular Culture Surveys:** Conduct culture surveys to gauge the pulse of your organization. This is your radar in the fog, helping to navigate the complex dynamics of team morale and satisfaction.
* **Transparent Feedback Channels:** Establish transparent channels for feedback. Let your team know that their opinions are not just heard but valued. The vital link keeping the organization’s heartbeat alive is this open channel of communication.
* **Strengthen the company’s values:** Regularly remind your staff of the goals and core principles of the organization. Doing so will ensure that everyone is on the same page and moving in the same direction. You will be rekindling the team’s work ethos, and relighting its candle.
* **Personalized Motivation Strategies:** Understand what motivates each team member. Tailoring your approach to individual needs and aspirations can ignite a passion that burns brighter than any generic incentive.

### Our Actions and Words as Managers Have an Impact

It’s critical for leaders to keep in mind the power of their words and deeds. They have the power to boost morale or put it out of control.

It all comes down to fostering an atmosphere where workers are inspired, engaged, and respected. Imagine a place where the joyful celebration of group achievement and contentment takes the place of the quiet lamentation of disengagement.

In essence, revitalizing workplace morale is not just about fixing what’s broken. It’s about rediscovering and nurturing the very essence of what makes a team thrive. We’re aiming for a workplace that is more than a mere physical space. Any workplace can become a haven of collaboration, respect, and shared aspirations.

### Final Thoughts

The route to a more contented and successful team can be illuminated by efficient communication and sincere engagement tactics, just like a beam of sunshine might cut through the gloom of a funeral.

As we overcome these obstacles, let’s not forget the lessons learned and the journey undertaken.

The road to high morale is continuous and ever-evolving, demanding constant attention, care, and commitment. It is, after all, the very heart of what makes our lives and workplaces not just survive but thrive.

&lt;p&gt;It leaves us, our work, and our team in a place of darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recall in my agency days, a typical grey morning in a bustling office, the silence was palpable, much like being at a funeral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this corporate landscape, heads were bowed, not in grief, but seemingly under the weight of an invisible burden. The usual buzz of collaboration had faded into a murmur of disconnection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, in this space of grey cubicles and flickering fluorescent lights, a different kind of mourning was taking place — the slow, steady decline of workplace morale.&lt;/p&gt;

,NatureofPredators," Hey there guys! So, I'm going to try doing something different when it comes to writing NoA. I've been focusing on this Fanfic for a good while now. Almost 9 months, (What the fuck), and not on my on original work, simply because this is what you guys are enjoying. I mean, my original piece was made three months ago with no follow up. Like, what??? But I want to start working of me of piece as well, so I'll be alternating between NoA posts and Chains of the Veiled posts. Hopefully, I'll be able to get a new chapter out per every three days, but there might be some hiccups along the way. Also, I'm running into some internet troubles, so hopefully this doesn't cause too much issue. I'll see you guys later!  Love ya :)  

Thank you, u/SpacePaladin15, for the wonderful, (and depressing) world of Nature of Predators!

**Memory Transcription Subject:** Farkiv, Admiral of the Yotul Technocracy

**Date \[Standard Human Time\]:** January 5, 2137

“STAND FIRM! ALL GUNS BROUGHT TO BARE!!”

I shouted to the bridge, all stations hyper focused upon the task at hand. The vile that plague the point in space before us. The Kolshian fleet looming in a point in space not far from Leirn. It was a dreaded situation, to be presented with an extermination force. Of all scenarios, this is the one that I felt the most dreadful of… The possibility of such an engagement was always something which haunted me in the depths of my mind as it did with everyone. I refused to give them ground, nor would we… We were the mighty first fleet. 5,000 strong with Super Battleships, regular battleships, and swarms upon swarms of anti-munition and anti-capital corvettes acting as the defending screen for our main damage dealers. This strategy of symbiotic forces was put to the test. A test where failure cannot be tolerated…

For failure in a scenario like this is all but acceptable, for these feds do nothing but take and mold everything they find to fit their narrative… and I’ll die in battle before ever being caught speaking their stories. Their advance was unimpeded, for we had yet to build any defensive emplacements. We focused on our Navy… the ships which served as much as shields as they were swords. We’re lined up in a defensive manner, all in place to take on the Aggressors and halt their advances before they’re given the chance to move any closer to Leirn… I was scared to fail… I couldn’t fail, not with everything on the line.

They readied their first strike, a collective railgun blast, coordinated to remove us in a single strike. A very naive thing to believe would ever occur with the nature of our fleet, armor was our most prominent aspect. With the way it was angled at the bow and sloped along the length of the craft gave the larger ships the shapes of oversized hatchet heads, able to cleave through enemy ranks and tear through any strike force. They were coming to face us where we were the strongest. Like with human vessels, our ships were designed to take on multiple targets with a fair likelihood of success. Each of our vessels had targets set, and locked on, ready to return fire when they came into fair range. Each of our target locks were upon ships which seemed to target us in turn. Their railguns were fully charged but meant little with how ours operated in a way to outclass our opponents' armaments.

***“All ships FIRE!”***

I shout with confidence over the fleet channels, initiation of our guns entering the fire-at-will battle condition. Our targeting system was top of the line with the human’s assistance in production. A system which allowed us total target lock before our opponents. The hope was to strike at as many of their craft which were part of their forward assault vectors, trying to move in from multiple points in space. One by one, Chem-Rail weapons designed by my granddaughter fired projectiles from chemical explosions, projectiles which had their acceleration multiplied several times over through the usage of electromagnetic systems along the large barrels of each cannon. Whether the gun in question was an auto turret or 250mm canon, it shot shells which were all electromagnetically boosted, which served us well.

Shells littered the void space between the two forces, launched from our guns to pile through the brittle enemy ships. The targets of Priority were the ones charging the railguns for the first strike. Our goal was to mitigate the amount of damage they could cause with their initial strike by removing as many players as possible from the game. I watched as many of the enemy ships with charged railguns were driven into by kinetic slugs moving at over 2,000 kilometers per second. It didn’t matter how much more advanced their “superior shielding was” with speeds like that. Like with human ships, our cannons were able to one-shot the largest warships that this galaxy had to offer, those ships being our own. The technology they used, and the amount of it that we incorporated into such massive ships…

These were the most powerful ships we could ever conceive constructing. And all because of the help we received from the humans… to think, one of the most xenophobic species in the galaxy was more listening and understanding than those who came before… It was poetic and concerning all the same.

Kolshian forces were beginning to sustain heavy casualties from being impacted by such rapid moving shells yet were able to compensate concerningly quickly. They never had reaction times like this… Whenever one of their ships fell another began to charge its railgun. When seven fell seven more charged their cannons. They refused to have a weaker first strike and did the necessary actions to assure that every vessel we had would falter. When they entered proper firing ranges in order to strike, plasma light erupted from their lines, they seemed to avoid targeting our massive vessels and seemed all the more focused upon our corvettes… defensive corvettes and supporting craft.

It was only after I watched missiles and torpedoes from the federation launched in massive swarms… It was then that I realized the flaw in our symbiotic strategy between vessels. When one fell, it was destined that the other falter also. It didn’t matter how many guns we shot; they weren’t calibrated in order to handle anti munitions. They didn’t fire fast enough or had the necessary maneuverability. We slugged shells for as long as we could manage in order to make sure we took as many of them down before they could get their satisfaction. I’ll never tolerate Kolshian getting out of a fight unscathed. Unfortunately, it didn’t last long. Our ships began to rock and burst apart as multiple well-placed torpedoes and missiles met their marks, searing through space to us… Particularly me, and my ship. I watched as a missile came to strike directly at the area of the ship where the bridge was located underneath Armor…

…

**\[Simulation Complete. Condition: Catastrophic. Grade: Failure\]**

*Damn it…*

My subordinates and bridge crew groaned in disappointment as the screen which our cameras were displaying on the battlefield read the messages. I slumped into my chair, disappointed that it went so sour so quickly. I knew that we were at the point of simulating higher than normal difficulties, but this was just getting annoying to deal with. I rested my paws against my face, I was getting too old to be handling this kind of nonsense insanity. Insanity was doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results, and I hated how accurately such a piece of wisdom fit into such a puzzling situation. A situation of *genuinely competent strategy* from the federation.

*Fucking unlikely is what it was…* I grumbled in annoyance before having my object of attention turning to become the human stepping through the side door. He sighed and looked at me with sympathetic and understanding eyes. “Angry?” Justin asked, before I sighed in annoyance turning to him. I respond with, “More annoyed than anything else. Also angry, though more at this difficulty than anything! It’s just… the idea of dealing with tactically competent feds is both tedious and terrifying. They’re so reliant on their technology and greater numbers to just handle everything for them without actually thinking! It’s just so… wrong.”

The dark-skinned human seemed to huff in amusement, “Believe me I get it, the idea of feds being competent is so out of the ballpark it’s uncanny. But to prepare for the possibility is very much a need for the future. We need to adapt to enemy adaptations before they ever make them. Thinking ahead is one of the most important things we can do now, preparing for any possible engagements and strategies that we might need to counter.”

“But they never will, those Feds are traditionalists at heart! They’ll stick to what they think is true and proper no matter what reality tells them.” I said in a distasteful manner. Federation allied aliens were just pathetic to anything that was a genuine threat… especially to threats that were actually threatening to them, and not perceived like humans… at least originally. Now, they were scrambling to keep themselves together in combat situations with the humans. After the Farsul colony’s destruction, the Federation was most likely soiling themselves at the strategic play, destroying their shipyards.

Justin seemed to sigh as his disposition towards me seemed to shift to one of a more condoning manner. I tensed up at the sudden shift in behavior, as I was mainly used to the human commander all laid back when it came to me and other officials of similar rank to him. This was something I rarely, if ever see from this lackadaisical human. He spoke up, “I understand, but underestimating any enemy, no matter how stupid they might be is ignorant. Such oversights cannot be made in the threat of collapse. Confidence in thinking you understand your enemy ultimately builds a fragile foundation, which can falter and crumble the moment things change. You need to be ready for any and all strategies against you, for preparation of such a level, to be able to counter any and all advances… To have the ability to stand firm against your foe is invaluable. To understand their power, and what they’re capable of… to counter them effectively is one of the most important qualities you can possess. Remember, to not know your enemy, to not consider them capable, can lead to cataclysmic failure.”

… *Well then.* Hearing Justin talk like this definitely caught me off guard, but certainly let me open my eyes and realize all that I needed to hear. As much as I was ashamed to admit it, he was right. Thinking I understood them, it was a fatal error that I couldn’t risk making with everything on the line. I sighed, acceptant of the fact and nodding to Justin in understanding. His serious demeanor was quickly replaced by an easy-going smile that he usually wore upon his face.

“Alright then… you guys did well for the simulations today, we can cut things here. You guys want to go and relax? I managed to convince Gabriel to provide you guys with some hot chocolate as a reward for your recent victories in the simulators.” He said, which warranted quite the response from me and my subordinates. My crew jumped in joy at the idea, as we’ve grown accustomed to the drink since we first had it a few weeks back. I smirked, seeing my crew happily rushing out of the simulator to go get themselves a cup of that delicious drink. I knew that after this war was over, we’d ***need*** to open up trade with the humans to get the ingredients so we could make it ourselves.

I walked out of the simulator with Justin following behind me. He seemed to speak up, trying to strike small talk. “So, with such a serious simulation to end off on, did you realize any sort of flaws in your fleet’s formation and make up?” He asked, looking down at me in an awaiting manner. I dissuaded his comment with a tail flick before turning to respond. “Oh, don’t even start… You were watch us from the control center yourself. Knowing you, you were probably smirking like the goblin you are, based on what Gabriel has told me about you.” Justin simply laughed at the comment, taking the banter in stride before replying. “Fair… the idea of symbiotic strategizing is indeed a plausible concept, on paper at least… But it’s a chain that’s easy to break. You’re going to want to talk about your granddaughter about designing new ships to make it to where the links in your ranks aren’t so easily broken. Maybe make it to where weapon compliments are more diverse in their configurations? It’s clear that having a ship which is meant purely for anti-munition defense be so easy to take out… leads to other links being torn and broken.”

“Reinforcing our formation with more variety in weapons on our ships might be the wisest idea. Having each ship be more independent rather than being reliant on other vessels needed to perform optimally. I’ll talk to aggie about retrofitting our fleets’ weapons to be better dispersed.” I said, garnering a nod of affirmation from Justin as we made our way up to one of the private breakrooms. This room in question was one of the pristine areas of the human Shipyard, where officials were able to lounge around in a peaceful atmosphere. As Justin and I made our way into the lounge, we found Gabriel, the Yardmaster there as he seemed to partake in some Leisurely reading on his Holo pad. He wasn’t quick to take notice to us, only jumping out of his trance once Justin plopped down on the other side of the couch.

I sat just before the both of them on a chair opposite of the coffee table, I chuckled at Gabriel’s surprised awakening of his reading session. He seemed embarrassed at the fact, as Justin and I laughed at the fact. Even getting a little red in embarrassment before setting his book off to the side. “Just so you know. You’re not funny. You never will be.” He said, jabbing at the human commander. “Actually, I’m VERY funny… you’re just a bookworm bore.” Justine retorted in an equally jabbing tone. I could only chuckle as the two numbskulls started to go at it… Yet again…

From what Gabriel told me, He, Justine, and even Daniel were all friends in college. All of them are well acquainted with each other and are known to act like this out of the fact that they were friends. Treating each other like garbage despite their concern over each other. It was actually very endearing in a surreal sort of way. I simply chuckled as I reached over to the nearby counter to grab myself a cup of water. “So, how’d the simulations go today? Anything worth noting?”

I sighed, as I turned back to him after grabbing my cup. “Well, I certainly learned that we need to retrofit our fleet to be more attuned to independent ships… It’s clear that we need to have a bit of variety in our weapon’s compliments. Justin and I decided to go through one of the more difficult settings of the simulator, and it was much less of a park walk than I’d like to admit. It was my first actual loss in the Simulator, if you could believe it...”

“I can.”

“Fuck you.”

We laughed a good bit before returning to the topic of conversation. We often enjoyed this banter between ourselves, it was a good way of passing time, as well as just becoming better friends with each other. Justin spoke up again, “Putting yourself in more difficult scenarios is one of the best ways to learn. Sure, it can be difficult, but challenge is one of the most effective ways of gaining new experiences. Though, if you ask me, we’ve had more than enough challenges as of recent.” Justine spoke truth in both ways… Things have been far more difficult since humanity’s arrival into the stars.

Though, my current train of thought was interrupted when I heard a phone start ringing. I looked up at the two humans as they looked between themselves. Gabriel then looked down at his pocket, and reached to pull out his phone which was the source of the ringing. He swiped on the accept and held the phone up to his ears. “Hello?” He asked, before a flurry of frantic noises came through the other end, causing him to hold the phone away from him as the noise hurt his ears. He groans as he struggled to calm down whoever was on the other end of the line.

“Jesus Chri- CALM DOWN! Daniel, what the fuck is going on?!” He said as he got up and walked off to the side to continue the call. Daniel was the human shipwright who was working with my granddaughter, constructing designs for the Yotul’s fleets. Did… did something happen to Aggi!? If that was the case then i’d never be able to forgive myself. After a moment Gabriel spoke out to his human friend, in a rather loud and aggrivated manner. “You ***WHAT!?*** Are you insane?! You saw the kinds of ships she’s desgined already! Why would you give her material like that to work with!? Good God, I knew you were braindead, but this is just a new level!”

I was confused, yet so was Justine based on the looks we exchanged. I was lost from what the conversation pertained, and Justin simply shruged all the same. A moment later, Gabriel just snapped back over the phone. “Well that’s your problem then! You caused it, you’re damn well going to fucking fix it! You’re on your own here. So *good luck!”* He said before swiftly hanging up. Sighing in defeat as he pocketed away the phone, turning back to us. I could see a tired sense of fear in his eyes. No, not fear, dread. What he dreaded was likely to be resultant from the call he just recieved from Daniel. “What was that about? Is Aggi okay?” I asked, concerned for the safety of my granddaughter.

“Yes, Aggi is okay physically… though, I’m worried she’s beyond saving based on what Daniel did.” He said, looking off to the side in concern. Justin looked at me in interest before looking back at the Yardmaster. He sat upright before he asked, “What did that idiot Canadian do?” Gabriel seemed to sigh, before turning to answer.

“He… introduced Aggi to the Warhammer Franchise-”

**“HE WHAT?!?”**

…

*What’s Warhammer?*

Almost 9 months, (What the fuck), and not on my on original work, simply because this is what you guys are enjoying. I mean, my original piece was made three months ago with no follow up. Like, what??? But I want to start working of me of piece as well, so I&amp;#39;ll be alternating between NoA posts and Chains of the Veiled posts. Hopefully, I&amp;#39;ll be able to get a new chapter out per every three days, but there might be some hiccups along the way. Also, I&amp;#39;m running into some internet troubles, so hopefully this doesn&amp;#39;t cause too much issue. I&amp;#39;ll see you guys later!  Love ya :)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, &lt;a href=""/u/SpacePaladin15""&gt;u/SpacePaladin15&lt;/a&gt;, for the wonderful, (and depressing) world of Nature of Predators! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Transcription Subject:&lt;/strong&gt; Farkiv, Admiral of the Yotul Technocracy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date [Standard Human Time]:&lt;/strong&gt; January 5, 2137&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“STAND FIRM! ALL GUNS BROUGHT TO BARE!!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shouted to the bridge, all stations hyper focused upon the task at hand. The vile that plague the point in space before us. The Kolshian fleet looming in a point in space not far from Leirn. It was a dreaded situation, to be presented with an extermination force. Of all scenarios, this is the one that I felt the most dreadful of… The possibility of such an engagement was always something which haunted me in the depths of my mind as it did with everyone. I refused to give them ground, nor would we… We were the mighty first fleet. 5,000 strong with Super Battleships, regular battleships, and swarms upon swarms of anti-munition and anti-capital corvettes acting as the defending screen for our main damage dealers. This strategy of symbiotic forces was put to the test. A test where failure cannot be tolerated…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For failure in a scenario like this is all but acceptable, for these feds do nothing but take and mold everything they find to fit their narrative… and I’ll die in battle before ever being caught speaking their stories. Their advance was unimpeded, for we had yet to build any defensive emplacements. We focused on our Navy… the ships which served as much as shields as they were swords. We’re lined up in a defensive manner, all in place to take on the Aggressors and halt their advances before they’re given the chance to move any closer to Leirn… I was scared to fail… I couldn’t fail, not with everything on the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They readied their first strike, a collective railgun blast, coordinated to remove us in a single strike. A very naive thing to believe would ever occur with the nature of our fleet, armor was our most prominent aspect. With the way it was angled at the bow and sloped along the length of the craft gave the larger ships the shapes of oversized hatchet heads, able to cleave through enemy ranks and tear through any strike force. They were coming to face us where we were the strongest. Like with human vessels, our ships were designed to take on multiple targets with a fair likelihood of success. Each of our vessels had targets set, and locked on, ready to return fire when they came into fair range. Each of our target locks were upon ships which seemed to target us in turn. Their railguns were fully charged but meant little with how ours operated in a way to outclass our opponents&amp;#39; armaments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“All ships FIRE!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shout with confidence over the fleet channels, initiation of our guns entering the fire-at-will battle condition. Our targeting system was top of the line with the human’s assistance in production. A system which allowed us total target lock before our opponents. The hope was to strike at as many of their craft which were part of their forward assault vectors, trying to move in from multiple points in space. One by one, Chem-Rail weapons designed by my granddaughter fired projectiles from chemical explosions, projectiles which had their acceleration multiplied several times over through the usage of electromagnetic systems along the large barrels of each cannon. Whether the gun in question was an auto turret or 250mm canon, it shot shells which were all electromagnetically boosted, which served us well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shells littered the void space between the two forces, launched from our guns to pile through the brittle enemy ships. The targets of Priority were the ones charging the railguns for the first strike. Our goal was to mitigate the amount of damage they could cause with their initial strike by removing as many players as possible from the game. I watched as many of the enemy ships with charged railguns were driven into by kinetic slugs moving at over 2,000 kilometers per second. It didn’t matter how much more advanced their “superior shielding was” with speeds like that. Like with human ships, our cannons were able to one-shot the largest warships that this galaxy had to offer, those ships being our own. The technology they used, and the amount of it that we incorporated into such massive ships…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were the most powerful ships we could ever conceive constructing. And all because of the help we received from the humans… to think, one of the most xenophobic species in the galaxy was more listening and understanding than those who came before… It was poetic and concerning all the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kolshian forces were beginning to sustain heavy casualties from being impacted by such rapid moving shells yet were able to compensate concerningly quickly. They never had reaction times like this… Whenever one of their ships fell another began to charge its railgun. When seven fell seven more charged their cannons. They refused to have a weaker first strike and did the necessary actions to assure that every vessel we had would falter. When they entered proper firing ranges in order to strike, plasma light erupted from their lines, they seemed to avoid targeting our massive vessels and seemed all the more focused upon our corvettes… defensive corvettes and supporting craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was only after I watched missiles and torpedoes from the federation launched in massive swarms… It was then that I realized the flaw in our symbiotic strategy between vessels. When one fell, it was destined that the other falter also. It didn’t matter how many guns we shot; they weren’t calibrated in order to handle anti munitions. They didn’t fire fast enough or had the necessary maneuverability. We slugged shells for as long as we could manage in order to make sure we took as many of them down before they could get their satisfaction. I’ll never tolerate Kolshian getting out of a fight unscathed. Unfortunately, it didn’t last long. Our ships began to rock and burst apart as multiple well-placed torpedoes and missiles met their marks, searing through space to us… Particularly me, and my ship. I watched as a missile came to strike directly at the area of the ship where the bridge was located underneath Armor…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Simulation Complete. Condition: Catastrophic. Grade: Failure]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Damn it…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My subordinates and bridge crew groaned in disappointment as the screen which our cameras were displaying on the battlefield read the messages. I slumped into my chair, disappointed that it went so sour so quickly. I knew that we were at the point of simulating higher than normal difficulties, but this was just getting annoying to deal with. I rested my paws against my face, I was getting too old to be handling this kind of nonsense insanity. Insanity was doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results, and I hated how accurately such a piece of wisdom fit into such a puzzling situation. A situation of &lt;em&gt;genuinely competent strategy&lt;/em&gt; from the federation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fucking unlikely is what it was…&lt;/em&gt; I grumbled in annoyance before having my object of attention turning to become the human stepping through the side door. He sighed and looked at me with sympathetic and understanding eyes. “Angry?” Justin asked, before I sighed in annoyance turning to him. I respond with, “More annoyed than anything else. Also angry, though more at this difficulty than anything! It’s just… the idea of dealing with tactically competent feds is both tedious and terrifying. They’re so reliant on their technology and greater numbers to just handle everything for them without actually thinking! It’s just so… wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dark-skinned human seemed to huff in amusement, “Believe me I get it, the idea of feds being competent is so out of the ballpark it’s uncanny. But to prepare for the possibility is very much a need for the future. We need to adapt to enemy adaptations before they ever make them. Thinking ahead is one of the most important things we can do now, preparing for any possible engagements and strategies that we might need to counter.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But they never will, those Feds are traditionalists at heart! They’ll stick to what they think is true and proper no matter what reality tells them.” I said in a distasteful manner. Federation allied aliens were just pathetic to anything that was a genuine threat… especially to threats that were actually threatening to them, and not perceived like humans… at least originally. Now, they were scrambling to keep themselves together in combat situations with the humans. After the Farsul colony’s destruction, the Federation was most likely soiling themselves at the strategic play, destroying their shipyards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justin seemed to sigh as his disposition towards me seemed to shift to one of a more condoning manner. I tensed up at the sudden shift in behavior, as I was mainly used to the human commander all laid back when it came to me and other officials of similar rank to him. This was something I rarely, if ever see from this lackadaisical human. He spoke up, “I understand, but underestimating any enemy, no matter how stupid they might be is ignorant. Such oversights cannot be made in the threat of collapse. Confidence in thinking you understand your enemy ultimately builds a fragile foundation, which can falter and crumble the moment things change. You need to be ready for any and all strategies against you, for preparation of such a level, to be able to counter any and all advances… To have the ability to stand firm against your foe is invaluable. To understand their power, and what they’re capable of… to counter them effectively is one of the most important qualities you can possess. Remember, to not know your enemy, to not consider them capable, can lead to cataclysmic failure.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… &lt;em&gt;Well then.&lt;/em&gt; Hearing Justin talk like this definitely caught me off guard, but certainly let me open my eyes and realize all that I needed to hear. As much as I was ashamed to admit it, he was right. Thinking I understood them, it was a fatal error that I couldn’t risk making with everything on the line. I sighed, acceptant of the fact and nodding to Justin in understanding. His serious demeanor was quickly replaced by an easy-going smile that he usually wore upon his face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Alright then… you guys did well for the simulations today, we can cut things here. You guys want to go and relax? I managed to convince Gabriel to provide you guys with some hot chocolate as a reward for your recent victories in the simulators.” He said, which warranted quite the response from me and my subordinates. My crew jumped in joy at the idea, as we’ve grown accustomed to the drink since we first had it a few weeks back. I smirked, seeing my crew happily rushing out of the simulator to go get themselves a cup of that delicious drink. I knew that after this war was over, we’d &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to open up trade with the humans to get the ingredients so we could make it ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked out of the simulator with Justin following behind me. He seemed to speak up, trying to strike small talk. “So, with such a serious simulation to end off on, did you realize any sort of flaws in your fleet’s formation and make up?” He asked, looking down at me in an awaiting manner. I dissuaded his comment with a tail flick before turning to respond. “Oh, don’t even start… You were watch us from the control center yourself. Knowing you, you were probably smirking like the goblin you are, based on what Gabriel has told me about you.” Justin simply laughed at the comment, taking the banter in stride before replying. “Fair… the idea of symbiotic strategizing is indeed a plausible concept, on paper at least… But it’s a chain that’s easy to break. You’re going to want to talk about your granddaughter about designing new ships to make it to where the links in your ranks aren’t so easily broken. Maybe make it to where weapon compliments are more diverse in their configurations? It’s clear that having a ship which is meant purely for anti-munition defense be so easy to take out… leads to other links being torn and broken.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Reinforcing our formation with more variety in weapons on our ships might be the wisest idea. Having each ship be more independent rather than being reliant on other vessels needed to perform optimally. I’ll talk to aggie about retrofitting our fleets’ weapons to be better dispersed.” I said, garnering a nod of affirmation from Justin as we made our way up to one of the private breakrooms. This room in question was one of the pristine areas of the human Shipyard, where officials were able to lounge around in a peaceful atmosphere. As Justin and I made our way into the lounge, we found Gabriel, the Yardmaster there as he seemed to partake in some Leisurely reading on his Holo pad. He wasn’t quick to take notice to us, only jumping out of his trance once Justin plopped down on the other side of the couch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat just before the both of them on a chair opposite of the coffee table, I chuckled at Gabriel’s surprised awakening of his reading session. He seemed embarrassed at the fact, as Justin and I laughed at the fact. Even getting a little red in embarrassment before setting his book off to the side. “Just so you know. You’re not funny. You never will be.” He said, jabbing at the human commander. “Actually, I’m VERY funny… you’re just a bookworm bore.” Justine retorted in an equally jabbing tone. I could only chuckle as the two numbskulls started to go at it… Yet again…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what Gabriel told me, He, Justine, and even Daniel were all friends in college. All of them are well acquainted with each other and are known to act like this out of the fact that they were friends. Treating each other like garbage despite their concern over each other. It was actually very endearing in a surreal sort of way. I simply chuckled as I reached over to the nearby counter to grab myself a cup of water. “So, how’d the simulations go today? Anything worth noting?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sighed, as I turned back to him after grabbing my cup. “Well, I certainly learned that we need to retrofit our fleet to be more attuned to independent ships… It’s clear that we need to have a bit of variety in our weapon’s compliments. Justin and I decided to go through one of the more difficult settings of the simulator, and it was much less of a park walk than I’d like to admit. It was my first actual loss in the Simulator, if you could believe it...”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I can.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fuck you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We laughed a good bit before returning to the topic of conversation. We often enjoyed this banter between ourselves, it was a good way of passing time, as well as just becoming better friends with each other. Justin spoke up again, “Putting yourself in more difficult scenarios is one of the best ways to learn. Sure, it can be difficult, but challenge is one of the most effective ways of gaining new experiences. Though, if you ask me, we’ve had more than enough challenges as of recent.” Justine spoke truth in both ways… Things have been far more difficult since humanity’s arrival into the stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though, my current train of thought was interrupted when I heard a phone start ringing. I looked up at the two humans as they looked between themselves. Gabriel then looked down at his pocket, and reached to pull out his phone which was the source of the ringing. He swiped on the accept and held the phone up to his ears. “Hello?” He asked, before a flurry of frantic noises came through the other end, causing him to hold the phone away from him as the noise hurt his ears. He groans as he struggled to calm down whoever was on the other end of the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Jesus Chri- CALM DOWN! Daniel, what the fuck is going on?!” He said as he got up and walked off to the side to continue the call. Daniel was the human shipwright who was working with my granddaughter, constructing designs for the Yotul’s fleets. Did… did something happen to Aggi!? If that was the case then i’d never be able to forgive myself. After a moment Gabriel spoke out to his human friend, in a rather loud and aggrivated manner. “You &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;WHAT!?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Are you insane?! You saw the kinds of ships she’s desgined already! Why would you give her material like that to work with!? Good God, I knew you were braindead, but this is just a new level!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was confused, yet so was Justine based on the looks we exchanged. I was lost from what the conversation pertained, and Justin simply shruged all the same. A moment later, Gabriel just snapped back over the phone. “Well that’s your problem then! You caused it, you’re damn well going to fucking fix it! You’re on your own here. So &lt;em&gt;good luck!”&lt;/em&gt; He said before swiftly hanging up. Sighing in defeat as he pocketed away the phone, turning back to us. I could see a tired sense of fear in his eyes. No, not fear, dread. What he dreaded was likely to be resultant from the call he just recieved from Daniel. “What was that about? Is Aggi okay?” I asked, concerned for the safety of my granddaughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes, Aggi is okay physically… though, I’m worried she’s beyond saving based on what Daniel did.” He said, looking off to the side in concern. Justin looked at me in interest before looking back at the Yardmaster. He sat upright before he asked, “What did that idiot Canadian do?” Gabriel seemed to sigh, before turning to answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He… introduced Aggi to the Warhammer Franchise-”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“HE WHAT?!?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What’s Warhammer?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

,fireemblem,"Hello y'all, as the title suggests, I used to collect the fire emblem cipher TCG cards when they were actively in production. Unfortunately, I had to take a hiatus from my hobby sometime around B18 (for the booster boxes, link below if you need info about what they are) was releasing due to not having the disposable income at the time, and now in 2024 I am now far more financially stable. I've been looking to get back into collecting some of these cards again, but as they have been out of production and discontinued since around Oct 2020 I think, they've been increasingly harder to find online. 

Does anyone know of any resources or sites I can look at to buy/import/etc any booster boxes, card packs, etc, for cards from B18 through B22? I've done some looking at some typical sites (amazon, amiami, ebay, etc) but it's hard to find some boxes at all, and the ones I can find are going for &gt;$400 and that's just out of my price range. I'm open to buying single cards as well, though I feel like it'd be easier to at least get some packs first since I have literally nothing from that era, to narrow down my search for singles I'm missing. I know prices will be inflated now since the game doesn't have active support anymore, but I'm just looking for something that won't cost me an arm and a leg to get. Heck, if you even know of any places directly in Japan that still carries them at a okay price, I'd be willing to make a trip there (I'm in the U.S.) at some point and stop by there if I have to. I'm just trying to not get price gouged to death while I'm trying to complete my collection. 

Tl;dr I got back into collecting fire emblem TCG cards, are there any good places I can buy cards from booster box 18 - 22 at a semi reasonable price in 2024? Ideally looking for something around &lt;$200 per box to consider, or around &lt;=$12 per card pack, but if you have a reliable source I'm open to at least looking at them even if they're outside of that price range.

,GranblueFantasyRelink,"Hey all, 

I've only been playing End Game for about half a day or so, but I'm at work now and rather than work I figured I'd make a post to talk about it for those interested. There may be minor spoilers, but honestly the story is so... yeah that spoilers won't really effect the game at all. 

This will be from the point of view of Ghandagoza, as he's the only character I've leveled and geared up.

When you finish the main story you'll have a short quest to do with a new unlocked character and then end game opens up. End game is very similar to Monster Hunter Sunbreak in many regards. The game is all instanced based and you sit in town like a hub to do all your upgrades and take on missions that teleport you to a new map. 

The basic goal of end game is to do the new unlocked missions which have a chance of giving you a page, when you have so many pages you do a rank up quest, which involves fighting a hard boss, then when you beat that boss you unlock a new difficulty and new quests. 


When you first finish the main story, you unlock additional mastery point talents. There are no new abilities in these talents, they just provide stat boosts and augments to your current abilities. The stat boosts you get for these talents are absolutely massive. For reference, I had about 500 attack power when finishing the main story quest. In the first bracket of end game talents a single bubble can give +100 attack. Just finishing the boosts in the first bracket I'm now at 2100 attack power in a non-attack power centered build. The augments to the abilities vary with each ability, but appear minor on paper. Like for example the slow duration on Ghandagoza's stomp will last 5% longer. They may get better at higher tiers but I've only finished just finished the second tier. 

These new talents take an abundance of mastery points to unlock. So there is a long grind to power up your characters and unlike the story upgrades you feel the difference in power when you take the time to do the grind. 

Currently I have only leveled up Ghandagoza and here is the difference between him, my party members and neglected heroes on the bench. 

Ghandagoza HP: 15000, Attack: 2100 Crit Chance: 71% 

Ferry (On my Team) HP: 3500, Attack: 422, Crit Chance: 10%

Io (On the bench) HP: 1800, Attack: 300, Crit Chance: 12%

Other than farming for Mastery Points your next objective is to upgrade your weapons. In End Game you unlock new weapons that can be crafted, unlocking new ones each tier you unlock (beating the rank up quest after doing so many missions). The new weapons all specialize in a single stat, ie HP, Stun, Crit, Weak Point ect. Some of them have joke appearances but all of them look great in game. You can spend yet further masteries unlocking even more stats for upgrading weapons that are present regardless of which weapon you choose to use. These are of the same amount of the nodes but not as expensive. You need to farm for specific ingredients dropped by obtaining high ranks on certain bosses or you can buy them by farming other ingredients from the vendor. Then you need to farm upgrade items and money to complete the process. Each character has 6 weapons, I currently have 5 unlocked in the second tier of end game as Ghandagoza. You can also farm these sigil things that attach to weapons and increase their stats. I've only found like three in the entire game so far so they are pretty rare. 

The final upgrade and the long RNG based on are sigils. Characters unlock more and more sigils as they progress. I believe I'm at 7-8 right now, but someone mentioned the cap was 10 sigils per character. Sigils can change how your character plays and provide a massive boost of stats. You farm these in a similar way you farm necklaces in Monster Hunter Sunbreak, you get a bunch of world based ingredients, turn those in for tickets and then trade tickets for an RNG sigil. You also get sigils for completing quests and challenges. You then need to upgrade the sigils, different rarities have limits to how many times you can upgrade them. The max level of a sigil is 20, but currently I haven't been able to get one above 12. 

These sigils can do things like... add HP drain to attacks, add a huge damage boost when you time a perfect evade/block, add percent based HP, add massive amounts of attacks for each of the spiders you find, deal extra damage to monsters with conditions, reduce cooldowns each time you hit an enemy, increase charge speed and tons of other things to build a character you want. Many sigils stack too, so you can equip several of the same kind. 

There are also random side quests you pick up to give a boost of mastery points, exp and random items. The level grind after level 65 slows down significantly, you can find Exp books to help with that. 

There are a few things to mix stuff up, like you can do harder difficulty story missions to go back and unlock new things and get experience/loot. You can do a ""random mission"" which picks a random missions of any difficult from easy to hard that you unlocked and you get these special tokens for completing it which can be used to purchase things. There's also some non-combat missions too, like a surfing coin collecting one and a gunship airfight one. 

My thoughts:

Overall it's a fun grind. I enjoy the combat of the game and there are several characters I want to try but I want to master Ghandagoza first as I really enjoy his combat loop. The biggest downside to the end game for me so far is there are NO new monsters. You fight the same monsters you fought in the story and to my knowledge they have the same mechanics. It's hard to tell as everything died very fast in the story as Ghandagoza is a one man army. There does seem to be more adds during boss fights and mechanics are less forgiving. 

So far as I mentioned I've only progressed Ghandagoza for end game. Every other character has their base tree maxed out (the one unlocked in story mode) and their weapon upgraded to that level (50 or 75, forgot). I've been able to clear content so far but I'm starting to notice things getting a lot more difficult and I feel I'm going to have to start upgrading my party more. 

I still haven't unlocked every character, there are 2 left, one is locked behind those special tokens above but I'm in no hurry as I'm not interested in the two lollis left. 

I have not tried online play yet, I don't really find enjoyment in playing with random people. 

One thing that is neat is if you want to play as a support focused character you absolutely can. You don't need to be the star of the show as the CPU is smart enough to play their characters well. You likely won't get speed clear objectives but you can still hit S++ with only 2/3 of the objectives. 

I've also noticed the importance of weak points as the game is getting more difficult. Before I was just hitting whatever wherever, now I notice which bar charges faster based on my attacks and focus that, when it fills you get a link attack and when Ghandagoza gets 100% Link that monster is absolutely screwed. It lets him continuously use his maxed out charge attack which hits like a nuclear warhead. Imagine a greatsword user in Monster Hunter able to only spam True Charged Slash and nothing else. 

For those interested in my build, I use the Crit based weapon with the Gap Closer, Slam, Counter and the Defense Buff. The goal is to land as many power attacks as you can. You can use the Gap Closer mid charge if the enemy moves and not lose the charge. The slam applies a super powerful slow making it easy to hit a power attack, the defense boost is a taunt which causes things to cluster to you allowing you to hit a lot with the charge attack and it prevents your gauge from depleting for a bit, and the counter is amazing. 

My party members currently are the same ones I used in the story, I want to swap Captain out I just need to level people. I use Captain who has his heal, attack boost and two damage skills. I have Rosetta who uses her heal, poison, Iron maiden and plant explosion and I use the spirit girl who uses her heal, and three pet based skills I can't remember what they do. 

If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask. Happy to help.",t2_mnajwo3b,False,,0,False,End Game Thoughts and Break Down,[],r/GranblueFantasyRelink,False,6.0,,0.0,,,True,t3_1af30qw,False,dark,1.0,,public,1.0,0.0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion,False,1,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,,1706657777.0,text,6.0,,,text,self.GranblueFantasyRelink,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve only been playing End Game for about half a day or so, but I&amp;#39;m at work now and rather than work I figured I&amp;#39;d make a post to talk about it for those interested. There may be minor spoilers, but honestly the story is so... yeah that spoilers won&amp;#39;t really effect the game at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be from the point of view of Ghandagoza, as he&amp;#39;s the only character I&amp;#39;ve leveled and geared up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you finish the main story you&amp;#39;ll have a short quest to do with a new unlocked character and then end game opens up. End game is very similar to Monster Hunter Sunbreak in many regards. The game is all instanced based and you sit in town like a hub to do all your upgrades and take on missions that teleport you to a new map. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic goal of end game is to do the new unlocked missions which have a chance of giving you a page, when you have so many pages you do a rank up quest, which involves fighting a hard boss, then when you beat that boss you unlock a new difficulty and new quests. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you first finish the main story, you unlock additional mastery point talents. There are no new abilities in these talents, they just provide stat boosts and augments to your current abilities. The stat boosts you get for these talents are absolutely massive. For reference, I had about 500 attack power when finishing the main story quest. In the first bracket of end game talents a single bubble can give +100 attack. Just finishing the boosts in the first bracket I&amp;#39;m now at 2100 attack power in a non-attack power centered build. The augments to the abilities vary with each ability, but appear minor on paper. Like for example the slow duration on Ghandagoza&amp;#39;s stomp will last 5% longer. They may get better at higher tiers but I&amp;#39;ve only finished just finished the second tier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These new talents take an abundance of mastery points to unlock. So there is a long grind to power up your characters and unlike the story upgrades you feel the difference in power when you take the time to do the grind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently I have only leveled up Ghandagoza and here is the difference between him, my party members and neglected heroes on the bench. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghandagoza HP: 15000, Attack: 2100 Crit Chance: 71% &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ferry (On my Team) HP: 3500, Attack: 422, Crit Chance: 10%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Io (On the bench) HP: 1800, Attack: 300, Crit Chance: 12%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than farming for Mastery Points your next objective is to upgrade your weapons. In End Game you unlock new weapons that can be crafted, unlocking new ones each tier you unlock (beating the rank up quest after doing so many missions). The new weapons all specialize in a single stat, ie HP, Stun, Crit, Weak Point ect. Some of them have joke appearances but all of them look great in game. You can spend yet further masteries unlocking even more stats for upgrading weapons that are present regardless of which weapon you choose to use. These are of the same amount of the nodes but not as expensive. You need to farm for specific ingredients dropped by obtaining high ranks on certain bosses or you can buy them by farming other ingredients from the vendor. Then you need to farm upgrade items and money to complete the process. Each character has 6 weapons, I currently have 5 unlocked in the second tier of end game as Ghandagoza. You can also farm these sigil things that attach to weapons and increase their stats. I&amp;#39;ve only found like three in the entire game so far so they are pretty rare. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final upgrade and the long RNG based on are sigils. Characters unlock more and more sigils as they progress. I believe I&amp;#39;m at 7-8 right now, but someone mentioned the cap was 10 sigils per character. Sigils can change how your character plays and provide a massive boost of stats. You farm these in a similar way you farm necklaces in Monster Hunter Sunbreak, you get a bunch of world based ingredients, turn those in for tickets and then trade tickets for an RNG sigil. You also get sigils for completing quests and challenges. You then need to upgrade the sigils, different rarities have limits to how many times you can upgrade them. The max level of a sigil is 20, but currently I haven&amp;#39;t been able to get one above 12. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These sigils can do things like... add HP drain to attacks, add a huge damage boost when you time a perfect evade/block, add percent based HP, add massive amounts of attacks for each of the spiders you find, deal extra damage to monsters with conditions, reduce cooldowns each time you hit an enemy, increase charge speed and tons of other things to build a character you want. Many sigils stack too, so you can equip several of the same kind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also random side quests you pick up to give a boost of mastery points, exp and random items. The level grind after level 65 slows down significantly, you can find Exp books to help with that. &lt;/p&gt;

,projectzomboid,"Lucky, is it worth spending 4 pts? Or is Unlucky better, sacrificing some loot in exchange for 4 pts to use on any other traits. In this experiment I wanted to determine whether, from the perspective of a player who mains Unlucky, whether I stood to gain by switching to Lucky. In my previous test, I chose a select set of locations to collect loot and from that determine the loot disparity between Lucky/Unlucky. This experiment used a much larger set of locations, they are as follows:

Rosewood: Police Department, School, Book-Naked

West Point: Police Department, School, Enigma Books, Gun Store, Warehouse, Storage Lot

Riverside: Police Department, School, Post Office, Enigma Books, Hardware Store

Muldraugh: Police Department, Enigma Books, Warehouse, 4x Storage Lots

March Ridge: Community Center, Post Office

Louisville: Army Surplus Store, Checkpoints W and E

Unincorporated: Secret Military Base, Army Surplus Store NW of Rosewood

These locations were looted using the Autoloot mod, configured the items the mod would pick up with  the Mod Options mod, and the map used all standard Apocalypse settings (normal pop, all items are 'rare' in quantity). No other mods were at play. One character spawned in one world with Lucky, another in another world with Unlucky. It took 1h36m to conduct this test and was video recorded, which will be edited to shorten video length via increasing playback speed, and dubbed over so the findings can be more readily accessible than searching for this post or finding it under 'New Posts', perchance. I was looking for the difference in loot generated where it matters most: ammunition, rare firearms like the M14 and M16, melee weapons, vests, large and military backpacks, sledgehammers, How-to-Use-Gen magazines, nails, wood glue, and duct tape. My findings are as follows:

Conclusion:  
Opting for (Lucky, -4pts) as opposed to (Unlucky, +4pts), all players stand to benefit in some way. Firearm heavy players receive the largest benefit, by receiving a massive increase in ammunition generated and a higher probability of finding firearms, but M16 spawn probability appears too small for the +10% probability multiplier to produce more assault rifles. Players interested in carpentry stand to gain substantially, with a massive boost in nails, wood glue, and especially Wood Axes. Axe-mains are the only melee class to see a substantial boost in their desired weapon spawns. Crowbars have such a high durability, having twice as many crowbars will hardly make a difference in anyone's playthrough. Sledgehammer spawn probability is substantially boosted, which is critical for destroying tiles. However, if you're using them to get in otherwise inaccessible locations like gun stores, just grab a molotov and some water bottles if you're running Unlucky and can't find one. I don't care to run this test again because I have faith in the legitimacy of the findings, but anyone else is more than welcome to follow this methodology or improve upon it and add their findings.",t2_mh1bo,False,,0,False,A Larger Test on the Loot Disparity between Lucky/Unlucky,[],r/projectzomboid,False,6.0,guide,0.0,78.0,,True,t3_1af2fr2,False,light,1.0,,public,1.0,0.0,{},140.0,aa4f0390-b39e-11e2-b946-12313b0b21ae,False,[],,False,False,,{},Guide / Tip,False,1,,False,False,https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/dHG5wZ80Nxs_mwylt0VjhCXTCwOsh2E4khDJ-xrlxc4.jpg,False,marksman,[],{},,,True,,1706656252.0,text,6.0,,,text,self.projectzomboid,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucky, is it worth spending 4 pts?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/21rwvo92tnfc1.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=28435120484982178d0f9076a0d7eb41a1f649cc""&gt;Lucky Character&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/542k47v3tnfc1.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7986b10e25f2aaf84ff08c1e681b22f37467a20b""&gt;Unlucky Character&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br/&gt;
Opting for (Lucky, -4pts) as opposed to (Unlucky, +4pts), all players stand to benefit in some way. Firearm heavy players receive the largest benefit, by receiving a massive increase in ammunition generated and a higher probability of finding firearms, but M16 spawn probability appears too small for the +10% probability multiplier to produce more assault rifles. Players interested in carpentry stand to gain substantially, with a massive boost in nails, wood glue, and especially Wood Axes. Axe-mains are the only melee class to see a substantial boost in their desired weapon spawns. Crowbars have such a high durability, having twice as many crowbars will hardly make a difference in anyone&amp;#39;s playthrough. Sledgehammer spawn probability is substantially boosted, which is critical for destroying tiles. However, if you&amp;#39;re using them to get in otherwise inaccessible locations like gun stores, just grab a molotov and some water bottles if you&amp;#39;re running Unlucky and can&amp;#39;t find one. I don&amp;#39;t care to run this test again because I have faith in the legitimacy of the findings, but anyone else is more than welcome to follow this methodology or improve upon it and add their findings.&lt;/p&gt;

,Enshrouded,"Hey Reddit Community,

I've been playing a lot of barbarian lately and wanted to let you know the build I'm currently using. You can find the full post[here](https://deltiasgaming.com/best-enshrouded-barbarian-build/) on my website, but in case you are looking for this information over the week here is what I've learned.

For this Barbarian build, we will emphasize killing targets to flood your Blood Rage skill. This will increase your overall damage while using the Warrior skill line to build towards Blunt Mace damage. You will have the option to play with one-handed mace or two-handed, giving you defensive capabilities to block, parry, and bash targets. 

https://preview.redd.it/abuifw6zlnfc1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f2fe0dbb7f65bd77dd58c718c9395de3bf71466

The following list presents all the features and mechanics for Barbarian Build:

* **Primary Attribute**: Strength
* **Secondary Attribute**: Constitution
* **Primary Weapon**: Twin Soul Mace (one-handed)
* **Secondary Weapon**: Misfortune Mace (two-handed)
* **Shields**: Magic
* **Damage Type**: Blunt
* **Best Armor**: Adventure
* **Best Skills**: Jump Attack, Barbarian, Blood Rage, Veteran
* **Best Consumable**: Hazelnut, Grilled Game

# Overpowered and Merciless

https://preview.redd.it/b9y0qo97mnfc1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=625d06d156c6c592f38b95c347eb22920be48827

Every build and player should be aware of two key mechanics in Enshrouded builds. Overpowered is a mechanic that allows you to make an enemy vulnerable. With a Barbarian, you do this by either timing blocks or filling up the silver stun bar beneath the health bar. Additionally, you can create overpower by attacking a target while they are blocking. This will then stun the enemy giving a circle above their head. 

https://preview.redd.it/lixp1v5bmnfc1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20f60f51d35a72cf84abc0e70b2a822bd52f7e58

For this Barbarian build, I've not selected the Merciless Attack talent. Instead, the skill Shockwave was selected as a way to create more area damage passively. The merciless attack is a helpful skill only in one-on-one situations and is weaker in area-based fights. Thus, be aware, that I will still take advantage of overpowered, but do so in a passive way. 

# Character Creator

https://preview.redd.it/i7gvf03kmnfc1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0642d56623e5ca6045b8fe2b260b62b5f65b74f

Currently, Enshrouded Character Creation has no impact on your gameplay and build potential. There are no racial passives, ability scores, or attributes to consider. Thus, I advise you to select a character whose appearance resonates with you.

# Attributes

https://preview.redd.it/xxinaalsmnfc1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf0121b0986bb1883945daabf849dca1cf9fa48b

The best attribute for a Barbarian build is Strength because it increases melee damage by 5% per attribute point.  The secondary most important is the Constitution which gives you 50 health per attribute point.  Lastly, Dexterity will help increase range damage if you use a bow weapon frequently. 

Additionally, your Flame Altar level will increase your attribute bonus. This is a priority for improving your Enshrouded Barbarian build power level.

# Combat Stats

The most important combat stats are critical chance and critical damage.  The Barbarian and melee damage skills have multiple skills to improve critical chance and damage.  By default, your Barbarian will have 50% critical damage and a low critical chance.  Consider using skills and gear to increase to further increase your damage.

# Skill Selections

Below is a list, in order, of the skills for the Best Barbarian Build:

1. Strength (Athlete): Increases Melee damage by 5% per attribute.

# Barbarian Gameplay &amp; Tips

The way to play the Barbarian build in Enshrouded is to aggressively look to kill the weakest target first. This will trigger Blood Rage increasing your damage by 20%. In single-target situations, it’s best to use one hand and shield and look to parry any incoming attacks. Most monsters attack after you land 2-3 swings and an audible clue will give you a hint for an incoming attack.

During area or multiple enemy situations, look to double jump and attack with a two-handed weapon. This will create a powerful area-based damage effect and multi-kills. However, this will be an intense drain on your stamina, so consume stamina regeneration or prepare accordingly.

Your critical bonus is quite low at the start of the game but increases when you land a two-handed critical. This is why it’s important to try and trigger this effect (relentless) via multiple enemies during airborne attacks. Then, look to kill the weakest target to increase overall damage, and keep the pressure on!

# Barbarian Weapons &amp; Armor

https://preview.redd.it/sm72e9z5onfc1.jpg?width=1914&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fece38925c04b4ba9019d0c14d69b462c0d746b

 Below is a list of the best Barbarian Build Armor and Weapons:

&amp;#x200B;

| **Slot** | **Item**| **Effect**|
|:-|:-|:-|
| Main Hand Weapon | Twin Soul Mace | 10% critical chance, +6 Blunt damage |
| Shield | Ghastly Shield | 10% fire resistance |
| Secondary Weapon | Misfortune Mace | Mana on Hit |
| Range Weapon | Undergrowth Staff | 15% crit chance |
| Head | Guard of the North Helmet | 13% crit chance |
| Upper Body | Guard of the North Chest | \+160 health |
| Arms | Guard of the North Gloves | \+4% melee, magic, range damage |
| Lower Body | Guard of the North Pants | \+8 Stamina |
| Feet | Guard of the North Boots | \+2 Health Regeneration |
| Ring 1 | Sigil Ring of the Elder Guard | \+8 Stamin, +10 Health|
| Ring 2 | Commander’s Ring|  \+30% mana, +30 health|

Your main priority is to find a blunt-style weapon both one-handed and two-handed with a shield:

* Adventure Armor: can be crafted with a blacksmith needed to advance the quest. You can use level 8 Rising Fighter armor as a starter set.
* Guard of the North: These items can be found northeast furthest most of the map. Use Rising Fighter as an alternative.

# Barbarian Consumables

The best Barbarian consumables are those that increase your damage, strength, and or constitution. You will find alternatives to the items we list here, most of which require cooking. Experiment, collect, and cook everything to see what you can obtain early in the game. However, later you will find many items but must consume them to keep the buffs active.

* Hazelnut: Can be harvested in the overland on trees in northern parts of the maps. Hazelnut will increase your damage with +3 Strength for 15 minutes.
* Grilled Game: Kill a wild boar and cook at camp. This gives a big boost to your health via +3 Constitution.
* Elixir: +30% increase damage multiplayer, but 1 minute reduction in shroud. This elixir does a massive amount of damage in conjunction with Hazelnut.

# Healing

In addition, make sure to carry berries (blueberries or strawberries) for health regeneration, water for stamina regeneration, and bandages for healing. As you advance, you can unlock the Alchemist and craft healing potions. This will help you early with survival, then start optimizing for damage with consumables.

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Overpowered and Merciless&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/b9y0qo97mnfc1.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=625d06d156c6c592f38b95c347eb22920be48827""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/b9y0qo97mnfc1.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=625d06d156c6c592f38b95c347eb22920be48827&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every build and player should be aware of two key mechanics in Enshrouded builds. Overpowered is a mechanic that allows you to make an enemy vulnerable. With a Barbarian, you do this by either timing blocks or filling up the silver stun bar beneath the health bar. Additionally, you can create overpower by attacking a target while they are blocking. This will then stun the enemy giving a circle above their head. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/lixp1v5bmnfc1.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=20f60f51d35a72cf84abc0e70b2a822bd52f7e58""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/lixp1v5bmnfc1.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=20f60f51d35a72cf84abc0e70b2a822bd52f7e58&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this Barbarian build, I&amp;#39;ve not selected the Merciless Attack talent. Instead, the skill Shockwave was selected as a way to create more area damage passively. The merciless attack is a helpful skill only in one-on-one situations and is weaker in area-based fights. Thus, be aware, that I will still take advantage of overpowered, but do so in a passive way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Character Creator&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/i7gvf03kmnfc1.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c0642d56623e5ca6045b8fe2b260b62b5f65b74f""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/i7gvf03kmnfc1.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c0642d56623e5ca6045b8fe2b260b62b5f65b74f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, Enshrouded Character Creation has no impact on your gameplay and build potential. There are no racial passives, ability scores, or attributes to consider. Thus, I advise you to select a character whose appearance resonates with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Attributes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/xxinaalsmnfc1.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=bf0121b0986bb1883945daabf849dca1cf9fa48b""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/xxinaalsmnfc1.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=bf0121b0986bb1883945daabf849dca1cf9fa48b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best attribute for a Barbarian build is Strength because it increases melee damage by 5% per attribute point.  The secondary most important is the Constitution which gives you 50 health per attribute point.  Lastly, Dexterity will help increase range damage if you use a bow weapon frequently. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, your Flame Altar level will increase your attribute bonus. This is a priority for improving your Enshrouded Barbarian build power level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Combat Stats&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important combat stats are critical chance and critical damage.  The Barbarian and melee damage skills have multiple skills to improve critical chance and damage.  By default, your Barbarian will have 50% critical damage and a low critical chance.  Consider using skills and gear to increase to further increase your damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Skill Selections&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/emn2a6ozmnfc1.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=aa0372628f0bd095f852949547f310cc5d3d56fe""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/emn2a6ozmnfc1.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=aa0372628f0bd095f852949547f310cc5d3d56fe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Barbarian Gameplay &amp;amp; Tips&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way to play the Barbarian build in Enshrouded is to aggressively look to kill the weakest target first. This will trigger Blood Rage increasing your damage by 20%. In single-target situations, it’s best to use one hand and shield and look to parry any incoming attacks. Most monsters attack after you land 2-3 swings and an audible clue will give you a hint for an incoming attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During area or multiple enemy situations, look to double jump and attack with a two-handed weapon. This will create a powerful area-based damage effect and multi-kills. However, this will be an intense drain on your stamina, so consume stamina regeneration or prepare accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your critical bonus is quite low at the start of the game but increases when you land a two-handed critical. This is why it’s important to try and trigger this effect (relentless) via multiple enemies during airborne attacks. Then, look to kill the weakest target to increase overall damage, and keep the pressure on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Barbarian Weapons &amp;amp; Armor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/sm72e9z5onfc1.jpg?width=1914&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1fece38925c04b4ba9019d0c14d69b462c0d746b""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/sm72e9z5onfc1.jpg?width=1914&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1fece38925c04b4ba9019d0c14d69b462c0d746b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td align=""left""&gt;+30% mana, +30 health&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your main priority is to find a blunt-style weapon both one-handed and two-handed with a shield:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adventure Armor: can be crafted with a blacksmith needed to advance the quest. You can use level 8 Rising Fighter armor as a starter set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guard of the North: These items can be found northeast furthest most of the map. Use Rising Fighter as an alternative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/pf01z7zgnnfc1.jpg?width=1477&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=680e043ddca834e43cf9991bb07448f0be73e57d""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/pf01z7zgnnfc1.jpg?width=1477&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=680e043ddca834e43cf9991bb07448f0be73e57d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Barbarian Consumables&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best Barbarian consumables are those that increase your damage, strength, and or constitution. You will find alternatives to the items we list here, most of which require cooking. Experiment, collect, and cook everything to see what you can obtain early in the game. However, later you will find many items but must consume them to keep the buffs active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hazelnut: Can be harvested in the overland on trees in northern parts of the maps. Hazelnut will increase your damage with +3 Strength for 15 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grilled Game: Kill a wild boar and cook at camp. This gives a big boost to your health via +3 Constitution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elixir: +30% increase damage multiplayer, but 1 minute reduction in shroud. This elixir does a massive amount of damage in conjunction with Hazelnut.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/qi60lavaonfc1.jpg?width=1868&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c70b351c085bf27fa7bc678fe58117ef6e0513f4""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/qi60lavaonfc1.jpg?width=1868&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c70b351c085bf27fa7bc678fe58117ef6e0513f4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Healing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, make sure to carry berries (blueberries or strawberries) for health regeneration, water for stamina regeneration, and bandages for healing. As you advance, you can unlock the Alchemist and craft healing potions. This will help you early with survival, then start optimizing for damage with consumables. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

About the Server…

Step into a world where survival isn't just a matter of strength; it’s history waiting to be written. Our server motto, ""Create your story or die painfully trying..."" isn't just a statement; it's a call to action. May you rise as a revered hero or plunge into the depths of infamous notoriety as a scoundrel. Regardless of the direction your journey unfolds, only those with an insatiable appetite will etch their names into the annals of legend.

Welcome to VitalityRP, where you're not handed survival on a silver platter; rather, it's earned through the indomitable qualities of resilience and adaptability. Join us, and let your story resonate in a world where each chapter is a testament to your skill, determination, and ability to thrive amidst the uncertainties. Your story awaits, shrouded in mystery—will you master the game, or become a pawn in someone else's narrative?

The Story So Far..

*""We here at Stormlord Mining Company have been receiving reports of an ancient Dwarven kingdom somewhere at the distant reaches of the ocean for some time now. Lands filled with gold, mithril and other rare treasures as far as the eye can see! We’ve sent out dozens of scouting parties, and are finally now receiving reports, most of which are disappointing. One, however, claims they may have found this land, but it seems there are some problems. The report claims that while yes, there are massive deposits of rare minerals, the natives appear to have gone mad and our mining teams are unable to establish a long term settlement on land.*

*If you are reading this, know we have sent this letter out far and wide. Stormlord Mining Company is putting out notice that we are hiring anyone willing and able to go collect those minerals for us. In return, we will provide a safe staging ground for you to launch from, and payment for bringing in these resources. Bonuses will be provided for anyone able to figure out what caused the Dwarves to go mad and abandon Khazadurin.""*

The Story So Far..

*""We here at Stormlord Mining Company have been receiving reports of an ancient Dwarven kingdom somewhere at the distant reaches of the ocean for some time now. Lands filled with gold, mithril and other rare treasures as far as the eye can see! We’ve sent out dozens of scouting parties, and are finally now receiving reports, most of which are disappointing. One, however, claims they may have found this land, but it seems there are some problems. The report claims that while yes, there are massive deposits of rare minerals, the natives appear to have gone mad and our mining teams are unable to establish a long term settlement on land.*

*If you are reading this, know we have sent this letter out far and wide. Stormlord Mining Company is putting out notice that we are hiring anyone willing and able to go collect those minerals for us. In return, we will provide a safe staging ground for you to launch from, and payment for bringing in these resources. Bonuses will be provided for anyone able to figure out what caused the Dwarves to go mad and abandon Khazadurin.""*

,duolingo,"Hi /r/duolingo, I completed Section 2 of Duolingo's Japanese course in 109 and wanted to share my thoughts on what I like and dislike about learning with the Duolingo app so far. I also have some thoughts on Duolingo as a game from the perspective of a Diamond Leaguer that has grinded out the Unrivaled achievement.

**The Good**

Hiragana/Katakana Lessons - I think these do a good job showing new learners how to read/write the Japanese syllabary and hear phonetics. However, these exercises may repeat too much for some learners.

Kanji Lessons - Duolingo teaches Kanji with vocabulary and has you memorize the strokes/radical components by rote repetition. *This method works best for me.* Other learners prefer using memorization mnemonics and/or studying ideography and readings.

Typing/Speaking Exercises - Duolingo does a decent job at accepting most of the grammatically correct variations a learner would produce with the vocabulary and grammar points available to them. Yes, it's flawed and obviously correct answers sometimes get rejected (most frustrating when text to speech produces a numeral, but Duolingo wants the Kanji form), but it's the best formed outlet in the app to produce language on your own.

**The Bad (Needs Improvement)**

Grammar Lessons - Duolingo abandons explaining grammar points midway thru section 2. The key phrases are not a substitute. I recommend learners pickup an elementary Japanese textbook to fill in the gaps. Duolingo Section 2 can be completed by studying grammar points learned thru chapter 7 of the Genki 1 textbook so you have a grasp of adjective conjugation and the -te form of verbs.

Exercise Variety - It's apparent comparing Duolingo's exercises to a language textbook/workbook that Duolingo relies too much on word bank and matching and is missing some core language learning exercise types. In particular, I think Duolingo should implement visual spatial relationship exercises. (i.e. show a picture of a room and ask: ""What is on the desk?"", ""What is under the window?"", etc.) I'm looking forward to finally seeing stories in section 3, but I'd appreciate if Duolingo added more reading/listening comprehension content and started sooner.

**The Ugly**

AI Voices - I wish Duolingo offered native voices for all the exercises, but if we must have computer voices, could we at least have the to select which voices to include in the exercise rotation. I can deal with the flaws of the standard Japanese male/female and older male/female computer voices, but I don't agree there's a benefit to learning with exaggerated cartoon and foreigner voices.

Kanji Readings - You'll often run into Kanji that are voiced with an incorrect reading in word bank exercises. If you know the vocabulary used in a lesson well, an incorrect reading in the word bank is merely annoying. If you haven't learned the vocabulary yet, these incorrect readings actively confuse and delay your learning.

**The Game**

I've collected the Unrivaled achievement, so I don't focus on the game aspect much any longer, but here are some tips to help you win a Diamond Leagues.

League Competitiveness - Try to join a league away from the peak hours to get into a less competitive league. If you're lucky you'll get into a league that is winnable with regular gameplay along the path and Kanji lessons alone.

Double XP - When you're playing Duolingo as a game, you want an XP bonus active as much as possible. Use you early bird chest, night owl chest, daily quests, friends quest, etc. Try to end on the last lesson of a unit so you can get the XP bonus when you come back to the app and complete it.

Rapid Review - My first few weeks of learning I thought these timed exercises were impossible and just for selling timer boosts. However, I now approach these as a gauge of how well I'm comprehending a unit. 2 stars without using a boost is my threshold for moving on, and I expect to get 3 stars after I've master the content in a unit. If you're grinding for XP, the 3-star is a quick 80 points with double XP.

Match Madness - This minigame is usually fastest way to consistently earn XP, but most players will need timer boosts at the highest levels. It's questionable how useful this is for learning, but it may help you read faster.

XP Ramp Up Challenge - This minigame is like a practice hub lesson for rapid reviews. However, it sometimes gets bugged with too few questions and players can cheese that way to 80XP every few seconds.

**Closing Thoughts**

I'm grateful that Duolingo has helped me and so many others get introduced to or rekindle their interest in a language. However, the Duolingo method of learning is gamefied to it's core and the game elements may be deter some learners. Additionally, Japanese learners face a particular set of issues and limitations with Duolingo . Because of these concerns, I recommend Japanese learners seek out additional resources that supplement Duolingo in order to achieve learning goals.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Good&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

**Hello J, it’s an incredible honor to have you with us. How are you today?**


Good Morning! It’s an Honor and a Pleasure to be asked for this interview- and it’s a great opportunity to connect with so many passionate flower people- both NEW or Seasoned… It’s definitely a Delight to be here… THANK You!


**We have some questions for you, our community will be extremely excited to hear your words.**


I’m excited to hear the questions- I love an interview- and I love sharing my passion for flowers…


**Occupying the position you do in our world of flowers and designs, are there any advices or warnings you would give to newcomers approaching the art?**


Let’s start with Advice- The Flower Industry- and sharing your Passion for Flowers- is “hard work”- but the good news- is that doing something you love- never really seems like work… so it can be easy- to spend every waking moment - with your NEW Found Passion- so remember to be cautious and not “Burn Out” your Passion! Set aside time and make room for ALL things YOU love- so that you don’t overdue it… A great quote I came across the other day- “what commands your attention- becomes your life”… as I read it (on my phone)- I realized how much time I spend on my phone… so I tossed my phone across the room… and went directly to the Flowers… because Flowers are what I want my life to be… Not a Phone, Not Social Media, Not Politics …but rather the “JOY that Flowers Bring”… so don’t lose yourself in attention-grabbing traps… instead - invest in what you want your life to become and involve! Be Mindful- to create a life outside your ‘work’… with Hobbies, Interest Friends, Family, Pets, and Enjoyable and distracting aligned Interests, Make time for getting away and for having Fun…
Heed my Warning… The Flower Industry is very competitive- and people love to compare things- or compete… Keep your attention - on yourself and your life- and your flowers- there are way too many “haters” out there- that will create distractions, competitions, or rude comments… - when you run across something that is distracting you- or engaging in something other than the kindness and joy- that we all seek and need… ‘delete it’ or Unfollow them- and move forward, around or away from those unpleasant distractions. Remember that “hurt people- hurt people”…. another favorite quote of mine!""


**Gen-Z whom I’ve noticed are taking particular interest in artistic career fields such as Floristy, are generally thought of to be extremely concerned with environmental health and wellbeing. In your view, how should we approach our practices now in insuring, sustainability and environmental health for our industry and for our future, Florists?**


This is really good news… because flowers offer such Incredible Health and Wellness Benefits- and that is what creating a Life in Bloom is all about… taking advantage of the natural and beautiful benefits that flowers provide. Having Flowers in our Lives- reduces depression- creates happier thoughts, helps us get better faster, makes us more creative- the list is Long- and Valuable… (complied at the link uBloom.com/research)

I’m so excited that Gen-Z and ALL Young people are looking for experiences- instead of stuff- and that includes the experience flowers can provide… What would happen if EVERYONE - was happier- and less depressed- and more creative… Flowers are powerful and we have that Flower Power in the palm of our hands… All of Us… No matter what generation we are… 

I wish our industry was less divisive- there is so much focus on creating Groups for certain ages or talents or skills… I wish we were more inclusive- and gathered together more to share ideas… there is such value in the creativity and optimism of youth… and equal value in the experience and knowledge of our elders… I want to talk to everyone and I want to share with everyone… Flowers are Joyful and Comforting… and we need to find Joy and Comfort and Kindness in each other! 


**It’s well known that you’ve been in our field your entire life. What are some of the most prominent changes you’ve observed in our industry over the decades?** 


One of the Most Prominent Changes- that is so disappointing- is the elimination of LIVE Education- that was sponsored by Industry Manufacturers- and Wholesale Florists- and Associations… thus a “dumbing down of our industry” is taking place that is very tragic… I used to attend Wholesale shows where there were 1200 florists- that were there for a day of learning, inspiration, motivation and most of all EDUCATION… sharing time and talent- and networking with each other…
Now our industry divides us by age- or talent- or association- or certification, or business type and we are missing the excitement and education benefits that every single person- no matter what their background- has to bring to the table… no matter their affiliation, skill level, age, association membership etc… I always created my education videos- so they were applicable to everyone- and that it wasn’t biased- newcomer- freelance designer, wedding or event specialist- old or young… education should be open and welcoming to everyone… and that is why I created my videos- and tried to be helpful, kind and inclusive in all my education endeavors…
Education for the Future was the whole reason we created uBloom.com and the many educational series (JTV, Fun with Flowers and J- and now- At Home with Flowers) and all the documentaries (CA Grown Experience, The Florida Fresh Tour, The Flowers of Columbia) we archive on uBloom - I saw this disconnection happening back in the early 2000’s and wanted to ensure that flower education remained available for future generations of florists, special event planners and flower enthusiasts!
Social Media is also a big change… I’m not fond of Social Media- it’s too often divisive and shocking- and self-absorbing… it’s generally not helpful on a day to day basis… and frankly I worry that it’s not psychologically healthy for humans, it’s not mindful- and for our industry it’s divisive and egotistical - but at this time in our world- it is a necessary evil for promotion and marketing… I makes me sad that anyone can make an uneducated post- and claim to be an expert- and even share inaccurate or harmful information without recourse… the model is broken- and I hope that Integrity, Honesty and Kindness will win out… someday- somehow…
I see so much bad behavior- when it comes to Flower Processing and Mechanics- and Flower Techniques- that are normalized- (and these are mistakes we made back in the 60s and 70s… )but because of the lack of education we have today in the Flower Industry -future generations are destined to make the mistakes over again… because we have abandoned education…and anyone can create the impression of an expert- on social media…
Whew! that’s a lot to take in… Let me be More Productive and turn my Attention and talk about the changes that I LOVE seeing on Social Media…
I LOVE Pretty Flowers- and Love Seeing Pretty Flowers- and Love Seeing the Growers that Produce Pretty Flower… I love seeing Pretty flowers arranged well…
(I don’t enjoy- poorly designed arrangements of Pretty Flowers— though) I wish I saw more processes or concepts that show regard and dedication to longevity (safety) of Flowers… rather than flowers that are created to shock- incite, or create reaction… I’m not a reality TV fan at all… and I’m not a reality FLOWER Fan either…
I love that we are all Part of a Greater Global Flower Industry- that we can have Hydrangea- any day of the year, for example… and that flowers are grown all over the world- and there are more flowers today than every before- different types, colors, variety- so much more… and that is because we are a global industry and we can access those flowers- and bring the joy of flowers to anyone - anywhere…
I love that flowers have become mainstream- (this was caused by the pandemic)… suddenly people were disconnecting - staying home- out of contact… but then there was this inspired fascination with flowers- (I like to think our Public Television- all Access - no Cost Show- that anyone could watch- and Millions did… helped in this outcome) and people suddenly became aware that Flowers make us feel good- they bring us joy- they reduce depression… this is the exact result that a myriad of Flower Studies prove (thank you Society of American Florists for investing in these studies- and God Bless Dr. Haviland Jones)… and suddenly Flower Sales were off the charts- people were buying and enjoying flowers- and Flowers became a mainstay - for home health, peace, joy, inspiration, creativity… It was magical and still is today!
I love- that Kelly and I have created “Life in Bloom” and that we all collectively have a National Television Show- about Cut Flowers- the first of it’s kind- that simply enforces the Health and Wellness benefits of flowers… with it’s 6th Season coming soon and a total of 81 episodes -with 5 Permanent National Time Slots- and over 98 Million Viewers every week… This is Groundbreaking- and it mainstreams CUT FLOWERS- just like Garden Shows mainstream Gardening- and Cooking Shows mainstream cooking… You get the idea… and I’m thankful and grateful for CalFlowers, Albertsons Companies, Holland American Flowers, Passion Roses, and Suntory Flowers- for helping us keep that show on the Air… it makes a huge difference that the General Public is inspired to keep Flowers front and center! 


**What is the most funny/humorous event you’ve witnessed in your time in the floral industry?**


That’s a tough Question… I’ve seen many funny things… and enjoyed many funny people… and had many funny experiences… hmmmmm…I think that Humor can be subjective- and what may have been hilarious at one moment- may not be hysterical today…
Kel and I laugh constantly… we find humor is so many places… and Laughter, Love, Kindness and Gratitude are a way of life for us… so - back to your question…
Haskel Eargle - was the funniest man in the flower industry… he was always funny- and made me laugh constantly whenever we talked or visited… I believe that we should find humor in everything we do … Laughing everyday is important… you know the old adage… “Laughter is the best medicine”- My grandfather Carnation Joe had a saying… “When you lay your head on the pillow at night- take inventory! Did you learn something new today? Did you Laugh Today? If the answer is “NO” to either of those questions… Get Back up- Your Day isn’t over!”…
My advice- laugh everyday- the value of laughter and humor - makes you a better - happier person… ""


**We live in a world of coming and going trends, how have you managed to stay on or even ahead of trend over the years?**


I think the secret behind ‘seeing a trend’ is paying attention to what is happening in our world- and how people react to the thing you have discovered! … Trends are supported by what people (all people) are paying attention to… and more importantly - what people are loving and buying into…
(reminder of my earlier quote- “What occupies our attention- becomes our life”… -so what is garnering attention may become a trend… very easily!)
I would like to offer this kind advice…
NO ONE CAN MAKE UP A TREND!- Trends have to be observed, identified, and then you can address or take advantage of them. No one can create them by simply stating -“ I think this should be a Trend…”
or more accurately- “This is WHAT I AM GOING TO MAKE A TREND”… that is the biggest delusion!
Our industry tries to hard to “make trends happen” - even of things like the NEW COLOR OF THE YEAR… just because someone says this is the COLOR of the YEAR- that doesn’t make it popular… I believe the Color of the Year is a HOPE- and a Prayer- that this Color will go WILD!
There have been plenty of Colors of the Year- that never made it to mainstream… or became popular… just look at the history! As an example - Did the 2016 Colors (another gimmick-2 colors not one!) light blue and pink really turn up everywhere? They did not and it just created confusion!
It’s also interesting to note- that once the Color is announced- it’s usually not in the market yet- and everyone (manufacturers) have to start producing things in that color… it’s not already in our everyday lifestyle!
Now- to be clear- there are already colors that are in the marketplace- and that means those colors are ALREADY available… those colors have a much better chance of being Trendy- than something that is announced pre-manufacturer level - to be or become a trend…
Great Example- Barbie- the movie- Up for Best Picture- It made everyone go crazy for Pink… but PINK was already in the marketplace in lots of shades, tints and tones- and when the movie became successful- pink was poised and ready to be POPULAR… it’s a great Example and good food for thought!
So to answer Your Question- I pay attention to what people are loving, enjoying, buying- and “paying attention to”… that is where the next trend lies … So… my advice - Pay Attention, Observe, Identify and then react to the Trend!


**And what are some of your favorite design trends you’ve seen or created?**


My Favorite Trend- is “FLOWERS” - and how they have become mainstream with the consumer public! It was not always the case, unfortunately - so let’s keep it going! It also reinforces the trend- when we realize how Flowers can calm us, comfort us, bring us joy, reduce depression, reduce arguments, enlarge our circles of friends…
“The Power of Flowers” - is my Favorite Trend… because flowers are my life… and I pay attention to them… and so do millions of other people… Everyone Loves Flowers… it’s not a specific flower… but Flowers in General- People love Flowers and Flowers bring us Joy! 


**You’re a person that many look up to in our world, you’re a hero to some. Who are some of your design heroes?**


Thank you for that kind statement… I assume you mean “Flower” design heroes… and I’ll address it from that standpoint- even though some of my heroes are not from the world of flowers…
I have to say that I am an amalgamation of many designers and design styles- So Many people have affected the way I design and how I enjoy flowers- and thus they have become a part of me… and their influence brings me joy… so if that is a definition of a design hero… the list will be long…
My Flower Design “Influence” Heroes… Haskell Eargle… Mandy Majerik… Joe Smith …Bill Harper… Phil Rulloda…Eddie VonBargen…Mel Resendiz… My Dad- Mel Schwanke… Matt Wood… Mari Ignatowski… Talmage McLaurin… Cliff Mann… Bobbi Ecker-Blatchford… But then other Heroes- start to influence my life- and the way I present flowers… My Husband - Kelly Blank… Bob Ross… Mr Rogers… My Grandpa Carnation Joe…My Nanny- Dorothy Swanson…Pat Doyle… to name a few… You may not even know some of these people… but they all played very Heroic Parts in my life- Many still do- others were there for a reason or a season… none-the-less they are all HEROES and they all influence my Flowers!
Although - I have to state… there are also viewers, followers and fans that send in arrangements they have made that were inspired by my TV Show- and they are ALSO huge design heroes to me as well… and their style influences me too… 


**The industry and art seem to be accelerating in a different direction than before the year 2000. What impacts do you think social media and new tech has had on our art form?**


This is going to take “a minute” Thomas- as it’s a very complex question…
First of all when it comes to art and flowers- and how they intertwine… I want to talk about “ART in BLOOM” the interactive event created by the Boston Museum of Fine Art- over half a century ago… where local flower artists are invited to come into an art museum and are allowed to interpret a piece of art through flowers… I love that project- and I love seeing Flower Designers interpret a Piece of Art through Flowers… I think that is magnificent, magical, inspiring and thought provoking…
Art is subjective and thus- not every art form is appreciated by everyone… that is an important factor when we start to discuss ART- and Flowers…
“One man’s junk is another man’s art”… is a quote that is very meaningful- and again- the quote is also subjective…
Personally- I love pretty flowers- I enjoy arranging flowers… I LOVE-ADORE- and LIVE FOR Color… Color and Flowers is my thing… I think that color combinations are an art form as well… but again it’s subjective too… so Art is Subjective… I was trained in Ikenoba (a style or form of Ikebana) flower design in Japan- and my parents insisted that I learn that Art form as a young man (age 18)… so I could incorporate that into my design style- that was a huge blessing- and I am inspired by Ikebana- and Japanese Flower Design to this day…
I have great respect for any Artist- that creates Art- from the ether… Art is magical and Artists are Magical- Inspired and sometimes troubled… Van Gogh is a good example - great artist- amazing art- extremely troubled!
To that End… I hate AI- Artificial Intelligence and the fascination it occupies on social media. I think AI is dangerous- and AI degrades our respect for Art and Artists- Stephen Hawking warned us all that AI would be death of humankind… I think his warning is VERY IMPORTANT and Grave… I say this because I want you to know that I stand for ARTISTS- and their practice- and know and appreciate their value- and Talent!
Remember- I’m not fond of Social Media- I will honestly admit that… as I think it gave ANYONE the ability to share their opinion- and not have to defend it… people are mean on social media and have not accountability - that is what I dislike MOST about Social Media… Anyone can say mean things to anyone and not have to suffer the repercussions… Valerie Bertinelli came forward and made us all aware of this… She is a Hero of Mine as well!
I don’t appreciate that anyone can be portrayed as an Expert or ARTIST on Social Media- there is no vetting process… and that REALITY- SHOCK- are King on Social Media… I wish there was more kindness- and comfort on Social Media- that is why Kelly and I ALWAYS POST Flowers- on Social Media! We both believe that flowers offer Kindness, Comfort and Calm… and occasionally education.
I Strongly believe in the IMPORTANCE of knowing and embracing the Elements and Principles of Flower Design- I think there is merit to Line, Form, Balance, Color, Rhythm, Texture… the list goes on… You can only fully ‘break the rules” of design- by Understanding, Knowing and Practicing them… and I also believe that Flowers- are in themselves “Pretty” - however these Flowers are not always arranged in a Pretty fashion- (where attention has NOT been paid to the elements and principles of flower design - and in fact are poorly or unattractively arranged- without attention) Sometimes- these poorly arranged flowers are then claimed to be ART… to distract from the fact that they are not properly arranged or attractive- and I don’t find joy in that!
And I shall return to my original statement- “I believe that ALL Art is subjective” - even when it comes to flowers… Art is typically sold… and thus appreciated- I love watching the Antiques Roadshow - and seeing how Art Appreciates or Depreciates… it’s fascinating… Flowers are perishable… so they aren’t mean to hang on a wall for years like an oil painting or reside on a table like a bronze statue…
So… Flower Art is perishable (for the most part) and I don’t know if it’s advantageous for Florists to Create Flower Art for the masses… Many Times Flower Art- like what we see at the World Cup Competition- takes TIME… and it’s perishable- and I often question- if World Cup Art is salable… (that is not a requirement for the World Cup Competition to be clear) … but I wonder what the everyday flower consumer - thinks of flowers at that level… do they get it? Do they like it - and most of all - would they be willing to PAY for what it would cost- both in Labor, Hard Goods and Flower Quantities and Types? That doesn’t mean it’s not beautiful- but there is a definite line between Pretty Flowers that we put for Sale (and Hopefully Sell) and Flower ART for art’s sake.

Personally- What J finds interest in- are attainable - salable- comfortable- and MOST IMPORTANTLY - Beautiful Flowers… that is my very own very personal and subjective preference… so I don’t know if it’s fair - for me to say what I like and don’t like when it comes to Flower Art … because my opinion is subjective…
I do however hate that Social Media allows anyone who creates flowers to post anything they make and claim it Flower art… I don’t like or need to see so many things I see on Social Media… thus- a call back- to what I said before- I enjoy tossing my phone aside and heading into the garden, or the local flower sellers cooler for my flowers to arrange- visiting a farmers market, cooking a dinner, or petting my dogs… All these things thrill me and I love and enjoy them.


**If I bestowed you with three wishes you could use on the world of flowers and floristry, what would you wish for us?**


1. The Ability to Sell more Flowers to More People More Often- (without limit)… This would allow EVERYONE to Enjoy More Flowers- More Often … and allow Growers to Grow with Wild Abandon- Flower Sellers to Sell with Wild Abandon- and Consumers to Buy Flowers- with Wild Abandon… What a World that would be! SIGH… 

2. The Ability for all Flower People- (Designers, Enthusiasts, Sales People, Managers, Owners, Employees) to be Kind, Comforting, Inspiring and Loving toward Ourselves, Others- and the Entire Industry… (I feel this is a concealed Wish for World Peace- honestly) 

3. An Unending Revenue Stream for FLOWER EDUCATIONAL EVENTS- to benefit both Past Present and Future Florists… This would allow us to learn from one another- past present and future- and Move Forward with Success, Positivity and Joy… 


**Many of us have a favorite design style or a style at least that we are most comfortable in. Out of all the different styles of Floral Design that exist which ones are your favorites?**


Pretty Flowers (FIRST and FOREMOST) - arranged in a comfortable, calming style that incites Joy and Kindness - (I love Creative Naturalism— mixed with color and texture)  This is best achieved by mixing a little Haskell Eargle, Bill Harper, Matt Wood, and Joe Smith with Pretty Flowers and Foliage… 

You have this is your design style, sir. In looking at your instagram account- you embrace color- and pretty flowers…you do it VERY VERY WELL! 

If I had to PICK my Favorite- and Most Important Element or Principle of Flower Design Style- it would be COLOR- I think it’s so effective- and helps us “Turn our Feelings into Flowers” in a very memorable and eye-catching way! 


**Florists in the millennial generation will probably look back at the pandemic as a particularly trying time for the floral industry.**


I hope you will allow me to address this statement first… I will ALWAYS look back on the pandemic as the TIME that Flowers became Necessary for EVERYONE- it was one of the largest and most profitable times in the flower industry… and the CONSUMER PUBLIC became graphically and personally aware of the POSITIVE Health and Wellness Benefits of Cut Flowers… It is possibly one of the MOST IMPORTANT times for the Flower Industry Bar None! It was a gift the universe gave to the Flower Industry… In my Opinion… 


**Are there any other times before that you can remember that were also especially difficult or uncertain?**


So this is another interesting fact… during the great Depression… My Grandfather was running our family flower shop in Nebraska… and while everyone else was struggling- he noticed that flowers were becoming an “affordable luxury-“ - and that people were realizing that flowers made them feel better… so my Grandfather- was becoming very busy at the flower shop (actually doing ok financially)… because people were finding-  .05 - .10 - or .15 cents to spend on a simple bunch of flowers- to put in the house to make everyone feel better… so the Infamous Great Depression- that downturn or struggle- was somehow ALSO providing a beneficial time for flowers… florists, flower growers and sellers…

Thus- In my opinion- downturns- or difficult times- provide a unique and positive opportunity for flowers…and Florists-  and thus- I feel that FLOWER POWER is a real thing and it’s something very important for us to remember- as times get tough- FLORISTS- get TOUGHER- and Bring on the Flower Power! 


**What’s your favorite flower of all time?**


That’s a Super Difficult Question… I can’t narrow it to one Flower… I will apologize- I have a Group of Flowers- I can always depend on to bring me joy- here they are in no particular order… 

As a Broad Flower Variety- I love Carnations Most of All… It’s a Family thing too… We Grew Carnations in my families greenhouses- and my Grandpa and Father always wore a Red Carnation… I love how they are en vogue again… and that there are new colors, varieties, shapes, styles and texture… I love the clove smell of a carnation...I Love mini-carnations and Standard Carnations… Carnations are so long lasting… I love them… 

I Love Gardenias- there is nothing better than going to sleep or awakening to the smell of gardenias… and thus I love Stemmed Gardenias that can be arranged in a vase… like the ones that High Camp Supply sells… those are amazing… 

I Love the smell of Freesia Too… Yellow Freesia used to have the best smell… but these days there is a rusty brown colored one- that has an incredible intense fun- fruity smell… I always joke that Fressia’s Smell like Froot Loops… 

Zinnias- I adore Zinnias- and I especially love the Queeny Lime Variety- that is green with rose and orange overtones… it’s in the Cinderella Variety Expanse… I love arranging Zinnias- all summer long- it’s a joy… and they make me happy! 

Roses- I love Roses that smell like Roses… Helga Piaget, Yves Piaget, Sweet Moments, in my world… I love a Rose that smells like a classic rose... That is what makes life wonderful- when Roses have a Rose Fragrance… 

And finally- I have to offer the famous Quote from Claude Monet “ I must always have flowers- always and always!”… So it really doesn’t matter… as long as there are flowers- I will be happy! 


**What do you hope to see from the floral industry in the future?**


I hope to always see Pretty Flowers… I hope to see kinder, gentler and less division in our Flower Industry- I hope to see a resurgence and priority put on education! I hope to see the consumers interest and consumption of flowers- continue to grow- unceasingly…  Flower Power Forever!


**Many films and TV shows include floristry in their set designs, are there any films or TV shows you can think of that included Florist particularly well?**


This reminds me of a funny idiosyncrasy of mine… I always See the Flowers in a Film or TV… I can’t help but see them… and I critic them… MOST COMMONLY on availability… I watched a movie set in the 1950’s about Truman Capote - it was a wonderful period piece - and they had a Single Alstroemeria in a vase on a table… and I thought (and brought to everyone’s attention) that Alstroemerias had NOT yet been discovered nor would they have been commercially available at that time… and I couldn’t stop talking about it… 

Kel jokes that - it’s an annoying habit I have… I had similar reactions to the flowers- that were created for “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel … style and flower type were not always correct for the period of time… ALTHOUGH they were GORGEOUS and I loved seeing them… They were Pretty Flowers- but not always historically accurate. I still love that series- and I loved EVERY SINGLE SECOND…  and I loves seeing flowers added so profusely to the series… My Crew thought I should write a letter and offer to the be flower consultant!

I think I would be remiss- if I didn’t include “ J Schwanke’s Life in Bloom” on Public Television! I believe it represents Floristry Very Well… and encourages anyone to include flowers in their life at every/any avenue… Flowers become accessible to everyone- and they are brought back into every situation… that is something that I am very proud of… and also why I think the show is so beloved by our viewers! 


**Who’s your favorite author, painter, musician, and film director?**


My Favorite Author: David Sedaris- Brilliant and Laugh Out Loud Funny!
My Favorite Painter: Mary Blair - American Artist and Animator- for Walt Disney- Her concept art is amazing… I hope to own one - someday!
My Favorite Musician: Joey DeFrancesco- American Jazz Organist (and Trumpeter) but I’m in love with Hammond Jazz Organ Music… 
My Favorite Film Director: I don’t really follow directors… I enjoy all kinds of movies- and I don’t group them by Director… I look at the content - and when I love it… I can admire the director of that film… 


**Final question, what is your most cherished flower related memory?**


I think it has to be the wisdom and advice of Mrs. Jan Therien - from Fremont Nebraska, my High School Guidance Counselor… When I was a Junior in High School - had a meeting with Jan - to decide what I was going to do with my life… what career I was going to pursue to ensure- that I would be on the road to success and also have the classes needed to follow my dream…  here’s how the dialog went… 

Jan: What do you want to be when you graduate from school?
J: A Zookeeper (I always have and still do have an inordinate love and ultimate fascination with animals- and especially Zoological Parks and Zoo Animals)
Jan: Really???- Well- you know how difficult that will be- as you have to become a doctor of Zoology- that means BIOLOGY… CHEMISTRY, PHYSICS, 
and MATH- You realize how you are presently doing in those courses- and that you don’t do well in those studies- You do better in the Fine Arts… 
Drama, Art … and it’s going to be a lot of hard work and studying… and If I may be frank… You seem to be kind of lazy… 
J: (Not Surprised… I was Lazy- and Hated Math and Studying… Let’s be honest… I get it and Jan knew me well) … Well… then what do YOU think I 
should do???
Jan: You’re a 4th Generation Florist- You know more about Flowers- than Anyone I know- ALREADY- without even studying- YOU love flowers
and You could be a great florist- without much effort… I think that might be a good thing - Join your family business and become a Florist… arranging
flowers- creating window displays- running your family flower business- seems like a good idea to me… What do you think????
J: Sounds like a Great Plan… 

And Here we are today… I have a National TV Show about Flowers- that reaches 98 Million People every day- I have a successful website and series of videos that have educated florists around the world- in the art of Floristry- I love Flowers- and I Love what I do… and Jan Therien- is in my Opinion- the Greatest High School Guidance Counselor of All TIME… she gave it to me straight… and I became a Blooming Success!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hello J, it’s an incredible honor to have you with us. How are you today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good Morning! It’s an Honor and a Pleasure to be asked for this interview- and it’s a great opportunity to connect with so many passionate flower people- both NEW or Seasoned… It’s definitely a Delight to be here… THANK You!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have some questions for you, our community will be extremely excited to hear your words.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m excited to hear the questions- I love an interview- and I love sharing my passion for flowers…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupying the position you do in our world of flowers and designs, are there any advices or warnings you would give to newcomers approaching the art?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with Advice- The Flower Industry- and sharing your Passion for Flowers- is “hard work”- but the good news- is that doing something you love- never really seems like work… so it can be easy- to spend every waking moment - with your NEW Found Passion- so remember to be cautious and not “Burn Out” your Passion! Set aside time and make room for ALL things YOU love- so that you don’t overdue it… A great quote I came across the other day- “what commands your attention- becomes your life”… as I read it (on my phone)- I realized how much time I spend on my phone… so I tossed my phone across the room… and went directly to the Flowers… because Flowers are what I want my life to be… Not a Phone, Not Social Media, Not Politics …but rather the “JOY that Flowers Bring”… so don’t lose yourself in attention-grabbing traps… instead - invest in what you want your life to become and involve! Be Mindful- to create a life outside your ‘work’… with Hobbies, Interest Friends, Family, Pets, and Enjoyable and distracting aligned Interests, Make time for getting away and for having Fun…
Heed my Warning… The Flower Industry is very competitive- and people love to compare things- or compete… Keep your attention - on yourself and your life- and your flowers- there are way too many “haters” out there- that will create distractions, competitions, or rude comments… - when you run across something that is distracting you- or engaging in something other than the kindness and joy- that we all seek and need… ‘delete it’ or Unfollow them- and move forward, around or away from those unpleasant distractions. Remember that “hurt people- hurt people”…. another favorite quote of mine!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen-Z whom I’ve noticed are taking particular interest in artistic career fields such as Floristy, are generally thought of to be extremely concerned with environmental health and wellbeing. In your view, how should we approach our practices now in insuring, sustainability and environmental health for our industry and for our future, Florists?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is really good news… because flowers offer such Incredible Health and Wellness Benefits- and that is what creating a Life in Bloom is all about… taking advantage of the natural and beautiful benefits that flowers provide. Having Flowers in our Lives- reduces depression- creates happier thoughts, helps us get better faster, makes us more creative- the list is Long- and Valuable… (complied at the link uBloom.com/research)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so excited that Gen-Z and ALL Young people are looking for experiences- instead of stuff- and that includes the experience flowers can provide… What would happen if EVERYONE - was happier- and less depressed- and more creative… Flowers are powerful and we have that Flower Power in the palm of our hands… All of Us… No matter what generation we are… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish our industry was less divisive- there is so much focus on creating Groups for certain ages or talents or skills… I wish we were more inclusive- and gathered together more to share ideas… there is such value in the creativity and optimism of youth… and equal value in the experience and knowledge of our elders… I want to talk to everyone and I want to share with everyone… Flowers are Joyful and Comforting… and we need to find Joy and Comfort and Kindness in each other! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s well known that you’ve been in our field your entire life. What are some of the most prominent changes you’ve observed in our industry over the decades?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the Most Prominent Changes- that is so disappointing- is the elimination of LIVE Education- that was sponsored by Industry Manufacturers- and Wholesale Florists- and Associations… thus a “dumbing down of our industry” is taking place that is very tragic… I used to attend Wholesale shows where there were 1200 florists- that were there for a day of learning, inspiration, motivation and most of all EDUCATION… sharing time and talent- and networking with each other…
Now our industry divides us by age- or talent- or association- or certification, or business type and we are missing the excitement and education benefits that every single person- no matter what their background- has to bring to the table… no matter their affiliation, skill level, age, association membership etc… I always created my education videos- so they were applicable to everyone- and that it wasn’t biased- newcomer- freelance designer, wedding or event specialist- old or young… education should be open and welcoming to everyone… and that is why I created my videos- and tried to be helpful, kind and inclusive in all my education endeavors…
Education for the Future was the whole reason we created uBloom.com and the many educational series (JTV, Fun with Flowers and J- and now- At Home with Flowers) and all the documentaries (CA Grown Experience, The Florida Fresh Tour, The Flowers of Columbia) we archive on uBloom - I saw this disconnection happening back in the early 2000’s and wanted to ensure that flower education remained available for future generations of florists, special event planners and flower enthusiasts!
Social Media is also a big change… I’m not fond of Social Media- it’s too often divisive and shocking- and self-absorbing… it’s generally not helpful on a day to day basis… and frankly I worry that it’s not psychologically healthy for humans, it’s not mindful- and for our industry it’s divisive and egotistical - but at this time in our world- it is a necessary evil for promotion and marketing… I makes me sad that anyone can make an uneducated post- and claim to be an expert- and even share inaccurate or harmful information without recourse… the model is broken- and I hope that Integrity, Honesty and Kindness will win out… someday- somehow…
I see so much bad behavior- when it comes to Flower Processing and Mechanics- and Flower Techniques- that are normalized- (and these are mistakes we made back in the 60s and 70s… )but because of the lack of education we have today in the Flower Industry -future generations are destined to make the mistakes over again… because we have abandoned education…and anyone can create the impression of an expert- on social media…
Whew! that’s a lot to take in… Let me be More Productive and turn my Attention and talk about the changes that I LOVE seeing on Social Media…
I LOVE Pretty Flowers- and Love Seeing Pretty Flowers- and Love Seeing the Growers that Produce Pretty Flower… I love seeing Pretty flowers arranged well…
(I don’t enjoy- poorly designed arrangements of Pretty Flowers— though) I wish I saw more processes or concepts that show regard and dedication to longevity (safety) of Flowers… rather than flowers that are created to shock- incite, or create reaction… I’m not a reality TV fan at all… and I’m not a reality FLOWER Fan either…
I love that we are all Part of a Greater Global Flower Industry- that we can have Hydrangea- any day of the year, for example… and that flowers are grown all over the world- and there are more flowers today than every before- different types, colors, variety- so much more… and that is because we are a global industry and we can access those flowers- and bring the joy of flowers to anyone - anywhere…
I love that flowers have become mainstream- (this was caused by the pandemic)… suddenly people were disconnecting - staying home- out of contact… but then there was this inspired fascination with flowers- (I like to think our Public Television- all Access - no Cost Show- that anyone could watch- and Millions did… helped in this outcome) and people suddenly became aware that Flowers make us feel good- they bring us joy- they reduce depression… this is the exact result that a myriad of Flower Studies prove (thank you Society of American Florists for investing in these studies- and God Bless Dr. Haviland Jones)… and suddenly Flower Sales were off the charts- people were buying and enjoying flowers- and Flowers became a mainstay - for home health, peace, joy, inspiration, creativity… It was magical and still is today!
I love- that Kelly and I have created “Life in Bloom” and that we all collectively have a National Television Show- about Cut Flowers- the first of it’s kind- that simply enforces the Health and Wellness benefits of flowers… with it’s 6th Season coming soon and a total of 81 episodes -with 5 Permanent National Time Slots- and over 98 Million Viewers every week… This is Groundbreaking- and it mainstreams CUT FLOWERS- just like Garden Shows mainstream Gardening- and Cooking Shows mainstream cooking… You get the idea… and I’m thankful and grateful for CalFlowers, Albertsons Companies, Holland American Flowers, Passion Roses, and Suntory Flowers- for helping us keep that show on the Air… it makes a huge difference that the General Public is inspired to keep Flowers front and center! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the most funny/humorous event you’ve witnessed in your time in the floral industry?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a tough Question… I’ve seen many funny things… and enjoyed many funny people… and had many funny experiences… hmmmmm…I think that Humor can be subjective- and what may have been hilarious at one moment- may not be hysterical today…
Kel and I laugh constantly… we find humor is so many places… and Laughter, Love, Kindness and Gratitude are a way of life for us… so - back to your question…
Haskel Eargle - was the funniest man in the flower industry… he was always funny- and made me laugh constantly whenever we talked or visited… I believe that we should find humor in everything we do … Laughing everyday is important… you know the old adage… “Laughter is the best medicine”- My grandfather Carnation Joe had a saying… “When you lay your head on the pillow at night- take inventory! Did you learn something new today? Did you Laugh Today? If the answer is “NO” to either of those questions… Get Back up- Your Day isn’t over!”…
My advice- laugh everyday- the value of laughter and humor - makes you a better - happier person… &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We live in a world of coming and going trends, how have you managed to stay on or even ahead of trend over the years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the secret behind ‘seeing a trend’ is paying attention to what is happening in our world- and how people react to the thing you have discovered! … Trends are supported by what people (all people) are paying attention to… and more importantly - what people are loving and buying into…
(reminder of my earlier quote- “What occupies our attention- becomes our life”… -so what is garnering attention may become a trend… very easily!)
I would like to offer this kind advice…
NO ONE CAN MAKE UP A TREND!- Trends have to be observed, identified, and then you can address or take advantage of them. No one can create them by simply stating -“ I think this should be a Trend…”
or more accurately- “This is WHAT I AM GOING TO MAKE A TREND”… that is the biggest delusion!
Our industry tries to hard to “make trends happen” - even of things like the NEW COLOR OF THE YEAR… just because someone says this is the COLOR of the YEAR- that doesn’t make it popular… I believe the Color of the Year is a HOPE- and a Prayer- that this Color will go WILD!
There have been plenty of Colors of the Year- that never made it to mainstream… or became popular… just look at the history! As an example - Did the 2016 Colors (another gimmick-2 colors not one!) light blue and pink really turn up everywhere? They did not and it just created confusion!
It’s also interesting to note- that once the Color is announced- it’s usually not in the market yet- and everyone (manufacturers) have to start producing things in that color… it’s not already in our everyday lifestyle!
Now- to be clear- there are already colors that are in the marketplace- and that means those colors are ALREADY available… those colors have a much better chance of being Trendy- than something that is announced pre-manufacturer level - to be or become a trend…
Great Example- Barbie- the movie- Up for Best Picture- It made everyone go crazy for Pink… but PINK was already in the marketplace in lots of shades, tints and tones- and when the movie became successful- pink was poised and ready to be POPULAR… it’s a great Example and good food for thought!
So to answer Your Question- I pay attention to what people are loving, enjoying, buying- and “paying attention to”… that is where the next trend lies … So… my advice - Pay Attention, Observe, Identify and then react to the Trend!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And what are some of your favorite design trends you’ve seen or created?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Favorite Trend- is “FLOWERS” - and how they have become mainstream with the consumer public! It was not always the case, unfortunately - so let’s keep it going! It also reinforces the trend- when we realize how Flowers can calm us, comfort us, bring us joy, reduce depression, reduce arguments, enlarge our circles of friends…
“The Power of Flowers” - is my Favorite Trend… because flowers are my life… and I pay attention to them… and so do millions of other people… Everyone Loves Flowers… it’s not a specific flower… but Flowers in General- People love Flowers and Flowers bring us Joy! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re a person that many look up to in our world, you’re a hero to some. Who are some of your design heroes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for that kind statement… I assume you mean “Flower” design heroes… and I’ll address it from that standpoint- even though some of my heroes are not from the world of flowers…
I have to say that I am an amalgamation of many designers and design styles- So Many people have affected the way I design and how I enjoy flowers- and thus they have become a part of me… and their influence brings me joy… so if that is a definition of a design hero… the list will be long…
My Flower Design “Influence” Heroes… Haskell Eargle… Mandy Majerik… Joe Smith …Bill Harper… Phil Rulloda…Eddie VonBargen…Mel Resendiz… My Dad- Mel Schwanke… Matt Wood… Mari Ignatowski… Talmage McLaurin… Cliff Mann… Bobbi Ecker-Blatchford… But then other Heroes- start to influence my life- and the way I present flowers… My Husband - Kelly Blank… Bob Ross… Mr Rogers… My Grandpa Carnation Joe…My Nanny- Dorothy Swanson…Pat Doyle… to name a few… You may not even know some of these people… but they all played very Heroic Parts in my life- Many still do- others were there for a reason or a season… none-the-less they are all HEROES and they all influence my Flowers!
Although - I have to state… there are also viewers, followers and fans that send in arrangements they have made that were inspired by my TV Show- and they are ALSO huge design heroes to me as well… and their style influences me too… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The industry and art seem to be accelerating in a different direction than before the year 2000. What impacts do you think social media and new tech has had on our art form?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is going to take “a minute” Thomas- as it’s a very complex question…
First of all when it comes to art and flowers- and how they intertwine… I want to talk about “ART in BLOOM” the interactive event created by the Boston Museum of Fine Art- over half a century ago… where local flower artists are invited to come into an art museum and are allowed to interpret a piece of art through flowers… I love that project- and I love seeing Flower Designers interpret a Piece of Art through Flowers… I think that is magnificent, magical, inspiring and thought provoking…
Art is subjective and thus- not every art form is appreciated by everyone… that is an important factor when we start to discuss ART- and Flowers…
“One man’s junk is another man’s art”… is a quote that is very meaningful- and again- the quote is also subjective…
Personally- I love pretty flowers- I enjoy arranging flowers… I LOVE-ADORE- and LIVE FOR Color… Color and Flowers is my thing… I think that color combinations are an art form as well… but again it’s subjective too… so Art is Subjective… I was trained in Ikenoba (a style or form of Ikebana) flower design in Japan- and my parents insisted that I learn that Art form as a young man (age 18)… so I could incorporate that into my design style- that was a huge blessing- and I am inspired by Ikebana- and Japanese Flower Design to this day…
I have great respect for any Artist- that creates Art- from the ether… Art is magical and Artists are Magical- Inspired and sometimes troubled… Van Gogh is a good example - great artist- amazing art- extremely troubled!
To that End… I hate AI- Artificial Intelligence and the fascination it occupies on social media. I think AI is dangerous- and AI degrades our respect for Art and Artists- Stephen Hawking warned us all that AI would be death of humankind… I think his warning is VERY IMPORTANT and Grave… I say this because I want you to know that I stand for ARTISTS- and their practice- and know and appreciate their value- and Talent!
Remember- I’m not fond of Social Media- I will honestly admit that… as I think it gave ANYONE the ability to share their opinion- and not have to defend it… people are mean on social media and have not accountability - that is what I dislike MOST about Social Media… Anyone can say mean things to anyone and not have to suffer the repercussions… Valerie Bertinelli came forward and made us all aware of this… She is a Hero of Mine as well!
I don’t appreciate that anyone can be portrayed as an Expert or ARTIST on Social Media- there is no vetting process… and that REALITY- SHOCK- are King on Social Media… I wish there was more kindness- and comfort on Social Media- that is why Kelly and I ALWAYS POST Flowers- on Social Media! We both believe that flowers offer Kindness, Comfort and Calm… and occasionally education.
I Strongly believe in the IMPORTANCE of knowing and embracing the Elements and Principles of Flower Design- I think there is merit to Line, Form, Balance, Color, Rhythm, Texture… the list goes on… You can only fully ‘break the rules” of design- by Understanding, Knowing and Practicing them… and I also believe that Flowers- are in themselves “Pretty” - however these Flowers are not always arranged in a Pretty fashion- (where attention has NOT been paid to the elements and principles of flower design - and in fact are poorly or unattractively arranged- without attention) Sometimes- these poorly arranged flowers are then claimed to be ART… to distract from the fact that they are not properly arranged or attractive- and I don’t find joy in that!
And I shall return to my original statement- “I believe that ALL Art is subjective” - even when it comes to flowers… Art is typically sold… and thus appreciated- I love watching the Antiques Roadshow - and seeing how Art Appreciates or Depreciates… it’s fascinating… Flowers are perishable… so they aren’t mean to hang on a wall for years like an oil painting or reside on a table like a bronze statue…
So… Flower Art is perishable (for the most part) and I don’t know if it’s advantageous for Florists to Create Flower Art for the masses… Many Times Flower Art- like what we see at the World Cup Competition- takes TIME… and it’s perishable- and I often question- if World Cup Art is salable… (that is not a requirement for the World Cup Competition to be clear) … but I wonder what the everyday flower consumer - thinks of flowers at that level… do they get it? Do they like it - and most of all - would they be willing to PAY for what it would cost- both in Labor, Hard Goods and Flower Quantities and Types? That doesn’t mean it’s not beautiful- but there is a definite line between Pretty Flowers that we put for Sale (and Hopefully Sell) and Flower ART for art’s sake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally- What J finds interest in- are attainable - salable- comfortable- and MOST IMPORTANTLY - Beautiful Flowers… that is my very own very personal and subjective preference… so I don’t know if it’s fair - for me to say what I like and don’t like when it comes to Flower Art … because my opinion is subjective…
I do however hate that Social Media allows anyone who creates flowers to post anything they make and claim it Flower art… I don’t like or need to see so many things I see on Social Media… thus- a call back- to what I said before- I enjoy tossing my phone aside and heading into the garden, or the local flower sellers cooler for my flowers to arrange- visiting a farmers market, cooking a dinner, or petting my dogs… All these things thrill me and I love and enjoy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If I bestowed you with three wishes you could use on the world of flowers and floristry, what would you wish for us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ability to Sell more Flowers to More People More Often- (without limit)… This would allow EVERYONE to Enjoy More Flowers- More Often … and allow Growers to Grow with Wild Abandon- Flower Sellers to Sell with Wild Abandon- and Consumers to Buy Flowers- with Wild Abandon… What a World that would be! SIGH… &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ability for all Flower People- (Designers, Enthusiasts, Sales People, Managers, Owners, Employees) to be Kind, Comforting, Inspiring and Loving toward Ourselves, Others- and the Entire Industry… (I feel this is a concealed Wish for World Peace- honestly) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Unending Revenue Stream for FLOWER EDUCATIONAL EVENTS- to benefit both Past Present and Future Florists… This would allow us to learn from one another- past present and future- and Move Forward with Success, Positivity and Joy… &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many of us have a favorite design style or a style at least that we are most comfortable in. Out of all the different styles of Floral Design that exist which ones are your favorites?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty Flowers (FIRST and FOREMOST) - arranged in a comfortable, calming style that incites Joy and Kindness - (I love Creative Naturalism— mixed with color and texture)  This is best achieved by mixing a little Haskell Eargle, Bill Harper, Matt Wood, and Joe Smith with Pretty Flowers and Foliage… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have this is your design style, sir. In looking at your instagram account- you embrace color- and pretty flowers…you do it VERY VERY WELL! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to PICK my Favorite- and Most Important Element or Principle of Flower Design Style- it would be COLOR- I think it’s so effective- and helps us “Turn our Feelings into Flowers” in a very memorable and eye-catching way! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Florists in the millennial generation will probably look back at the pandemic as a particularly trying time for the floral industry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you will allow me to address this statement first… I will ALWAYS look back on the pandemic as the TIME that Flowers became Necessary for EVERYONE- it was one of the largest and most profitable times in the flower industry… and the CONSUMER PUBLIC became graphically and personally aware of the POSITIVE Health and Wellness Benefits of Cut Flowers… It is possibly one of the MOST IMPORTANT times for the Flower Industry Bar None! It was a gift the universe gave to the Flower Industry… In my Opinion… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any other times before that you can remember that were also especially difficult or uncertain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is another interesting fact… during the great Depression… My Grandfather was running our family flower shop in Nebraska… and while everyone else was struggling- he noticed that flowers were becoming an “affordable luxury-“ - and that people were realizing that flowers made them feel better… so my Grandfather- was becoming very busy at the flower shop (actually doing ok financially)… because people were finding-  .05 - .10 - or .15 cents to spend on a simple bunch of flowers- to put in the house to make everyone feel better… so the Infamous Great Depression- that downturn or struggle- was somehow ALSO providing a beneficial time for flowers… florists, flower growers and sellers…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus- In my opinion- downturns- or difficult times- provide a unique and positive opportunity for flowers…and Florists-  and thus- I feel that FLOWER POWER is a real thing and it’s something very important for us to remember- as times get tough- FLORISTS- get TOUGHER- and Bring on the Flower Power! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your favorite flower of all time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a Super Difficult Question… I can’t narrow it to one Flower… I will apologize- I have a Group of Flowers- I can always depend on to bring me joy- here they are in no particular order… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Broad Flower Variety- I love Carnations Most of All… It’s a Family thing too… We Grew Carnations in my families greenhouses- and my Grandpa and Father always wore a Red Carnation… I love how they are en vogue again… and that there are new colors, varieties, shapes, styles and texture… I love the clove smell of a carnation...I Love mini-carnations and Standard Carnations… Carnations are so long lasting… I love them… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I Love Gardenias- there is nothing better than going to sleep or awakening to the smell of gardenias… and thus I love Stemmed Gardenias that can be arranged in a vase… like the ones that High Camp Supply sells… those are amazing… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I Love the smell of Freesia Too… Yellow Freesia used to have the best smell… but these days there is a rusty brown colored one- that has an incredible intense fun- fruity smell… I always joke that Fressia’s Smell like Froot Loops… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zinnias- I adore Zinnias- and I especially love the Queeny Lime Variety- that is green with rose and orange overtones… it’s in the Cinderella Variety Expanse… I love arranging Zinnias- all summer long- it’s a joy… and they make me happy! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roses- I love Roses that smell like Roses… Helga Piaget, Yves Piaget, Sweet Moments, in my world… I love a Rose that smells like a classic rose... That is what makes life wonderful- when Roses have a Rose Fragrance… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally- I have to offer the famous Quote from Claude Monet “ I must always have flowers- always and always!”… So it really doesn’t matter… as long as there are flowers- I will be happy! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you hope to see from the floral industry in the future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope to always see Pretty Flowers… I hope to see kinder, gentler and less division in our Flower Industry- I hope to see a resurgence and priority put on education! I hope to see the consumers interest and consumption of flowers- continue to grow- unceasingly…  Flower Power Forever!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many films and TV shows include floristry in their set designs, are there any films or TV shows you can think of that included Florist particularly well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reminds me of a funny idiosyncrasy of mine… I always See the Flowers in a Film or TV… I can’t help but see them… and I critic them… MOST COMMONLY on availability… I watched a movie set in the 1950’s about Truman Capote - it was a wonderful period piece - and they had a Single Alstroemeria in a vase on a table… and I thought (and brought to everyone’s attention) that Alstroemerias had NOT yet been discovered nor would they have been commercially available at that time… and I couldn’t stop talking about it… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kel jokes that - it’s an annoying habit I have… I had similar reactions to the flowers- that were created for “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel … style and flower type were not always correct for the period of time… ALTHOUGH they were GORGEOUS and I loved seeing them… They were Pretty Flowers- but not always historically accurate. I still love that series- and I loved EVERY SINGLE SECOND…  and I loves seeing flowers added so profusely to the series… My Crew thought I should write a letter and offer to the be flower consultant!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I would be remiss- if I didn’t include “ J Schwanke’s Life in Bloom” on Public Television! I believe it represents Floristry Very Well… and encourages anyone to include flowers in their life at every/any avenue… Flowers become accessible to everyone- and they are brought back into every situation… that is something that I am very proud of… and also why I think the show is so beloved by our viewers! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who’s your favorite author, painter, musician, and film director?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Favorite Author: David Sedaris- Brilliant and Laugh Out Loud Funny!
My Favorite Painter: Mary Blair - American Artist and Animator- for Walt Disney- Her concept art is amazing… I hope to own one - someday!
My Favorite Musician: Joey DeFrancesco- American Jazz Organist (and Trumpeter) but I’m in love with Hammond Jazz Organ Music… 
My Favorite Film Director: I don’t really follow directors… I enjoy all kinds of movies- and I don’t group them by Director… I look at the content - and when I love it… I can admire the director of that film… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final question, what is your most cherished flower related memory?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it has to be the wisdom and advice of Mrs. Jan Therien - from Fremont Nebraska, my High School Guidance Counselor… When I was a Junior in High School - had a meeting with Jan - to decide what I was going to do with my life… what career I was going to pursue to ensure- that I would be on the road to success and also have the classes needed to follow my dream…  here’s how the dialog went… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan: What do you want to be when you graduate from school?
J: A Zookeeper (I always have and still do have an inordinate love and ultimate fascination with animals- and especially Zoological Parks and Zoo Animals)
Jan: Really???- Well- you know how difficult that will be- as you have to become a doctor of Zoology- that means BIOLOGY… CHEMISTRY, PHYSICS, 
and MATH- You realize how you are presently doing in those courses- and that you don’t do well in those studies- You do better in the Fine Arts… 
Drama, Art … and it’s going to be a lot of hard work and studying… and If I may be frank… You seem to be kind of lazy… 
J: (Not Surprised… I was Lazy- and Hated Math and Studying… Let’s be honest… I get it and Jan knew me well) … Well… then what do YOU think I 
should do???
Jan: You’re a 4th Generation Florist- You know more about Flowers- than Anyone I know- ALREADY- without even studying- YOU love flowers
and You could be a great florist- without much effort… I think that might be a good thing - Join your family business and become a Florist… arranging
flowers- creating window displays- running your family flower business- seems like a good idea to me… What do you think????
J: Sounds like a Great Plan… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Here we are today… I have a National TV Show about Flowers- that reaches 98 Million People every day- I have a successful website and series of videos that have educated florists around the world- in the art of Floristry- I love Flowers- and I Love what I do… and Jan Therien- is in my Opinion- the Greatest High School Guidance Counselor of All TIME… she gave it to me straight… and I became a Blooming Success!&lt;/p&gt;

,osr,"I like to DM OSR modules but using 5e rules. (Why? Because I like the old-school, interactive problem-solving dungeon crawling experience, but I also like the well-oiled modern system that is 5e. Crazy but true). 5e lacks clear procedures for resource management, encounters and dungeon/hex crawling, and the danger level tends to feel low, but these things can be solved by importing some ‘houserules’ and tables directly from OSRIC and/or OSE. 

Of course you cannot have your cake and eat it. There is one particular aspect of 5e that doesn’t go away easily. In ADND, when rolling up your character you will hardly get any stat bonuses to attack rolls (aka THAC0), armor class, hit points etc.. Bonuses will be essentially 0 in the normal human range, but strongly increasing around the edges (5- and 16+), becoming comparable to 5e just outside the human range (at 19-20). And a second big difference is that you don't have any direct influence on reaching these high numbers. Compare this to 5e, where you build up your stats in a controlled way when gaining levels. 

**Has anyone here tried to plug 1e-style stat bonuses directly into 5e?**

\[Babbling continues\] The major effects of the 1e system are that a) there is no spending time on min-maxing, and b) (stat-boosting) magic items become very attractive, since these are the most important way to obtaining superhuman powers. This is in line with the idea that the quest for magic items (and other loot) is a main driver in 1e ADND.

Chances to hit also vary much more widely in 1e, for 3 major reasons: as (let’s say) a fighter, your to hit bonus (THAC0) starts at 0 but increases at a pace of 1 per level; monster armor classes vary more widely in 1e compared to 5e; and magic items have bonuses from 1 to 5 (compared to 1-3 in 5e). The fighter sometimes faces monsters that are easily chopped down, but at other times his to-hit chances go down to almost 0. Player experience then becomes a larger factor in making the right judgment. Also, a fighter is weaker at Level 1 compared to 5e (based on to hit chances alone) but catches up somewhere between levels 5 and 10 (also depending on magic items). 

Taken together, in 1e  fighters (used here as a standard for evaluation) face more uncertainty in combat and have little control over their development, and they have to compensate by focusing on collecting magical treasure and knowing when to flee.

This drive to ‘advance through play’ is missing a bit in 5e and it seems difficult to re-introduce without significantly messing with the system. But as I mentioned, maybe somebody tried to do this anyway?",t2_bssgx57f,False,,0,False,ADND stat bonuses in 5e?,[],r/osr,False,,,0.0,,,True,t3_1aewukm,False,dark,1.0,,public,1.0,0.0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,,1706642626.0,text,,,,text,self.osr,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like to DM OSR modules but using 5e rules.

Crazy but true). 5e lacks clear procedures for resource management, encounters and dungeon/hex crawling, and the danger level tends to feel low, but these things can be solved by importing some ‘houserules’ and tables directly from OSRIC and/or OSE. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course you cannot have your cake and eat it. There is one particular aspect of 5e that doesn’t go away easily.

## Release Schedule

The 7.5.0 Update and the Dead by Daylight: Alan Wake Chapter will be available starting at 12PM ET. (This is an estimate and may very from platform to platform.)

## Features

### Field of View Settings

There is a new settings option in DbD! Players now have the ability to adjust their FOV, or field-of-view, with a slider in the Settings Menu. This allows players with a first-person-camera (Killers, with the exception of The Good Guy) to adjust their field-of-view, reducing motion-sickness and other accessibility issues. This feature is initially in the Beta Tab while we allow for thorough testing.

### FOV Perk Updates

* **Shadowborn**
   * When blinded by any means, gain a 6/8/10% Haste Status Effect for 10 seconds *(new functionality)*
* **Monitor and Abuse**
   * While in a chase, your Terror Radius is increased by 8 meters. Otherwise, your Terror Radius is decreased by 8 meters *(FoV clause was removed)*

### Generators System Update

The 3-gen strategy (identifying the closest 3 Generators and defending only them) has become very strong, especially on certain Killers. This can lead to very long games and frustration. To help prevent such situations, the following now applies:

* Each Generator can only suffer 8 regression events maximum.
* After the max has been reached on a Generator, that Generator can no longer be regressed by the Killer (including kicks, Add-ons, and Perk-related regressions).
   * Number of regressions per Generator is indicated by increasing VFX after 3 or more regression events.
   * Gens at max regression events cannot regress by the Killer (including kicks, Add-ons, and Perk-related regressions).
* Survivors failing Skill Checks still regress Generators normally and do not count as regression events.
* Killer kick regression is increased from 2.5% to 5%.
* ""Gen tapping"" is no longer possible. To stop a Generator from regressing, a Survivor must repair 5% of the Generator.
   * Regression does not occur while repairs are in progress.

### Perks Affected

* **Hex: Ruin**
   * All Generators are affected by *Hex: Ruin*. While a Generator is not being repaired by a Survivor, it will immediately and automatically regress repair progress at 50%/75%/100% of the normal regression speed. *(no longer deactivates when a Survivor is killed).*
* **Surge** and **Scourge Hook: Pain Resonance**
   * *Does not create a loud noise notification if no progress is lost on the Generator.*
* **Oppression**
   * *Only causes a regression event on the Generator that was kicked.*
* **Overcharge**
   * *Only the initiating kick counts as a regression event.*

## Content

* Re-enabled the Nowhere to Hide Perk.
* Re-enabled The Knight Killer.

### New Survivor - Alan Wake

Dead by Daylight welcomes a new famous Survivor into The Fog - Alan Wake!

### Perks

* **Champion of Light**

Press and hold the Power button to break into a Chainsaw Sprint. Survivors hit during a Chainsaw Sprint are put into the dying state. Revving the Chainsaw, and sprinting with the Chainsaw each cause the Overdrive meter to increase.

### Maps

* **Mount Ormond updates**

We made some changes to Mount Ormond. The layout and main building are staying the same. but we decided to address the fact that the front of the Building, representing an entrance, had no gameplay or interesting loop. It was a big pile of rocks and not much else. So we went updated the gameplay to make it more fluid and fitting with the loops and to actually add gameplay. The Art team went through as well to make things look nice.

In the back of the building we had a couple of tiles that were simple loops, but that didn't have interesting gameplay. We updated this and improved the quality there as well.

&lt;h2&gt;Release Schedule&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 7.5.0 Update and the Dead by Daylight: Alan Wake Chapter will be available starting at 12PM ET. (This is an estimate and may very from platform to platform.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Field of View Settings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a new settings option in DbD! Players now have the ability to adjust their FOV, or field-of-view, with a slider in the Settings Menu. This allows players with a first-person-camera (Killers, with the exception of The Good Guy) to adjust their field-of-view, reducing motion-sickness and other accessibility issues. This feature is initially in the Beta Tab while we allow for thorough testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;FOV Perk Updates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shadowborn&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When blinded by any means, gain a 6/8/10% Haste Status Effect for 10 seconds &lt;em&gt;(new functionality)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor and Abuse&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While in a chase, your Terror Radius is increased by 8 meters. Otherwise, your Terror Radius is decreased by 8 meters &lt;em&gt;(FoV clause was removed)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Generators System Update&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 3-gen strategy (identifying the closest 3 Generators and defending only them) has become very strong, especially on certain Killers. This can lead to very long games and frustration. To help prevent such situations, the following now applies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each Generator can only suffer 8 regression events maximum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the max has been reached on a Generator, that Generator can no longer be regressed by the Killer (including kicks, Add-ons, and Perk-related regressions).

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of regressions per Generator is indicated by increasing VFX after 3 or more regression events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gens at max regression events cannot regress by the Killer (including kicks, Add-ons, and Perk-related regressions).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Survivors failing Skill Checks still regress Generators normally and do not count as regression events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Killer kick regression is increased from 2.5% to 5%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Gen tapping&amp;quot; is no longer possible. To stop a Generator from regressing, a Survivor must repair 5% of the Generator.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regression does not occur while repairs are in progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Perks Affected&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hex: Ruin&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All Generators are affected by &lt;em&gt;Hex: Ruin&lt;/em&gt;. While a Generator is not being repaired by a Survivor, it will immediately and automatically regress repair progress at 50%/75%/100% of the normal regression speed. &lt;em&gt;(no longer deactivates when a Survivor is killed).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surge&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Scourge Hook: Pain Resonance&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does not create a loud noise notification if no progress is lost on the Generator.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oppression&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only causes a regression event on the Generator that was kicked.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overcharge&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only the initiating kick counts as a regression event.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Content&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-enabled the Nowhere to Hide Perk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-enabled The Knight Killer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;New Survivor - Alan Wake&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dead by Daylight welcomes a new famous Survivor into The Fog - Alan Wake!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Perks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Champion of Light&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While you are holding a Flashlight, this Perk activates. When you are shining a flashlight, you have 50% Haste. When you successfully blind the Killer, they also gain 20% Hindered for 6 seconds. This effect cannot stack with itself. Then, this Perk goes on cool-down for 80/70/60 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boon: Illumination&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press and hold the &lt;em&gt;Ability button 1&lt;/em&gt; near a Dull or Hex Totem to bless it and create a Boon Totem. Soft chimes ring out in a 24 meter range. Survivors inside your Boon Totem’s range see the aura of all Chests and all Generators in blue. If you have a lit Boon Totem, you cleanse or bless Totems 6/8/10% faster. You can only bless one Totem at a time. All equipped Boon Perks are active on your Boon Totem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadline&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This Perk activates when you are injured. Skill Checks appear 6/8/10% more frequently when repairing or healing and appear in random places. The penalty for missing Skill Checks is reduced by 50%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Killer Update - The Hillbilly&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Killer Power&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Press and hold the Power button to break into a Chainsaw Sprint. Survivors hit during a Chainsaw Sprint are put into the dying state. Revving the Chainsaw, and sprinting with the Chainsaw each cause the Overdrive meter to increase. The meter decreases when the Chainsaw is not in use. When the meter is full, the Chainsaw goes into Overdrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Base changes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased Chainsaw Sprint movement speed to 10.12 m/s &lt;em&gt;(was 9.2 m/s).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decreased the Chainsaw hit cooldown to 2.7 seconds &lt;em&gt;(was 3 seconds).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decreased the Chainsaw miss cooldown to 2.5 seconds &lt;em&gt;(was 3 seconds).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased movement speed during the Chainsaw miss cooldown to 2.3 m/s &lt;em&gt;(was 1.38 m/s).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decreased the size of the Chainsaw&amp;#39;s collision to improve navigation during a Chainsaw Sprint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disconnected the Chainsaw&amp;#39;s sensitivity from controller sensitivity.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baseline sensitivity was set to 100% of the controller sensitivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Special State: Overdrive&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in Overdrive, the Chainsaw is enhanced. Chainsaw Charge and Sprint speeds are increased, and Chainsaw Sprint cooldowns are reduced. Overdrive lasts for 20 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Base Overdrive stats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chainsaw charge speed increased by 5%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chainsaw Sprint movement speed increased to 13 m/s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chainsaw cooldowns reduced by 10%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Addons&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Survivors hit with the Chainsaw suffer from the Mangled and Hemorrhage Status Effects until fully healed &lt;em&gt;(new functionality).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thermal Casing&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(was Punctured Muffler)&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decreases the speed at which heat dissipates when not using the Chainsaw by 20% &lt;em&gt;(new functionality).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Thompson&amp;#39;s Mix&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(was Black Grease)&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decrease recovery time after using the Chainsaw by 12% &lt;em&gt;(new functionality).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iridescent Engravings&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(was Doom Engravings)&lt;/em&gt; 

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increases the Chainsaw Sprint turn rate by 45% &lt;em&gt;(was 44%, &amp;amp; removed functionality).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Misc.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a new loading tip regarding the Overdrive meter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added new score events when using the Chainsaw:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curve: When turning a minimum of 80 degrees within 1 second of using the Chainsaw.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curve Hit: When hitting a Survivor with the Chainsaw within 2 seconds of getting the Curve score event.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Sprint Hit: When hitting a Survivor with the Chainsaw after travelling more than 32 meters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Killer Update - The Onryo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Demanifested State&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While Demanifested:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Onryo can gain Bloodlust as usual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Onryo can enter chases as usual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Demanifesting:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bloodlust is no longer lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase Demanifested state invisibility duration from 1 to 1.2 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Killer Power&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teleport cooldown from previous update removed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Condemned gained from teleports increased to 1 full stack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Power Meter:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resets on teleport and charges automatically afterwards (10 seconds).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the power meter is at 98% or more when teleporting, the teleport applies Condemned to Survivors within 16 meters of the TV where The Onryo projected or any other powered TV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the power meter is &amp;lt;98%, no Condemned is applied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Powered TVs:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now have VFX showing range at all times (when powered).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are revealed to Survivors within 16 meters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hooking a Survivor locks in up to 2 stacks of Condemned (applies for each hook action). These stacks become impossible to remove.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;VHS Tapes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tapes no longer grant protection from gaining Condemned while holding them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Survivors no longer gain Condemned if hit while holding a Tape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Survivors no longer lose their Tape when attacked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Survivors must bring their Tape to the furthest TV.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highlighted in yellow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retrieving a Tape now takes 1 second &lt;em&gt;(was 2).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inserting a Tape in a TV now takes 1 second &lt;em&gt;(was 2).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Addons&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Videotape Copy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increases the range at which Survivors gain Condemned from Projection by 2 meters &lt;em&gt;(new functionality).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reiko&amp;#39;s Watch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increases the invisibility duration while Demanifested by 25% &lt;em&gt;(was 33%).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ring Drawing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When hooking a Survivor carrying a Tape, other Survivors gain 1 Condemned stack &lt;em&gt;(new functionality).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tape Editing&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Deck&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each Survivor starts the Trial with a Tape in their possession, and their target TV is the furthest from their location &lt;em&gt;(no change).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Survivors that insert their Tape are revealed for 6 seconds &lt;em&gt;(new functionality).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iridescent Videotape&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projection does not turn off TVs, and does not apply Condemned &lt;em&gt;(new functionality).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TVs turned off by Survivors take 20% longer to turn back on &lt;em&gt;(new functionality).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Killer Addon Updates - The Blight&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blighted Rat&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increases Rush speed by 2% for each consecutive Rush &lt;em&gt;(was 4%).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blighted Crow&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increases Rush speed by 3% for each consecutive Rush &lt;em&gt;(was 6%).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adrenaline Vial&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increases maximum Rush tokens by 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increases maximum Rush look angle by 20 degrees.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increases Rush speed by 5%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;(adjusted functionality)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alchemist&amp;#39;s Ring&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increases Rush duration by 20% for each consecutive Rush &lt;em&gt;(new functionality).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compound Thirty-Three&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increases Rush turn rate by 11% for each consecutive Rush that travels at least 3 meters, up to a maximum of 33% &lt;em&gt;(new functionality).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iridescent Blight Tag&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enables Rush to be performed without spending tokens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rush bonuses are capped after 3 consecutive rushes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blighted Corruption goes on cooldown for 20 seconds after a Lethal Rush attack, missing a Slam, or breaking a Pallet with Blighted Corruption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;(new functionality)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Perk Updates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick Gambit&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you are chased by the Killer, see the Auras of Gens within 36 meters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Survivors working on highlighted Generators receives a 6/7/8% speed boost to the repair action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;(new functionality)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Save the Best for Last&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You become Obsessed with one Survivor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earn a Token for each successful basic attack that is not dealt to the Obsession&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each Token grants a stackable 4% &lt;em&gt;(was 5%)&lt;/em&gt; decreased successful basic attack cooldown, you can earn up to 6/7/8 tokens. &lt;em&gt;(was 8 tokens)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When hitting the Obsession with a basic attack or special attack, lose 2 Tokens. You cannot gain Tokens as long as the Obsession is sacrificed or killed. &lt;em&gt;(adjusted damage source and tokens lost)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grim Embrace&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each time a Survivor is hooked for the first time, gain a Token, then when you leave a 16 meter range of that hook, all Generators are blocked for 8/10/12 seconds. &lt;em&gt;(new functionality)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upon reaching 4 Tokens, when you leave a 16 meter range of that hook, The Entity instead blocks all Generators for 40 seconds. The Obsession&amp;#39;s aura is revealed to you for 6 seconds. &lt;em&gt;(Increased times, added proximity clause)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, this Perk deactivates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Events&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modifier: Lights Out&lt;/strong&gt; will be active from February 7, 2024 11:00am ET to February 14, 2024 11:00am ET.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;Modifier: Lights Out&lt;/strong&gt; event Tome will also open while the Modifier is active.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Maps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mount Ormond updates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made some changes to Mount Ormond. The layout and main building are staying the same. but we decided to address the fact that the front of the Building, representing an entrance, had no gameplay or interesting loop. It was a big pile of rocks and not much else. So we went updated the gameplay to make it more fluid and fitting with the loops and to actually add gameplay. The Art team went through as well to make things look nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the back of the building we had a couple of tiles that were simple loops, but that didn&amp;#39;t have interesting gameplay. We updated this and improved the quality there as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bug Fixes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Archives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue where The Archives Challenges could be completed when playing Tutorial Bot Match.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue where the Memory Shard visual effects would not stop drawing when in Spectator mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue where the Challenge descriptions of Core Memory: Stray Thoughts were inconsistent with other Core Memory Challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue where the Tome 17 Back-to-Back Challenge would gain unintended progress from non-consecutive Skill Checks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue where the Knockout Challenge would gain progress if a Survivor activated the Plot Twist Perk to put themselves in the dying state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue where the A Stunning Display Challenge would not gain progress after wiggling free from the Killer&amp;#39;s grasp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue where the That&amp;#39;s Rude Challenge would not gain progress when pointing at the Killer within five (5) seconds of the Premonition Perk activating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Undying Influence Challenge now properly tracks Totems ignited by the Hex: Plaything Perk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Plot Twist Perk no longer gives progress towards the Killer Challenge Knockout (Remix).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The That’s Rude Challenge now correctly gains progress when pointing towards the Killer after activating the Premonition Perk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Audio&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed issues that caused the Thorn SFX from the 3 Generator System to be too loud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduced The Hillbilly&amp;#39;s Chainsaw volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Bots&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bots no longer self-heal immediately after being unhooked. They will first try to get healed by the person that got the unhook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bots now have different priorities between different self interactions (self mend being the highest priority, and self care being the lowest priority)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bots no longer enter an infinite loop when injured and holding a Medkit and a special item.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bots self-healing is now more consistent: they correctly see the interaction as possible while moving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Players can now signal a bot for their attention by either using the &amp;quot;come here&amp;quot; emote or by t-bagging. Unless they have something urgent, they&amp;#39;ll drop what they&amp;#39;re doing and heal the player or let themselves get healed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bots now change the priority of their interactions when they are targeting a specific interactor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When bots drop their Flashbang to grab and use a Spray or Serum, they will immediately pick back up their Flashbang once they&amp;#39;re done healing themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bots no longer stop in front of certain vaults.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Characters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Knight can no longer summon many Guards at the same time when vaulting a window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue that caused the Pebble throw animation from male Survivors to be misaligned with the camera&amp;#39;s orientation when using the Diversion Perk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue that caused Struggling Survivors to clip outside of The Demogorgon&amp;#39;s arm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue that caused Nancy&amp;#39;s red plaid skirt to clips into her leg while running in the tally screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The screen no longer turns black for spectators after The Cenobite teleports to the Lament Configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Environment/Maps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue in Nostromo Wreckage where The Nurse would get stuck in the main building.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue in Mount Ormond where a collision would block the Guards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue in the Crotus Prenn Asylum where players could walk on the visually inaccessible ramp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue in Mount Ormond where debris would prevent The Mastermind from moving properly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue in the Underground Complex where the Killers could not drop down a hole in the Rift room.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue in the Underground Complex where The Knight&amp;#39;s Guards are unable to climb the stairs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Perks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue where players would end up with unleveled perks if they have leveled it in lobby without opening the loadout menu before loading into a Trial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Survivors equipped with the Visionary Perk will see the Aura of the claws on a Generator blocked by the Corrupt Intervention Perk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;UI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue where the &amp;quot;Controller Disconnected&amp;quot; pop-up does not appear when the controller is disconnected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue where a popup message displays an option to buy Auric Cells when the item cannot be purchased with Auric Cells.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue that caused the hook vignette to remain visible on screen in smaller scale while Survivors were being sacrificed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue that caused Survivors to be sacrificed a little before the End Game Collapse’s progression bar became empty.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue that caused The Demogorgon’s Open Portal bar to remain white when equipped with the Rat Tail Add-on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue that caused the progress bar of nearby Generators, Totems or Chests not to be displayed when equipped with a Key or Map.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue where some tooltips in bot loadout had their header off screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Misc&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue where players could be stuck in a loop loading when attempting to start a Trial in a Custom Game with 6 players.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fixes from PTB&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Characters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Cannibal’s Speed Limiter Add-on correctly gives bonus Bloodpoints for the Chainsaw Hit score event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hillbilly’s movement speed no longer increases when colliding with an asset during a Chainsaw Sprint just as Override activates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue that caused some animations to be missing for female Survivors when repairing one side of a Generator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Undetectable Status Effect is properly granted when playing as The Blight with both the Iridescent Blight Tag and Vigo’s Journal Add-ons equipped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Onryo can no longer turn invisible when using the Nowhere to Hide Perk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Killer Instinct is now properly shown when The Twins’ Victor is Dormant close to Survivors hidden in Lockers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;FOV&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Players can no longer bypass the minimum and maximum FOV by editing the ini files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The FOV setting is correctly saved between sessions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Restore Defaults button correctly resets the FOV setting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Generators&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The minimum repair indicator to stop regression no longer appears on Generators that are not regressing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The minimum repair indicator no longer appears if the Generator regression is stopped by something other than repairing the Generator, such as when the Hex: Ruin Totem is Cleansed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eruption no longer applies its effects if the Generator is not damaged because it has already accrued the maximum number of regression events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Missing the Overcharge Skill Check no longer causes a Generator with no repair progress to regress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generators that are blocked after having accrued the maximum number of regression events can no longer be regressed by The Legion’s Fuming Mix Tape Add-on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Misc.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Survivors may no longer become invisible when interacting with a Locker at the same time as another Character.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Characters may no longer get pushed when interacting with a Locker at the same time as another Character.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Perks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Chest Auras reveal by the Boon: Illumination Perk are now hidden when affected by the Blindness Status Effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Champion of Light Perk no longer applies the Hindered Status Effect to the Killer when blinded by something other than a Flashlight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Shadowborn Perk icon now only lights up when the Perk is active.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Save the Best for Last Perk no longer sometimes fails to lose Tokens when hitting the Obsession when other Obsession Perks are equipped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue that may cause players to become desynced when the Decisive Strike Perk was triggered at the same time the Killer was Stunned in another way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Plot Twist Perk icon is no longer lit up when the Survivor is healthy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hex: Thrill of the Hunt Perk now has the proper number of Tokens when re-ignited by the Hex: Undying Perk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Endurance Status Effect granted by the We’re Gonna Live Forever Perk now counts towards the Humanitarian achievement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Known Issues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily Rituals button is unresponsive when coming to the Main menu from the Archives or a Killer lobby. This can be fixed by visiting any other menus and coming back to the Main menu. The daily rituals button is also accessible in any Lobby or the Tally.&lt;/li&gt;

,MonopolyGoTrading,"Hey,

monopoly go is a great game but sometimes , I feel like there could be some adjustments made to overall increase the gaming experience and I would like to share them. These are just broad ideas and modifications could be subject to change. Let me know what y'all think about these:

1. Chance cards should hold event tokens if an event is ongoing, where the tokens are on the map (partners, peg-e, treasure hunt). 

2. Forge Gold Cards:
       
The ability to forge gold cards out of normal equal star cards. Gold cards are usually hard to obtain. A cool addition to the treasure, could be a forge system that gives you a random gold card, if you put in the amount of standard cards (10x5🌟would probably be logical but almost impossible to obtain). Also it would take away stars from the treasure, to make it a little more balanced.
1 🌟 Gold	25x 1🌟 Standard
2🌟 Gold	20x 2🌟 Standard
3🌟 Gold	15x 3🌟 Standard
4🌟 Gold	15x 4🌟 Standard
5🌟 Gold	5x   5🌟 Standard


3. Addition of skill-based mini games. Like 2v2 events with milestones where you and a friend compete against two others. Dont have one specific in mind but sounds cool. Something like memory or sum.

4. Seasonal Battle Pass with rewards of: tokens, shield skins, sticker packs, dice, emojis; w/events: (like High Roller, Wheel Boost, Sticker Boom etc.
 
Example
Lv 44	4🌟 Sticker Pack
Lv 45	1hr Sticker Boom
Lv 46	New Shield Skin
Lv 47	2500 Dice
Lv 48	New Emojy
Lv 49	5 Star Sticker Pack
Lv 50	New Token

Lasting the whole season, with tasks like quick win, just a little bit harder to collect tokens for milestones.Affordable!

5. switch partners in partner event if the partner has under 10k after 2 days in. Reduce max to 70k. This would make people to work onto the cakes simultaneously, without being completely left off rewards. Otherwise a switching partner system could also end up being a snitching partner system; If you switch partners, allow to take 35% of the process to the new cake. (Probably to less but better that nothing, 50% also possible)

6. Take Golden blitz votings or atleast count amount or atleast fix gold card spam out of packs. No one needs a golden blitz for a card everyone has about 20 times

7. Less milestones in solo tournaments for people with less dice. By that i mean dont raise them for the people with more dice, just lowering them for people with low dice who can make almost no profit of tournaments because a reward of 1200 dice will cost them their hard fought 1300 dice and the next few rewards wont even be dice until the next reward is 2000 Dice for 27.550 milestone points. Been there, done that. no fun actually.

8. allow gifting. pege tokens, puzzles, pockaxes, dice. whatever. cap it. don't. just let people gift their 7000 extra pieces rather than it being turned into 60 mio cash which is one quick win and they still put 2-3k dice in for.

9. Implement repeating bonus rounds for people who actually finish tournaments. I dont wanna be out of the game because i finished a tournament 1d early. Make repeating bonuses of 100 dices, 2 star packs whatever, just dont let me play for nothing or not play at all. Its called addiction.

10. Multiple Sticker Exchange. Would make star trading also safer.

11. Give ""Go-to-jail"" space some value. For the love of god, my man is just existing for corner events. Please send us to jail, take bail, give him anything. hes probably feeling useless :(

12. Remove. cash grab. ty

13. Event Shops: Event shops for residual event tokens like partner events, peg-e, pickaxes after completing the event           
        Example:
100 Peg-E	2 Star Sticker Pack/ 150 Dice
200 Peg-E	3 Star Sticker Pack/300 Dice
300 Peg-E	4 Star Sticker Pack/ 400 Dice
400 Peg-E	5 Star Sticker Pack/ 500 Dice

,AlgorandOfficial,"# Stepping Up

In the last episode from [The Next Block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCKa5zWezFg&amp;t=3386s), Staci Warden had been asked about Johns tweet, proposing to focus on the fundamentals of the roadmap and stop the less effective programs. She stated, privately:

*“… chances are high to face out old government rewards completely. You are not going to get paid making votes anymore, you are going to get paid by keeping this network secure. Also as part of this .… should DeFi and NFT rewards not go into xGovs?”* (In competition with other xGovs proposals)

I am very happy about Staci making this statement. Sure, who doesn’t like to get subsidized, but those payments won’t matter much if we are not able to turn this ship around, together. When I walked my Dog today (yes, the one in the picture), I got an idea I wanted to formalize, so maybe we can make sense out of it together and discuss its merits and shortfalls.

This is exactly what this post is all about. If there is something most of us will certainly agree on, it is that quite some of the past initiatives have been a shot in the foot. I am very glad about the directional turn the Foundation took, for them to learn from past mistakes, decoupling from early day hubris and focusing on the very cornerstones of Algorand. Staci is not keen on putting money on the table to farm FOMO, and I like it. We want to be the adult in the room, and while we do not have the treasuries of some of our most well-equipped competitors, we have a technical foundation that is, as we all know, “fit for purpose”. But what we are in dire need of is not merely a technical matter, but a matter of community and shared identity. If we want to succeed, we have to grow up, step up, and aspire to be more than mere speculators, riding on the back of the Foundation. Staci is never tired, and rightfully so, to appeal to the community to step up and take part in this endeavor in tandem with the foundation, for it is of no ones benefit to lay back and play the blame game. Indeed, the resources of the Foundation are limited, and it is on us to bring in our individual strengths and fresh ideas, to engage in discussions and to aspire, in the brotherly spirit of free and open source software, to create a common good and a social environment we share together.

# The Coming Network Update: A Chance for Change

In my opinion, we have too many processes competing with one another. Governance, XGovernance, DeFi incentives, soon node incentives … the construct is not loosely coupled and often creates friction between incentives, negating possible long term benefits. Staci seems to agree. But how do we streamline Governance and Node incentives efficiently?

The last few days I have been thinking about the current network incentives, and what it would take to streamline incentives, network security, distribution and fairness in the best way I could come up to. While I am not a gifted software developer by trade, but only a humble philosopher, I would like to initiate a discussion about possible incentive mechanics we would like to see in the future, and to evaluate them together to separate the brain fart from the viable, the wheat from the chaff. Therefore, I am presenting to you a simplistic model I thought about the last few days, and I hope for a fruitful discussion, and if not, at least a fun humble theory-crafting session. This is not meant to be a quantitative analysis, but a qualitative discussion about the applied game theory.

# The PAL(Participation Activity Level) Protocol

The PAL model is completely based on incentivisation for running Participation Nodes *and* for wide participation in staking on these nodes, that’s where the acronym is coming from. It’s raison d'être is basically: *One PAL for All, all PALs for One.*

**To summarise the goals of the PAL model:**

1. Incentivise people of \_all balances\_ to run participation nodes
2. Create a reward structure that does not create friction with the XGov process
3. In Fact, create a reward structure that ultimately plays in sync with xGov
4. Punish PALs with low availability and reward true PALs (like we all should \_cough\_)
5. PALs should be predictably rewarded for for their support
6. Get rid of pooling in the traditional sense
7. Reduce the possibility to game the system by applying random functions
8. Make the process of running nodes as convenient and easy as possible

# Basic Observations: There’s a lot of Fish in the Pond!

Like mentioned, the question at the heart of the model is how to increase participation in both, Participation Nodes and Governance. When I looked at the distribution of balances per wallet, for what it’s worth, some numbers catched my eye: There are *a lot* of members in the network with a stake below 100k Algo. In fact, according to Algoexplorer, \~98% of wallets boost a balance below 100k ALGO.

[77&amp;#37; of wallets have less than 10k ALGO. Although scewed because it doesn’t include ALGO locked into e.g. Folks Finance, I take it as a hint nonetheless until proven otherwis](https://preview.redd.it/0kqksnjq9lfc1.jpg?width=1911&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ecef1f212448f7aecfaee014fdbeec064f3cf424)

So, would you purchase the hardware required, learn the ropes, and run a participation node when your bag holds 10k ALGO or less - I don’t think so. We are at a point where we have to admit that altruistic motives for running nodes, that is, indirect incentives, simply do not work at all.

On the other hand, people with large bags have a higher incentive to run participation nodes — but the probability is likely not as good either. Having a hefty bag is convinient and makes on lazy. Price movements produce sizeable returns. Putting the ALGOs into governance, vanilla style, is safe from counterparty risk - the most important thing to avoid as a wealthy speculator. If I have a bag of one million ALGO and more, I sleep better at night when my bag has next to none counterparty risk, I collect my 1-3% riskfree from the vanilla governance program, and hope either to trade my ALGOs for a sizeable return short term, or play the investors game and keep myself invested for the long term. As we all learned at some point, chasing a fantastic APY is almost never a good idea. \_If the Algorand Foundation is truly getting rid of vanilla governance, they would be well served to offer an alternative service regarding very low counterparty risk. \_

So, those people are unlikely to run a node - because ""counterparty risk\* and of course, additionally, the *inherent risk to, accidentally, fuck something up* \- no thanks but thanks! And if they stake, they are more likely to delegate their stake to a trusted third party, for example, Folks Finance, if they begin offering node staking services later on, which seems very likely.

This makes people with a medium stake the most likely to participate in running nodes. They have enough to care, but not enough to care too much. Additionally, while I do appreciate Folks Finance for what they did and continue to do for our ecosystem, I do not feel at easy with one large protocol, basically boosting the status of a monopoly, holding the majority of the wealth on Algorand inside their smart-contract. It could end up as a very fatal point of failure - eventually. We need an alternative, especially considering Staci’s statement discontinuing vanilla governance, there may be risk of centralization by entities running participation nodes. This should be avoided at all costs.

# 1 The PAL-Protocol: One PAL for All, all PALs for PALS

The fundamental idea of the PAL-Protocol is to give it, a decentralised contract, complete control over the staking mechanism of all nodes participating. You are simply setting up your node, installing the software, and plug it into the PAL-Protocol. After that, all you have to do is provide availability. It should also reduce the maintenance burden of the node and guarantees you a profit at the end of the governance cycle — that is, if you have been a true PAL.

I have thrown together some terribly simplistic, but hopefully understandable, colorful flowcharts to illustrate the process. I will walk you through the idea step by step and hope it will make the process more transparent.

# 1.1 PAL-Protocol: Participation Phase Flowchart

[xGovs\/PALs Registering for the upcoming Cycle ](https://preview.redd.it/5g30t681alfc1.png?width=1396&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62fc974bc1b3282b9ddd1392b7479310549b67bd)

**Short Summary: Participation Phase**

1. Before the upcoming governance period, a participant decides to plug his/her node into the PAL-Protocol. He signs the PAL-SC for Node Operators, and his Node is added to the PAL-Registry.
2. The same participant will also take part in the next governance period. He will sign the corresponding smart contract as usual. (For the sake of simplicity, I will take Staci by her word and expect the future of Algorand to consist of xGov only)
3. The PAL-Protocol distributes the aggregate ALGOs from the xGovs randomly across the nodes in the registry. While it does so, it allocated the fees the distribution generated to the discrete Operator Treasury.
4. At the very end of the Participation Phase, all participants who want to be PALs registered their nodes, as did all the governors, who signed up for the coming period. While these two types of participants joined, the PAL-Protocol distributed the ALGO to the PALs concurrently. First come, first served.

# Discussion: Participation Phase

*“... Nature almost surely operates by combining chance with necessity, randomness with determinism...”*

― Eric Chaisson, \[Epic of Evolution: Seven Ages of the Cosmos\]

&amp;#x200B;

**The Core of PAL: Random Distribution:**

I am really font of the idea to integrate randomness into this process - it’s Algorand after all! In fact, we easily could (and should) leverage Algorands secret sauce, *VRFs*, for a process of this importance. *Verifiable Random Functions* (VRFs) can be used to demonstrate that something has been distributed fairly. Here's a simple example to illustrate how it might work (in my limited understanding):

Let's say you have a group of people who want to divide a set of tokens among themselves fairly. Each person has a unique identifier (like a public key), and you want to use a VRF to decide who gets what in a way that everyone can verify is fair.

Here's a basic process:

1. **Assignment:** Each person applies the VRF using their unique identifier (public key) as input. This generates a seemingly random output and a proof.
2. **Reveal:** Each person reveals their output and proof to the group.
3. **Verification:** Others in the group can use the public keys, the revealed outputs, and the proofs to verify that the distribution was done correctly and that each person received their item fairly.
4. **Fairness Assurance:** Since the VRF ensures unpredictability and the proofs ensure verifiability, everyone can be confident that the distribution was fair, and no one had an advantage in determining the outcome.

This process helps demonstrate that the distribution wasn't biased or manipulated by any participant. It provides a way to achieve fairness in a distributed setting where each participant can independently verify the fairness of the outcome. This type of application is relevant in scenarios like random selection for tasks, allocation of resources, or any situation where fairness in distribution is important. *So, in short, we could leverage Algorands VRFs not just for the verifiable selection of the “winning ticket” for a given round, but also to verify random and fair allocation of resources*.

Note that is it not possible to directly allocate your ALGO to your own node, or any specific node for the matter. It is therefore not possible to exploit the staking mechanism, since you cannot separate your set of ALGOs from the complete set. The PAL-Protocol is handling the allocation for us. This separates the incentives in a clean and predictable way, supporting the first mandate of the PAL-Protocol to Incentivize people of \_all balances\_ to run participation nodes. It doesn’t matter if you ALGO bag is large or not. The reward for operating a node is, essentially, *equally predictable and fair to every participant operating in the network*. Because PALs are PALs. Note also, again, that *every ALGO participating in Governance efficiently* *spread out across the complete PAL-Network*, *effectively securing and decentralising the network*. Because every discrete ALGO is distributed across the whole network, *even if a very large ALGO whale withdraws from governance, it won’t affect the number of nodes in service to the network.*

**Growing the Treasury Pool for PALs**

We can make good use of the participation phase by creating a discrete rewards pool for the node operators. The more people take part in the xGov program, the more ALGO will the PALs Pool accumulate.

Let's assume it will distribute every discrete ALGO randomly: There are currently 1,884,394,774 ALGO staked in Period 10 ( - guess in vanilla only). Lets take this number as an example. Lets assume the AF will raise the fee from 0.001 ALGO per TXN to 0.005 ALGO. This would generate 9.421.973 ALGO, amounting to, obviously, 0.5% of all ALGOs committed - or put another way, a tax of 0.5% governors pay to their PALs. Because PALs need something to eat, too. If we assume there are one thousand PALs offering their friendship, this would result for PALs earning 9.421 for securing the network for the whole governance cycle. That is, given all PALs stay good PALs for the whole time.

# 1.2 PAL-Protocol: Starting Phase Flowchart

[xGovs\/PALs at the start of the period ](https://preview.redd.it/s8n2nebdalfc1.png?width=1454&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=addd060896d2278a9bd03bcf8f1b547035c7f003)

# Short Summary: Starting Phase

**From PAL Pete’s perspective:**

1. Operator Pete has successfully registered his node with the PAL-Protocol.
2. He plugged in his node early and made sure to keep up its uptime
3. His node hardware had no struggles to manage the workload of the distribution phase
4. Pete’s node filled up with ALGO, distributed from xGov wallets by the PAL-Protocol Random Function
5. Given a certain metric, like e.g. number of unique wallets involved in your node filling up, Pete receives a PAL-Score at the start of the governance phase, representing his share on the PAL-Network Operator Treasury.

**From Governor Harry’s perspective:**

1. Harry, like usual, stakes his ALGO with the governance contract
2. Behind the scenes, his ALGO are distributed across the PAL-Network
3. Based on the total ALGO staked for governance, Harry receives his weighted share of voting-power, in this case named Ballots.

# Discussion: Governance Starting Phase

**Integration of xGovs Program: Governors need PALs, too!**

Harry’s process is pretty much the same to the current xGovs program. There are many ways how to improve xGovs specifically, but this Post is mostly about the node operator’s side of things. Nevertheless, both xGov and the PAL-Protocol go together at the end of the day. But since this night comes to an end at some point, and my eyes are getting heavy, I’ll just use the current program as an example.

**About PALS (Participation Activity Level Score): Good PALS are hard to find**

This is the most important metric for operators at the starting phase of governance. The random distribution of numerous discrete ALGOs over time acts as a probing and weighting function. As time progresses, it rewards PALs who provide the best availability and efficiency while punishing bad PALs, potentially even by removing them from the PAL-Network for the current period.

It does so by utilizing a phenomenon of random distributions, that tend to even out over a large number of trials, known as the Law of Large Numbers. This law states that as the number of trials (or samples) increases, the sample mean (average) converges in probability to the expected (population) mean. In simpler terms, it suggests that the average result over a large number of trials will be close to the expected average.

You can think of the PAL-Score in the following way: In all four participation phases of the year (that is, the start of the governance periods), the PAL-Protocol utilizes a random function to allocate discrete ALGOs rapidly to the nodes waiting to get filled. The Law of Large Numbers applies. Let’s say we measure the PAL-Score of a given operator by the number of unique wallets that distributed ALGOs to said operator. If your node is not online, you won’t get PALS. If you node is not managing to keep up with the requests, missing out, you won’t get PALS. \_*So, in every participation phase, your node is loading up with ALGOs, generating PAL-Score in turn, representing your stake in the PAL-Protocol.* Assuming all nodes and operators to be equal, you could say you *fill up* your PAL-Score in these periods, while in subsequent periods, your job is to keep your score as high as possible.

# 1.3 PAL-Protocol: Active Phase &amp; Dropouts - PALs on the PAL-Score 

[Dropout Example](https://preview.redd.it/6r4w076zalfc1.png?width=1584&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3db380149e45e2c6af8026b9b33e6cfe360bc60a)

**Short Summary: Active Phase - Dropout Flowchart**

1. The PAL-Protocol randomly probes the liveliness of the PALs in the PAL-Network
2. PAL Pete has failed to maintain his node appropriately, resulting in a drop of liveliness of his node
3. Given a metric, let’s assume one based on downtime, the PAL-Protocol will revoke PAL-Score from Pete
4. The PAL-Score is then reallocated to PALs who deserve PALS (cough), based on their current PAL-Score
5. If it turns out Pete is a terrible PAL, the PAL-Protocol will kick his node out of the PAL-Network
6. It then redistributes the ALGO that were staked on Pete's node to better PALs, based on current PAL-Score
7. Pete has the chance to reenter into the PAL-Network at the start of the next government period
8. The process of kicking out PALs is therefore actively encouraging all node operators to become better PALs by matter of both, incentives and disincentives.

# Discussion: Active Phase - PAL-Score - Not all PALs are the Same

[Full xGov\/PAL Cycle ](https://preview.redd.it/wy2tjak6blfc1.png?width=1726&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c532f4952403f54aa0fc78643e6026312e2fae6)

The PAL-Protocol integrates into the xGov program. Your duty is to uphold your PAL Mandate for all four periods. Like in xGovs, you can become a PAL every Period, but if you drop out of the PAL-Network because you used up your PAL-Score, you forfeit your rewards for the full cycle. So, if you become a PAL in Period(A), but fail to uphold your uptime, the PAL-Protocol will drain your PAL-Score, thereby redistributing your fair share of the PAL-Treasury to true PALs. If your PAL-Score hits zero, you are removed from the PAL-Network by the PAL-Protocol. The ALGO staked will then further be redistributed to deserving PALs, increasing in turn their PAL-Score by way of the random distribution function and therefore their fair share on the PAL-Treasury, as well as further fuelling the PAL-Treasury itself.

When the full cycle is complete, from P(A) to P(D), the PAL-Score of all PALs is set to zero again. Allowing for a fresh start for participants to become their best version of a PAL possible (of course, If it were not reset, it would disencourage participation). *The PAL-Protocol therefore effectively manages for natural selection of good PALs, and discontinues bad PALs, catering to the overall health of the network by creating incentives instantly were needed*.

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Basic Observations: There’s a lot of Fish in the Pond!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like mentioned, the question at the heart of the model is how to increase participation in both, Participation Nodes and Governance. When I looked at the distribution of balances per wallet, for what it’s worth, some numbers catched my eye: There are &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of members in the network with a stake below 100k Algo. In fact, according to Algoexplorer, ~98% of wallets boost a balance below 100k ALGO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/0kqksnjq9lfc1.jpg?width=1911&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ecef1f212448f7aecfaee014fdbeec064f3cf424""&gt;77&amp;#37; of wallets have less than 10k ALGO. Although scewed because it doesn’t include ALGO locked into e.g. Folks Finance, I take it as a hint nonetheless until proven otherwis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, would you purchase the hardware required, learn the ropes, and run a participation node when your bag holds 10k ALGO or less - I don’t think so. We are at a point where we have to admit that altruistic motives for running nodes, that is, indirect incentives, simply do not work at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, people with large bags have a higher incentive to run participation nodes — but the probability is likely not as good either. Having a hefty bag is convinient and makes on lazy. Price movements produce sizeable returns. Putting the ALGOs into governance, vanilla style, is safe from counterparty risk - the most important thing to avoid as a wealthy speculator. If I have a bag of one million ALGO and more, I sleep better at night when my bag has next to none counterparty risk, I collect my 1-3% riskfree from the vanilla governance program, and hope either to trade my ALGOs for a sizeable return short term, or play the investors game and keep myself invested for the long term. As we all learned at some point, chasing a fantastic APY is almost never a good idea. _If the Algorand Foundation is truly getting rid of vanilla governance, they would be well served to offer an alternative service regarding very low counterparty risk. _&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, those people are unlikely to run a node - because &amp;quot;counterparty risk* and of course, additionally, the &lt;em&gt;inherent risk to, accidentally, fuck something up&lt;/em&gt; - no thanks but thanks! And if they stake, they are more likely to delegate their stake to a trusted third party, for example, Folks Finance, if they begin offering node staking services later on, which seems very likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes people with a medium stake the most likely to participate in running nodes. They have enough to care, but not enough to care too much. Additionally, while I do appreciate Folks Finance for what they did and continue to do for our ecosystem, I do not feel at easy with one large protocol, basically boosting the status of a monopoly, holding the majority of the wealth on Algorand inside their smart-contract. It could end up as a very fatal point of failure - eventually. We need an alternative, especially considering Staci’s statement discontinuing vanilla governance, there may be risk of centralization by entities running participation nodes. This should be avoided at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1 The PAL-Protocol: One PAL for All, all PALs for PALS&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental idea of the PAL-Protocol is to give it, a decentralised contract, complete control over the staking mechanism of all nodes participating. You are simply setting up your node, installing the software, and plug it into the PAL-Protocol. After that, all you have to do is provide availability. It should also reduce the maintenance burden of the node and guarantees you a profit at the end of the governance cycle — that is, if you have been a true PAL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have thrown together some terribly simplistic, but hopefully understandable, colorful flowcharts to illustrate the process. I will walk you through the idea step by step and hope it will make the process more transparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1.1 PAL-Protocol: Participation Phase Flowchart&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/5g30t681alfc1.png?width=1396&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=62fc974bc1b3282b9ddd1392b7479310549b67bd""&gt;xGovs/PALs Registering for the upcoming Cycle &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short Summary: Participation Phase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before the upcoming governance period, a participant decides to plug his/her node into the PAL-Protocol. He signs the PAL-SC for Node Operators, and his Node is added to the PAL-Registry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The same participant will also take part in the next governance period. He will sign the corresponding smart contract as usual. (For the sake of simplicity, I will take Staci by her word and expect the future of Algorand to consist of xGov only)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The PAL-Protocol distributes the aggregate ALGOs from the xGovs randomly across the nodes in the registry. While it does so, it allocated the fees the distribution generated to the discrete Operator Treasury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the very end of the Participation Phase, all participants who want to be PALs registered their nodes, as did all the governors, who signed up for the coming period. While these two types of participants joined, the PAL-Protocol distributed the ALGO to the PALs concurrently. First come, first served.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Discussion: Participation Phase&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“... Nature almost surely operates by combining chance with necessity, randomness with determinism...”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;― Eric Chaisson, [Epic of Evolution: Seven Ages of the Cosmos]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Core of PAL: Random Distribution:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am really font of the idea to integrate randomness into this process - it’s Algorand after all! In fact, we easily could (and should) leverage Algorands secret sauce, &lt;em&gt;VRFs&lt;/em&gt;, for a process of this importance. &lt;em&gt;Verifiable Random Functions&lt;/em&gt; (VRFs) can be used to demonstrate that something has been distributed fairly. Here&amp;#39;s a simple example to illustrate how it might work (in my limited understanding):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say you have a group of people who want to divide a set of tokens among themselves fairly. Each person has a unique identifier (like a public key), and you want to use a VRF to decide who gets what in a way that everyone can verify is fair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a basic process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assignment:&lt;/strong&gt; Each person applies the VRF using their unique identifier (public key) as input. This generates a seemingly random output and a proof.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reveal:&lt;/strong&gt; Each person reveals their output and proof to the group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verification:&lt;/strong&gt; Others in the group can use the public keys, the revealed outputs, and the proofs to verify that the distribution was done correctly and that each person received their item fairly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fairness Assurance:&lt;/strong&gt; Since the VRF ensures unpredictability and the proofs ensure verifiability, everyone can be confident that the distribution was fair, and no one had an advantage in determining the outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process helps demonstrate that the distribution wasn&amp;#39;t biased or manipulated by any participant. It provides a way to achieve fairness in a distributed setting where each participant can independently verify the fairness of the outcome. This type of application is relevant in scenarios like random selection for tasks, allocation of resources, or any situation where fairness in distribution is important. &lt;em&gt;So, in short, we could leverage Algorands VRFs not just for the verifiable selection of the “winning ticket” for a given round, but also to verify random and fair allocation of resources&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that is it not possible to directly allocate your ALGO to your own node, or any specific node for the matter. It is therefore not possible to exploit the staking mechanism, since you cannot separate your set of ALGOs from the complete set. The PAL-Protocol is handling the allocation for us. This separates the incentives in a clean and predictable way, supporting the first mandate of the PAL-Protocol to Incentivize people of _all balances_ to run participation nodes. It doesn’t matter if you ALGO bag is large or not. The reward for operating a node is, essentially, &lt;em&gt;equally predictable and fair to every participant operating in the network&lt;/em&gt;. Because PALs are PALs. Note also, again, that &lt;em&gt;every ALGO participating in Governance efficiently&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;spread out across the complete PAL-Network&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;effectively securing and decentralising the network&lt;/em&gt;. Because every discrete ALGO is distributed across the whole network, &lt;em&gt;even if a very large ALGO whale withdraws from governance, it won’t affect the number of nodes in service to the network.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growing the Treasury Pool for PALs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can make good use of the participation phase by creating a discrete rewards pool for the node operators. The more people take part in the xGov program, the more ALGO will the PALs Pool accumulate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s assume it will distribute every discrete ALGO randomly: There are currently 1,884,394,774 ALGO staked in Period 10 ( - guess in vanilla only). Lets take this number as an example. Lets assume the AF will raise the fee from 0.001 ALGO per TXN to 0.005 ALGO. This would generate 9.421.973 ALGO, amounting to, obviously, 0.5% of all ALGOs committed - or put another way, a tax of 0.5% governors pay to their PALs. Because PALs need something to eat, too. If we assume there are one thousand PALs offering their friendship, this would result for PALs earning 9.421 for securing the network for the whole governance cycle. That is, given all PALs stay good PALs for the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1.2 PAL-Protocol: Starting Phase Flowchart&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/s8n2nebdalfc1.png?width=1454&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=addd060896d2278a9bd03bcf8f1b547035c7f003""&gt;xGovs/PALs at the start of the period &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Short Summary: Starting Phase&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From PAL Pete’s perspective:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operator Pete has successfully registered his node with the PAL-Protocol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He plugged in his node early and made sure to keep up its uptime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His node hardware had no struggles to manage the workload of the distribution phase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pete’s node filled up with ALGO, distributed from xGov wallets by the PAL-Protocol Random Function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given a certain metric, like e.g. number of unique wallets involved in your node filling up, Pete receives a PAL-Score at the start of the governance phase, representing his share on the PAL-Network Operator Treasury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Governor Harry’s perspective:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harry, like usual, stakes his ALGO with the governance contract&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Behind the scenes, his ALGO are distributed across the PAL-Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on the total ALGO staked for governance, Harry receives his weighted share of voting-power, in this case named Ballots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Discussion: Governance Starting Phase&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integration of xGovs Program: Governors need PALs, too!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harry’s process is pretty much the same to the current xGovs program. There are many ways how to improve xGovs specifically, but this Post is mostly about the node operator’s side of things. Nevertheless, both xGov and the PAL-Protocol go together at the end of the day. But since this night comes to an end at some point, and my eyes are getting heavy, I’ll just use the current program as an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About PALS (Participation Activity Level Score): Good PALS are hard to find&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the most important metric for operators at the starting phase of governance. The random distribution of numerous discrete ALGOs over time acts as a probing and weighting function. As time progresses, it rewards PALs who provide the best availability and efficiency while punishing bad PALs, potentially even by removing them from the PAL-Network for the current period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does so by utilizing a phenomenon of random distributions, that tend to even out over a large number of trials, known as the Law of Large Numbers. This law states that as the number of trials (or samples) increases, the sample mean (average) converges in probability to the expected (population) mean. In simpler terms, it suggests that the average result over a large number of trials will be close to the expected average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can think of the PAL-Score in the following way: In all four participation phases of the year (that is, the start of the governance periods), the PAL-Protocol utilizes a random function to allocate discrete ALGOs rapidly to the nodes waiting to get filled. The Law of Large Numbers applies. Let’s say we measure the PAL-Score of a given operator by the number of unique wallets that distributed ALGOs to said operator. If your node is not online, you won’t get PALS. If you node is not managing to keep up with the requests, missing out, you won’t get PALS. _&lt;em&gt;So, in every participation phase, your node is loading up with ALGOs, generating PAL-Score in turn, representing your stake in the PAL-Protocol.&lt;/em&gt; Assuming all nodes and operators to be equal, you could say you &lt;em&gt;fill up&lt;/em&gt; your PAL-Score in these periods, while in subsequent periods, your job is to keep your score as high as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1.3 PAL-Protocol: Active Phase &amp;amp; Dropouts - PALs on the PAL-Score&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/6r4w076zalfc1.png?width=1584&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3db380149e45e2c6af8026b9b33e6cfe360bc60a""&gt;Dropout Example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short Summary: Active Phase - Dropout Flowchart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The PAL-Protocol randomly probes the liveliness of the PALs in the PAL-Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PAL Pete has failed to maintain his node appropriately, resulting in a drop of liveliness of his node&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given a metric, let’s assume one based on downtime, the PAL-Protocol will revoke PAL-Score from Pete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The PAL-Score is then reallocated to PALs who deserve PALS (cough), based on their current PAL-Score&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it turns out Pete is a terrible PAL, the PAL-Protocol will kick his node out of the PAL-Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It then redistributes the ALGO that were staked on Pete&amp;#39;s node to better PALs, based on current PAL-Score&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pete has the chance to reenter into the PAL-Network at the start of the next government period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The process of kicking out PALs is therefore actively encouraging all node operators to become better PALs by matter of both, incentives and disincentives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Discussion: Active Phase - PAL-Score - Not all PALs are the Same&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/wy2tjak6blfc1.png?width=1726&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4c532f4952403f54aa0fc78643e6026312e2fae6""&gt;Full xGov/PAL Cycle &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PAL-Protocol integrates into the xGov program. Your duty is to uphold your PAL Mandate for all four periods. Like in xGovs, you can become a PAL every Period, but if you drop out of the PAL-Network because you used up your PAL-Score, you forfeit your rewards for the full cycle. So, if you become a PAL in Period(A), but fail to uphold your uptime, the PAL-Protocol will drain your PAL-Score, thereby redistributing your fair share of the PAL-Treasury to true PALs. If your PAL-Score hits zero, you are removed from the PAL-Network by the PAL-Protocol. The ALGO staked will then further be redistributed to deserving PALs, increasing in turn their PAL-Score by way of the random distribution function and therefore their fair share on the PAL-Treasury, as well as further fuelling the PAL-Treasury itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the full cycle is complete, from P(A) to P(D), the PAL-Score of all PALs is set to zero again. Allowing for a fresh start for participants to become their best version of a PAL possible (of course, If it were not reset, it would disencourage participation). &lt;em&gt;The PAL-Protocol therefore effectively manages for natural selection of good PALs, and discontinues bad PALs, catering to the overall health of the network by creating incentives instantly were needed&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1.4 PAL-Protocol: End of Full Cycle Flowchat&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the end of the cycle is, considering the text above, self explanatory for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/9tlgj9gbblfc1.png?width=2480&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=75fc3adfc11aba7d51a0ea3065e45a0dac1840e6""&gt;End of Cycle &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This marks the end for my proposal for now, as my mind is slowly entering an ego-death stage for writing this incomplete draft throughout the whole night. I will postpone further elaborations to the future. Thank you for taking the time to read through. I welcome and greatly appreciate any suggestions or feedback, whether positive or critical, as we might work together to explore and develop this idea together, if there happens to be any merit to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be safe, be kind, and know that you - are appreciated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

,u_imod87,"# Stepping Up 

In the last episode from [The Next Block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCKa5zWezFg&amp;t=3386s), Staci Warden had been asked about Johns tweet, proposing to  focus on the fundamentals of the roadmap and stop the less effective programs. She stated, privately: 

*“… chances are high to face out old government rewards completely. You are not going to get paid making votes anymore, you are going to get paid by keeping this network secure. Also as part of this .… should DeFi and NFT rewards not go into xGovs?”* (In competition with other xGovs proposals)

I am very happy about Staci making this statement. Sure, who doesn’t like to get subsidized, but those payments won’t matter much if we are not able to turn this ship around, together. When I walked my Dog today (yes, the one in the picture), I got an idea I wanted to formalize, so maybe we can make sense out of it together and discuss its merits and shortfalls. 

This is exactly what this post is all about. If there is something most of us will certainly agree on, it is that quite some of the past initiatives have been a shot in the foot. I am very glad about the directional turn the Foundation took, for them to learn from past mistakes, decoupling from early day hubris and focusing on the very cornerstones of Algorand. Staci is not keen on putting money on the table to farm FOMO, and I like it. We want to be the adult in the room, and while we do not have the treasuries of some of our most well-equipped competitors, we have a technical foundation that is, as we all know, “fit for purpose”. But what we are in dire need of is not merely a technical matter, but a matter of community and shared identity. If we want to succeed, we have to grow up, step up, and aspire to be more than mere speculators, riding on the back of the Foundation. Staci is never tired, and rightfully so, to appeal to the community to step up and take part in this endeavor in tandem with the foundation, for it is of no ones benefit to lay back and play the blame game. Indeed, the resources of the Foundation are limited, and it is on us to bring in our individual strengths and fresh ideas, to engage in discussions and to aspire, in the brotherly spirit of free and open source software, to create a common good and a social environment we share together. 

# The Coming Network Update:  A Chance for Change 

In my opinion, we have too many processes competing with one another. Governance, XGovernance, DeFi incentives, soon node incentives … the construct is not loosely coupled and often creates friction between incentives, negating possible long term benefits. Staci seems to agree. But how do we streamline Governance and Node incentives efficiently?

The last few days I have been thinking about the current network incentives, and what it would take to streamline incentives, network security, distribution and fairness in the best way I could come up to. While I am not a gifted software developer by trade, but only a humble philosopher, I would like to initiate a discussion about possible incentive mechanics we would like to see in the future, and to evaluate them together to separate the brain fart from the viable, the wheat from the chaff. Therefore, I am presenting to you a simplistic model I thought about the last few days, and I hope for a fruitful discussion, and if not, at least a fun humble theory-crafting session. This is not meant to be a quantitative analysis, but a qualitative discussion about the applied game theory. 

# The PAL(Participation Activity Level) Protocol 

The PAL model is completely based on incentivisation for running Participation Nodes *and* for wide participation in staking on these nodes, that’s where the acronym is coming from. It’s raison d'être is basically: *One PAL for All, all PALs for One.*

**To summarise the goals of the PAL model:**

1. Incentivise people of \_all balances\_ to run participation nodes
2. Create a reward structure that does not create friction with the XGov process
3. In Fact, create a reward structure that ultimately plays in sync with xGov
4. Punish PALs with low availability and reward true PALs (like we all should \_cough\_)
5. PALs should be predictably rewarded for for their support 
6. Get rid of pooling in the traditional sense 
7. Reduce the possibility to game the system by applying random functions
8. Make the process of running nodes as convenient and easy as possible

# Basic Observations: There’s a lot of FIsh in the Pond!

Like mentioned, the question at the heart of the model is how to increase participation in both, Participation Nodes and Governance. When I looked at the distribution of balances per wallet, for what it’s worth, some numbers catched my eye: There are *a lot* of members in the network with a stake below 100k Algo. In fact, according to Algoexplorer, \~98% of wallets boost a balance below 100k ALGO. 

[77&amp;#37; of wallets have less than 10k ALGO. Although scewed because it doesn’t include ALGO locked into e.g. Folks Finance, I take it as a hint nonetheless until proven otherwis](https://preview.redd.it/v1lzu2983lfc1.jpg?width=1911&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83f56a65c96570b1657a395eec62130b255797a0)

So, would you purchase the hardware required, learn the ropes, and run a participation node when your bag holds 10k ALGO or less - I don’t think so. We are at a point where we have to admit that altruistic motives for running nodes, that is, indirect incentives, simply do not work at all. 

On the other hand, people with large bags have a higher incentive to run participation nodes — but the  probability is likely not as good either. Having a hefty bag is convinient and makes on lazy. Price movements produce sizeable returns. Putting the ALGOs into governance, vanilla style, is safe from counterparty risk - the most important thing to avoid as a wealthy speculator. If I have a bag of one million ALGO and more, I sleep better at night when my bag has next to none counterparty risk, I collect my 1-3% riskfree from the vanilla governance program, and hope either to trade my ALGOs for a sizeable return short term, or play the investors game and keep myself invested for the long term. As we all learned at some point, chasing a fantastic APY is almost never a good idea. \_If the Algorand Foundation is truly getting rid of vanilla governance, they would be well served to offer an alternative service regarding very low counterparty risk. \_

So, those people are unlikely to run a node - because ""counterparty risk\* and of course, additionally, the *inherent risk to, accidentally, fuck something up* \- no thanks but thanks! And if they stake, they are more likely to delegate their stake to a trusted third party, for example, Folks Finance, if they begin offering node staking services later on, which seems very likely. 

This makes people with a medium stake the most likely to participate in running nodes. They have enough to care, but not enough to care too much. Additionally, while I do appreciate Folks Finance for what they did and continue to do for our ecosystem, I do not feel at easy with one large protocol, basically boosting the status of a monopoly, holding the majority of the wealth on Algorand inside their smart-contract. It could end up as a very fatal point of failure - eventually. We need an alternative, especially considering Staci’s statement discontinuing vanilla governance, there may be risk of centralization by entities running participation nodes. This should be avoided at all costs. 

# 1 The PAL-Protocol: One PAL for All, all PALs for PALS

The fundamental idea of the PAL-Protocol is to give it, a decentralised contract, complete control over the staking mechanism of all nodes participating. You are simply setting up your node, installing the software, and plug it into the PAL-Protocol. After that, all you have to do is provide availability. It should also reduce the maintenance burden of the node and guarantees you a profit at the end of the governance cycle — that is, if you have been a true PAL. 

I have thrown together some terribly simplistic, but hopefully understandable, colorful flowcharts to illustrate the process. I will walk you through the idea step by step and hope it will make the process more transparent. 

# 1.1 PAL-Protocol: Participation Phase Flowchart

**Short Summary: Participation Phase**

1. Before the upcoming governance period, a participant decides to plug his/her node into the PAL-Protocol. He signs the PAL-SC for Node Operators, and his Node is added to the PAL-Registry.
2. The same participant will also take part in the next governance period. He will sign the corresponding smart contract as usual. (For the sake of simplicity, I will take Staci by her word and expect the future of Algorand to consist of xGov only)
3. The PAL-Protocol distributes the aggregate ALGOs from the xGovs randomly across the nodes in the registry. While it does so, it allocated the fees the distribution generated to the discrete Operator Treasury.
4. At the very end of the Participation Phase, all participants who want to be PALs registered their nodes, as did all the governors, who signed up for the coming period. While these two types of participants joined, the PAL-Protocol distributed the ALGO to the PALs concurrently. First come, first served.

# Discussion: Participation Phase 

&amp;#x200B;

*“... Nature almost surely operates by combining chance with necessity, randomness with determinism...”*

― Eric Chaisson, \[Epic of Evolution: Seven Ages of the Cosmos\]

&amp;#x200B;

**The Core of PAL: Random Distribution:** 

I am really font of the idea to integrate randomness into this process - it’s Algorand after all! In fact, we easily could (and should) leverage Algorands secret sauce, *VRFs*, for a process of this importance. *Verifiable Random Functions* (VRFs) can be used to demonstrate that something has been distributed fairly. Here's a simple example to illustrate how it might work (in my limited understanding):

Let's say you have a group of people who want to divide a set of tokens among themselves fairly. Each person has a unique identifier (like a public key), and you want to use a VRF to decide who gets what in a way that everyone can verify is fair.

Here's a basic process:

1.  **Assignment:** Each person applies the VRF using their unique identifier (public key) as input. This generates a seemingly random output and a proof.

2.  **Reveal:** Each person reveals their output and proof to the group.

3.  **Verification:** Others in the group can use the public keys, the revealed outputs, and the proofs to verify that the distribution was done correctly and that each person received their item fairly.

4.  **Fairness Assurance:** Since the VRF ensures unpredictability and the proofs ensure verifiability, everyone can be confident that the distribution was fair, and no one had an advantage in determining the outcome.

This process helps demonstrate that the distribution wasn't biased or manipulated by any participant. It provides a way to achieve fairness in a distributed setting where each participant can independently verify the fairness of the outcome. This type of application is relevant in scenarios like random selection for tasks, allocation of resources, or any situation where fairness in distribution is important. *So, in short, we could leverage Algorands VRFs not just for the verifiable selection of the “winning ticket” for a given round, but also to verify random and fair allocation of resources*.

Note that is it not possible to directly allocate your ALGO to your own node, or any specific node for the matter. It is therefore not possible to exploit the staking mechanism, since you cannot separate your set of ALGOs from the complete set. The PAL-Protocol is handling the allocation for us. This separates the incentives in a clean and predictable way, supporting the first mandate of the PAL-Protocol to Incentivize people of \_all balances\_ to run participation nodes. It doesn’t matter if you ALGO bag is large or not. The reward for operating a node is, essentially, *equally predictable and fair to every participant operating in the network*. Because PALs are PALs. Note also, again, that *every ALGO participating in Governance efficiently* *spread out across the complete PAL-Network*, *effectively securing and decentralising the network*. Because every discrete ALGO is distributed across the whole network, *even if a very large ALGO whale withdraws from governance, it won’t affect the number of nodes in service to the network.*

**Growing the Treasury Pool for PALs**

We can make good use of the participation phase by creating a discrete rewards pool for the node operators. The more people take part in the xGov program, the more ALGO will the PALs Pool accumulate. 

Let's assume it will distribute every discrete ALGO randomly: There are currently 1,884,394,774 ALGO staked in Period 10 ( - guess in vanilla only). Lets take this number as an example. Lets assume the AF will raise the fee from 0.001 ALGO per TXN to 0.005 ALGO. This would generate 9.421.973 ALGO, amounting to, obviously, 0.5% of all ALGOs committed - or put another way, a tax of 0.5% governors pay to their PALs. Because PALs need something to eat, too. If we assume there are one thousand PALs offering their friendship, this would result for PALs earning 9.421 for securing the network for the whole governance cycle. That is, given all PALs stay good PALs for the whole time.

# Short Summary: Starting Phase 

**From PAL Pete’s perspective:** 

1. Operator Pete has successfully registered his node with the PAL-Protocol.
2. He plugged in his node early and made sure to keep up its uptime
3. His node hardware had no struggles to manage the workload of the distribution phase
4. Pete’s node filled up with ALGO, distributed from xGov wallets by the PAL-Protocol Random Function
5. Given a certain metric, like e.g. number of unique wallets involved in your node filling up, Pete receives a PAL-Score at the start of the governance phase, representing his share on the PAL-Network Operator Treasury.

**From Governor Harry’s perspective:** 

1. Harry, like usual, stakes his ALGO with the governance contract
2. Behind the scenes, his ALGO are distributed across the PAL-Network
3. Based on the total ALGO staked for governance, Harry receives his weighted share of voting-power, in this case named Ballots.

# Discussion: Governance Starting Phase 

&amp;#x200B;

**Integration of xGovs Program: Governors need PALs, too!**

Harry’s process is pretty much the same to the current xGovs program. There are many ways how to improve xGovs specifically, but this Post is mostly about the node operator’s side of things. Nevertheless, both xGov and the PAL-Protocol go together at the end of the day. But since this night comes to an end at some point, and my eyes are getting heavy, I’ll just use the current program as an example.

**About PALS (Participation Activity Level Score): Good PALS are hard to find**

This is the most important metric for operators at the starting phase of governance. The random distribution of numerous discrete ALGOs over time acts as a probing and weighting function. As time progresses, it rewards PALs who provide the best availability and efficiency while punishing bad PALs, potentially even by removing them from the PAL-Network for the current period.

It does so by utilizing a phenomenon of random distributions, that tend to even out over a large number of trials, known as the Law of Large Numbers. This law states that as the number of trials (or samples) increases, the sample mean (average) converges in probability to the expected (population) mean. In simpler terms, it suggests that the average result over a large number of trials will be close to the expected average.

You can think of the PAL-Score in the following way: In all four participation phases of the year (that is, the start of the governance periods), the PAL-Protocol utilizes a random function to allocate discrete ALGOs rapidly to the nodes waiting to get filled. The Law of Large Numbers applies. Let’s say we measure the PAL-Score of a given operator by the number of unique wallets that distributed ALGOs to said operator. If your node is not online, you won’t get PALS. If you node is not managing to keep up with the requests, missing out, you won’t get PALS. \_*So, in every participation phase, your node is loading up with ALGOs, generating PAL-Score in turn, representing your stake in the PAL-Protocol.* Assuming all nodes and operators to be equal, you could say you *fill up* your PAL-Score in these periods, while in subsequent periods, your job is to keep your score as high as possible.

**Short Summary: Active Phase - Dropout Flowchart** 

1. The PAL-Protocol randomly probes the liveliness of the PALs in the PAL-Network
2. PAL Pete has failed to maintain his node appropriately, resulting in a drop of liveliness of his node
3. Given a metric, let’s assume one based on downtime, the PAL-Protocol will revoke PAL-Score from Pete
4. The PAL-Score is then reallocated to PALs who deserve PALS (cough), based on their current PAL-Score
5. If it turns out Pete is a terrible PAL, the PAL-Protocol will kick his node out of the PAL-Network
6. It then redistributes the ALGO that were staked on Pete's node to better PALs, based on current PAL-Score
7. Pete has the chance to reenter into the PAL-Network at the start of the next government period
8. The process of kicking out PALs is therefore actively encouraging all node operators to become better PALs by matter of both, incentives and disincentives.

[Complete xGov\/PAL Cycle ](https://preview.redd.it/2ckxidif6lfc1.png?width=1726&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a07c16a72126cf5d1a17a86aa960d8d5274fb287)

The PAL-Protocol integrates into the xGov program. Your duty is to uphold your PAL Mandate for all four periods. Like in xGovs, you can become a PAL every Period, but if you drop out of the PAL-Network because you used up your PAL-Score, you forfeit your rewards for the full cycle. So, if you become a PAL in Period(A), but fail to uphold your uptime, the PAL-Protocol will drain your PAL-Score, thereby redistributing your fair share of the PAL-Treasury to true PALs. If your PAL-Score hits zero, you are removed from the PAL-Network by the PAL-Protocol. The ALGO staked will then further be redistributed to deserving PALs, increasing in turn their PAL-Score by way of the random distribution function and therefore their fair share on the PAL-Treasury, as well as further fuelling the PAL-Treasury itself.

When the full cycle is complete, from P(A) to P(D), the PAL-Score of all PALs is set to zero again. Allowing for a fresh start for participants to become their best version of a PAL possible (of course, If it were not reset, it would disencourage participation). *The PAL-Protocol therefore effectively manages for natural selection of good PALs, and discontinues bad PALs, catering to the overall health of the network by creating incentives instantly were needed*.

# 1.4 PAL-Protocol: End of Full Cycle Flowchat

I think the end of the cycle is, considering the text above, self explanatory for now.

# Conclusion

This marks the end for my proposal for now, as my mind is slowly entering an ego-death stage for writing this incomplete draft throughout the whole night. I will postpone further elaborations to the future. Thank you for taking the time to read through. I welcome and greatly appreciate any suggestions or feedback, whether positive or critical, as we might work together to explore and develop this idea together, if there happens to be any merit to it.

&lt;p&gt;In the last episode from &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCKa5zWezFg&amp;amp;t=3386s""&gt;The Next Block&lt;/a&gt;, Staci Warden had been asked about Johns tweet, proposing to  focus on the fundamentals of the roadmap and stop the less effective programs. She stated, privately: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“… chances are high to face out old government rewards completely. You are not going to get paid making votes anymore, you are going to get paid by keeping this network secure. Also as part of this .… should DeFi and NFT rewards not go into xGovs?”&lt;/em&gt; (In competition with other xGovs proposals)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very happy about Staci making this statement. Sure, who doesn’t like to get subsidized, but those payments won’t matter much if we are not able to turn this ship around, together. When I walked my Dog today (yes, the one in the picture), I got an idea I wanted to formalize, so maybe we can make sense out of it together and discuss its merits and shortfalls. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what this post is all about. If there is something most of us will certainly agree on, it is that quite some of the past initiatives have been a shot in the foot. I am very glad about the directional turn the Foundation took, for them to learn from past mistakes, decoupling from early day hubris and focusing on the very cornerstones of Algorand. Staci is not keen on putting money on the table to farm FOMO, and I like it. We want to be the adult in the room, and while we do not have the treasuries of some of our most well-equipped competitors, we have a technical foundation that is, as we all know, “fit for purpose”. But what we are in dire need of is not merely a technical matter, but a matter of community and shared identity. If we want to succeed, we have to grow up, step up, and aspire to be more than mere speculators, riding on the back of the Foundation. Staci is never tired, and rightfully so, to appeal to the community to step up and take part in this endeavor in tandem with the foundation, for it is of no ones benefit to lay back and play the blame game. Indeed, the resources of the Foundation are limited, and it is on us to bring in our individual strengths and fresh ideas, to engage in discussions and to aspire, in the brotherly spirit of free and open source software, to create a common good and a social environment we share together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Coming Network Update:  A Chance for Change&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, we have too many processes competing with one another. Governance, XGovernance, DeFi incentives, soon node incentives … the construct is not loosely coupled and often creates friction between incentives, negating possible long term benefits. Staci seems to agree. But how do we streamline Governance and Node incentives efficiently?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last few days I have been thinking about the current network incentives, and what it would take to streamline incentives, network security, distribution and fairness in the best way I could come up to. While I am not a gifted software developer by trade, but only a humble philosopher, I would like to initiate a discussion about possible incentive mechanics we would like to see in the future, and to evaluate them together to separate the brain fart from the viable, the wheat from the chaff. Therefore, I am presenting to you a simplistic model I thought about the last few days, and I hope for a fruitful discussion, and if not, at least a fun humble theory-crafting session. This is not meant to be a quantitative analysis, but a qualitative discussion about the applied game theory. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The PAL(Participation Activity Level) Protocol&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PAL model is completely based on incentivisation for running Participation Nodes &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; for wide participation in staking on these nodes, that’s where the acronym is coming from. It’s raison d&amp;#39;être is basically: &lt;em&gt;One PAL for All, all PALs for One.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To summarise the goals of the PAL model:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incentivise people of _all balances_ to run participation nodes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a reward structure that does not create friction with the XGov process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Fact, create a reward structure that ultimately plays in sync with xGov&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Punish PALs with low availability and reward true PALs (like we all should _cough_)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PALs should be predictably rewarded for for their support &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get rid of pooling in the traditional sense &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce the possibility to game the system by applying random functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the process of running nodes as convenient and easy as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Basic Observations: There’s a lot of FIsh in the Pond!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like mentioned, the question at the heart of the model is how to increase participation in both, Participation Nodes and Governance. When I looked at the distribution of balances per wallet, for what it’s worth, some numbers catched my eye: There are &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of members in the network with a stake below 100k Algo. In fact, according to Algoexplorer, ~98% of wallets boost a balance below 100k ALGO. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/v1lzu2983lfc1.jpg?width=1911&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=83f56a65c96570b1657a395eec62130b255797a0""&gt;77&amp;#37; of wallets have less than 10k ALGO. Although scewed because it doesn’t include ALGO locked into e.g. Folks Finance, I take it as a hint nonetheless until proven otherwis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, would you purchase the hardware required, learn the ropes, and run a participation node when your bag holds 10k ALGO or less - I don’t think so. We are at a point where we have to admit that altruistic motives for running nodes, that is, indirect incentives, simply do not work at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, people with large bags have a higher incentive to run participation nodes — but the  probability is likely not as good either. Having a hefty bag is convinient and makes on lazy. Price movements produce sizeable returns. Putting the ALGOs into governance, vanilla style, is safe from counterparty risk - the most important thing to avoid as a wealthy speculator. If I have a bag of one million ALGO and more, I sleep better at night when my bag has next to none counterparty risk, I collect my 1-3% riskfree from the vanilla governance program, and hope either to trade my ALGOs for a sizeable return short term, or play the investors game and keep myself invested for the long term. As we all learned at some point, chasing a fantastic APY is almost never a good idea. _If the Algorand Foundation is truly getting rid of vanilla governance, they would be well served to offer an alternative service regarding very low counterparty risk. _&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, those people are unlikely to run a node - because &amp;quot;counterparty risk* and of course, additionally, the &lt;em&gt;inherent risk to, accidentally, fuck something up&lt;/em&gt; - no thanks but thanks! And if they stake, they are more likely to delegate their stake to a trusted third party, for example, Folks Finance, if they begin offering node staking services later on, which seems very likely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes people with a medium stake the most likely to participate in running nodes. They have enough to care, but not enough to care too much. Additionally, while I do appreciate Folks Finance for what they did and continue to do for our ecosystem, I do not feel at easy with one large protocol, basically boosting the status of a monopoly, holding the majority of the wealth on Algorand inside their smart-contract. It could end up as a very fatal point of failure - eventually. We need an alternative, especially considering Staci’s statement discontinuing vanilla governance, there may be risk of centralization by entities running participation nodes. This should be avoided at all costs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1 The PAL-Protocol: One PAL for All, all PALs for PALS&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental idea of the PAL-Protocol is to give it, a decentralised contract, complete control over the staking mechanism of all nodes participating. You are simply setting up your node, installing the software, and plug it into the PAL-Protocol. After that, all you have to do is provide availability. It should also reduce the maintenance burden of the node and guarantees you a profit at the end of the governance cycle — that is, if you have been a true PAL. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have thrown together some terribly simplistic, but hopefully understandable, colorful flowcharts to illustrate the process. I will walk you through the idea step by step and hope it will make the process more transparent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1.1 PAL-Protocol: Participation Phase Flowchart&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/671vslss3lfc1.png?width=1396&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f8f6ebfc833fe46fcdd1d6faa26d4ce48a76c578""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/671vslss3lfc1.png?width=1396&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f8f6ebfc833fe46fcdd1d6faa26d4ce48a76c578&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short Summary: Participation Phase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before the upcoming governance period, a participant decides to plug his/her node into the PAL-Protocol. He signs the PAL-SC for Node Operators, and his Node is added to the PAL-Registry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The same participant will also take part in the next governance period. He will sign the corresponding smart contract as usual. (For the sake of simplicity, I will take Staci by her word and expect the future of Algorand to consist of xGov only)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The PAL-Protocol distributes the aggregate ALGOs from the xGovs randomly across the nodes in the registry. While it does so, it allocated the fees the distribution generated to the discrete Operator Treasury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the very end of the Participation Phase, all participants who want to be PALs registered their nodes, as did all the governors, who signed up for the coming period. While these two types of participants joined, the PAL-Protocol distributed the ALGO to the PALs concurrently. First come, first served.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Discussion: Participation Phase&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“... Nature almost surely operates by combining chance with necessity, randomness with determinism...”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;― Eric Chaisson, [Epic of Evolution: Seven Ages of the Cosmos]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Core of PAL: Random Distribution:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am really font of the idea to integrate randomness into this process - it’s Algorand after all! In fact, we easily could (and should) leverage Algorands secret sauce, &lt;em&gt;VRFs&lt;/em&gt;, for a process of this importance. &lt;em&gt;Verifiable Random Functions&lt;/em&gt; (VRFs) can be used to demonstrate that something has been distributed fairly. Here&amp;#39;s a simple example to illustrate how it might work (in my limited understanding):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say you have a group of people who want to divide a set of tokens among themselves fairly. Each person has a unique identifier (like a public key), and you want to use a VRF to decide who gets what in a way that everyone can verify is fair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a basic process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assignment:&lt;/strong&gt; Each person applies the VRF using their unique identifier (public key) as input. This generates a seemingly random output and a proof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reveal:&lt;/strong&gt; Each person reveals their output and proof to the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verification:&lt;/strong&gt; Others in the group can use the public keys, the revealed outputs, and the proofs to verify that the distribution was done correctly and that each person received their item fairly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fairness Assurance:&lt;/strong&gt; Since the VRF ensures unpredictability and the proofs ensure verifiability, everyone can be confident that the distribution was fair, and no one had an advantage in determining the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process helps demonstrate that the distribution wasn&amp;#39;t biased or manipulated by any participant. It provides a way to achieve fairness in a distributed setting where each participant can independently verify the fairness of the outcome. This type of application is relevant in scenarios like random selection for tasks, allocation of resources, or any situation where fairness in distribution is important. &lt;em&gt;So, in short, we could leverage Algorands VRFs not just for the verifiable selection of the “winning ticket” for a given round, but also to verify random and fair allocation of resources&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that is it not possible to directly allocate your ALGO to your own node, or any specific node for the matter. It is therefore not possible to exploit the staking mechanism, since you cannot separate your set of ALGOs from the complete set. The PAL-Protocol is handling the allocation for us. This separates the incentives in a clean and predictable way, supporting the first mandate of the PAL-Protocol to Incentivize people of _all balances_ to run participation nodes. It doesn’t matter if you ALGO bag is large or not. The reward for operating a node is, essentially, &lt;em&gt;equally predictable and fair to every participant operating in the network&lt;/em&gt;. Because PALs are PALs. Note also, again, that &lt;em&gt;every ALGO participating in Governance efficiently&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;spread out across the complete PAL-Network&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;effectively securing and decentralising the network&lt;/em&gt;. Because every discrete ALGO is distributed across the whole network, &lt;em&gt;even if a very large ALGO whale withdraws from governance, it won’t affect the number of nodes in service to the network.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growing the Treasury Pool for PALs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can make good use of the participation phase by creating a discrete rewards pool for the node operators. The more people take part in the xGov program, the more ALGO will the PALs Pool accumulate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s assume it will distribute every discrete ALGO randomly: There are currently 1,884,394,774 ALGO staked in Period 10 ( - guess in vanilla only). Lets take this number as an example. Lets assume the AF will raise the fee from 0.001 ALGO per TXN to 0.005 ALGO. This would generate 9.421.973 ALGO, amounting to, obviously, 0.5% of all ALGOs committed - or put another way, a tax of 0.5% governors pay to their PALs. Because PALs need something to eat, too. If we assume there are one thousand PALs offering their friendship, this would result for PALs earning 9.421 for securing the network for the whole governance cycle. That is, given all PALs stay good PALs for the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1.2 PAL-Protocol: Starting Phase Flowchart&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/icpuj2ja5lfc1.png?width=1454&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c658ca0e5a7731088002b2ae990d736ef98155c3""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/icpuj2ja5lfc1.png?width=1454&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c658ca0e5a7731088002b2ae990d736ef98155c3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Short Summary: Starting Phase&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From PAL Pete’s perspective:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operator Pete has successfully registered his node with the PAL-Protocol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He plugged in his node early and made sure to keep up its uptime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His node hardware had no struggles to manage the workload of the distribution phase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pete’s node filled up with ALGO, distributed from xGov wallets by the PAL-Protocol Random Function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given a certain metric, like e.g. number of unique wallets involved in your node filling up, Pete receives a PAL-Score at the start of the governance phase, representing his share on the PAL-Network Operator Treasury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Governor Harry’s perspective:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harry, like usual, stakes his ALGO with the governance contract&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Behind the scenes, his ALGO are distributed across the PAL-Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on the total ALGO staked for governance, Harry receives his weighted share of voting-power, in this case named Ballots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Discussion: Governance Starting Phase&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integration of xGovs Program: Governors need PALs, too!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harry’s process is pretty much the same to the current xGovs program. There are many ways how to improve xGovs specifically, but this Post is mostly about the node operator’s side of things. Nevertheless, both xGov and the PAL-Protocol go together at the end of the day. But since this night comes to an end at some point, and my eyes are getting heavy, I’ll just use the current program as an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About PALS (Participation Activity Level Score): Good PALS are hard to find&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the most important metric for operators at the starting phase of governance. The random distribution of numerous discrete ALGOs over time acts as a probing and weighting function. As time progresses, it rewards PALs who provide the best availability and efficiency while punishing bad PALs, potentially even by removing them from the PAL-Network for the current period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does so by utilizing a phenomenon of random distributions, that tend to even out over a large number of trials, known as the Law of Large Numbers. This law states that as the number of trials (or samples) increases, the sample mean (average) converges in probability to the expected (population) mean. In simpler terms, it suggests that the average result over a large number of trials will be close to the expected average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can think of the PAL-Score in the following way: In all four participation phases of the year (that is, the start of the governance periods), the PAL-Protocol utilizes a random function to allocate discrete ALGOs rapidly to the nodes waiting to get filled. The Law of Large Numbers applies. Let’s say we measure the PAL-Score of a given operator by the number of unique wallets that distributed ALGOs to said operator. If your node is not online, you won’t get PALS. If you node is not managing to keep up with the requests, missing out, you won’t get PALS. _&lt;em&gt;So, in every participation phase, your node is loading up with ALGOs, generating PAL-Score in turn, representing your stake in the PAL-Protocol.&lt;/em&gt; Assuming all nodes and operators to be equal, you could say you &lt;em&gt;fill up&lt;/em&gt; your PAL-Score in these periods, while in subsequent periods, your job is to keep your score as high as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1.3 PAL-Protocol: Active Phase - (Dis)Incentives for PALS  (PAL-Score)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/vaqj3pz96lfc1.png?width=1584&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ef57972eade334bbd26bb41904c20acdeb884f95""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/vaqj3pz96lfc1.png?width=1584&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ef57972eade334bbd26bb41904c20acdeb884f95&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short Summary: Active Phase - Dropout Flowchart&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The PAL-Protocol randomly probes the liveliness of the PALs in the PAL-Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PAL Pete has failed to maintain his node appropriately, resulting in a drop of liveliness of his node&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given a metric, let’s assume one based on downtime, the PAL-Protocol will revoke PAL-Score from Pete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The PAL-Score is then reallocated to PALs who deserve PALS (cough), based on their current PAL-Score&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it turns out Pete is a terrible PAL, the PAL-Protocol will kick his node out of the PAL-Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It then redistributes the ALGO that were staked on Pete&amp;#39;s node to better PALs, based on current PAL-Score&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pete has the chance to reenter into the PAL-Network at the start of the next government period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The process of kicking out PALs is therefore actively encouraging all node operators to become better PALs by matter of both, incentives and disincentives. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Discussion: Active Phase - PAL-Score - Not all PALs are the Same&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/2ckxidif6lfc1.png?width=1726&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a07c16a72126cf5d1a17a86aa960d8d5274fb287""&gt;Complete xGov/PAL Cycle &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PAL-Protocol integrates into the xGov program. Your duty is to uphold your PAL Mandate for all four periods. Like in xGovs, you can become a PAL every Period, but if you drop out of the PAL-Network because you used up your PAL-Score, you forfeit your rewards for the full cycle. So, if you become a PAL in Period(A), but fail to uphold your uptime, the PAL-Protocol will drain your PAL-Score, thereby redistributing your fair share of the PAL-Treasury to true PALs. If your PAL-Score hits zero, you are removed from the PAL-Network by the PAL-Protocol. The ALGO staked will then further be redistributed to deserving PALs, increasing in turn their PAL-Score by way of the random distribution function and therefore their fair share on the PAL-Treasury, as well as further fuelling the PAL-Treasury itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the full cycle is complete, from P(A) to P(D), the PAL-Score of all PALs is set to zero again. Allowing for a fresh start for participants to become their best version of a PAL possible (of course, If it were not reset, it would disencourage participation). &lt;em&gt;The PAL-Protocol therefore effectively manages for natural selection of good PALs, and discontinues bad PALs, catering to the overall health of the network by creating incentives instantly were needed&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1.4 PAL-Protocol: End of Full Cycle Flowchat&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the end of the cycle is, considering the text above, self explanatory for now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/eqt3soor6lfc1.png?width=2480&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5b0491af4cc042978dd96d94bdedae5d9a3e1a5a""&gt;End of the complete xGov/PAL cycle &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This marks the end for my proposal for now, as my mind is slowly entering an ego-death stage for writing this incomplete draft throughout the whole night. I will postpone further elaborations to the future. Thank you for taking the time to read through. I welcome and greatly appreciate any suggestions or feedback, whether positive or critical, as we might work together to explore and develop this idea together, if there happens to be any merit to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be safe, be kind, and know that you - are appreciated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h1&gt;

,AlgorandOfficial,"# Stepping Up 

In the last episode from \[The Next Block\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCKa5zWezFg&amp;t=3386s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCKa5zWezFg&amp;t=3386s)), Staci Warden had been asked about Johns Tweet proposing to go along with the roadmap and stop the less effective programs to focus on the fundamentals. She stated privately: 

“… chances are high to face out old goverment rewards completely. You are not going to get paid making votes anymore, you are going to get paid by keeping this network secure. Also as part of this .… should DeFi and NFT rewards not go into xGovs?” (In competition with other xGovs proposals)

I am very happy about Staci making this statement. Sure, who doesn’t like to get subsidized, but those payments won’t matter much if we are not able to turn this ship around, together. When I walked my Dog today (yes, the one in the picture), I got an idea I wanted to formalize, so maybe we can make sense out of it together and discuss its merits and shortfalls. 

This is exactly what this post is all about. If there is something most of us will certainly agree on, it is that quite some of the past initiatives had been a shot in the foot. I am very glad about the directional turn the Foundation took, for them to learn from past mistakes, decoupling from early day hubris and focusing on the very cornerstones of Algorand. Staci is not keen on putting money on the table to farm FOMO, and I like it. We want to be the adult in the room, and while we do not have the treasuries of some of our most well-equipped competitors, we have a technical foundation that is, as we all know, “fit for purpose”. But what we are in dire need of is not merely a technical matter, but a matter of community and shared identity. If we want to succeed, we have to grow up, step up, and aspire to be more than mere speculators, riding on the back of the Foundation. Staci is never tired, and rightfully so, to appeal to the community to step up and take part in this endeavor in tandem with the foundation, for it is of no ones benefit to lay back and play the blame game. Indeed, the resources of the Foundation are limited, and it is on us to bring in our individual strengths and fresh ideas, to engage in discussions and to aspire, in the brotherly spirit of free and open source software, to create a common good and a social environment we share together. 

# The Coming Network Update:  A Chance for Change 

In my opinion, we have too many processes competing with one another. Governance, XGovernance, DeFi incentives, soon node incentives … the construct is not loosely coupled and often creates friction between incentives, negating possible long term benefits. Staci seems to agree. But how do we streamline Governance and Node incentives efficiently?

The last few days I have been thinking about the current network incentives, and what it would take to streamline incentives, network security, distribution and fairness in the best way I could come up to. While I am not a gifted software developer by trade, but only a humble philosopher, I would like to initiate a discussion about possible incentive mechanics we would like to see in the future, and to evaluate them together to separate the brain fart from the viable, the wheat from the chaff. Therefore, I am presenting to you a simplistic model I thought about the last few days, and I hope for a fruitful discussion, and if not, at least a fun humble theory-crafting session. This is not meant to be a quantitative analysis, but a qualitative discussion about the applied game theory. 

# The PAL(Participation Activity Level) Protocol 

The PAL model is completely based on incentivization for running Participation Nodes \_and\_ for wide participation in staking on these nodes, that’s where the acronym is coming from. It’s raison d'être is basically: *One PAL for All, all PALs for One*.

**To summarize the goals of the PAL model:**

* Incentivize people of *all balances* to run participation nodes
* Create a reward structure that does not create friction with the XGov process
* In Fact, create a reward structure that ultimately plays in sync with xGov
* Punish PALs with low availability and reward true PALs (like we all should \_cough\_)
* PALs should be predictably rewarded for for their support 
* Get rid of pooling in the traditional sense 
* Reduce the possibility to game the system by applying random functions
* Make the process convenient and easy to understand 

# Basic Observations: There’s a lot of Fish in the Pond!

Like mentioned, the question at the heart of the model is how to increase participation in both, Participation Nodes and Governance. When I looked at the distribution of balances per wallet, for what it’s worth, some numbers caught my eye: There are *a lot* of members in the network with a stake below 100k Algo. In fact, according to Algoexplorer, \~98% of wallets boost a balance below 100k ALGO.

[77&amp;#37; of wallets have less than 10k ALGO. ](https://preview.redd.it/0lsdcsamukfc1.png?width=2004&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb6ef27989f3a985fe4e8d9241b9fd81dc0996eb)

Although scewed because it doesn’t include ALGO locked into e.g. Folks Finance, I take the data as a hint nonetheless until proven otherwise.

So, would you purchase the hardware required, learn the ropes, and run a participation node when your bag holds 10k ALGO or less - I don’t think so. We are at a point where we have to admit that altruistic motives for running nodes, that is, indirect incentives, simply do not work at all. 

On the other hand, people with large bags have a higher incentive to run participation nodes — but the  probability is likely not as good either. Having a hefty bag is convinient and makes on lazy. Price movements produce sizeable returns. Putting the ALGOs into governance, vanilla style, is safe from counterparty risk - the most important thing to avoid as a wealthy speculator. If I have a bag of one million ALGO and more, I sleep better at night when my bag has next to none counterparty risk, I collect my 1-3% riskfree from the vanilla governance program, and hope either to trade my ALGOs for a sizeable return short term, or play the investors game and keep myself invested for the long term. As we all learned at some point, chasing a fantastic APY is almost never a good idea. *If the Algorand Foundation is truly getting rid of vanilla governance, they would be well served to offer an alternative service regarding very low counterparty risk*. 

So, those people are unlikely to run a node - because ""counterparty risk\* and of course, additionally, the inherent risk to accidentally, *fuck something up* \- no thanks but thanks! And if they stake, they are more likely to delegate their stake to a trusted third party, for example, Folks Finance, if they begin offering node staking later on, which seems very likely. 

This makes people with a medium stake the most likely to participate in running nodes. They have enough to care, but not enough to care too much. Additionally, while I do appreciate Folks Finance for what they did and continue to do for our ecosystem, I do not feel at easy with one large protocol, basically boosting the status of a monopoly, holding the majority of the wealth on Algorand inside their smart-contract. It could end up as a very fatal point of failure - eventually. We need an alternative, especially considering Staci’s statement discontinuing vanilla governance, there may be risk of centralization by entities running participation nodes. This should be avoided at all costs. 

# 1 The PAL-Protocol: One PAL for All, all PALs for One

The fundamental idea of the PAL-Protocol is to give it complete control over the staking mechanism on your node. You are simply setting up your node, installing the software, and plug it into the PAL-Protocol. After that, all you have to do is provide availability. It should also reduce the maintenance burden of the node and guarantees you a profit at the end of the governance cycle — that is, if you have been a true PAL. 

I have put together some terribly simplistic, but hopefully understandable, colorful flowcharts to illustrate the process at several stages. I will walk you through the idea step by step and hope it will make the process more transparent. 

# 1.1 PAL-Protocol: Participation Phase Flowchart

https://preview.redd.it/wmiicdclvkfc1.png?width=1396&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e5effdc2f34b0bf059b2875cf6fb5404a8fd685

**Short Summary: Participation Phase**

1. Before the upcoming governance period, a participant decides to plug his/her node into the PAL-Protocol. He signs the PAL-SC for Node Operators, and his Node is added to the PAL-Registry.
2. The same participant will also take part in the next governance period. He will sign the corresponding smart contract as usual. (For the sake of simplicity, I will take Staci by her word and expect the future of Algorand to consist of xGov only)
3. The PAL-Protocol distributes the aggregate ALGOs from the xGovs randomly across the nodes in the registry. While it does so, it allocated the fees the distribution generated to the discrete Operator Treasury.
4. At the very end of the Participation Phase, all participants who want to be PALs registered their nodes, as did all the governors, who signed up for the coming period. While these two types of participants joined, the PAL-Protocol distributed the ALGO to the PALs concurrently. First come, first served.

# 1.1.1 Discussion: Participation Phase 

# 1.1.2 The Core of PAL: Random Distribution:

*“... Nature almost surely operates by combining chance with necessity, randomness with determinism...”*

― Eric Chaisson, \[Epic of Evolution: Seven Ages of the Cosmos\]

&amp;#x200B;

 I am really font of the idea to integrate randomness into this process - it’s Algorand after all! In fact, we easily could (and should) leverage Algorands secret sauce, *VRFs*, for a process of this importance. *Verifiable Random Functions* (VRFs) can be used to demonstrate that something has been distributed fairly. 

Here's a simple example to illustrate how it might work (in my humble understanding): Let's say you have a group of people who want to divide a set of tokens among themselves fairly. Each person has a unique identifier (like a public key), and you want to use a VRF to decide who gets what in a way that everyone can verify is fair.

Here's a basic process:

1. **Assignment:** Each person applies the VRF using their unique identifier (public key) as input. This generates a seemingly random output and a proof.
2. **Reveal:** Each person reveals their output and proof to the group.
3. **Verification:** Others in the group can use the public keys, the revealed outputs, and the proofs to verify that the distribution was done correctly and that each person received their item fairly.
4. **Fairness Assurance:** Since the VRF ensures unpredictability and the proofs ensure verifiability, everyone can be confident that the distribution was fair, and no one had an advantage in determining the outcome.

This process helps demonstrate that the distribution wasn't biased or manipulated by any participant. It provides a way to achieve fairness in a distributed setting where each participant can independently verify the fairness of the outcome. This type of application is relevant in scenarios like random selection for tasks, allocation of resources, or any situation where fairness in distribution is important. *So, in short, we could leverage Algorands VRFs not just for the verifiable selection of the “winning ticket” for a given round, but also to verify random and fair allocation of resources*. 

Note that is it not possible to directly allocate your ALGO to your own node, or any specific node for the matter. It is therefore not possible to exploit the staking mechanism, since you cannot separate your set of ALGOs from the complete set. The PAL-Protocol is handling the allocation for us. This separates the incentives in a clean and predictable way, supporting the first mandate of the PAL-Protocol to Incentivize people of *all balances* to run participation nodes. It doesn’t matter if you ALGO bag is large or not. The reward for operating a node is, essentially, *equally predictable and fair to every participant operating in the network*. Because PALs are PALs. Note also, again, that \_every ALGO participating in Governance is staked efficiently\_ spread out across the complete PAL-Network, effectively securing and decentralising the network. Because every discrete ALGO is distributed across the whole network, *even if a large ALGO holder withdraws from governance, it won’t affect the number of nodes in service to the network*.

# 1.1.3 Growing the Treasury Pool for PALs

We can make good use of the participation phase by creating a discrete rewards pool for the node operators. The more people take part in the xGov program, the more ALGO will the PALs Pool accumulate. 

Let's assume it will distribute every discrete ALGO randomly: 

There are currently 1,884,394,774 ALGO staked in Period 10 ( vanilla only). Let's take this number as an example. Let's assume the AF will raise the fee from 0.001 ALGO per TXN to 0.005 ALGO. This would generate 9.421.973 ALGO, amounting to, obviously, 0.5% of all ALGOs committed - or put another way, a tax of 0.5% governors pay to their PALs. Because PALs need something to eat, too. If we assume there are one thousand PALs offering their friendship, this would result for PALs earning 9.421 for securing the network for the whole governance cycle. That is, given all PALs stay good PALs for the complete duration of the cycle.

# Short Summary: Starting Phase / Participation Phase 

**From PAL Pete’s perspective:** 

1. Operator Pete has successfully registered his node with the PAL-Protocol.
2. He plugged in his node early and made sure to keep up its uptime
3. His node hardware had no struggles to manage the workload of the distribution phase
4. Pete’s node filled up with ALGO, distributed from xGov wallets by the PAL-Protocol Random Function
5. Given a certain metric, like e.g. number of unique wallets involved in your node filling up, Pete receives a PAL-Score at the start of the governance phase, representing his share on the PAL-Network Operator Treasury.

**From Governor Harry’s perspective:** 

1. Harry, like usual, stakes his ALGO with the governance contract
2. Behind the scenes, his ALGO are distributed across the PAL-Network
3. Based on the total ALGO staked for governance, Harry receives his weighted share of voting-power, in this case named Ballots.

# 1.2.1 Discussion: Governance Starting Phase 

# 1.2.2 Integration of xGovs: Governors need PALs, too!

Harry’s process is pretty much the same to the current xGovs program. There are many ways how to improve xGovs specifically, but this Post is mostly about the node operator’s side of things. Nevertheless, both xGov and the PAL-Protocol go together at the end of the day. But since this night comes to an end at some point, and my eyes are getting heavy, I’ll just use the current program as an example.

# 1.2.3 About PALS (Participation Activity Level Score): Good PALS are hard to find

This is the most important metric for operators at the starting phase of governance. The random distribution of numerous discrete ALGOs over time acts as a probing and weighting function. As time progresses, it rewards PALs who provide the best availability and efficiency while punishing bad PALs, potentially even by removing them from the PAL-Network for the current period.

It does so by utilizing a phenomenon of random distributions, that tend to even out over a large number of trials, known as the Law of Large Numbers. This law states that as the number of trials (or samples) increases, the sample mean (average) converges in probability to the expected (population) mean. In simpler terms, it suggests that the average result over a large number of trials will be close to the expected average.

**You can think of the PAL-Score in the following way**: In all four participation phases of the year (that is, the start of the governance periods), the PAL-Protocol utilizes a random function to allocate discrete ALGOs rapidly to the nodes waiting to get filled. The Law of Large Numbers applies. Let’s say we measure the PAL-Score of a given operator by the number of unique wallets that distributed ALGOs to said operator. If your node is not online, you won’t get PALS. If you node is not managing to keep up with the requests, missing out, you won’t get PALS. *So, in every participation phase, your node is loading up with ALGOs, generating PAL-Score in turn, representing your stake in the PAL-Protocol*. Assuming all nodes and operators to be equal, you could say you *fill up* your PAL-Score in these periods, while in subsequent periods, your job is to keep your score as high as possible. 

# 1.3 PAL-Protocol: Active Phase - Scoring on the PAL-Score

https://preview.redd.it/tdkrdpe0zkfc1.png?width=1584&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=696035f10e45336779de566011e374e9df1b365f

**Short Summary: Active Phase - Dropout Flowchart** 

1. The PAL-Protocol randomly probes the liveliness of the PALs in the PAL-Network
2. PAL Pete has failed to maintain his node appropriately, resulting in a drop of liveliness of his node
3. Given a metric, let’s assume one based on downtime, the PAL-Protocol will revoke PAL-Score from Pete
4. The PAL-Score is then reallocated to PALs who deserve PALS (cough), based on their current PAL-Score
5. If it turns out Pete is a terrible PAL, the PAL-Protocol will kick his node out of the PAL-Network
6. It then redistributes the ALGO that were staked on Pete's node to better PALs, based on current PAL-Score
7. Pete has the chance to reenter into the PAL-Network at the start of the next government period
8. The process of kicking out PALs is therefore actively encouraging all node operators to become better PALs by matter of both, incentives and disincentives. 

# 1.3.1 Discussion: Active Phase - PAL-Score - Not all PALs are the Same 

[Complete Cycle of xGovs &amp;PAL-Protocol](https://preview.redd.it/l9njuc9dzkfc1.png?width=1726&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86adcf97315b4d41acbfd56578b6d5d425667f44)

The PAL-Protocol integrates into the xGov program. Your duty is to uphold your PAL Mandate for all four periods. Like in xGovs, you can become a PAL every Period, but if you drop out of the PAL-Network because you used up your PAL-Score, you forfeit your rewards for the full cycle. So, if you become a PAL in Period(A), but fail to uphold your uptime, the PAL-Protocol will drain your PAL-Score, thereby redistributing your fair share of the PAL-Treasury to true PALs. If your PAL-Score hits zero, you are removed from the PAL-Network by the PAL-Protocol. The ALGO staked will then further be redistributed to deserving PALs, increasing in turn their PAL-Score by way of the random distribution function and therefore their fair share on the PAL-Treasury, as well as further fuelling the PAL-Treasury itself.

When the full cycle is complete, from P(A) to P(D), the PAL-Score of all PALs is set to zero again. Allowing for a fresh start for participants to become their best version of a PAL possible (of course, If it were not reset, it would disencourage participation). 

*The PAL-Protocol therefore effectively manages for natural selection of good PALs, and discontinues bad PALs, catering to the overall health of the network by creating incentives instantly were needed.*

&amp;#x200B;

# 1.4 PAL-Protocol: End of Full Cycle Flowchart

I think the end of the cycle is, considering the text above, self explanatory (getting lazy \*cough\*).

&lt;h1&gt;Basic Observations: There’s a lot of Fish in the Pond!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like mentioned, the question at the heart of the model is how to increase participation in both, Participation Nodes and Governance. When I looked at the distribution of balances per wallet, for what it’s worth, some numbers caught my eye: There are &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of members in the network with a stake below 100k Algo. In fact, according to Algoexplorer, ~98% of wallets boost a balance below 100k ALGO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/0lsdcsamukfc1.png?width=2004&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=eb6ef27989f3a985fe4e8d9241b9fd81dc0996eb""&gt;77&amp;#37; of wallets have less than 10k ALGO. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although scewed because it doesn’t include ALGO locked into e.g. Folks Finance, I take the data as a hint nonetheless until proven otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, would you purchase the hardware required, learn the ropes, and run a participation node when your bag holds 10k ALGO or less - I don’t think so. We are at a point where we have to admit that altruistic motives for running nodes, that is, indirect incentives, simply do not work at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, people with large bags have a higher incentive to run participation nodes — but the  probability is likely not as good either. Having a hefty bag is convinient and makes on lazy. Price movements produce sizeable returns. Putting the ALGOs into governance, vanilla style, is safe from counterparty risk - the most important thing to avoid as a wealthy speculator. If I have a bag of one million ALGO and more, I sleep better at night when my bag has next to none counterparty risk, I collect my 1-3% riskfree from the vanilla governance program, and hope either to trade my ALGOs for a sizeable return short term, or play the investors game and keep myself invested for the long term. As we all learned at some point, chasing a fantastic APY is almost never a good idea. &lt;em&gt;If the Algorand Foundation is truly getting rid of vanilla governance, they would be well served to offer an alternative service regarding very low counterparty risk&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, those people are unlikely to run a node - because &amp;quot;counterparty risk* and of course, additionally, the inherent risk to accidentally, &lt;em&gt;fuck something up&lt;/em&gt; - no thanks but thanks! And if they stake, they are more likely to delegate their stake to a trusted third party, for example, Folks Finance, if they begin offering node staking later on, which seems very likely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes people with a medium stake the most likely to participate in running nodes. They have enough to care, but not enough to care too much. Additionally, while I do appreciate Folks Finance for what they did and continue to do for our ecosystem, I do not feel at easy with one large protocol, basically boosting the status of a monopoly, holding the majority of the wealth on Algorand inside their smart-contract. It could end up as a very fatal point of failure - eventually. We need an alternative, especially considering Staci’s statement discontinuing vanilla governance, there may be risk of centralization by entities running participation nodes. This should be avoided at all costs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1 The PAL-Protocol: One PAL for All, all PALs for One&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental idea of the PAL-Protocol is to give it complete control over the staking mechanism on your node. You are simply setting up your node, installing the software, and plug it into the PAL-Protocol. After that, all you have to do is provide availability. It should also reduce the maintenance burden of the node and guarantees you a profit at the end of the governance cycle — that is, if you have been a true PAL. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have put together some terribly simplistic, but hopefully understandable, colorful flowcharts to illustrate the process at several stages. I will walk you through the idea step by step and hope it will make the process more transparent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1.1 PAL-Protocol: Participation Phase Flowchart&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/wmiicdclvkfc1.png?width=1396&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4e5effdc2f34b0bf059b2875cf6fb5404a8fd685""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/wmiicdclvkfc1.png?width=1396&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4e5effdc2f34b0bf059b2875cf6fb5404a8fd685&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short Summary: Participation Phase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before the upcoming governance period, a participant decides to plug his/her node into the PAL-Protocol. He signs the PAL-SC for Node Operators, and his Node is added to the PAL-Registry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The same participant will also take part in the next governance period. He will sign the corresponding smart contract as usual. (For the sake of simplicity, I will take Staci by her word and expect the future of Algorand to consist of xGov only)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The PAL-Protocol distributes the aggregate ALGOs from the xGovs randomly across the nodes in the registry. While it does so, it allocated the fees the distribution generated to the discrete Operator Treasury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the very end of the Participation Phase, all participants who want to be PALs registered their nodes, as did all the governors, who signed up for the coming period. While these two types of participants joined, the PAL-Protocol distributed the ALGO to the PALs concurrently. First come, first served.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1.1.1 Discussion: Participation Phase&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1.1.2 The Core of PAL: Random Distribution:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“... Nature almost surely operates by combining chance with necessity, randomness with determinism...”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;― Eric Chaisson, [Epic of Evolution: Seven Ages of the Cosmos]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am really font of the idea to integrate randomness into this process - it’s Algorand after all! In fact, we easily could (and should) leverage Algorands secret sauce, &lt;em&gt;VRFs&lt;/em&gt;, for a process of this importance. &lt;em&gt;Verifiable Random Functions&lt;/em&gt; (VRFs) can be used to demonstrate that something has been distributed fairly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a simple example to illustrate how it might work (in my humble understanding): Let&amp;#39;s say you have a group of people who want to divide a set of tokens among themselves fairly. Each person has a unique identifier (like a public key), and you want to use a VRF to decide who gets what in a way that everyone can verify is fair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a basic process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assignment:&lt;/strong&gt; Each person applies the VRF using their unique identifier (public key) as input. This generates a seemingly random output and a proof.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reveal:&lt;/strong&gt; Each person reveals their output and proof to the group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verification:&lt;/strong&gt; Others in the group can use the public keys, the revealed outputs, and the proofs to verify that the distribution was done correctly and that each person received their item fairly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fairness Assurance:&lt;/strong&gt; Since the VRF ensures unpredictability and the proofs ensure verifiability, everyone can be confident that the distribution was fair, and no one had an advantage in determining the outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process helps demonstrate that the distribution wasn&amp;#39;t biased or manipulated by any participant. It provides a way to achieve fairness in a distributed setting where each participant can independently verify the fairness of the outcome. This type of application is relevant in scenarios like random selection for tasks, allocation of resources, or any situation where fairness in distribution is important. &lt;em&gt;So, in short, we could leverage Algorands VRFs not just for the verifiable selection of the “winning ticket” for a given round, but also to verify random and fair allocation of resources&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that is it not possible to directly allocate your ALGO to your own node, or any specific node for the matter. It is therefore not possible to exploit the staking mechanism, since you cannot separate your set of ALGOs from the complete set. The PAL-Protocol is handling the allocation for us. This separates the incentives in a clean and predictable way, supporting the first mandate of the PAL-Protocol to Incentivize people of &lt;em&gt;all balances&lt;/em&gt; to run participation nodes. It doesn’t matter if you ALGO bag is large or not. The reward for operating a node is, essentially, &lt;em&gt;equally predictable and fair to every participant operating in the network&lt;/em&gt;. Because PALs are PALs. Note also, again, that _every ALGO participating in Governance is staked efficiently_ spread out across the complete PAL-Network, effectively securing and decentralising the network. Because every discrete ALGO is distributed across the whole network, &lt;em&gt;even if a large ALGO holder withdraws from governance, it won’t affect the number of nodes in service to the network&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1.1.3 Growing the Treasury Pool for PALs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can make good use of the participation phase by creating a discrete rewards pool for the node operators. The more people take part in the xGov program, the more ALGO will the PALs Pool accumulate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s assume it will distribute every discrete ALGO randomly: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are currently 1,884,394,774 ALGO staked in Period 10 ( vanilla only). Let&amp;#39;s take this number as an example. Let&amp;#39;s assume the AF will raise the fee from 0.001 ALGO per TXN to 0.005 ALGO. This would generate 9.421.973 ALGO, amounting to, obviously, 0.5% of all ALGOs committed - or put another way, a tax of 0.5% governors pay to their PALs. Because PALs need something to eat, too. If we assume there are one thousand PALs offering their friendship, this would result for PALs earning 9.421 for securing the network for the whole governance cycle. That is, given all PALs stay good PALs for the complete duration of the cycle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1.2  PAL-Protocol: Starting Phase Flowchart&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/93w7owofxkfc1.png?width=1454&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f9cb86a298c14000a66044f1ca4ada8cd38b9dec""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/93w7owofxkfc1.png?width=1454&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f9cb86a298c14000a66044f1ca4ada8cd38b9dec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Short Summary: Starting Phase / Participation Phase&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From PAL Pete’s perspective:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operator Pete has successfully registered his node with the PAL-Protocol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He plugged in his node early and made sure to keep up its uptime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His node hardware had no struggles to manage the workload of the distribution phase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pete’s node filled up with ALGO, distributed from xGov wallets by the PAL-Protocol Random Function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given a certain metric, like e.g. number of unique wallets involved in your node filling up, Pete receives a PAL-Score at the start of the governance phase, representing his share on the PAL-Network Operator Treasury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Governor Harry’s perspective:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harry, like usual, stakes his ALGO with the governance contract&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Behind the scenes, his ALGO are distributed across the PAL-Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on the total ALGO staked for governance, Harry receives his weighted share of voting-power, in this case named Ballots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1.2.1 Discussion: Governance Starting Phase&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1.2.2 Integration of xGovs: Governors need PALs, too!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harry’s process is pretty much the same to the current xGovs program. There are many ways how to improve xGovs specifically, but this Post is mostly about the node operator’s side of things. Nevertheless, both xGov and the PAL-Protocol go together at the end of the day. But since this night comes to an end at some point, and my eyes are getting heavy, I’ll just use the current program as an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1.2.3 About PALS (Participation Activity Level Score): Good PALS are hard to find&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the most important metric for operators at the starting phase of governance. The random distribution of numerous discrete ALGOs over time acts as a probing and weighting function. As time progresses, it rewards PALs who provide the best availability and efficiency while punishing bad PALs, potentially even by removing them from the PAL-Network for the current period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does so by utilizing a phenomenon of random distributions, that tend to even out over a large number of trials, known as the Law of Large Numbers. This law states that as the number of trials (or samples) increases, the sample mean (average) converges in probability to the expected (population) mean. In simpler terms, it suggests that the average result over a large number of trials will be close to the expected average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can think of the PAL-Score in the following way&lt;/strong&gt;: In all four participation phases of the year (that is, the start of the governance periods), the PAL-Protocol utilizes a random function to allocate discrete ALGOs rapidly to the nodes waiting to get filled. The Law of Large Numbers applies. Let’s say we measure the PAL-Score of a given operator by the number of unique wallets that distributed ALGOs to said operator. If your node is not online, you won’t get PALS. If you node is not managing to keep up with the requests, missing out, you won’t get PALS. &lt;em&gt;So, in every participation phase, your node is loading up with ALGOs, generating PAL-Score in turn, representing your stake in the PAL-Protocol&lt;/em&gt;. Assuming all nodes and operators to be equal, you could say you &lt;em&gt;fill up&lt;/em&gt; your PAL-Score in these periods, while in subsequent periods, your job is to keep your score as high as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1.3 PAL-Protocol: Active Phase - Scoring on the PAL-Score&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/tdkrdpe0zkfc1.png?width=1584&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=696035f10e45336779de566011e374e9df1b365f""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/tdkrdpe0zkfc1.png?width=1584&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=696035f10e45336779de566011e374e9df1b365f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short Summary: Active Phase - Dropout Flowchart&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The PAL-Protocol randomly probes the liveliness of the PALs in the PAL-Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PAL Pete has failed to maintain his node appropriately, resulting in a drop of liveliness of his node&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given a metric, let’s assume one based on downtime, the PAL-Protocol will revoke PAL-Score from Pete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The PAL-Score is then reallocated to PALs who deserve PALS (cough), based on their current PAL-Score&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it turns out Pete is a terrible PAL, the PAL-Protocol will kick his node out of the PAL-Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It then redistributes the ALGO that were staked on Pete&amp;#39;s node to better PALs, based on current PAL-Score&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pete has the chance to reenter into the PAL-Network at the start of the next government period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The process of kicking out PALs is therefore actively encouraging all node operators to become better PALs by matter of both, incentives and disincentives. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1.3.1 Discussion: Active Phase - PAL-Score - Not all PALs are the Same&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/l9njuc9dzkfc1.png?width=1726&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=86adcf97315b4d41acbfd56578b6d5d425667f44""&gt;Complete Cycle of xGovs &amp;amp;PAL-Protocol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PAL-Protocol integrates into the xGov program. Your duty is to uphold your PAL Mandate for all four periods. Like in xGovs, you can become a PAL every Period, but if you drop out of the PAL-Network because you used up your PAL-Score, you forfeit your rewards for the full cycle. So, if you become a PAL in Period(A), but fail to uphold your uptime, the PAL-Protocol will drain your PAL-Score, thereby redistributing your fair share of the PAL-Treasury to true PALs. If your PAL-Score hits zero, you are removed from the PAL-Network by the PAL-Protocol. The ALGO staked will then further be redistributed to deserving PALs, increasing in turn their PAL-Score by way of the random distribution function and therefore their fair share on the PAL-Treasury, as well as further fuelling the PAL-Treasury itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the full cycle is complete, from P(A) to P(D), the PAL-Score of all PALs is set to zero again. Allowing for a fresh start for participants to become their best version of a PAL possible (of course, If it were not reset, it would disencourage participation). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PAL-Protocol therefore effectively manages for natural selection of good PALs, and discontinues bad PALs, catering to the overall health of the network by creating incentives instantly were needed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1.4 PAL-Protocol: End of Full Cycle Flowchart&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the end of the cycle is, considering the text above, self explanatory (getting lazy *cough*).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/x4hcwf100lfc1.png?width=2480&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=12e119c1d73847987704d29ef5b236d7d08b4a31""&gt;Last Period in the xGov/PAL-Protocol Cycle &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This marks the end for my proposal for now, as my mind is slowly entering an ego-death stage for writing this incomplete draft throughout the whole night. I will postpone further elaborations to the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much for taking your time to read through. I welcome and greatly appreciate any suggestions or feedback, whether positive or critical, technical or otherwise, as we might work together to explore and develop this idea together, if there happens to be any merit to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So long! Be safe, be kind, and know that you - are appreciated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h1&gt;

[Beehiiv](https://www.beehiiv.com/?via=oumar) is an emerging newsletter platform gaining popularity among content creators as a serious competitor to Substack and Convertkit.

What makes [Beehiiv](https://www.beehiiv.com/?via=oumar) stand out are the built-in money-making features absent on other newsletter platforms.

 If you want to monetize your subscriber list, these five clever [Beehiiv](https://www.beehiiv.com/?via=oumar) strategies can help you boost your income.

 

### 1. Display Advertisements

The first way to profit with [Beehiiv](https://www.beehiiv.com/?via=oumar) is by publishing advertisements in your newsletters. 

Brands and other creators pay you to promote their products/services to your audience.

In the past, creators handled advertising manually — creating custom workflows to collaborate with brands. This involved a lot of tedious coordination.

 

[Beehiiv](https://www.beehiiv.com/?via=oumar) removes these hassles by centralizing the ad process natively inside the platform. You can easily:

* Manage ad campaigns
* Review advertiser requests
* View performance analytics
* Collect payments

If you’re open to running ads, [Beehiiv](https://www.beehiiv.com/?via=oumar) streamlines the operational intricacies.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wyipfmvg1kfc1.png?width=375&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4c4c481a012953779d730aa3775325c224c892e

 

### 2. Paid Subscriptions

Another monetization avenue is paid subscriptions. You can gate some or all of your newsletter content behind a paywall. This recurring income stream is predictable when scaled.

However, a subscription model needs significant reach to be viable. You’ll want at least 10,000+ free subscribers before introducing paid plans. Without a solid base, revenue will be meager.

 

### 3. Beehiiv Affiliate Commissions

You can also profit by promoting [Beehiiv ](https://www.beehiiv.com/?via=oumar)itself. As an affiliate, you earn 50% commission on any new subscriber’s payments over 12 months.

For example, if someone signs up for the $99/month Scale plan through your link, you pocket $49.50 each month they remain a paying member.

To access your unique promo link:

 

1. Go to Monetization -&gt; Partner Program
2. Click “**Join Today**” and fill out the application
3. Share the affiliate link sent to your email

This is an effortless approach to monetization. You get rewarded for referring creators who end up loving the platform.

&amp;#x200B;

### 4. Newsletter Cross-Promotions

[Beehiiv](https://www.beehiiv.com/?via=oumar) also lets you earn by promoting other creators’ newsletters to your list. You apply to advertise on their behalf and take a cut of any signups.

Here’s how it works:

1. Connect payment account
2. Browse available newsletters
3. Apply to promote the ones relevant to your audience
4. Earn around $2 per new subscriber

This is similar to an affiliate partnership but negotiated at the platform level.  

When your promotion goes out, subscribers see a popup offering to join the other newsletter.

&amp;#x200B;

### 5. Promote Your Own Products

The most lucrative approach is promoting your own products/services. When someone signs up, put them into an automated email sequence that ultimately pitches a paid offer.

For example:

* Give away a lead magnet on losing belly fat
* Sequence drip emails with more advice
* End by selling personal coaching or an online course

Here’s how to set it up in [Beehiiv](https://www.beehiiv.com/?via=oumar):

 

1. Click Automations
2. Add “New Subscriber” as the trigger
3. Build a multi-email workflow to pitch your offer
4. Sit back and profit

It takes some work up front but earns passive income over time.

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;li&gt;Go to Monetization -&amp;gt; Partner Program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click “&lt;strong&gt;Join Today&lt;/strong&gt;” and fill out the application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share the affiliate link sent to your email&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an effortless approach to monetization. You get rewarded for referring creators who end up loving the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/gxbhelqq1kfc1.png?width=880&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b22676b888b4619c6204a8bf3a72c07f54b9bf76""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/gxbhelqq1kfc1.png?width=880&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b22676b888b4619c6204a8bf3a72c07f54b9bf76&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Newsletter Cross-Promotions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.beehiiv.com/?via=oumar""&gt;Beehiiv&lt;/a&gt; also lets you earn by promoting other creators’ newsletters to your list. You apply to advertise on their behalf and take a cut of any signups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how it works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connect payment account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browse available newsletters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply to promote the ones relevant to your audience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earn around $2 per new subscriber&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is similar to an affiliate partnership but negotiated at the platform level.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your promotion goes out, subscribers see a popup offering to join the other newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/w72vr30y1kfc1.png?width=880&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=557e70eb61ac4197ad5071d907fce47a792c86f1""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/w72vr30y1kfc1.png?width=880&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=557e70eb61ac4197ad5071d907fce47a792c86f1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Promote Your Own Products&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most lucrative approach is promoting your own products/services. When someone signs up, put them into an automated email sequence that ultimately pitches a paid offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give away a lead magnet on losing belly fat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sequence drip emails with more advice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;End by selling personal coaching or an online course&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to set it up in &lt;a href=""https://www.beehiiv.com/?via=oumar""&gt;Beehiiv&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Automations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add “New Subscriber” as the trigger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a multi-email workflow to pitch your offer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sit back and profit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes some work up front but earns passive income over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/vzc7lk742kfc1.png?width=715&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=20d9a67024c7090437fe3475b83a5d5a59c5dcfd""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/vzc7lk742kfc1.png?width=715&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=20d9a67024c7090437fe3475b83a5d5a59c5dcfd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Wrap Up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.beehiiv.com/?via=oumar""&gt;Beehiiv&lt;/a&gt; opens various ways to monetize that creators previously had to handle solo. Their suite of money-making tools streamlines the complexities around building subscriber income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which strategy resonates most with your business goals? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you going to give &lt;a href=""https://www.beehiiv.com/?via=oumar""&gt;Beehiiv’s&lt;/a&gt; newsletter platform a try? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

,OnePieceTCG,"Hey so I recently pulled a Oda-signed Luffy from a loose booster pack that was laying around at my LGS and I'm ecstatic, especially after opening a box, a display and the 30 or so boosters from weekly locals.   


Now the real question is whether or not to sell. The game seems to be on a crazy hype train right now and I honestly believe that this will be the peak of the game (in terms of collecting). With the anime being on Netflix, as well as the live-action, gear 5 transformation, and the recent announcement that they were going to reanimate the show, One Piece is peak right now. And honestly, when it's all said and done I believe this anime will be regarded as one of, if not the greatest pieces of fiction ever. And it is this love and hope I have for One Piece that makes me want to keep the card and hold it for years and years.   


On the other hand, as I've mentioned I believe that this game is at its biggest peak and most likely won't be back to this level any time in the near future unless the anime is concluded and everyone tries to jump back on nostalgia. However, the reasons as to why I think the game is only going down is the fact that it is Bandai. Bandai has been notoriously known to run their TCGs into the ground as seen with DBS and Digimon. Power creeping is starting to seem like an issue with OP06 leaders like Gecko Moria and Yamato, as well as B/B Sakazuki just being such an overloaded deck. Bandai have also announced that they will reprint the sets and this naturally will bring the prices of everything down, as to how much it is still a mystery. Now I get that reprints were bound to happen sooner or later and as a player of the game it does make me happy but given that prices are going to drop should I sell it ASAP while the wave is high or keep it.

,Cordials,"This is an time-consuming, but effective method for making a fruit juice ""concentrate"" at home for use in drinks.

If you have a juicer, use that, if not, you'll need to press and strain the fruit by hand through a sieve and / or cheesecloth to collect the juice. Filter through a coffee paper (you may need to use several) until you have just juice in a container.

Once you have the juice, you'll need to pasteurise it. Put the juice into a sterilised bottle and place it into a large pan. Fill the pan with water and bring to the boil for at least 10 minutes.

Remove from the heat, seal the bottles and allow to cool.

You can, at this stage, clarify the juice using pectin enzyme and filtering, but it's not necessary if you're only making a small amount as the quantity of enzyme needed may be too small to measure accurately.

To make a concentrate, once the juice has cooled, you'll need to decant the juice into a large container (or several small containers) and freeze it for at least 24 hours.

Once the juice is frozen solid, take the frozen juice and place it in a funnel or sieve over another bottle or container and allow it to defrost. The juice should thaw faster than the water content and drip into the lower container. Shave off any pure white ice that appears at the top of the frozen block to prevent it thawing into the juice.

You can repeat this method several times to further concentrate the juice.

Bottle and seal the juice and store in the fridge. You should use it within a few days.

**Don't throw the fruit pulp away!**

Whilst the juice is freezing, decant the pulp into a sterlised jar and cover with alcohol (40% vodka is fine with half volume of glycerine to vodka), shake and allow to infuse. After a day or so (longer is better), filter the pulp carefully and gently heat the liquid to reduce to make a concentrated extract you can add back into the juice or final drink to boost the flavour.",t2_1ni1d,False,,0,False,Fruit juice concentrate,[],r/Cordials,False,,,0.0,,,True,t3_1aejgix,False,dark,1.0,,public,1.0,0.0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,,1706602420.0,text,,,,text,self.Cordials,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an time-consuming, but effective method for making a fruit juice &amp;quot;concentrate&amp;quot; at home for use in drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

After a day or so (longer is better), filter the pulp carefully and gently heat the liquid to reduce to make a concentrated extract you can add back into the juice or final drink to boost the flavour.&lt;/p&gt;

,JumpChain,"This time we're gonna be [salespeople](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sPEKF8eRmuXNbbapvWPncYUod8zDxrC3/view). Let's talk about Generic Merchant (Edro's version, though I don't doubt I'll talk about Burkess's version at some point). This is sort of a continuation of my post about Edrogrimshell's [Generic Tamer jump](https://www.reddit.com/r/JumpChain/comments/1ado0mn/generic_tamer_is_just_a_must_jump/). If you're curious as to why I'm doing this... it's fun. I like to talk about jumps, perks, and items. Plus I actually have two separate story jumpers who use multiple Edro generic jumps as part of their base power sets. One is in a generic fantasy world and the other is in Minecraft and both have decently lengthy stories over on Questionable Questing.

# General Thoughts:

I think this particular jump will not be as universally useful as generic tamer but I think any jumper can get SOME use out of it. There are powerfully handy and unorthodox perks worth collecting here, some of which can be seriously handy in the right hands or in the right circumstances but I do think this jump is probably best when it serves as a thematic core of some sort or when used by a creative, galaxy brain jumper. Jumpers who commit to the idea of collecting stuff and selling things are gonna be the ones who get the most bang for their buck. That said, I do strongly think that any jumper could come here, have a good time, and get some fun powers and items.

My absolute favorite perk from here is reclamation which costs 200 points. It is also definitely one of the most universally useful perks here, since it lets you destroy stuff and literally turn it to money. It is a hilariously useful perk, especially for stealthy jumpers who can do shenanigans and sneak into places owned by enemies or rivals and just go to town on their supplies. In the right setting an ability like this is ridiculously powerful. That said, my favorite ways to use something like this would be in a modern setting where things like landfills and dumpsters exist, because those sorts of places are just money pits for somebody with this power. I do think the real power of this perk actually stems from the way it can be used to set up other perks, such as Investing and Universal Bartering.

# 100 CP

Gonna start with the items this time. I'll highlight three of them, the maps and charts item, the catalogue item, and the rolodex item. The maps and charts item can be a little cheat/head start for smart jumpers in the right settings, like Minecraft or other procedurally generated places. The rolodex is rad for some jumpers, especially ones who tend to avoid head start perks or ones who really like to venture to generic settings as this nifty little gadget lets you start off with peeps who owe you favors independent of your origin, though I do wonder how this works for drop-ins. Fanwank, obviously, but like a part of me is curious to hear the justifications friends would make to keep the item working and to mix it with one's drop-in status. The catalogue is fun for peeps who want to be strategic and who are on the prowl for something specific in a setting. Obviously at this tier we aren't seeing anything wild.

The perks that cost 100 CP also aren't bonkers, and are mostly non-supernatural things related to a range of merchant skills. Appraisal is a fun perk that let's you detect value and talent with a look (with you learning more if you take the time to more closely study something), or little more then a look in some cases and Haggler lets you know what prices folks are willing to pay for stuff, as well as makes you a neat gift giver. Nickel and Dime is a rare supernatural/superpower perk at this tier that let's you transform currency from one form to another.

# 200 CP

I'm gonna highlight one item mostly because it's very funny to me: the ""Your Card"" item is hilarious because it is handy but also a nice little self defense weapon if you like the card tricks from the ""Now you see me"" movies. This also has the added utility of being a way to contact you if you lack certain types of tech such as cell phones or magic or psychic abilities that would allow you to instantly communicate with peeps across large distances. It's fun for baby jumpers or those who have never been in modern settings and thus don't have things like fiat-backed cell phones.

This is the tier where we start to see some neat supernatural perks. Merchant Vessel is a fun perk that lets you bring your vehicles to a limited sort of life, mostly focused on stuff like piloting itself and following simple instructions. The Vault is neat, it is a hammerspace inventory perk that counts any of the stuff in it as stuff that is on your person. Collector is a rad QOL perk that gives you thematic boosts to your luck based on what you own, with things like wealth giving you luck, wands making you lucky with regards to magic, and swords giving you a leg up in battle.

# 300 CP

One of my favorite items ever is in the 300 CP tier in this jump: ""The Traveler's Dream"". It's a fantastically good item for traveling merchants, as it is a vehicle that can shapeshift and can copy the forms of other vehicles. It is a godly item for beginning jumpers, especially those who venture to settings with neat vehicles like Sci-fi places and places with airships. This item is not some otherworldly powerhouse or anything it's just a truly stupendous QOL item, especially early on in a chain. Another fantastic 300 CP item is the Constructed Guardian, which is a specially built bodyguard homie item that is fun for if you don't want to be alone while on your adventures but don't love the idea of companions or followers.

The 300 CP perks are the big boys, as to be expected with many of the origin-less jumps. The 300 CP level perks grant straight-up supernatural abilities and eldritch knowledge to those who purchase them. As an example of this, Goblin Market is one of the rare few perks I've seen that allows for the super fun ability to buy and purchase... pretty much anything, really. It's a perk that lets you buy stuff like years from somebody, or their soul, or even their unique abilities and their bloodline. Pay2Win is a neat perk that let's you accelerate your growth (or the growth of others) by spending money. This can let you learn languages by spending money, or teach someone something by spending money. It is expensive to do so, but it's a very intriguing ace in the hole if you need a last minute power up and have a fat wallet you can burn through some cash and potentially save your ass. There's also a 300 CP perk that can save you from chain failing by burning through a fortune (and it will always activate once for free per jump if you purchase it). 

# Synergies with other Edro Generics:

This is a fun one. This little beauty synergizes best with both other Edrogrimshell generics that emphasize the creation of products, so it could go well with enchanter, alchemist, or the two warrior ones that are already out (culinary and style). Products created by a jumper who is any of those professions could easily be enhanced by a merchant jumper paid to enhance goods using their strange abilities such as Investing and people in need of raw resources could pay a merchant to use one of the capstones, Universal Bartering, to create raw goods. Obviously when people are being creative with merchants everyone should accept that the merchant will keep some of the wealth given to them as a fee, but merchants make for skilled allies provided one provides them with coins or other currency.

There's actually no need to focus on products and not services specifically, so this COULD synergize well (provided you have perks that allow tomake deals or have the right to force someone to honor the deal when they visit) with Generic Bard and Generic Tamer both of which are replete with great perks and items for selling stuff. Bards could mix their enhanced mercantile skills with their performing skills and charisma to reach terrifying heights of rizz and wealth. Tamers could have a grand time taming animals, training them, and then using their merchant skills to make a solid living. And of course there will always be scientifically minded jumpers who visit generic tamer and want to build scientific inventions that make a profit and revolutionize entire industries. Those folks will benefit from the various perks that help get things around such as Traveling Merchant and Merchant Vessel as well perks that help you enhance things with money. 

# In Conclusion: 

This is a fun little jump with some interesting QOL items and perks. Most jumpers won't find anything essential here but it makes for an interesting vacation jump, or an intriguing thematic one, where nearly any baby jumper can find neat toys and fun games. Art of the Deal jumpers (merchant types) would find this jump incredibly helpful. Still I know this is a fun setting and jumpers could and should visit!",t2_x030n,False,,0,False,Generic Merchant Is A Fun Time,[],r/JumpChain,False,6.0,,0.0,,,True,t3_1aeicbb,False,dark,1.0,,public,1.0,0.0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},DISCUSSION,False,1,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,,1706597801.0,text,6.0,,,text,self.JumpChain,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time we&amp;#39;re gonna be &lt;a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sPEKF8eRmuXNbbapvWPncYUod8zDxrC3/view""&gt;salespeople&lt;/a&gt;.

In the dynamic landscape of education in India, the significance of preschool education has gained considerable momentum. Recognizing the critical role early childhood education plays in a child's cognitive and emotional development, parents are increasingly seeking high-quality preschools for their little ones. This surge in demand has paved the way for the flourishing business model of  [Best Preschool Franchise in India](https://www.alphabetz.in/preschool-franchise-in-india.html) .

# The Growing Importance of Early Childhood Education

The early years of a child's life are crucial for laying the foundation of various cognitive, emotional, and social skills. Experts emphasize that children who receive quality preschool education are more likely to excel academically and possess better social skills in the long run. Recognizing this, parents are actively investing in their children's early education, sparking a boom in the preschool industry.

# The Birth of Preschool Franchises

In the realm of early education, the franchise model has emerged as a viable and scalable business solution. Preschool franchises offer a systematic and proven approach to education, providing not only a structured curriculum but also a recognizable brand that parents trust. This model allows entrepreneurs to venture into the education sector with a well-established framework, reducing the risks associated with starting a business from scratch.

# Advantages of Opting for a Preschool Franchise

1. **Established Brand and Curriculum:** Preschool franchises come with a pre-defined curriculum and teaching methodology, often developed by education experts. This ensures a standardized and quality education experience across all branches.
2. **Training and Support:** Franchisors typically provide comprehensive training and ongoing support to franchisees. This support ranges from teacher training programs to operational guidance, enabling smooth and efficient functioning of the preschool.
3. **Marketing and Advertising:** Leveraging the power of a recognized brand, preschool franchises benefit from national or regional marketing campaigns conducted by the franchisor. This not only attracts more enrollments but also establishes a sense of trust among parents.
4. **Economies of Scale:** Through a franchise model, individual preschools can take advantage of bulk purchasing, shared resources, and collective marketing efforts, leading to cost savings and increased profitability.
5. **Proven Business Model:** Franchises operate based on a tried-and-tested business model. This reduces the risk for entrepreneurs, as they can rely on the success of the established system.

# The Rise of Preschool Franchises in India

India has witnessed a significant rise in the number of preschool franchises in recent years. The increasing awareness among parents about the importance of early education, coupled with the desire for a trusted and standardized learning environment, has fueled the growth of this industry.

1. **Changing Parental Mindset:** Modern parents are more discerning when it comes to their child's education. They seek not just a daycare service but a holistic learning experience. Preschool franchises, with their structured curriculum and focus on child development, align with the evolving expectations of parents.
2. **Urbanization and Nuclear Families:** The rise of nuclear families and urbanization has led to an increased demand for organized and professional preschool services.  [Alphabetz Franchise](https://www.alphabetz.in/) fill this gap by providing a reliable and quality educational option for working parents.
3. **Government Initiatives:** Government initiatives promoting early childhood education have further boosted the preschool industry. Increased awareness about the importance of early learning has translated into a higher demand for organized preschool services.

# Challenges and Considerations

While the preschool franchise model presents lucrative opportunities, potential entrepreneurs must consider certain challenges:

1. **Competition:** The preschool market is becoming increasingly competitive. Entrepreneurs must differentiate their offerings and maintain a high standard of quality to stand out in the crowded market.
2. **Regulatory Compliance:** Preschools must adhere to various regulations and standards set by education boards and authorities. Ensuring compliance is crucial for the success and sustainability of the franchise.
3. **Quality Control:** Maintaining consistent quality across multiple franchise locations can be challenging. Franchisors must have robust systems in place to monitor and ensure that each preschool maintains the prescribed standards.

,RocketLeagueSchool,"You know the dudes who have made SSL without knowing how to half flip air drib etc.?  Theyre flexing sure, but are also trying to show you something.  Theyre trying to show you what this game truly is, and not what you wish it was.  


Youre champ, and you just cant crack gc.  Maybe you were gc at a point, now you cant get back in.  Maybe you never been there, but think you deserve it.  Im here to tell you that the reason youre not, isnt what you think it is.


Ive been gc consistently every season since 2018 (hard stuck, but thats my own fault).  I know the skills that make you gc and make you just short.  Let's go over the things holding you back.


First and foremost, the most common questions asked here:


- DAR and everything to do with it
- Speedflips
-  why are my teammates...


Which directly feeds into why youre not gc.


DAR while definitely an important skill, will not win you games
Speedflips while definitely an important skill, will not win you games
Your teammates ESPECIALLY will not win you games


Let me explain


DAR helps you angle your car better on aerials.  It grants you no other advantage.  Might kill
Some recoil on touches but there's other ways to beat that.  Your main purpose breaking out of champ has more to do on the ground than in the air.


Speedflips!  Fuck where do i begin.  So many replay analysis of champs and lower are confused because they speedflip to everything.  Listen, most of you arent doing it right.  Some of you are doing it at the wrong time or too much.  And a few of you are doing it right, but thinking because you can, you should win.  It's not true and really, you dont need to bother until about c1 in ONES.  Even then you can win those games without it.  


Teammates.  Hard reality is you wont rank up til you can take over the game.  This stops around gc3ish.


So what can you do?


While i wouldnt say dont learn those things, many people think that's the key to your success.  It just isnt, and what is, is the more finer details of the game.  Im regularly gc1-gc2, and i cant air dribble.  I cant even fuckin do a basic air dribble consistently.  Can i at all?  Yes, but if you ask me ill fuck it up.  So what do i do that you dont?


I Fucking Win Games.


How?  


Sports, that's how.  


If you havent played sports, you may not know.  The thing about practicing sports is it's fucking boring.  Youre not learning how to do 360 slam dunks.  Youre taking free throw shots again, and again, and again, til your arms fall off.  Youre catching rebounds over people taller than you again, and again, and again.  


The things you wanna learn are not helping you win.  Theyre helping you get that ""OHHH SHIT""
moment, in other words stroking your ego.  If youre in it for that, fine.  Dont get mad at your mate when he whiffs a 2v1 save though.  


The simple fact of the matter is youre not ranking up, because youre holding yourself back.  Youre focusing in on the things that get you clips, and not the things that win you games.  If you truly wanna rank up, work on these things:


-  shooting.  Shots you should never miss is a good training pack.  Do it 10 minutes every fucking day.  Switch up which shots you practice.


50s -  in game only.  Stop flipping into all of your 50s and use some geometry.  Honestly experience is the only helper here.  1v1s even though its exhausting.


Defense - learn proper shadow defense.   Stop jumping immediately, you get fucked on those and youre helping noone.  Playing the backboard correctly is critical, put it in the corner.


Passing - fuck passing in 2v2, youll do it when you see it.  To focus on only passing in 2v2 is suicide.  Just get past a defender at a time and goals will come.  



Last but most importantly, chill the fuck out.  Were all guilty of this, but it gets less prevalent the higher you get.  Sometimes, you just have to trust your mate and deal with his fuck up.  It's cool, move on.  You bugging out for a ball that he definitely got is leaving your net open, and you know what im talking about.   


There's SO MUCH more to it than this, but it's a good place to start.  The things someone like Zen does right are often overlooked because of the amazing shit he pulls off.  Look at his second man kickoffs, and tell me what stands out to you.  If it's his speed, or his accuracy on a touch, those things are just expected.  What is impressive is how when he gets to a place where everyone's collecting their boost and getting in position, he can flick his camera down for a fraction of a second, see their trajectory, and know exactly what the fuck is about to happen next.  This game is the purest sport game in existence in my opinion, and should be treated as such.


Gl, ggs, and i hope someone took something away  from this.

,attitudinalpsyche,"I'm quite new to AP, and Psychosophy. I don't have an in-depth knowledge about how it all works, to say the least. I get the general picture, but I'm having a hard time narrowing down my type, since I relate to a lot of them, and I'm really confused what my attitude placements are. for example, there's multiple attitudes I think belong in the same position. I relate to 3L, 3F, and 3F, and I can't decide which I actually am. I need help. So, I'll give you my perspective as to what my relation to each attitude is. this is going to be a really long post. thanks in advance to anyone who is willing to read my rambling. and if you don't want to, you could just read a bit or half from each one, get the gist of it, and comment your guess/opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

Emotion: I was quite sure this was my first attitude/confident position, I considered it as my flexible position, it can appear as insecure sometimes, but I highly doubt, and I'm quite sure it's not my last position/unbothered attitude. my emotions guide me most of the time. I am aware of, and fixated on, my own emotions and others'. I'm a people person, and I love observing the dynamics and interaction between people. and according to other typology systems, I use feeling as my main function. I'm also a 4 in enneagram (I think), I'm very in tune with my own feelings and thoughts, I know where my emotions come from, and listen to my emotions when I shouldn't. But my feelings aren't very deep, and I tend to have a very stable mood, and level emotions, I don't get nor feel the need to get upset or angry often. though, I'm highly sensitive to criticism or anything I take as an insult towards me, even a joke, can stay with me for a long time. I love talking about my feelings and the things I like A LOT. I'm very self-indulgent, as you could probably tell. I also have this desire to be special, ""Different"" or have a distinct identity. in a childish manner, I'd feel upset when others have the same interests and hobbies as me, as I often incorporate those things into my identity, so it almost feels like a part of me was ""stolen"". I'm very talkative, and I dislike being alone. I tend to show my emotions, even the bad, and I can't keep things to myself. I often express my worries and doubts and any negative feelings, which can label me in the eyes of others as a dramatic person. despite all of this, surprisingly, I'm a very shy and socially anxious person, and it's hard for me to truly open up to others, and be truly vulnerable in the sense that I reveal myself, that's why I considered 3E. I have unconventional views and opinions, and my values differ to those around me, so I often keep to myself, even though I don't want to, out of fear of rejection and judgement. even outside of this fact, I often act as someone I'm not, and play up a persona, to hide my ""true self"", out of shame, because I'm a people-pleaser, and I'm highly insecure with a low self-esteem. you could say I'm embarrassed, I find my feelings to be a bit shameful, maybe because of the environment I grew up in, but it's hard for me to express myself honestly. I'm a conformist, despite not wanting to be. I hate being in conflict with others and I fear social pressure, as I often give in. I also fear disappointing others, so I tend to lower their expectations about me, by always using self-deprecating humor and being critical of myself, in hopes I could surprise them. which I know is unhealthy (and stupid as fuck) and only works to further damage my self-esteem, but It became a compulsive habit. I'm a dishonest person, who can be discrete, contradictory, and hard to get to know, or at least open up, but at the same time, I want to be myself, and to be validated for who I am. I'm an expressive person, and I tend to reveal feelings and things I don't want to, it shows inadvertently on my face. despite my low opinion of my sense, I'm a bit ego-centric, and I like to grab attention and be liked/admired even though I fear being in the spotlight or drawing any attention, paradoxically. which made me think maybe I fear people perceiving me as self-centered because I am. I like to think that I'm accepting of others and all their strangeness and flaws, but I'm not sure if that's true. but I'm flawed enough, so my standards can be low for others. I'm a bit soft-hearted, and I hate harsh and judgmental people, despite being guilty of it myself. I also tend to be optimistic, and idealistic, to the point of impracticality, that's why I feel hopeful about my life, self, and future despite it all seeming less than ideal. my ideas are often romanticized and unrealistic in contrast to reality, maybe because I want a lot from life. Another fact is that I can be harsh and blunt, and mean to others, and I have been called out a lot for that, even though I try to not to be, I can get worked up and express my anger or frustration at others inappropriately. I also act in an ironic, sarcastic, sometimes offensive way (a habit I carried from my younger self), I say things I don't mean at all a lot of the time. My humor tends to be the same, often playful and sarcastic, very silly or is shocking and clever. I love making people laugh and being considered funny. I also think I'm perceptive of other people's thoughts, feelings, and nature. and for what it it's worth, my sister mentioned before that I know how to please and comfort others, and persuade them when they are upset with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Logic: I enjoy philosophical and metaphysical discussions, talking about beliefs and ideas and their validity, but I honestly think it doesn't come from a desire to learn or inquisitiveness, but rather as a way to feed into my ego and compensate for my intellectual insecurity. I'm not a very intelligent person, average or below. something happened to me 2-3 years ago and I became unable to function normally, and it feels like I lost a lot of my intelligence. I had invested all my self-worth and prided myself in my mental abilities and perceptiveness, which I think is because I didn't have an external, tangible value in the world, so I had to look to something inward, to feel better about myself. this ""loss of intelligence"" took a toll on my self-esteem, so I started acting and talking like I was smarter than I actually am, and learning and reading a lot to make up for it. but in reality, I doubt I have a real desire for learning and intellectual pursuits, more than it being a confidence boost. I also tend to distrust my own mind, thoughts, and opinions, I would question everything and my beliefs and others' and it's hard for me to take a strong stand on anything, and I would often get into arguments, and I enjoy debating. I have the habit of challenging others' beliefs and opinions, especially if they are confident in it, and can relate to playing the devil's advocate, to poke holes in their arguments and to see just how much they are sure before I can be convinced. I tend to be a contrarian and pessimistic to those who hold ""positive"" beliefs about the world, but the same goes for the opposite as well. somehow, I'm also a conformist in all aspects, and I would be swayed by others' opinions easily, and even change my mind just to please them when I'm pressured, at least outwardly. I struggle with independent thinking, and often conform to other people's thinking, sometimes even using their words and opinions in conversations when I'm asked about mine, because I fear being wrong or incorrect. my doubtful nature also comes from that, I have a fear of holding the wrong opinion or view,  so I keep turning over every opinion I have to make sure I'm confident enough in it, especially when I have to convey it, I'm very careful to show that I'm not confident in those opinions. It makes me open-minded (to the point where my brain fell out), and I easily change my mind when I'm proven wrong. because I'm so skeptical, I'm prone to being neutral, and taking the middle ground on most things, and I hate extremism and people who have strong convictions and are dogmatic about their beliefs, same as I hate judgmental, opinionated people and harsh judgments. but I often feel the need to ""take a side"" and I dislike uncertainty, so sometimes I might act neutral, and try to be, but I'm always biased. I'm also not very good with logical reasoning, critical thinking, and sometimes I lack common sense, It's part of the mental problem I'm struggling with, but it generally applies. most of my beliefs that are important to me are more emotional than logical/rational, but I usually prefer they go hand-in-hand, and would resist a belief if it goes against logic. But I don't think I run on logic and reason, but rather emotion and inspiration.

&amp;#x200B;

Physics: I've had it as my confident attitude on the test multiple times, but I'm not really sure. my relationship with this attitude is a bit complicated. I have always been a hyperactive and lively person with a lot of energy, seeking and enjoying physical activity and experiences but I'm not sure If I really have much interest in the physical world. it often only piques my interest when it relates to my emotions or something special to me. as a child, I used to collect things I thought were pretty, even useless junk, and hold onto it like it was my treasure, if that's relevant. I also used to be ""materialistic"" if that applies, and liked to buy things and owning things used to fulfill me emotionally. I'm focused on the physical world, more than the abstract maybe, but I don't have a strong feeling regarding my surroundings, and I would often ""escape"" to my fantasies and imaginations to avoid reality, but I have a really weak imagination so it often feels not enough, I want to better my reality and become who I want to be instead of fantasizing about it. I'm also known to be comically clumsy, with horrible coordination, and am very oblivious to my surroundings, as I tend to be restless and move a lot and quickly, I'd often trip and bump into things, break stuff, all of that. I also don't have the best relationship with my body, I've always really felt uncomfortable and self-conscious about my appearance, body, and am shy about bodily functions, and basically everything related to it, and always desired to have another body. and my anxiety doesn't help either, as I'm a hypochondriac, and would get panic attacks and become anxious about my health, which comes from my fear of death. so much so that when I was a child, I stopped eating, at least solid food for several months, due to fearing that I'd choke and die after a slightly traumatic choking experience a while prior to this problem. and I'd suffer from severe insomnia due to anxiety that I wouldn't be able to sleep, so I wasn't able to sleep, which is hilarious. and I also can get uncomfortable with physical sensations sometimes as I feel them deeply, and I'm always focused on what's happening in my body. and I'd only feel comfortable when I had taken care of my needs. despite this, I don't really pay much attention to my surroundings, as it would often be very messy, and I wouldn't really mind, it doesn't make much difference to me. so I would often neglect cleaning and chores, and the same applies to myself. as gross as it sounds, I would neglect my hygiene and appearance a lot, I often have a crude and unkempt appearance. I also really love food and would often binge eat, and I have trouble controlling my cravings and impulses when it comes to food, I lack discipline. I often use food as an escapism, when I feel sad or empty or for enjoyment, I eat a lot. however, I'm not really picky with food, I'd often eat and enjoy whatever, I'm not sensitive to the taste of food.

&amp;#x200B;

Volition: most likely my 3rd/insecure attitude. I have a weak will-power, even though I like debate and often get into arguments, I don't like being aggressive or in conflict with others, and I tend to give in easily and apologize a lot even when I'm not wrong, most likely due to my low self-esteem. with everyone I'm not REALLY close to, I'm meek, shy, and a pushover even. as a child, I was much, much more stubborn, and a really entitled child. I often demanded what I wanted, getting it with force. my parents were lenient and permissive, so they reinforced this behavior in me one way or another, but I'm not blaming them at all. I have always been a ""follower"" in my life, I used to be the one who tags along and follows orders, despite wanting to be in charge of my life, and I usually react aggressively to being controlled. my parents were very controlling, in the sense that they controlled and decided everything for me in life, and I've always rebelled against it, but it has definitely affected me, becoming too dependent on others. in general, I want and desire to be independent, and the idea of anyone else having control over my life is depressing. my low sense of self-worth comes from the fact that I don't feel like a normal person, and that I'm below others, and I'm aware of the social gap between me and other people. I'm highly self-conscious, and I often get embarrassed about things I shouldn't, my insecurities are often plastered all over. I often talk in this nervous, hesitant tone, same with my body language. I desire to be normal, or achieve some standard of social success. I cannot live a life that is meaningless/without purpose, and I strive to achieve a place where I feel valuable and worthy. I struggle a lot with productivity, following my goals, or doing anything valuable with my time. I tend to be aimless and lazy, and I'm not confident in my ability to make good life decisions. I'm also really fickle and impulsive and tend to change my mind quickly and a lot. despite this, I enjoy working towards a goal, and the feeling of being productive, as it gives me a sense of purpose and worthiness, if that makes sense. I have a deep sense of envy towards those I perceive as possessing the things that are missing in my life/that I desire the most. like I mentioned, I'm very intellectually insecure, so when I see people who are around my age and appear to be more intelligent or learned than me, plus points if they are visually attractive and/or have a normal/nice life, I become instantly depressed. I often fall into self-pity, blaming my circumstances and outside factors, and everyone else. I get this unjustified sense of anger, and become competitive, to become better, or prove myself to be better than them, and sometimes belittle the other person and find anything ""bad"" about them to make me feel better about myself. It's almost like I feel entitled to be better than everyone else, which is horrible. in general, as I said before, I'm hopeful and ambitious about my future, that maybe I'll one day be normal and have a good life, despite no concrete evidence of that.

&amp;#x200B;

I&amp;#39;m also not very good with logical reasoning, critical thinking, and sometimes I lack common sense, It&amp;#39;s part of the mental problem I&amp;#39;m struggling with, but it generally applies. most of my beliefs that are important to me are more emotional than logical/rational, but I usually prefer they go hand-in-hand, and would resist a belief if it goes against logic. But I don&amp;#39;t think I run on logic and reason, but rather emotion and inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physics: I&amp;#39;ve had it as my confident attitude on the test multiple times, but I&amp;#39;m not really sure. my relationship with this attitude is a bit complicated. I have always been a hyperactive and lively person with a lot of energy, seeking and enjoying physical activity and experiences but I&amp;#39;m not sure If I really have much interest in the physical world. it often only piques my interest when it relates to my emotions or something special to me. as a child, I used to collect things I thought were pretty, even useless junk, and hold onto it like it was my treasure, if that&amp;#39;s relevant. I also used to be &amp;quot;materialistic&amp;quot; if that applies, and liked to buy things and owning things used to fulfill me emotionally. I&amp;#39;m focused on the physical world, more than the abstract maybe, but I don&amp;#39;t have a strong feeling regarding my surroundings, and I would often &amp;quot;escape&amp;quot; to my fantasies and imaginations to avoid reality, but I have a really weak imagination so it often feels not enough, I want to better my reality and become who I want to be instead of fantasizing about it. I&amp;#39;m also known to be comically clumsy, with horrible coordination, and am very oblivious to my surroundings, as I tend to be restless and move a lot and quickly, I&amp;#39;d often trip and bump into things, break stuff, all of that. I also don&amp;#39;t have the best relationship with my body, I&amp;#39;ve always really felt uncomfortable and self-conscious about my appearance, body, and am shy about bodily functions, and basically everything related to it, and always desired to have another body. and my anxiety doesn&amp;#39;t help either, as I&amp;#39;m a hypochondriac, and would get panic attacks and become anxious about my health, which comes from my fear of death. so much so that when I was a child, I stopped eating, at least solid food for several months, due to fearing that I&amp;#39;d choke and die after a slightly traumatic choking experience a while prior to this problem. and I&amp;#39;d suffer from severe insomnia due to anxiety that I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to sleep, so I wasn&amp;#39;t able to sleep, which is hilarious. and I also can get uncomfortable with physical sensations sometimes as I feel them deeply, and I&amp;#39;m always focused on what&amp;#39;s happening in my body. and I&amp;#39;d only feel comfortable when I had taken care of my needs. despite this, I don&amp;#39;t really pay much attention to my surroundings, as it would often be very messy, and I wouldn&amp;#39;t really mind, it doesn&amp;#39;t make much difference to me. so I would often neglect cleaning and chores, and the same applies to myself. as gross as it sounds, I would neglect my hygiene and appearance a lot, I often have a crude and unkempt appearance. I also really love food and would often binge eat, and I have trouble controlling my cravings and impulses when it comes to food, I lack discipline. I often use food as an escapism, when I feel sad or empty or for enjoyment, I eat a lot. however, I&amp;#39;m not really picky with food, I&amp;#39;d often eat and enjoy whatever, I&amp;#39;m not sensitive to the taste of food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volition: most likely my 3rd/insecure attitude. I have a weak will-power, even though I like debate and often get into arguments, I don&amp;#39;t like being aggressive or in conflict with others, and I tend to give in easily and apologize a lot even when I&amp;#39;m not wrong, most likely due to my low self-esteem. with everyone I&amp;#39;m not REALLY close to, I&amp;#39;m meek, shy, and a pushover even. as a child, I was much, much more stubborn, and a really entitled child. I often demanded what I wanted, getting it with force. my parents were lenient and permissive, so they reinforced this behavior in me one way or another, but I&amp;#39;m not blaming them at all. I have always been a &amp;quot;follower&amp;quot; in my life, I used to be the one who tags along and follows orders, despite wanting to be in charge of my life, and I usually react aggressively to being controlled. my parents were very controlling, in the sense that they controlled and decided everything for me in life, and I&amp;#39;ve always rebelled against it, but it has definitely affected me, becoming too dependent on others. in general, I want and desire to be independent, and the idea of anyone else having control over my life is depressing. my low sense of self-worth comes from the fact that I don&amp;#39;t feel like a normal person, and that I&amp;#39;m below others, and I&amp;#39;m aware of the social gap between me and other people. I&amp;#39;m highly self-conscious, and I often get embarrassed about things I shouldn&amp;#39;t, my insecurities are often plastered all over. I often talk in this nervous, hesitant tone, same with my body language. I desire to be normal, or achieve some standard of social success. I cannot live a life that is meaningless/without purpose, and I strive to achieve a place where I feel valuable and worthy. I struggle a lot with productivity, following my goals, or doing anything valuable with my time. I tend to be aimless and lazy, and I&amp;#39;m not confident in my ability to make good life decisions. I&amp;#39;m also really fickle and impulsive and tend to change my mind quickly and a lot. despite this, I enjoy working towards a goal, and the feeling of being productive, as it gives me a sense of purpose and worthiness, if that makes sense. I have a deep sense of envy towards those I perceive as possessing the things that are missing in my life/that I desire the most. like I mentioned, I&amp;#39;m very intellectually insecure, so when I see people who are around my age and appear to be more intelligent or learned than me, plus points if they are visually attractive and/or have a normal/nice life, I become instantly depressed. I often fall into self-pity, blaming my circumstances and outside factors, and everyone else. I get this unjustified sense of anger, and become competitive, to become better, or prove myself to be better than them, and sometimes belittle the other person and find anything &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; about them to make me feel better about myself. It&amp;#39;s almost like I feel entitled to be better than everyone else, which is horrible. in general, as I said before, I&amp;#39;m hopeful and ambitious about my future, that maybe I&amp;#39;ll one day be normal and have a good life, despite no concrete evidence of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the 3 types I relate to the most are: EFLV (Mostly by the description) ELVF, EFVL. I also relate to VELF, but it&amp;#39;s solely by description, I don&amp;#39;t relate much to the attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;

,EmoScreamo,"Is there a more controversial topic in this scene than Third Wave Emo? The maligned time period in the genre’s great history was also Emo’s biggest commercial boom, with Emo-Pop and Emo-Adjacent juggernauts becoming household names. The story goes that once bands like Taking Back Sunday and My Chemical Romance burst onto the scene, Emo’s dwindling Second Wave immediately died off and the ethos of the genre perished with it until some brave Revivalists brought it back from the dead in the early 2010s. However, this simplistic view minimizes the hard work that the underground, basement and DIY Emo scenes around the world were putting in during this very same span. 

Some bands looked at the 15+ year history of Emo to that point and continued to push those qualities. Others sought to innovate on Emo’s established sound, especially by fusing it with different genres. Others still invoked the relatively unknown Kinsella brothers’ unique approach to Emo and expanded upon it. 

With that said, this series will be taking a very deep dive into the world of underground, DIY and otherwise lesser-known Emo during its Third Wave. Many people believe no real Emo music was released during this time and, while the purpose of these articles isn’t to discredit mainstream Emo-Pop or to define what “real Emo” is, I want to dispel that notion completely and recontextualize Emo as a continued underground movement from the Second Wave to the Fourth Wave instead of the disconnected death and revival of a genre.

A few notes before we continue:

-Splitting Emo into different waves isn’t even a universally agreed-upon metric for defining the genre and its characteristics, but I find it to be a fairly useful way to categorize its history.    
-The general timeline that’s agreed on for the Third Wave is roughly 2002-2008. I used these years as a basis for gathering releases.    
-There is VERY little information on this topic out there, so I’d like to give a special shout-out to u/4010 and u/intrepid-mall9100 for all of the amazing resources.    
-I am not a grand Emo historian who’s lived through every Wave and attended millions of shows throughout the world, so if you believe I’ve incorrectly categorized an artist or release, just let me know your opinions in the comments.    
-I will be putting each section in roughly chronological order. Specific release dates can be hard to find so I’ll do my best to put these out in order.    
-Please give me suggestions in the comments! I’d love to add to this and make it even more comprehensive. 

Now that those disclaimers are out of the way, I present the first part of this series: The Last Vestiges of the Second Wave.

This section will cover Second Wave Emo artists who continued to release music between 2002-2008, especially those who utilized characteristics of that Wave’s sound. 

##Billy Music - Midwest Index (2002)
With one of the worst band names in existence (and a hair more googlable than their original band name “Billy”), Billy Music released their sole LP Midwest Index in 2002 after a couple of EPs and an appearance on one of the Emo Diaries compilations. At least the album name is appropriate for across 10 tracks is a sort of catalog of Midwest Emo tropes, collected together as sort of a primer for newer fans of the 90s Emo sound. This is a hidden gem.

##Kilowatthours - The Bright Side (2002)
Given the band had a lot more Post-Rock influences when they first released music in 1999, they nonetheless released an EP and LP before 2002 with strong Emo influence, so this album deserves to be in this section. Still employing a heaping tablespoon of Post-Rock in their music, this release is more grounded in Midwest Emo than anything they’ve done before. The vocals are soft so as not to disturb the atmosphere of each song.

Check this album out if you are looking for the cozier side of the Second Wave Emo sound and get a minute preview into the future of Emo during the Third Wave…

##Benton Falls - Guilt Beats Hate (2002)
Calling this a prototypical Second Wave Emo would do this album a great disservice as it's filled to the brim with passion, feeling and poetry. Benton Falls doesn't quite reach the lofty heights of their debut album, but this release is only a notch below. The Post-Hardcore-tinged Emo that was popularized by bands like Texas is the Reason and Mineral is fully on display here with messy, loud guitars, occasional belted screams and shifting volume dynamics.


This was released in early 2002, making it sort of the swan song to Second Wave Emo. This album is a real tour de force for the genre and is recommended to anyone who misses that 90s sound.

##Piebald - We Are the Only Friends We Have (2002)
Piebald was firmly entrenched in Second Wave Emo canon by releasing several EPs and albums in the 90s. These quality Midwest Emo releases would ensure the band had a loyal cult following, but they arguably released their magnum opus in 2002 and changed the trajectory of their legacy forever. 

Taking the bones of Midwest Emo and using different time signatures, they unlocked their melodic potential on this album by incorporating elements of the burgeoning Emo-Pop movement. The anthemic hooks only add to the experience, making this arguably their best album. Do not let the Emo-Pop influence deter you - the edginess in the production ensures this is Emo, through and through.

##Pop Unknown - The August Division (2002)
Conventional wisdom says this album isn’t as good as Pop Unknown’s previous LP, but I’d like to think The August Division stands on its own next to its progenitor. Taking Midwest Emo, sprinkling in some Post-Punk elements and injecting the whole thing with a ton of infectious melody, Pop Unknown deliver with their swan song. This album immediately grabs your attention and refuses to let go.

##Brandtson - Dial In Sounds (2002)
Utilizing classic Midwest Emo as a base and tossing mild Pop-Punk and Post-Hardcore elements is a winning formula with Dial In Sounds. With a career spanning from the late 90s into the mid 00s, Brandtson has released a prolific discography with somewhat mixed results, but this one is a definite notch in the “win” column. 

##Pedro the Lion - Control (2002)
Put simply, this is a bummer album. The Indie Rock-soaked Emo of Pedro the Lion's previous releases is present with bitter, crunchy guitars and a melancholic storyline that weaves the album together. The slew of mid-tempo tracks with Bazan’s droning voice wear on you emotionally over the course of 10 tracks.


Pedro the Lion is known for consistency, but this is perhaps their most solid and memorable outing as a band. 

##The Gloria Record - Start Here (2002)
The successor to Mineral, The Gloria Record was a passionate Midwest Emo band with less Post-Hardcore than their predecessor. The band's sound is often compared to Radiohead, and not just because their songwriting is both excellent and TGR display Indie traits, but because Start Here is this band's OK Computer.

The Emo bones of the band are present here, but the sonic exploration employed by Simpson and the boys is as vast as it is genre-defying. Perhaps calling this a “vestage of the Second Wave” isn’t exactly true as this album could have been revolutionary for the genre had it blown up in popularity. However, as dying branch of the Second Wave, this underrated album deserves its place here for how forward-thinking it is.

##Camber - Wake Up and Be Happy (2002)
Bursting onto the scene in 1997, Camber gained some notoriety by being in the first Emo Diaries compilation, along with a very good SDRE-inspired first LP. After a few more releases, they put out their last full-length in 2002 and is considered one of their weaker releases. However, I think there are some pretty decent ideas in here and the songs are pretty neat. Check it out if you’re itching for more authentic 90s Emo.

##King of Like Spitting - Bridges Worth Burning (2002)
Since the mid 90s, Kind of Like Spitting occupied an unparalleled space during the Second Wave, playing Midwest Emo with heavy dosages of Indie and some Folksy elements for good measure. A prolific discography and a few magna opera later, we’re in 2002 with KoLS’s final Midwest Emo release, Bridges Worth Burning. This LP is arguably on the same level as their previous greatest releases, trending toward being more upbeat. 

Beyond anything else, the passion with which this band plays, particularly in the vocals, is undeniable, much like the lyrics. Very few albums sound quite like this, so this is a must-listen. Soon hereafter, KoLS would veer hard into the Indie Folk direction, so this really serves as a denoument to their Emo career.

##The Casket Lottery - Survival is for Cowards (2002)
The Casket Lottery is a band with amazing longevity and consistency, having made splits with the likes of Hot Water Music and Touche Amore. After some really good albums and EPs in the late 90s / early 00s, 2002 saw the release of (arguably) their magnum opus, Survival is for Cowards. A potent blend of Post-Hardcore and Midwest Emo, this LP borrows much from the Second Wave but introduces fresh songwriting ideas, making this a sort of breath of fresh air.

Extremely powerful vocals are driven by an exemplary rhythm section that keeps the listener engaged throughout its ~30 minute runtime.

##The Jim Yoshii Pile-Up - Homemade Drugs (2002)
Somehow, despite being brighter and overall more hopeful than their debut LP, Homemade Drugs is still a distressing, uhurried album. Tiny elements of Indie and Post-Rock are evident in this album, beginning to turn the Second Wave sound in a new direction. 

Homemade Drugs isn’t the most well-known or beloved release in this section, but it is one of the best, especially if you’re looking for Emo music to sit back and dissociate to.

##Jets to Brazil - Perfecting Loneliness (2002)
Emo woven with equal parts Indie Rock, this late 90s Emo “supergroup” released their final LP Perfecting Loneliness in 2002. Little debate exists that Jets to Brazil's first album is their all-time musical accomplishment, but their final album is still worthy of praise. Fantastic lyricism and an overall softer tone characterize this album. 

Songs regularly exceed 5 minutes of length on this album so if you’re searching for quick bursts of energy as songs, this one isn't for you. However, if you enjoy a mature take on Indie with inextricable Emo roots, this one is worth a listen.

##Waxwing - Nobody Can Take What Everyone Owns (2002)
Waxwing produced Punk-leaning Emo goodness with their final LP. Although the album isn’t extraordinary, the songs are quite fun and energetic with pretty good vocals. Notably, one of the band’s guitarists, Cody Votolato, was working with The Blood Brothers at the same time. 

##Kid Brother Collective - Highway Miles (2002)
Simple, old-school Emo that will make you yearn for simpler days. In the end, that’s all this genre needs. Nothing extraordinary on display, but more fare for those in the Mineral / Penfold camp.

##Rainer Maria - Long Knives Drawn (2003)
Although Rainer Maria had changed fairly significantly since the band’s origins in the 90s, namely in the absence of male vocals, they had strong Emo ties in this 2003 LP. An Emo / Indie hybrid with the ethos of the Second Wave, what sets this album apart is how poppy Rainer Maria allow themselves to go, giving a memorable quality to the majority of the songs. This is an excellent addition to the band’s consistently good discography.

##Cursive - Ugly Organ (2003)
This one is probably one of the most well-known and beloved albums on this list, but I figure it’d be worth including it. Cursive began their career in the thick of the Second Wave, releasing two decent albums in the 90s before unleashing their first masterpiece Domestica in 2000. Following up on this unbelievable LP would be no small feat, but when Cursive released Ugly Organ in 2003, they did just that with an equally (if not more so) compelling album. 

About 50/50 Post-Hardcore / Emo, Ugly Organ adds a cellist to the lineup, greatly expanding past the audio barriers of the genre’s typical instruments. Sinister, dissonant and brooding, this one needs to be heard to be believed. One of the best releases during the Third Wave. Fortunately, this band is still kicking and making awesome music.

##Elliott - Song in the Air (2003)
The third and final full LP from Elliott, Song in the Air bookends their legendary (if somewhat obscure) discography with another great release, even if it perhaps falls short of the grandiosity of False Cathedrals. Regardless, this record encapsulates the evolution of a band from a more typical Mineral-like vibe to a dreamy, ethereal one. The vocals are smooth and gentle while the atmosphere provided by the instruments is dense and layered. 

Elliott typify Second Wave Emo in one respect while pushing the boundaries of the genre at the time. You can really feel that this band could have gotten big under the right circumstances.

##Small Brown Bike - Nail Yourself to the Ground (2003)
2003 was Small Brown Bike’s biggest year, having released an LP and EP, both very well received. Utilizing that classic Post-Hardcore / Emo formula with their very own spin, Small Brown Bike sound like no other on this EP. With only five songs (and one being a completely different folksy song with slide guitars), the band gave 2003 a huge opening salvo with this one.

##The Appleseed Cast - Two Conversations (2003)
The Appleseed Cast is one of the most prolific acts in all of Emo and, by the Third Wave, had already established themselves as one of Emo’s great innovators. They experimented with Post-Rock on Mare Vitalis and perfected the combination of Post-Rock and Emo with Low Level Owl Vol 1 and 2, all before 2002 even hit!

Two Conversations takes the grandiosity of Low Level Owl and strips it to its barest form, more personal and intimate than anything this band had released previously (and possibly since). A breakup concept album isn’t exactly ingenious, but it’s executed very well across 10 songs; each track is handcrafted to fit the album’s flow perfectly and they add up to be greater than the sum of their parts. This band, and especially this album, would have a huge effect on Third Wave Emo going forward.

##Small Brown Bike - The River Bed (2003)
Expanding sonically on what they produced earlier in the year with Nail Yourself to the Ground, Small Brown Bike ended their first run as a band with an immensely influential full-length album. One could argue that the sound palette screams Post-Hardcore and doesn’t have much to do with Emo, but the album owes almost its entire structure to 90s Emo. 
 
The catchiness of the vocals and instruments is juxtaposed perfectly with the rough Post-Hardcore edges of each track, sacrificing none of the heaviness of the band in the process of getting stuck in your head. 

##Brandtson - Send Us A Signal (2004)
Brandtson dives deeper into the Indie Rock sound but doesn’t lose its core Midwest Emo roots with this full-length. With more Emo-Pop influence than ever, the hooks are as catchy as they’ve ever been for this band. You can hear the evolution of their sound compared even to their previous record, and that’s definitely a good thing.

##I Hate Myself - 3 Songs (2005)
With almost no released music in the 2000s, I Hate Myself produced one final outing in 2005 with their 3 Songs EP. Gone are the half-Emo, half-Screamo days of yore and this one is pretty much pure Second Wave Midwest Emo. However, this leaves room for wonderful vocal melodies and driving songs. Definitely worth listening to this band’s final moments together.

This next section covers albums and EPs released in the Third Wave that are heavily indebted to the Second Wave’s signature sound from bands that weren’t really around for that time period. This should go to show that even though Emo was taking on an entirely different meaning in mainstream contexts, there were many acts dedicated to keeping the older traditions alive. This section is called Carrying the Flag of the Second Wave.

##.waterpistol. - Between Here and There is Everything (2002)
Debuting with a three-song EP in the year 2000, this relatively obscure band is far enough removed from the Second Wave to appear in this section, at least in my opinion. Fun, active prototypical Midwest Emo is what you’ll find on this album. This definitely sounds like Hardcore kids doing softer Emo music and it shows in the ever-present energy of the instruments and vocals. 

Rest of My Life - Rest of My Life (2002)
This is the first release from the How is Annie label in Norway, one that is very important to the Nordic Emo scene. Rest of My Life’s self-titled LP is heavily indebted to the sounds of Second Wave Midwest Emo with hints of Post-Rock throughout. This sound palette would be a staple of the How is Annie lineup of bands, some of which you’ll see later in this series.

A strong presence of Post-Hardcore in the occasional screams and heavier moments of this album give the songs a sense of urgency while the Post-Rock influence ensures the serenity of the quieter moments. This small evolution in Emo’s sound helped pave the way for more great releases in the future.

##Time Spent Driving - Just Enough Bright (2002)
One of the more popular albums on this list, Time Spent Driving played classic Midwest Emo with Emo-Pop sensibilities on this album, giving the release its own brand of charm. Situated perfectly at the edge where Emo went mainstream and where Emo remained underground.

##Rescue - Volume Plus Volume (2002)
With their debut LP, Rescue took the Post-Hardcore / Emo combination that was so popular in the mid-late 90s, added Math Rock elements like changing time signatures and played almost every song with a sense of urgency. Had this released sometime in the late 90s and was picked up by the right people, we might be calling this a minor Emo classic today.

In 2004, the band rereleased this album as Volume Plus Volume Plus, which included a bonus CD featuring their 2002 EP Even People and Not the Odds and other unreleased tracks. 


##8-Bit Revival - Up &amp; Atom (2002)
Standard 90s-sounding Midwest Emo fare, this debut EP is a great look into an up-and-coming underground Emo band. This group would change their name to Oh Condor but possibly changed it back at some point (not so sure about the name change history), so expect to see more of them in this series.

##Time to Fly - Birth.Work.Death (2002)
On their sole release, Time to Fly utilized the blueprints left behind by bands like Penfold and injected it with a high dose of Emo-Pop, a burgeoning influence during this period. Regardless, the LP stands on its own as a Second Wave-inspired Emo.

The vocals are catchy and melodic, juxtaposed by the occasional scream. There are tons of riffs and even some twinkles in there, adding to the diversity of dynamics found throughout the album. This is a true hidden gem.

##Rockets and Bluelights - Close At Hand (2002)
Released during an unknown time in 2002, Close At Hand is Rockets and Bluelights’ first demo. Simply put, this thing rocks. Produced with that 90s analog sound, this harrowing mix of Post-Hardcore and Midwest Emo comes at you with great force, but it doesn’t take away from the subtle elements of Post-Rock that somewhat spring this band into the future of the genre. Alas, I’ve decided to place them in this section of the list.

##Susquatch - First Demo (2003)
Since the 90s, Japan has had a flourishing Emo scene. Most here are aware of the Japanese Post-Rock / Screamo combination made famous by envy. However, Japan also kept Punky / melodic Emo alive during the 00s, usually with unique influences.

susquatch is a band that gained notoriety in 2009 with their twinkly debut LP right at the beginning of the Revival, but most are not aware of their debut Demo EP. With just the smallest hints that this is Japanese Emo, susquatch actually plays tribute to the greatness of Second Wave Emo quite effectively here. This isn't their only appearance in this series, but with four years to go before releasing their next EP, their sound would undergo massive changes.

##Halos for Martyrs - A Rush of Sound and the Silence That Follows (2003)
Make no mistake: this EP is a love letter to Second Wave Emo in both production and style. The ever-present Post-Hardcore accompanies Halos for Martyrs through an Emo musical journey while Math Rock influences seep in through the cracks, particularly in the twinkly riffs scattered about. This release was definitely an overlooked gem in 2003.

##A Season Drive - Summer of ‘73 (2003)
On the lighter side of Emo without veering into Emo-Pop territory, A Season Drive delivers a fun Second Wave-esque album in the vein of Sunny Day Real Estate. This album is by no means a classic, but it does keep the old ways alive for just a little bit longer.

##Filmmaker - Invitation to an Accident (2003)
Plain and simple, this is Seam-esque Midwest Emo done right, with just the right amount of Indie Rock influence to give the vocalist some fun melodies to play with. This band had one other EP released in 2001, but this would be their final release. Though this album is very short of groundbreaking, it’s a worthy listen for 90s Emo fans.

##Settlefish - Dance A While, Upset (2003)
Extremely difficult to find, this album has about half the songs featured on other Deep Elm compilations, so you can still hear the masterful and somewhat bleak Midwest emo songwriting used throughout. Nothing here is exceptional, but this refreshing take on Second Wave Midwest Emo features its share of twinkles and fun, mathy moments. 

##The Jealous Sound - Kill Them With Kindness (2003)
Quite jealous I am, indeed! To create such pure, unadulterated fun is an underappreciated aspect of Emo but The Jealous Sound does so with very simple song structures. Now yes, let’s clear the elephant in the room: Brian Shehan of Knapsack fame reprises his role as frontman of this band, utilizing a familiar Indie Rock / Emo approach. Knapsack’s unique qualities made them a very influential Emo band from the mid 90s, but few could hope to replicate them. Even The Jealous Sound doesn’t exactly…sound like Knapsack.

Fear not, for while The Jealous Sound is inherently indebted to Brian’s earlier project, they stand on their own two feet. With less overtly-Punk-influenced songs than Knapsack, a healthy use of synths and a few Emo-Pop sensibilities, they definitely are beginning to grow out of the shadow of Second Wave Emo, but perhaps are too intertwined with the time period to be completely removed from it.

##The December Drive - Handslikegunsandcrashingsounds (2003)
Releasing in 2003, this album was allegedly in the works for about three years and DAMN does that seem right! At its core, Handslikegunsandcrashingsounds is a Second Wave-inspired Emo / Post-Hardcore tour de force. Small elements of Post-Rock seep into the album, generating a powerful aura around each song. Powerful guitarwork lays the foundation for a truly unforgettable vocal performance.

Although this album takes a lot of direction from the Second Wave classics, The December Drive injects this album with their own flavor, giving this album a slightly forward-thinking edge compared to many of the true 90s Emo bands. This is without a doubt one of the best albums in this entire section.

##Dead Letter Auction - Cancer of Time (2003)
Dissonant and noisy, Cancer of Time is Dead Letter Auction’s only full-length and boy, is it a doozy! If you like technical Post-Hardcore with a 90s Emo foundation, you’ve come to the right band. The shouty vocals add to the cacophonous atmosphere as much as the dynamic shifts to quiet. 

##Outsmarting Simon - Silent Sober and Sound (2003)
Taking as much influence from Mineral and Penfold as they did from early Jimmy Eat World and The Get Up Kids, Outsmarting Simon debuted with this great traditional Emo LP. Silent Sober and Sound showcases the band's propensity for quiet-loud dynamics and dreamy atmospheres. Not the most memorable album, but definitely one with a pulse on the genre. 

##Rockets and Bluelights - A Smashed City with Flames and Music in the Air (2003)
One of the most criminally underlooked and underrated Midwest Emo releases ever, it’s also ludicrously short with only four songs. The Post-Hardcore guitar tone is punchy and robust, leaning into the Emo clean dynamic seamlessly from the heavy distortion. The rhythm section does wonders in giving the songs style, keeping up with the spastic energy of the highs and the subtly of the lows. 

Rudimentary Post-Rock song structures come into play in this EP, giving each track its own identity. 

##Kid Kilowatt - Guitar Method (2004)
Wow, this stuff is great! It almost sounds like it was ACTUALLY recorded between 1996 and 1999! Oh…well, it looks like it WAS recorded during that time! I’m not sure if this album should count on this list as it’s more of a compilation of the band’s recorded material from that time, released in CD format a half-decade after their breakup, Regardless, Kid Kilowatt featured members of Cave In, Piebald and even Converge. Despite that sort of street cred, they played fairly straightforward Indie-influenced Emo.

This LP can feel a bit disjointed at times, a consequence of releasing all of the band’s material at once in LP format. However, if this album had come out in the late 90s while the band was still around, we might be calling this one of the best undiscovered Emo bands of the 90s (I guess we can technically still call them that).

##The 101 - Green Street (2004)
The 101 use analog-sounding production that would be at home with the 90s Emo greats, utilizing some primitive Emo-Pop elements such as great use of melody and the odd synth here or there. The individual songs may not have much to write home about, but the flow of the album is actually quite good, making the sum greater than its parts.

This is especially good if you dig Christie Front Drive.

##The Moirai - Bury Yourself (2005)
Brian Carley, vocalist and guitarist of Penfold, refused to let Emo go by the wayside in the 2000s. Somehow, in the year 2005, The Moirai managed to unveil a 90s Emo classic that seemed lost to time and had just been unearthed. Midwest Emo had all but perished from the face of the Earth at this point, especially in the form of 90s Second Wave Emo, but The Moirai’s sole release aimed to inject the dying genre with one last super boost.

Bury Yourself is a true successor to Penfold’s two classic Second Wave albums, featuring almost every member of the aforementioned band in the credits. The complexity of the compositions appears deceptively simple to the untrained ear, but the quiet-loud dynamics that Penfold made a career of are all here in spades. Brian’s vocal performance is as good as it ever has been; legitimately, one of the best vocal performances you’re going to hear in this entire series. The vocal mastery is only matched by the intelligent, passionate lyrics it delivers. Alas, the Second Wave can finally rest easy knowing The Moirai gave it a proper sendoff.

##Minor Ache - Black Hours Surround You (2006)
Black Hours Surround You is Minor Ache’s only release, coming in at about 30 minutes. However, despite being released sometime in 2005-2006 (the exact release date appears to be unclear), this has the spirit of a 90s Emo / Indie Rock classic! Light twinkles are strewn together by unpredictable volume and time signature changes. The vocals tend to be a bit droning, but that can be a good thing if you aren’t into the whinier side of the genre.

This gem comes by way of Melbourne, Australia! It seemed as though once the US gave up on Second Wave Midwest Emo completely, the international community stepped up and released a few bangers in the genre’s honor.

##Build Nest, Sleep - Build Nest, Sleep (2006)
Another early release from the How Is Annie record label, Build Nest, Sleep produces old school Emo with a Noise Rock twist! The production is relatively lofi and the songs are smartly built around this. It creates a somewhat dense atmosphere, and atmosphere is what Norway’s infamous label does best. Perhaps not the greatest album on this list, but it is certainly quite an interesting one.

##Relative - The Progression of Stagnation (2006)
Okay, time to be honest: I couldn’t find much about this band. I mean, can you? Why do half the Emo bands out there have either the longest, easiest-to-identify names in all of music or the least searchable names of all time? As you can see, Relative falls into the latter half; either this band got lumped in with a Hardcore band that released music in the 2010s and they took a vastly different direction with their music after their 2006 debut EP, The Progress of Stagnation or they just released this one EP.

This is arguably more Post-Hardcore at times, but the Second Wave Emo stank seems to have reached this band all the way in the mid-aughts. Look out for lush sections of Emo atmosphere get broken up by chaotic outbursts throughout.

##The Brightest Comet - Demo (2007)
Female-fronted, Indie Rock-driven and unabashedly 90s in style, The Brightest Comet is a throwback Emo band in the vein of Rainer Maria or Eldritch Anisette. Their talented vocalist, Andi Camp, also performed vocal and bass duties for a 90s Emo band Ribbon Fix, so definitely check them out if you like this.

By 2007, Revival and Proto-Revival bands were coming together and started making music. The Brightest Comet decided to do it their own way and Second Wave lovers have every reason to be thankful.

##Aura… - Enquanto houver sentimentos (2007)
Maybe news didn't travel that fast to Brazil back in the day; Aura… didn't seem to know the Second Wave was long gone and the Fourth Wave was already looming. But damn, did they ever release a 90s-inspired gem with Enquanto Houver Sentimentos. 

The analog recording gives this a true DIY feel while the compositions are familiar yet somewhat complex. They sound like they could have opened up for Mineral back in the day.

##Everton - Floorsleepers (9/27/2007)
Finally, our journey brings us to Austria with Everton. Floorsleepers features songs of varying lengths, but they always give the compositions time to breathe and create a true individual identity. The clean, chunky guitars provide a nice base for the sound while the rhythm section, particularly the drums, is active and lively, even during quiet moments. 

Amazing, the production is also very reminiscent of the period they’re trying to visit. There must be a comparable “Midwest” area of Austria because these talented folks must be from there. The sad vibes are real.


That's it for part one! This one took weeks to compile, so make sure to be on the lookout for part two coming out sometime soon!",t2_10rt7t,False,,0,False,Recontextualizing Emo’s 3rd Wave from an Underground / DIY Perspective Part 1: Introduction and the Last Vestiges of the 2nd Wave,[],r/EmoScreamo,False,6.0,,0.0,,,True,t3_1ae7z0a,False,dark,1.0,,public,1.0,0.0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,,1706566694.0,text,6.0,,,text,self.EmoScreamo,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there a more controversial topic in this scene than Third Wave Emo? The maligned time period in the genre’s great history was also Emo’s biggest commercial boom, with Emo-Pop and Emo-Adjacent juggernauts becoming household names. The story goes that once bands like Taking Back Sunday and My Chemical Romance burst onto the scene, Emo’s dwindling Second Wave immediately died off and the ethos of the genre perished with it until some brave Revivalists brought it back from the dead in the early 2010s. However, this simplistic view minimizes the hard work that the underground, basement and DIY Emo scenes around the world were putting in during this very same span. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some bands looked at the 15+ year history of Emo to that point and continued to push those qualities. Others sought to innovate on Emo’s established sound, especially by fusing it with different genres. Others still invoked the relatively unknown Kinsella brothers’ unique approach to Emo and expanded upon it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, this series will be taking a very deep dive into the world of underground, DIY and otherwise lesser-known Emo during its Third Wave. Many people believe no real Emo music was released during this time and, while the purpose of these articles isn’t to discredit mainstream Emo-Pop or to define what “real Emo” is, I want to dispel that notion completely and recontextualize Emo as a continued underground movement from the Second Wave to the Fourth Wave instead of the disconnected death and revival of a genre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few notes before we continue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Splitting Emo into different waves isn’t even a universally agreed-upon metric for defining the genre and its characteristics, but I find it to be a fairly useful way to categorize its history.&lt;br/&gt;
-The general timeline that’s agreed on for the Third Wave is roughly 2002-2008. I used these years as a basis for gathering releases.&lt;br/&gt;
-There is VERY little information on this topic out there, so I’d like to give a special shout-out to &lt;a href=""/u/4010""&gt;u/4010&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""/u/intrepid-mall9100""&gt;u/intrepid-mall9100&lt;/a&gt; for all of the amazing resources.&lt;br/&gt;
-I am not a grand Emo historian who’s lived through every Wave and attended millions of shows throughout the world, so if you believe I’ve incorrectly categorized an artist or release, just let me know your opinions in the comments.&lt;br/&gt;
-I will be putting each section in roughly chronological order. Specific release dates can be hard to find so I’ll do my best to put these out in order.&lt;br/&gt;
-Please give me suggestions in the comments! I’d love to add to this and make it even more comprehensive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that those disclaimers are out of the way, I present the first part of this series: The Last Vestiges of the Second Wave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section will cover Second Wave Emo artists who continued to release music between 2002-2008, especially those who utilized characteristics of that Wave’s sound. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Billy Music - Midwest Index (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With one of the worst band names in existence (and a hair more googlable than their original band name “Billy”), Billy Music released their sole LP Midwest Index in 2002 after a couple of EPs and an appearance on one of the Emo Diaries compilations. At least the album name is appropriate for across 10 tracks is a sort of catalog of Midwest Emo tropes, collected together as sort of a primer for newer fans of the 90s Emo sound. This is a hidden gem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Kilowatthours - The Bright Side (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the band had a lot more Post-Rock influences when they first released music in 1999, they nonetheless released an EP and LP before 2002 with strong Emo influence, so this album deserves to be in this section. Still employing a heaping tablespoon of Post-Rock in their music, this release is more grounded in Midwest Emo than anything they’ve done before. The vocals are soft so as not to disturb the atmosphere of each song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check this album out if you are looking for the cozier side of the Second Wave Emo sound and get a minute preview into the future of Emo during the Third Wave…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Benton Falls - Guilt Beats Hate (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling this a prototypical Second Wave Emo would do this album a great disservice as it&amp;#39;s filled to the brim with passion, feeling and poetry. Benton Falls doesn&amp;#39;t quite reach the lofty heights of their debut album, but this release is only a notch below. The Post-Hardcore-tinged Emo that was popularized by bands like Texas is the Reason and Mineral is fully on display here with messy, loud guitars, occasional belted screams and shifting volume dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was released in early 2002, making it sort of the swan song to Second Wave Emo. This album is a real tour de force for the genre and is recommended to anyone who misses that 90s sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Piebald - We Are the Only Friends We Have (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Piebald was firmly entrenched in Second Wave Emo canon by releasing several EPs and albums in the 90s. These quality Midwest Emo releases would ensure the band had a loyal cult following, but they arguably released their magnum opus in 2002 and changed the trajectory of their legacy forever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking the bones of Midwest Emo and using different time signatures, they unlocked their melodic potential on this album by incorporating elements of the burgeoning Emo-Pop movement. The anthemic hooks only add to the experience, making this arguably their best album. Do not let the Emo-Pop influence deter you - the edginess in the production ensures this is Emo, through and through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pop Unknown - The August Division (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conventional wisdom says this album isn’t as good as Pop Unknown’s previous LP, but I’d like to think The August Division stands on its own next to its progenitor. Taking Midwest Emo, sprinkling in some Post-Punk elements and injecting the whole thing with a ton of infectious melody, Pop Unknown deliver with their swan song. This album immediately grabs your attention and refuses to let go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Brandtson - Dial In Sounds (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utilizing classic Midwest Emo as a base and tossing mild Pop-Punk and Post-Hardcore elements is a winning formula with Dial In Sounds. With a career spanning from the late 90s into the mid 00s, Brandtson has released a prolific discography with somewhat mixed results, but this one is a definite notch in the “win” column. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pedro the Lion - Control (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, this is a bummer album. The Indie Rock-soaked Emo of Pedro the Lion&amp;#39;s previous releases is present with bitter, crunchy guitars and a melancholic storyline that weaves the album together. The slew of mid-tempo tracks with Bazan’s droning voice wear on you emotionally over the course of 10 tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pedro the Lion is known for consistency, but this is perhaps their most solid and memorable outing as a band. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Gloria Record - Start Here (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The successor to Mineral, The Gloria Record was a passionate Midwest Emo band with less Post-Hardcore than their predecessor. The band&amp;#39;s sound is often compared to Radiohead, and not just because their songwriting is both excellent and TGR display Indie traits, but because Start Here is this band&amp;#39;s OK Computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Emo bones of the band are present here, but the sonic exploration employed by Simpson and the boys is as vast as it is genre-defying. Perhaps calling this a “vestage of the Second Wave” isn’t exactly true as this album could have been revolutionary for the genre had it blown up in popularity. However, as dying branch of the Second Wave, this underrated album deserves its place here for how forward-thinking it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Camber - Wake Up and Be Happy (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bursting onto the scene in 1997, Camber gained some notoriety by being in the first Emo Diaries compilation, along with a very good SDRE-inspired first LP. After a few more releases, they put out their last full-length in 2002 and is considered one of their weaker releases. However, I think there are some pretty decent ideas in here and the songs are pretty neat. Check it out if you’re itching for more authentic 90s Emo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;King of Like Spitting - Bridges Worth Burning (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the mid 90s, Kind of Like Spitting occupied an unparalleled space during the Second Wave, playing Midwest Emo with heavy dosages of Indie and some Folksy elements for good measure. A prolific discography and a few magna opera later, we’re in 2002 with KoLS’s final Midwest Emo release, Bridges Worth Burning. This LP is arguably on the same level as their previous greatest releases, trending toward being more upbeat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond anything else, the passion with which this band plays, particularly in the vocals, is undeniable, much like the lyrics. Very few albums sound quite like this, so this is a must-listen. Soon hereafter, KoLS would veer hard into the Indie Folk direction, so this really serves as a denoument to their Emo career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Casket Lottery - Survival is for Cowards (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Casket Lottery is a band with amazing longevity and consistency, having made splits with the likes of Hot Water Music and Touche Amore. After some really good albums and EPs in the late 90s / early 00s, 2002 saw the release of (arguably) their magnum opus, Survival is for Cowards. A potent blend of Post-Hardcore and Midwest Emo, this LP borrows much from the Second Wave but introduces fresh songwriting ideas, making this a sort of breath of fresh air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extremely powerful vocals are driven by an exemplary rhythm section that keeps the listener engaged throughout its ~30 minute runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Jim Yoshii Pile-Up - Homemade Drugs (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow, despite being brighter and overall more hopeful than their debut LP, Homemade Drugs is still a distressing, uhurried album. Tiny elements of Indie and Post-Rock are evident in this album, beginning to turn the Second Wave sound in a new direction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homemade Drugs isn’t the most well-known or beloved release in this section, but it is one of the best, especially if you’re looking for Emo music to sit back and dissociate to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Jets to Brazil - Perfecting Loneliness (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emo woven with equal parts Indie Rock, this late 90s Emo “supergroup” released their final LP Perfecting Loneliness in 2002. Little debate exists that Jets to Brazil&amp;#39;s first album is their all-time musical accomplishment, but their final album is still worthy of praise. Fantastic lyricism and an overall softer tone characterize this album. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Songs regularly exceed 5 minutes of length on this album so if you’re searching for quick bursts of energy as songs, this one isn&amp;#39;t for you. However, if you enjoy a mature take on Indie with inextricable Emo roots, this one is worth a listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Waxwing - Nobody Can Take What Everyone Owns (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waxwing produced Punk-leaning Emo goodness with their final LP. Although the album isn’t extraordinary, the songs are quite fun and energetic with pretty good vocals. Notably, one of the band’s guitarists, Cody Votolato, was working with The Blood Brothers at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Kid Brother Collective - Highway Miles (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple, old-school Emo that will make you yearn for simpler days. In the end, that’s all this genre needs. Nothing extraordinary on display, but more fare for those in the Mineral / Penfold camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rainer Maria - Long Knives Drawn (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Rainer Maria had changed fairly significantly since the band’s origins in the 90s, namely in the absence of male vocals, they had strong Emo ties in this 2003 LP. An Emo / Indie hybrid with the ethos of the Second Wave, what sets this album apart is how poppy Rainer Maria allow themselves to go, giving a memorable quality to the majority of the songs. This is an excellent addition to the band’s consistently good discography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cursive - Ugly Organ (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is probably one of the most well-known and beloved albums on this list, but I figure it’d be worth including it. Cursive began their career in the thick of the Second Wave, releasing two decent albums in the 90s before unleashing their first masterpiece Domestica in 2000. Following up on this unbelievable LP would be no small feat, but when Cursive released Ugly Organ in 2003, they did just that with an equally (if not more so) compelling album. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 50/50 Post-Hardcore / Emo, Ugly Organ adds a cellist to the lineup, greatly expanding past the audio barriers of the genre’s typical instruments. Sinister, dissonant and brooding, this one needs to be heard to be believed. One of the best releases during the Third Wave. Fortunately, this band is still kicking and making awesome music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Elliott - Song in the Air (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third and final full LP from Elliott, Song in the Air bookends their legendary (if somewhat obscure) discography with another great release, even if it perhaps falls short of the grandiosity of False Cathedrals. Regardless, this record encapsulates the evolution of a band from a more typical Mineral-like vibe to a dreamy, ethereal one. The vocals are smooth and gentle while the atmosphere provided by the instruments is dense and layered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elliott typify Second Wave Emo in one respect while pushing the boundaries of the genre at the time. You can really feel that this band could have gotten big under the right circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Small Brown Bike - Nail Yourself to the Ground (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2003 was Small Brown Bike’s biggest year, having released an LP and EP, both very well received. Utilizing that classic Post-Hardcore / Emo formula with their very own spin, Small Brown Bike sound like no other on this EP. With only five songs (and one being a completely different folksy song with slide guitars), the band gave 2003 a huge opening salvo with this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Appleseed Cast - Two Conversations (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Appleseed Cast is one of the most prolific acts in all of Emo and, by the Third Wave, had already established themselves as one of Emo’s great innovators. They experimented with Post-Rock on Mare Vitalis and perfected the combination of Post-Rock and Emo with Low Level Owl Vol 1 and 2, all before 2002 even hit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two Conversations takes the grandiosity of Low Level Owl and strips it to its barest form, more personal and intimate than anything this band had released previously (and possibly since). A breakup concept album isn’t exactly ingenious, but it’s executed very well across 10 songs; each track is handcrafted to fit the album’s flow perfectly and they add up to be greater than the sum of their parts. This band, and especially this album, would have a huge effect on Third Wave Emo going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Small Brown Bike - The River Bed (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expanding sonically on what they produced earlier in the year with Nail Yourself to the Ground, Small Brown Bike ended their first run as a band with an immensely influential full-length album. One could argue that the sound palette screams Post-Hardcore and doesn’t have much to do with Emo, but the album owes almost its entire structure to 90s Emo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The catchiness of the vocals and instruments is juxtaposed perfectly with the rough Post-Hardcore edges of each track, sacrificing none of the heaviness of the band in the process of getting stuck in your head. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Brandtson - Send Us A Signal (2004)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brandtson dives deeper into the Indie Rock sound but doesn’t lose its core Midwest Emo roots with this full-length. With more Emo-Pop influence than ever, the hooks are as catchy as they’ve ever been for this band. You can hear the evolution of their sound compared even to their previous record, and that’s definitely a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;I Hate Myself - 3 Songs (2005)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With almost no released music in the 2000s, I Hate Myself produced one final outing in 2005 with their 3 Songs EP. Gone are the half-Emo, half-Screamo days of yore and this one is pretty much pure Second Wave Midwest Emo. However, this leaves room for wonderful vocal melodies and driving songs. Definitely worth listening to this band’s final moments together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This next section covers albums and EPs released in the Third Wave that are heavily indebted to the Second Wave’s signature sound from bands that weren’t really around for that time period. This should go to show that even though Emo was taking on an entirely different meaning in mainstream contexts, there were many acts dedicated to keeping the older traditions alive. This section is called Carrying the Flag of the Second Wave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;.waterpistol. - Between Here and There is Everything (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debuting with a three-song EP in the year 2000, this relatively obscure band is far enough removed from the Second Wave to appear in this section, at least in my opinion. Fun, active prototypical Midwest Emo is what you’ll find on this album. This definitely sounds like Hardcore kids doing softer Emo music and it shows in the ever-present energy of the instruments and vocals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rest of My Life - Rest of My Life (2002)
This is the first release from the How is Annie label in Norway, one that is very important to the Nordic Emo scene. Rest of My Life’s self-titled LP is heavily indebted to the sounds of Second Wave Midwest Emo with hints of Post-Rock throughout. This sound palette would be a staple of the How is Annie lineup of bands, some of which you’ll see later in this series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strong presence of Post-Hardcore in the occasional screams and heavier moments of this album give the songs a sense of urgency while the Post-Rock influence ensures the serenity of the quieter moments. This small evolution in Emo’s sound helped pave the way for more great releases in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Time Spent Driving - Just Enough Bright (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the more popular albums on this list, Time Spent Driving played classic Midwest Emo with Emo-Pop sensibilities on this album, giving the release its own brand of charm. Situated perfectly at the edge where Emo went mainstream and where Emo remained underground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rescue - Volume Plus Volume (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With their debut LP, Rescue took the Post-Hardcore / Emo combination that was so popular in the mid-late 90s, added Math Rock elements like changing time signatures and played almost every song with a sense of urgency. Had this released sometime in the late 90s and was picked up by the right people, we might be calling this a minor Emo classic today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2004, the band rereleased this album as Volume Plus Volume Plus, which included a bonus CD featuring their 2002 EP Even People and Not the Odds and other unreleased tracks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;8-Bit Revival - Up &amp;amp; Atom (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard 90s-sounding Midwest Emo fare, this debut EP is a great look into an up-and-coming underground Emo band. This group would change their name to Oh Condor but possibly changed it back at some point (not so sure about the name change history), so expect to see more of them in this series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Time to Fly - Birth.Work.Death (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On their sole release, Time to Fly utilized the blueprints left behind by bands like Penfold and injected it with a high dose of Emo-Pop, a burgeoning influence during this period. Regardless, the LP stands on its own as a Second Wave-inspired Emo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vocals are catchy and melodic, juxtaposed by the occasional scream. There are tons of riffs and even some twinkles in there, adding to the diversity of dynamics found throughout the album. This is a true hidden gem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rockets and Bluelights - Close At Hand (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Released during an unknown time in 2002, Close At Hand is Rockets and Bluelights’ first demo. Simply put, this thing rocks. Produced with that 90s analog sound, this harrowing mix of Post-Hardcore and Midwest Emo comes at you with great force, but it doesn’t take away from the subtle elements of Post-Rock that somewhat spring this band into the future of the genre. Alas, I’ve decided to place them in this section of the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Susquatch - First Demo (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the 90s, Japan has had a flourishing Emo scene. Most here are aware of the Japanese Post-Rock / Screamo combination made famous by envy. However, Japan also kept Punky / melodic Emo alive during the 00s, usually with unique influences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;susquatch is a band that gained notoriety in 2009 with their twinkly debut LP right at the beginning of the Revival, but most are not aware of their debut Demo EP. With just the smallest hints that this is Japanese Emo, susquatch actually plays tribute to the greatness of Second Wave Emo quite effectively here. This isn&amp;#39;t their only appearance in this series, but with four years to go before releasing their next EP, their sound would undergo massive changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Halos for Martyrs - A Rush of Sound and the Silence That Follows (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake: this EP is a love letter to Second Wave Emo in both production and style. The ever-present Post-Hardcore accompanies Halos for Martyrs through an Emo musical journey while Math Rock influences seep in through the cracks, particularly in the twinkly riffs scattered about. This release was definitely an overlooked gem in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A Season Drive - Summer of ‘73 (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the lighter side of Emo without veering into Emo-Pop territory, A Season Drive delivers a fun Second Wave-esque album in the vein of Sunny Day Real Estate. This album is by no means a classic, but it does keep the old ways alive for just a little bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Filmmaker - Invitation to an Accident (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plain and simple, this is Seam-esque Midwest Emo done right, with just the right amount of Indie Rock influence to give the vocalist some fun melodies to play with. This band had one other EP released in 2001, but this would be their final release. Though this album is very short of groundbreaking, it’s a worthy listen for 90s Emo fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Settlefish - Dance A While, Upset (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extremely difficult to find, this album has about half the songs featured on other Deep Elm compilations, so you can still hear the masterful and somewhat bleak Midwest emo songwriting used throughout. Nothing here is exceptional, but this refreshing take on Second Wave Midwest Emo features its share of twinkles and fun, mathy moments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Jealous Sound - Kill Them With Kindness (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite jealous I am, indeed! To create such pure, unadulterated fun is an underappreciated aspect of Emo but The Jealous Sound does so with very simple song structures. Now yes, let’s clear the elephant in the room: Brian Shehan of Knapsack fame reprises his role as frontman of this band, utilizing a familiar Indie Rock / Emo approach. Knapsack’s unique qualities made them a very influential Emo band from the mid 90s, but few could hope to replicate them. Even The Jealous Sound doesn’t exactly…sound like Knapsack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear not, for while The Jealous Sound is inherently indebted to Brian’s earlier project, they stand on their own two feet. With less overtly-Punk-influenced songs than Knapsack, a healthy use of synths and a few Emo-Pop sensibilities, they definitely are beginning to grow out of the shadow of Second Wave Emo, but perhaps are too intertwined with the time period to be completely removed from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The December Drive - Handslikegunsandcrashingsounds (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Releasing in 2003, this album was allegedly in the works for about three years and DAMN does that seem right! At its core, Handslikegunsandcrashingsounds is a Second Wave-inspired Emo / Post-Hardcore tour de force. Small elements of Post-Rock seep into the album, generating a powerful aura around each song. Powerful guitarwork lays the foundation for a truly unforgettable vocal performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this album takes a lot of direction from the Second Wave classics, The December Drive injects this album with their own flavor, giving this album a slightly forward-thinking edge compared to many of the true 90s Emo bands. This is without a doubt one of the best albums in this entire section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Dead Letter Auction - Cancer of Time (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dissonant and noisy, Cancer of Time is Dead Letter Auction’s only full-length and boy, is it a doozy! If you like technical Post-Hardcore with a 90s Emo foundation, you’ve come to the right band. The shouty vocals add to the cacophonous atmosphere as much as the dynamic shifts to quiet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Outsmarting Simon - Silent Sober and Sound (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking as much influence from Mineral and Penfold as they did from early Jimmy Eat World and The Get Up Kids, Outsmarting Simon debuted with this great traditional Emo LP. Silent Sober and Sound showcases the band&amp;#39;s propensity for quiet-loud dynamics and dreamy atmospheres. Not the most memorable album, but definitely one with a pulse on the genre. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rockets and Bluelights - A Smashed City with Flames and Music in the Air (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most criminally underlooked and underrated Midwest Emo releases ever, it’s also ludicrously short with only four songs. The Post-Hardcore guitar tone is punchy and robust, leaning into the Emo clean dynamic seamlessly from the heavy distortion. The rhythm section does wonders in giving the songs style, keeping up with the spastic energy of the highs and the subtly of the lows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rudimentary Post-Rock song structures come into play in this EP, giving each track its own identity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Kid Kilowatt - Guitar Method (2004)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, this stuff is great! It almost sounds like it was ACTUALLY recorded between 1996 and 1999! Oh…well, it looks like it WAS recorded during that time! I’m not sure if this album should count on this list as it’s more of a compilation of the band’s recorded material from that time, released in CD format a half-decade after their breakup, Regardless, Kid Kilowatt featured members of Cave In, Piebald and even Converge. Despite that sort of street cred, they played fairly straightforward Indie-influenced Emo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This LP can feel a bit disjointed at times, a consequence of releasing all of the band’s material at once in LP format. However, if this album had come out in the late 90s while the band was still around, we might be calling this one of the best undiscovered Emo bands of the 90s (I guess we can technically still call them that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The 101 - Green Street (2004)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 101 use analog-sounding production that would be at home with the 90s Emo greats, utilizing some primitive Emo-Pop elements such as great use of melody and the odd synth here or there. The individual songs may not have much to write home about, but the flow of the album is actually quite good, making the sum greater than its parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is especially good if you dig Christie Front Drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Moirai - Bury Yourself (2005)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian Carley, vocalist and guitarist of Penfold, refused to let Emo go by the wayside in the 2000s. Somehow, in the year 2005, The Moirai managed to unveil a 90s Emo classic that seemed lost to time and had just been unearthed. Midwest Emo had all but perished from the face of the Earth at this point, especially in the form of 90s Second Wave Emo, but The Moirai’s sole release aimed to inject the dying genre with one last super boost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bury Yourself is a true successor to Penfold’s two classic Second Wave albums, featuring almost every member of the aforementioned band in the credits. The complexity of the compositions appears deceptively simple to the untrained ear, but the quiet-loud dynamics that Penfold made a career of are all here in spades. Brian’s vocal performance is as good as it ever has been; legitimately, one of the best vocal performances you’re going to hear in this entire series. The vocal mastery is only matched by the intelligent, passionate lyrics it delivers. Alas, the Second Wave can finally rest easy knowing The Moirai gave it a proper sendoff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Minor Ache - Black Hours Surround You (2006)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black Hours Surround You is Minor Ache’s only release, coming in at about 30 minutes. However, despite being released sometime in 2005-2006 (the exact release date appears to be unclear), this has the spirit of a 90s Emo / Indie Rock classic! Light twinkles are strewn together by unpredictable volume and time signature changes. The vocals tend to be a bit droning, but that can be a good thing if you aren’t into the whinier side of the genre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gem comes by way of Melbourne, Australia! It seemed as though once the US gave up on Second Wave Midwest Emo completely, the international community stepped up and released a few bangers in the genre’s honor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Build Nest, Sleep - Build Nest, Sleep (2006)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another early release from the How Is Annie record label, Build Nest, Sleep produces old school Emo with a Noise Rock twist! The production is relatively lofi and the songs are smartly built around this. It creates a somewhat dense atmosphere, and atmosphere is what Norway’s infamous label does best. Perhaps not the greatest album on this list, but it is certainly quite an interesting one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Relative - The Progression of Stagnation (2006)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, time to be honest: I couldn’t find much about this band. I mean, can you? Why do half the Emo bands out there have either the longest, easiest-to-identify names in all of music or the least searchable names of all time? As you can see, Relative falls into the latter half; either this band got lumped in with a Hardcore band that released music in the 2010s and they took a vastly different direction with their music after their 2006 debut EP, The Progress of Stagnation or they just released this one EP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is arguably more Post-Hardcore at times, but the Second Wave Emo stank seems to have reached this band all the way in the mid-aughts. Look out for lush sections of Emo atmosphere get broken up by chaotic outbursts throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Brightest Comet - Demo (2007)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Female-fronted, Indie Rock-driven and unabashedly 90s in style, The Brightest Comet is a throwback Emo band in the vein of Rainer Maria or Eldritch Anisette. Their talented vocalist, Andi Camp, also performed vocal and bass duties for a 90s Emo band Ribbon Fix, so definitely check them out if you like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2007, Revival and Proto-Revival bands were coming together and started making music. The Brightest Comet decided to do it their own way and Second Wave lovers have every reason to be thankful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Aura… - Enquanto houver sentimentos (2007)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe news didn&amp;#39;t travel that fast to Brazil back in the day; Aura… didn&amp;#39;t seem to know the Second Wave was long gone and the Fourth Wave was already looming. But damn, did they ever release a 90s-inspired gem with Enquanto Houver Sentimentos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analog recording gives this a true DIY feel while the compositions are familiar yet somewhat complex. They sound like they could have opened up for Mineral back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Everton - Floorsleepers (9/27/2007)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, our journey brings us to Austria with Everton. Floorsleepers features songs of varying lengths, but they always give the compositions time to breathe and create a true individual identity. The clean, chunky guitars provide a nice base for the sound while the rhythm section, particularly the drums, is active and lively, even during quiet moments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazing, the production is also very reminiscent of the period they’re trying to visit. There must be a comparable “Midwest” area of Austria because these talented folks must be from there. The sad vibes are real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it for part one! This one took weeks to compile, so make sure to be on the lookout for part two coming out sometime soon!&lt;/p&gt;

,Emo,"Is there a more controversial topic in this scene than Third Wave Emo? The maligned time period in the genre’s great history was also Emo’s biggest commercial boom, with Emo-Pop and Emo-Adjacent juggernauts becoming household names. The story goes that once bands like Taking Back Sunday and My Chemical Romance burst onto the scene, Emo’s dwindling Second Wave immediately died off and the ethos of the genre perished with it until some brave Revivalists brought it back from the dead in the early 2010s. However, this simplistic view minimizes the hard work that the underground, basement and DIY Emo scenes around the world were putting in during this very same span. 

Some bands looked at the 15+ year history of Emo to that point and continued to push those qualities. Others sought to innovate on Emo’s established sound, especially by fusing it with different genres. Others still invoked the relatively unknown Kinsella brothers’ unique approach to Emo and expanded upon it. 

With that said, this series will be taking a very deep dive into the world of underground, DIY and otherwise lesser-known Emo during its Third Wave. Many people believe no real Emo music was released during this time and, while the purpose of these articles isn’t to discredit mainstream Emo-Pop or to define what “real Emo” is, I want to dispel that notion completely and recontextualize Emo as a continued underground movement from the Second Wave to the Fourth Wave instead of the disconnected death and revival of a genre.

A few notes before we continue:

-Splitting Emo into different waves isn’t even a universally agreed-upon metric for defining the genre and its characteristics, but I find it to be a fairly useful way to categorize its history.
-The general timeline that’s agreed on for the Third Wave is roughly 2002-2008. I used these years as a basis for gathering releases.
-There is VERY little information on this topic out there, so I’d like to give a special shout-out to u/4010 and u/intrepid-mall9100 for all of the amazing resources.
-I am not a grand Emo historian who’s lived through every Wave and attended millions of shows throughout the world, so if you believe I’ve incorrectly categorized an artist or release, just let me know your opinions in the comments.
-I will be putting each section in roughly chronological order. Specific release dates can be hard to find so I’ll do my best to put these out in order.
-Please give me suggestions in the comments! I’d love to add to this and make it even more comprehensive. 

Now that those disclaimers are out of the way, I present the first part of this series: The Last Vestiges of the Second Wave.

This section will cover Second Wave Emo artists who continued to release music between 2002-2008, especially those who utilized characteristics of that Wave’s sound. 

##Billy Music - Midwest Index (2002)
With one of the worst band names in existence (and a hair more googlable than their original band name “Billy”), Billy Music released their sole LP Midwest Index in 2002 after a couple of EPs and an appearance on one of the Emo Diaries compilations. At least the album name is appropriate for across 10 tracks is a sort of catalog of Midwest Emo tropes, collected together as sort of a primer for newer fans of the 90s Emo sound. This is a hidden gem.

##Kilowatthours - The Bright Side (2002)
Given the band had a lot more Post-Rock influences when they first released music in 1999, they nonetheless released an EP and LP before 2002 with strong Emo influence, so this album deserves to be in this section. Still employing a heaping tablespoon of Post-Rock in their music, this release is more grounded in Midwest Emo than anything they’ve done before. The vocals are soft so as not to disturb the atmosphere of each song.

Check this album out if you are looking for the cozier side of the Second Wave Emo sound and get a minute preview into the future of Emo during the Third Wave…

##Benton Falls - Guilt Beats Hate (2002)
Calling this a prototypical Second Wave Emo would do this album a great disservice as it's filled to the brim with passion, feeling and poetry. Benton Falls doesn't quite reach the lofty heights of their debut album, but this release is only a notch below. The Post-Hardcore-tinged Emo that was popularized by bands like Texas is the Reason and Mineral is fully on display here with messy, loud guitars, occasional belted screams and shifting volume dynamics.


This was released in early 2002, making it sort of the swan song to Second Wave Emo. This album is a real tour de force for the genre and is recommended to anyone who misses that 90s sound.

##Piebald - We Are the Only Friends We Have (2002)
Piebald was firmly entrenched in Second Wave Emo canon by releasing several EPs and albums in the 90s. These quality Midwest Emo releases would ensure the band had a loyal cult following, but they arguably released their magnum opus in 2002 and changed the trajectory of their legacy forever. 

Taking the bones of Midwest Emo and using different time signatures, they unlocked their melodic potential on this album by incorporating elements of the burgeoning Emo-Pop movement. The anthemic hooks only add to the experience, making this arguably their best album. Do not let the Emo-Pop influence deter you - the edginess in the production ensures this is Emo, through and through.

##Pop Unknown - The August Division (2002)
Conventional wisdom says this album isn’t as good as Pop Unknown’s previous LP, but I’d like to think The August Division stands on its own next to its progenitor. Taking Midwest Emo, sprinkling in some Post-Punk elements and injecting the whole thing with a ton of infectious melody, Pop Unknown deliver with their swan song. This album immediately grabs your attention and refuses to let go.

##Brandtson - Dial In Sounds (2002)
Utilizing classic Midwest Emo as a base and tossing mild Pop-Punk and Post-Hardcore elements is a winning formula with Dial In Sounds. With a career spanning from the late 90s into the mid 00s, Brandtson has released a prolific discography with somewhat mixed results, but this one is a definite notch in the “win” column. 

##Pedro the Lion - Control (2002)
Put simply, this is a bummer album. The Indie Rock-soaked Emo of Pedro the Lion's previous releases is present with bitter, crunchy guitars and a melancholic storyline that weaves the album together. The slew of mid-tempo tracks with Bazan’s droning voice wear on you emotionally over the course of 10 tracks.


Pedro the Lion is known for consistency, but this is perhaps their most solid and memorable outing as a band. 

##The Gloria Record - Start Here (2002)
The successor to Mineral, The Gloria Record was a passionate Midwest Emo band with less Post-Hardcore than their predecessor. The band's sound is often compared to Radiohead, and not just because their songwriting is both excellent and TGR display Indie traits, but because Start Here is this band's OK Computer.

The Emo bones of the band are present here, but the sonic exploration employed by Simpson and the boys is as vast as it is genre-defying. Perhaps calling this a “vestage of the Second Wave” isn’t exactly true as this album could have been revolutionary for the genre had it blown up in popularity. However, as dying branch of the Second Wave, this underrated album deserves its place here for how forward-thinking it is.

##Camber - Wake Up and Be Happy (2002)
Bursting onto the scene in 1997, Camber gained some notoriety by being in the first Emo Diaries compilation, along with a very good SDRE-inspired first LP. After a few more releases, they put out their last full-length in 2002 and is considered one of their weaker releases. However, I think there are some pretty decent ideas in here and the songs are pretty neat. Check it out if you’re itching for more authentic 90s Emo.

##King of Like Spitting - Bridges Worth Burning (2002)
Since the mid 90s, Kind of Like Spitting occupied an unparalleled space during the Second Wave, playing Midwest Emo with heavy dosages of Indie and some Folksy elements for good measure. A prolific discography and a few magna opera later, we’re in 2002 with KoLS’s final Midwest Emo release, Bridges Worth Burning. This LP is arguably on the same level as their previous greatest releases, trending toward being more upbeat. 

Beyond anything else, the passion with which this band plays, particularly in the vocals, is undeniable, much like the lyrics. Very few albums sound quite like this, so this is a must-listen. Soon hereafter, KoLS would veer hard into the Indie Folk direction, so this really serves as a denoument to their Emo career.

##The Casket Lottery - Survival is for Cowards (2002)
The Casket Lottery is a band with amazing longevity and consistency, having made splits with the likes of Hot Water Music and Touche Amore. After some really good albums and EPs in the late 90s / early 00s, 2002 saw the release of (arguably) their magnum opus, Survival is for Cowards. A potent blend of Post-Hardcore and Midwest Emo, this LP borrows much from the Second Wave but introduces fresh songwriting ideas, making this a sort of breath of fresh air.

Extremely powerful vocals are driven by an exemplary rhythm section that keeps the listener engaged throughout its ~30 minute runtime.

##The Jim Yoshii Pile-Up - Homemade Drugs (2002)
Somehow, despite being brighter and overall more hopeful than their debut LP, Homemade Drugs is still a distressing, uhurried album. Tiny elements of Indie and Post-Rock are evident in this album, beginning to turn the Second Wave sound in a new direction. 

Homemade Drugs isn’t the most well-known or beloved release in this section, but it is one of the best, especially if you’re looking for Emo music to sit back and dissociate to.

##Jets to Brazil - Perfecting Loneliness (2002)
Emo woven with equal parts Indie Rock, this late 90s Emo “supergroup” released their final LP Perfecting Loneliness in 2002. Little debate exists that Jets to Brazil's first album is their all-time musical accomplishment, but their final album is still worthy of praise. Fantastic lyricism and an overall softer tone characterize this album. 

Songs regularly exceed 5 minutes of length on this album so if you’re searching for quick bursts of energy as songs, this one isn't for you. However, if you enjoy a mature take on Indie with inextricable Emo roots, this one is worth a listen.

##Waxwing - Nobody Can Take What Everyone Owns (2002)
Waxwing produced Punk-leaning Emo goodness with their final LP. Although the album isn’t extraordinary, the songs are quite fun and energetic with pretty good vocals. Notably, one of the band’s guitarists, Cody Votolato, was working with The Blood Brothers at the same time. 

##Kid Brother Collective - Highway Miles (2002)
Simple, old-school Emo that will make you yearn for simpler days. In the end, that’s all this genre needs. Nothing extraordinary on display, but more fare for those in the Mineral / Penfold camp.

##Rainer Maria - Long Knives Drawn (2003)
Although Rainer Maria had changed fairly significantly since the band’s origins in the 90s, namely in the absence of male vocals, they had strong Emo ties in this 2003 LP. An Emo / Indie hybrid with the ethos of the Second Wave, what sets this album apart is how poppy Rainer Maria allow themselves to go, giving a memorable quality to the majority of the songs. This is an excellent addition to the band’s consistently good discography.

##Cursive - Ugly Organ (2003)
This one is probably one of the most well-known and beloved albums on this list, but I figure it’d be worth including it. Cursive began their career in the thick of the Second Wave, releasing two decent albums in the 90s before unleashing their first masterpiece Domestica in 2000. Following up on this unbelievable LP would be no small feat, but when Cursive released Ugly Organ in 2003, they did just that with an equally (if not more so) compelling album. 

About 50/50 Post-Hardcore / Emo, Ugly Organ adds a cellist to the lineup, greatly expanding past the audio barriers of the genre’s typical instruments. Sinister, dissonant and brooding, this one needs to be heard to be believed. One of the best releases during the Third Wave. Fortunately, this band is still kicking and making awesome music.

##Elliott - Song in the Air (2003)
The third and final full LP from Elliott, Song in the Air bookends their legendary (if somewhat obscure) discography with another great release, even if it perhaps falls short of the grandiosity of False Cathedrals. Regardless, this record encapsulates the evolution of a band from a more typical Mineral-like vibe to a dreamy, ethereal one. The vocals are smooth and gentle while the atmosphere provided by the instruments is dense and layered. 

Elliott typify Second Wave Emo in one respect while pushing the boundaries of the genre at the time. You can really feel that this band could have gotten big under the right circumstances.

##Small Brown Bike - Nail Yourself to the Ground (2003)
2003 was Small Brown Bike’s biggest year, having released an LP and EP, both very well received. Utilizing that classic Post-Hardcore / Emo formula with their very own spin, Small Brown Bike sound like no other on this EP. With only five songs (and one being a completely different folksy song with slide guitars), the band gave 2003 a huge opening salvo with this one.

##The Appleseed Cast - Two Conversations (2003)
The Appleseed Cast is one of the most prolific acts in all of Emo and, by the Third Wave, had already established themselves as one of Emo’s great innovators. They experimented with Post-Rock on Mare Vitalis and perfected the combination of Post-Rock and Emo with Low Level Owl Vol 1 and 2, all before 2002 even hit!

Two Conversations takes the grandiosity of Low Level Owl and strips it to its barest form, more personal and intimate than anything this band had released previously (and possibly since). A breakup concept album isn’t exactly ingenious, but it’s executed very well across 10 songs; each track is handcrafted to fit the album’s flow perfectly and they add up to be greater than the sum of their parts. This band, and especially this album, would have a huge effect on Third Wave Emo going forward.

##Small Brown Bike - The River Bed (2003)
Expanding sonically on what they produced earlier in the year with Nail Yourself to the Ground, Small Brown Bike ended their first run as a band with an immensely influential full-length album. One could argue that the sound palette screams Post-Hardcore and doesn’t have much to do with Emo, but the album owes almost its entire structure to 90s Emo. 
 
The catchiness of the vocals and instruments is juxtaposed perfectly with the rough Post-Hardcore edges of each track, sacrificing none of the heaviness of the band in the process of getting stuck in your head. 

##Brandtson - Send Us A Signal (2004)
Brandtson dives deeper into the Indie Rock sound but doesn’t lose its core Midwest Emo roots with this full-length. With more Emo-Pop influence than ever, the hooks are as catchy as they’ve ever been for this band. You can hear the evolution of their sound compared even to their previous record, and that’s definitely a good thing.

##I Hate Myself - 3 Songs (2005)
With almost no released music in the 2000s, I Hate Myself produced one final outing in 2005 with their 3 Songs EP. Gone are the half-Emo, half-Screamo days of yore and this one is pretty much pure Second Wave Midwest Emo. However, this leaves room for wonderful vocal melodies and driving songs. Definitely worth listening to this band’s final moments together.

This next section covers albums and EPs released in the Third Wave that are heavily indebted to the Second Wave’s signature sound from bands that weren’t really around for that time period. This should go to show that even though Emo was taking on an entirely different meaning in mainstream contexts, there were many acts dedicated to keeping the older traditions alive. This section is called Carrying the Flag of the Second Wave.

##.waterpistol. - Between Here and There is Everything (2002)
Debuting with a three-song EP in the year 2000, this relatively obscure band is far enough removed from the Second Wave to appear in this section, at least in my opinion. Fun, active prototypical Midwest Emo is what you’ll find on this album. This definitely sounds like Hardcore kids doing softer Emo music and it shows in the ever-present energy of the instruments and vocals. 

Rest of My Life - Rest of My Life (2002)
This is the first release from the How is Annie label in Norway, one that is very important to the Nordic Emo scene. Rest of My Life’s self-titled LP is heavily indebted to the sounds of Second Wave Midwest Emo with hints of Post-Rock throughout. This sound palette would be a staple of the How is Annie lineup of bands, some of which you’ll see later in this series.

A strong presence of Post-Hardcore in the occasional screams and heavier moments of this album give the songs a sense of urgency while the Post-Rock influence ensures the serenity of the quieter moments. This small evolution in Emo’s sound helped pave the way for more great releases in the future.

##Time Spent Driving - Just Enough Bright (2002)
One of the more popular albums on this list, Time Spent Driving played classic Midwest Emo with Emo-Pop sensibilities on this album, giving the release its own brand of charm. Situated perfectly at the edge where Emo went mainstream and where Emo remained underground.

##Rescue - Volume Plus Volume (2002)
With their debut LP, Rescue took the Post-Hardcore / Emo combination that was so popular in the mid-late 90s, added Math Rock elements like changing time signatures and played almost every song with a sense of urgency. Had this released sometime in the late 90s and was picked up by the right people, we might be calling this a minor Emo classic today.

In 2004, the band rereleased this album as Volume Plus Volume Plus, which included a bonus CD featuring their 2002 EP Even People and Not the Odds and other unreleased tracks. 

##8-Bit Revival - Up &amp; Atom (2002)
Standard 90s-sounding Midwest Emo fare, this debut EP is a great look into an up-and-coming underground Emo band. This group would change their name to Oh Condor but possibly changed it back at some point (not so sure about the name change history), so expect to see more of them in this series.

##Time to Fly - Birth.Work.Death (2002)
On their sole release, Time to Fly utilized the blueprints left behind by bands like Penfold and injected it with a high dose of Emo-Pop, a burgeoning influence during this period. Regardless, the LP stands on its own as a Second Wave-inspired Emo.

The vocals are catchy and melodic, juxtaposed by the occasional scream. There are tons of riffs and even some twinkles in there, adding to the diversity of dynamics found throughout the album. This is a true hidden gem.

##Rockets and Bluelights - Close At Hand (2002)
Released during an unknown time in 2002, Close At Hand is Rockets and Bluelights’ first demo. Simply put, this thing rocks. Produced with that 90s analog sound, this harrowing mix of Post-Hardcore and Midwest Emo comes at you with great force, but it doesn’t take away from the subtle elements of Post-Rock that somewhat spring this band into the future of the genre. Alas, I’ve decided to place them in this section of the list.

##Susquatch - First Demo (2003)
Since the 90s, Japan has had a flourishing Emo scene. Most here are aware of the Japanese Post-Rock / Screamo combination made famous by envy. However, Japan also kept Punky / melodic Emo alive during the 00s, usually with unique influences.

susquatch is a band that gained notoriety in 2009 with their twinkly debut LP right at the beginning of the Revival, but most are not aware of their debut Demo EP. With just the smallest hints that this is Japanese Emo, susquatch actually plays tribute to the greatness of Second Wave Emo quite effectively here. This isn't their only appearance in this series, but with four years to go before releasing their next EP, their sound would undergo massive changes.

##Halos for Martyrs - A Rush of Sound and the Silence That Follows (2003)
Make no mistake: this EP is a love letter to Second Wave Emo in both production and style. The ever-present Post-Hardcore accompanies Halos for Martyrs through an Emo musical journey while Math Rock influences seep in through the cracks, particularly in the twinkly riffs scattered about. This release was definitely an overlooked gem in 2003.

##A Season Drive - Summer of ‘73 (2003)
On the lighter side of Emo without veering into Emo-Pop territory, A Season Drive delivers a fun Second Wave-esque album in the vein of Sunny Day Real Estate. This album is by no means a classic, but it does keep the old ways alive for just a little bit longer.

##Filmmaker - Invitation to an Accident (2003)
Plain and simple, this is Seam-esque Midwest Emo done right, with just the right amount of Indie Rock influence to give the vocalist some fun melodies to play with. This band had one other EP released in 2001, but this would be their final release. Though this album is very short of groundbreaking, it’s a worthy listen for 90s Emo fans.

##Settlefish - Dance A While, Upset (2003)
Extremely difficult to find, this album has about half the songs featured on other Deep Elm compilations, so you can still hear the masterful and somewhat bleak Midwest emo songwriting used throughout. Nothing here is exceptional, but this refreshing take on Second Wave Midwest Emo features its share of twinkles and fun, mathy moments. 

##The Jealous Sound - Kill Them With Kindness (2003)
Quite jealous I am, indeed! To create such pure, unadulterated fun is an underappreciated aspect of Emo but The Jealous Sound does so with very simple song structures. Now yes, let’s clear the elephant in the room: Brian Shehan of Knapsack fame reprises his role as frontman of this band, utilizing a familiar Indie Rock / Emo approach. Knapsack’s unique qualities made them a very influential Emo band from the mid 90s, but few could hope to replicate them. Even The Jealous Sound doesn’t exactly…sound like Knapsack.

Fear not, for while The Jealous Sound is inherently indebted to Brian’s earlier project, they stand on their own two feet. With less overtly-Punk-influenced songs than Knapsack, a healthy use of synths and a few Emo-Pop sensibilities, they definitely are beginning to grow out of the shadow of Second Wave Emo, but perhaps are too intertwined with the time period to be completely removed from it.

##The December Drive - Handslikegunsandcrashingsounds (2003)
Releasing in 2003, this album was allegedly in the works for about three years and DAMN does that seem right! At its core, Handslikegunsandcrashingsounds is a Second Wave-inspired Emo / Post-Hardcore tour de force. Small elements of Post-Rock seep into the album, generating a powerful aura around each song. Powerful guitarwork lays the foundation for a truly unforgettable vocal performance.

Although this album takes a lot of direction from the Second Wave classics, The December Drive injects this album with their own flavor, giving this album a slightly forward-thinking edge compared to many of the true 90s Emo bands. This is without a doubt one of the best albums in this entire section.

##Dead Letter Auction - Cancer of Time (2003)
Dissonant and noisy, Cancer of Time is Dead Letter Auction’s only full-length and boy, is it a doozy! If you like technical Post-Hardcore with a 90s Emo foundation, you’ve come to the right band. The shouty vocals add to the cacophonous atmosphere as much as the dynamic shifts to quiet. 

##Outsmarting Simon - Silent Sober and Sound (2003)
Taking as much influence from Mineral and Penfold as they did from early Jimmy Eat World and The Get Up Kids, Outsmarting Simon debuted with this great traditional Emo LP. Silent Sober and Sound showcases the band's propensity for quiet-loud dynamics and dreamy atmospheres. Not the most memorable album, but definitely one with a pulse on the genre. 

##Rockets and Bluelights - A Smashed City with Flames and Music in the Air (2003)
One of the most criminally underlooked and underrated Midwest Emo releases ever, it’s also ludicrously short with only four songs. The Post-Hardcore guitar tone is punchy and robust, leaning into the Emo clean dynamic seamlessly from the heavy distortion. The rhythm section does wonders in giving the songs style, keeping up with the spastic energy of the highs and the subtly of the lows. 

Rudimentary Post-Rock song structures come into play in this EP, giving each track its own identity. 

##Kid Kilowatt - Guitar Method (2004)
Wow, this stuff is great! It almost sounds like it was ACTUALLY recorded between 1996 and 1999! Oh…well, it looks like it WAS recorded during that time! I’m not sure if this album should count on this list as it’s more of a compilation of the band’s recorded material from that time, released in CD format a half-decade after their breakup, Regardless, Kid Kilowatt featured members of Cave In, Piebald and even Converge. Despite that sort of street cred, they played fairly straightforward Indie-influenced Emo.

This LP can feel a bit disjointed at times, a consequence of releasing all of the band’s material at once in LP format. However, if this album had come out in the late 90s while the band was still around, we might be calling this one of the best undiscovered Emo bands of the 90s (I guess we can technically still call them that).

##The 101 - Green Street (2004)
The 101 use analog-sounding production that would be at home with the 90s Emo greats, utilizing some primitive Emo-Pop elements such as great use of melody and the odd synth here or there. The individual songs may not have much to write home about, but the flow of the album is actually quite good, making the sum greater than its parts.

This is especially good if you dig Christie Front Drive.

##The Moirai - Bury Yourself (2005)
Brian Carley, vocalist and guitarist of Penfold, refused to let Emo go by the wayside in the 2000s. Somehow, in the year 2005, The Moirai managed to unveil a 90s Emo classic that seemed lost to time and had just been unearthed. Midwest Emo had all but perished from the face of the Earth at this point, especially in the form of 90s Second Wave Emo, but The Moirai’s sole release aimed to inject the dying genre with one last super boost.

Bury Yourself is a true successor to Penfold’s two classic Second Wave albums, featuring almost every member of the aforementioned band in the credits. The complexity of the compositions appears deceptively simple to the untrained ear, but the quiet-loud dynamics that Penfold made a career of are all here in spades. Brian’s vocal performance is as good as it ever has been; legitimately, one of the best vocal performances you’re going to hear in this entire series. The vocal mastery is only matched by the intelligent, passionate lyrics it delivers. Alas, the Second Wave can finally rest easy knowing The Moirai gave it a proper sendoff.

##Minor Ache - Black Hours Surround You (2006)
Black Hours Surround You is Minor Ache’s only release, coming in at about 30 minutes. However, despite being released sometime in 2005-2006 (the exact release date appears to be unclear), this has the spirit of a 90s Emo / Indie Rock classic! Light twinkles are strewn together by unpredictable volume and time signature changes. The vocals tend to be a bit droning, but that can be a good thing if you aren’t into the whinier side of the genre.

This gem comes by way of Melbourne, Australia! It seemed as though once the US gave up on Second Wave Midwest Emo completely, the international community stepped up and released a few bangers in the genre’s honor.

##Build Nest, Sleep - Build Nest, Sleep (2006)
Another early release from the How Is Annie record label, Build Nest, Sleep produces old school Emo with a Noise Rock twist! The production is relatively lofi and the songs are smartly built around this. It creates a somewhat dense atmosphere, and atmosphere is what Norway’s infamous label does best. Perhaps not the greatest album on this list, but it is certainly quite an interesting one.

##Relative - The Progression of Stagnation (2006)
Okay, time to be honest: I couldn’t find much about this band. I mean, can you? Why do half the Emo bands out there have either the longest, easiest-to-identify names in all of music or the least searchable names of all time? As you can see, Relative falls into the latter half; either this band got lumped in with a Hardcore band that released music in the 2010s and they took a vastly different direction with their music after their 2006 debut EP, The Progress of Stagnation or they just released this one EP.

This is arguably more Post-Hardcore at times, but the Second Wave Emo stank seems to have reached this band all the way in the mid-aughts. Look out for lush sections of Emo atmosphere get broken up by chaotic outbursts throughout.

##The Brightest Comet - Demo (2007)
Female-fronted, Indie Rock-driven and unabashedly 90s in style, The Brightest Comet is a throwback Emo band in the vein of Rainer Maria or Eldritch Anisette. Their talented vocalist, Andi Camp, also performed vocal and bass duties for a 90s Emo band Ribbon Fix, so definitely check them out if you like this.

By 2007, Revival and Proto-Revival bands were coming together and started making music. The Brightest Comet decided to do it their own way and Second Wave lovers have every reason to be thankful.

##Aura… - Enquanto houver sentimentos (2007)
Maybe news didn't travel that fast to Brazil back in the day; Aura… didn't seem to know the Second Wave was long gone and the Fourth Wave was already looming. But damn, did they ever release a 90s-inspired gem with Enquanto Houver Sentimentos. 

The analog recording gives this a true DIY feel while the compositions are familiar yet somewhat complex. They sound like they could have opened up for Mineral back in the day.

##Everton - Floorsleepers (9/27/2007)
Finally, our journey brings us to Austria with Everton. Floorsleepers features songs of varying lengths, but they always give the compositions time to breathe and create a true individual identity. The clean, chunky guitars provide a nice base for the sound while the rhythm section, particularly the drums, is active and lively, even during quiet moments. 

Amazing, the production is also very reminiscent of the period they’re trying to visit. There must be a comparable “Midwest” area of Austria because these talented folks must be from there. The sad vibes are real.

That's it for part one! This one took weeks to compile, so make sure to be on the lookout for part two coming out sometime soon!",t2_10rt7t,False,,0,False,Recontextualizing Emo’s 3rd Wave from an Underground / DIY Perspective Part 1: Introduction and the Last Vestiges of the 2nd Wave,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Basement Emo'}]",r/Emo,False,6.0,,0.0,,,True,t3_1ae7tzm,False,dark,1.0,#ea0027,public,1.0,0.0,{},,c9cbbc1c-bf11-11ec-a27e-4257586ddb7a,False,[],,False,False,,{},Basement Emo,False,1,,False,False,self,False,,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Skramz Gang👹'}]",{},,,True,,1706566354.0,richtext,6.0,,,richtext,self.Emo,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there a more controversial topic in this scene than Third Wave Emo? The maligned time period in the genre’s great history was also Emo’s biggest commercial boom, with Emo-Pop and Emo-Adjacent juggernauts becoming household names. The story goes that once bands like Taking Back Sunday and My Chemical Romance burst onto the scene, Emo’s dwindling Second Wave immediately died off and the ethos of the genre perished with it until some brave Revivalists brought it back from the dead in the early 2010s. However, this simplistic view minimizes the hard work that the underground, basement and DIY Emo scenes around the world were putting in during this very same span. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some bands looked at the 15+ year history of Emo to that point and continued to push those qualities. Others sought to innovate on Emo’s established sound, especially by fusing it with different genres. Others still invoked the relatively unknown Kinsella brothers’ unique approach to Emo and expanded upon it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, this series will be taking a very deep dive into the world of underground, DIY and otherwise lesser-known Emo during its Third Wave. Many people believe no real Emo music was released during this time and, while the purpose of these articles isn’t to discredit mainstream Emo-Pop or to define what “real Emo” is, I want to dispel that notion completely and recontextualize Emo as a continued underground movement from the Second Wave to the Fourth Wave instead of the disconnected death and revival of a genre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few notes before we continue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Splitting Emo into different waves isn’t even a universally agreed-upon metric for defining the genre and its characteristics, but I find it to be a fairly useful way to categorize its history.
-The general timeline that’s agreed on for the Third Wave is roughly 2002-2008. I used these years as a basis for gathering releases.
-There is VERY little information on this topic out there, so I’d like to give a special shout-out to &lt;a href=""/u/4010""&gt;u/4010&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""/u/intrepid-mall9100""&gt;u/intrepid-mall9100&lt;/a&gt; for all of the amazing resources.
-I am not a grand Emo historian who’s lived through every Wave and attended millions of shows throughout the world, so if you believe I’ve incorrectly categorized an artist or release, just let me know your opinions in the comments.
-I will be putting each section in roughly chronological order. Specific release dates can be hard to find so I’ll do my best to put these out in order.
-Please give me suggestions in the comments! I’d love to add to this and make it even more comprehensive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that those disclaimers are out of the way, I present the first part of this series: The Last Vestiges of the Second Wave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section will cover Second Wave Emo artists who continued to release music between 2002-2008, especially those who utilized characteristics of that Wave’s sound. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Billy Music - Midwest Index (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With one of the worst band names in existence (and a hair more googlable than their original band name “Billy”), Billy Music released their sole LP Midwest Index in 2002 after a couple of EPs and an appearance on one of the Emo Diaries compilations. At least the album name is appropriate for across 10 tracks is a sort of catalog of Midwest Emo tropes, collected together as sort of a primer for newer fans of the 90s Emo sound. This is a hidden gem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Kilowatthours - The Bright Side (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the band had a lot more Post-Rock influences when they first released music in 1999, they nonetheless released an EP and LP before 2002 with strong Emo influence, so this album deserves to be in this section. Still employing a heaping tablespoon of Post-Rock in their music, this release is more grounded in Midwest Emo than anything they’ve done before. The vocals are soft so as not to disturb the atmosphere of each song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check this album out if you are looking for the cozier side of the Second Wave Emo sound and get a minute preview into the future of Emo during the Third Wave…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Benton Falls - Guilt Beats Hate (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling this a prototypical Second Wave Emo would do this album a great disservice as it&amp;#39;s filled to the brim with passion, feeling and poetry. Benton Falls doesn&amp;#39;t quite reach the lofty heights of their debut album, but this release is only a notch below. The Post-Hardcore-tinged Emo that was popularized by bands like Texas is the Reason and Mineral is fully on display here with messy, loud guitars, occasional belted screams and shifting volume dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was released in early 2002, making it sort of the swan song to Second Wave Emo. This album is a real tour de force for the genre and is recommended to anyone who misses that 90s sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Piebald - We Are the Only Friends We Have (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Piebald was firmly entrenched in Second Wave Emo canon by releasing several EPs and albums in the 90s. These quality Midwest Emo releases would ensure the band had a loyal cult following, but they arguably released their magnum opus in 2002 and changed the trajectory of their legacy forever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking the bones of Midwest Emo and using different time signatures, they unlocked their melodic potential on this album by incorporating elements of the burgeoning Emo-Pop movement. The anthemic hooks only add to the experience, making this arguably their best album. Do not let the Emo-Pop influence deter you - the edginess in the production ensures this is Emo, through and through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pop Unknown - The August Division (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conventional wisdom says this album isn’t as good as Pop Unknown’s previous LP, but I’d like to think The August Division stands on its own next to its progenitor. Taking Midwest Emo, sprinkling in some Post-Punk elements and injecting the whole thing with a ton of infectious melody, Pop Unknown deliver with their swan song. This album immediately grabs your attention and refuses to let go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Brandtson - Dial In Sounds (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utilizing classic Midwest Emo as a base and tossing mild Pop-Punk and Post-Hardcore elements is a winning formula with Dial In Sounds. With a career spanning from the late 90s into the mid 00s, Brandtson has released a prolific discography with somewhat mixed results, but this one is a definite notch in the “win” column. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pedro the Lion - Control (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, this is a bummer album. The Indie Rock-soaked Emo of Pedro the Lion&amp;#39;s previous releases is present with bitter, crunchy guitars and a melancholic storyline that weaves the album together. The slew of mid-tempo tracks with Bazan’s droning voice wear on you emotionally over the course of 10 tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pedro the Lion is known for consistency, but this is perhaps their most solid and memorable outing as a band. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Gloria Record - Start Here (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The successor to Mineral, The Gloria Record was a passionate Midwest Emo band with less Post-Hardcore than their predecessor. The band&amp;#39;s sound is often compared to Radiohead, and not just because their songwriting is both excellent and TGR display Indie traits, but because Start Here is this band&amp;#39;s OK Computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Emo bones of the band are present here, but the sonic exploration employed by Simpson and the boys is as vast as it is genre-defying. Perhaps calling this a “vestage of the Second Wave” isn’t exactly true as this album could have been revolutionary for the genre had it blown up in popularity. However, as dying branch of the Second Wave, this underrated album deserves its place here for how forward-thinking it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Camber - Wake Up and Be Happy (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bursting onto the scene in 1997, Camber gained some notoriety by being in the first Emo Diaries compilation, along with a very good SDRE-inspired first LP. After a few more releases, they put out their last full-length in 2002 and is considered one of their weaker releases. However, I think there are some pretty decent ideas in here and the songs are pretty neat. Check it out if you’re itching for more authentic 90s Emo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;King of Like Spitting - Bridges Worth Burning (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the mid 90s, Kind of Like Spitting occupied an unparalleled space during the Second Wave, playing Midwest Emo with heavy dosages of Indie and some Folksy elements for good measure. A prolific discography and a few magna opera later, we’re in 2002 with KoLS’s final Midwest Emo release, Bridges Worth Burning. This LP is arguably on the same level as their previous greatest releases, trending toward being more upbeat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond anything else, the passion with which this band plays, particularly in the vocals, is undeniable, much like the lyrics. Very few albums sound quite like this, so this is a must-listen. Soon hereafter, KoLS would veer hard into the Indie Folk direction, so this really serves as a denoument to their Emo career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Casket Lottery - Survival is for Cowards (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Casket Lottery is a band with amazing longevity and consistency, having made splits with the likes of Hot Water Music and Touche Amore. After some really good albums and EPs in the late 90s / early 00s, 2002 saw the release of (arguably) their magnum opus, Survival is for Cowards. A potent blend of Post-Hardcore and Midwest Emo, this LP borrows much from the Second Wave but introduces fresh songwriting ideas, making this a sort of breath of fresh air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extremely powerful vocals are driven by an exemplary rhythm section that keeps the listener engaged throughout its ~30 minute runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Jim Yoshii Pile-Up - Homemade Drugs (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow, despite being brighter and overall more hopeful than their debut LP, Homemade Drugs is still a distressing, uhurried album. Tiny elements of Indie and Post-Rock are evident in this album, beginning to turn the Second Wave sound in a new direction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homemade Drugs isn’t the most well-known or beloved release in this section, but it is one of the best, especially if you’re looking for Emo music to sit back and dissociate to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Jets to Brazil - Perfecting Loneliness (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emo woven with equal parts Indie Rock, this late 90s Emo “supergroup” released their final LP Perfecting Loneliness in 2002. Little debate exists that Jets to Brazil&amp;#39;s first album is their all-time musical accomplishment, but their final album is still worthy of praise. Fantastic lyricism and an overall softer tone characterize this album. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Songs regularly exceed 5 minutes of length on this album so if you’re searching for quick bursts of energy as songs, this one isn&amp;#39;t for you. However, if you enjoy a mature take on Indie with inextricable Emo roots, this one is worth a listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Waxwing - Nobody Can Take What Everyone Owns (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waxwing produced Punk-leaning Emo goodness with their final LP. Although the album isn’t extraordinary, the songs are quite fun and energetic with pretty good vocals. Notably, one of the band’s guitarists, Cody Votolato, was working with The Blood Brothers at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Kid Brother Collective - Highway Miles (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple, old-school Emo that will make you yearn for simpler days. In the end, that’s all this genre needs. Nothing extraordinary on display, but more fare for those in the Mineral / Penfold camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rainer Maria - Long Knives Drawn (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Rainer Maria had changed fairly significantly since the band’s origins in the 90s, namely in the absence of male vocals, they had strong Emo ties in this 2003 LP. An Emo / Indie hybrid with the ethos of the Second Wave, what sets this album apart is how poppy Rainer Maria allow themselves to go, giving a memorable quality to the majority of the songs. This is an excellent addition to the band’s consistently good discography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cursive - Ugly Organ (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is probably one of the most well-known and beloved albums on this list, but I figure it’d be worth including it. Cursive began their career in the thick of the Second Wave, releasing two decent albums in the 90s before unleashing their first masterpiece Domestica in 2000. Following up on this unbelievable LP would be no small feat, but when Cursive released Ugly Organ in 2003, they did just that with an equally (if not more so) compelling album. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 50/50 Post-Hardcore / Emo, Ugly Organ adds a cellist to the lineup, greatly expanding past the audio barriers of the genre’s typical instruments. Sinister, dissonant and brooding, this one needs to be heard to be believed. One of the best releases during the Third Wave. Fortunately, this band is still kicking and making awesome music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Elliott - Song in the Air (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third and final full LP from Elliott, Song in the Air bookends their legendary (if somewhat obscure) discography with another great release, even if it perhaps falls short of the grandiosity of False Cathedrals. Regardless, this record encapsulates the evolution of a band from a more typical Mineral-like vibe to a dreamy, ethereal one. The vocals are smooth and gentle while the atmosphere provided by the instruments is dense and layered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elliott typify Second Wave Emo in one respect while pushing the boundaries of the genre at the time. You can really feel that this band could have gotten big under the right circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Small Brown Bike - Nail Yourself to the Ground (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2003 was Small Brown Bike’s biggest year, having released an LP and EP, both very well received. Utilizing that classic Post-Hardcore / Emo formula with their very own spin, Small Brown Bike sound like no other on this EP. With only five songs (and one being a completely different folksy song with slide guitars), the band gave 2003 a huge opening salvo with this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Appleseed Cast - Two Conversations (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Appleseed Cast is one of the most prolific acts in all of Emo and, by the Third Wave, had already established themselves as one of Emo’s great innovators. They experimented with Post-Rock on Mare Vitalis and perfected the combination of Post-Rock and Emo with Low Level Owl Vol 1 and 2, all before 2002 even hit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two Conversations takes the grandiosity of Low Level Owl and strips it to its barest form, more personal and intimate than anything this band had released previously (and possibly since). A breakup concept album isn’t exactly ingenious, but it’s executed very well across 10 songs; each track is handcrafted to fit the album’s flow perfectly and they add up to be greater than the sum of their parts. This band, and especially this album, would have a huge effect on Third Wave Emo going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Small Brown Bike - The River Bed (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expanding sonically on what they produced earlier in the year with Nail Yourself to the Ground, Small Brown Bike ended their first run as a band with an immensely influential full-length album. One could argue that the sound palette screams Post-Hardcore and doesn’t have much to do with Emo, but the album owes almost its entire structure to 90s Emo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The catchiness of the vocals and instruments is juxtaposed perfectly with the rough Post-Hardcore edges of each track, sacrificing none of the heaviness of the band in the process of getting stuck in your head. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Brandtson - Send Us A Signal (2004)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brandtson dives deeper into the Indie Rock sound but doesn’t lose its core Midwest Emo roots with this full-length. With more Emo-Pop influence than ever, the hooks are as catchy as they’ve ever been for this band. You can hear the evolution of their sound compared even to their previous record, and that’s definitely a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;I Hate Myself - 3 Songs (2005)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With almost no released music in the 2000s, I Hate Myself produced one final outing in 2005 with their 3 Songs EP. Gone are the half-Emo, half-Screamo days of yore and this one is pretty much pure Second Wave Midwest Emo. However, this leaves room for wonderful vocal melodies and driving songs. Definitely worth listening to this band’s final moments together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This next section covers albums and EPs released in the Third Wave that are heavily indebted to the Second Wave’s signature sound from bands that weren’t really around for that time period. This should go to show that even though Emo was taking on an entirely different meaning in mainstream contexts, there were many acts dedicated to keeping the older traditions alive. This section is called Carrying the Flag of the Second Wave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;.waterpistol. - Between Here and There is Everything (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debuting with a three-song EP in the year 2000, this relatively obscure band is far enough removed from the Second Wave to appear in this section, at least in my opinion. Fun, active prototypical Midwest Emo is what you’ll find on this album. This definitely sounds like Hardcore kids doing softer Emo music and it shows in the ever-present energy of the instruments and vocals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rest of My Life - Rest of My Life (2002)
This is the first release from the How is Annie label in Norway, one that is very important to the Nordic Emo scene. Rest of My Life’s self-titled LP is heavily indebted to the sounds of Second Wave Midwest Emo with hints of Post-Rock throughout. This sound palette would be a staple of the How is Annie lineup of bands, some of which you’ll see later in this series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strong presence of Post-Hardcore in the occasional screams and heavier moments of this album give the songs a sense of urgency while the Post-Rock influence ensures the serenity of the quieter moments. This small evolution in Emo’s sound helped pave the way for more great releases in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Time Spent Driving - Just Enough Bright (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the more popular albums on this list, Time Spent Driving played classic Midwest Emo with Emo-Pop sensibilities on this album, giving the release its own brand of charm. Situated perfectly at the edge where Emo went mainstream and where Emo remained underground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rescue - Volume Plus Volume (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With their debut LP, Rescue took the Post-Hardcore / Emo combination that was so popular in the mid-late 90s, added Math Rock elements like changing time signatures and played almost every song with a sense of urgency. Had this released sometime in the late 90s and was picked up by the right people, we might be calling this a minor Emo classic today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2004, the band rereleased this album as Volume Plus Volume Plus, which included a bonus CD featuring their 2002 EP Even People and Not the Odds and other unreleased tracks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;8-Bit Revival - Up &amp;amp; Atom (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard 90s-sounding Midwest Emo fare, this debut EP is a great look into an up-and-coming underground Emo band. This group would change their name to Oh Condor but possibly changed it back at some point (not so sure about the name change history), so expect to see more of them in this series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Time to Fly - Birth.Work.Death (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On their sole release, Time to Fly utilized the blueprints left behind by bands like Penfold and injected it with a high dose of Emo-Pop, a burgeoning influence during this period. Regardless, the LP stands on its own as a Second Wave-inspired Emo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vocals are catchy and melodic, juxtaposed by the occasional scream. There are tons of riffs and even some twinkles in there, adding to the diversity of dynamics found throughout the album. This is a true hidden gem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rockets and Bluelights - Close At Hand (2002)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Released during an unknown time in 2002, Close At Hand is Rockets and Bluelights’ first demo. Simply put, this thing rocks. Produced with that 90s analog sound, this harrowing mix of Post-Hardcore and Midwest Emo comes at you with great force, but it doesn’t take away from the subtle elements of Post-Rock that somewhat spring this band into the future of the genre. Alas, I’ve decided to place them in this section of the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Susquatch - First Demo (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the 90s, Japan has had a flourishing Emo scene. Most here are aware of the Japanese Post-Rock / Screamo combination made famous by envy. However, Japan also kept Punky / melodic Emo alive during the 00s, usually with unique influences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;susquatch is a band that gained notoriety in 2009 with their twinkly debut LP right at the beginning of the Revival, but most are not aware of their debut Demo EP. With just the smallest hints that this is Japanese Emo, susquatch actually plays tribute to the greatness of Second Wave Emo quite effectively here. This isn&amp;#39;t their only appearance in this series, but with four years to go before releasing their next EP, their sound would undergo massive changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Halos for Martyrs - A Rush of Sound and the Silence That Follows (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake: this EP is a love letter to Second Wave Emo in both production and style. The ever-present Post-Hardcore accompanies Halos for Martyrs through an Emo musical journey while Math Rock influences seep in through the cracks, particularly in the twinkly riffs scattered about. This release was definitely an overlooked gem in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A Season Drive - Summer of ‘73 (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the lighter side of Emo without veering into Emo-Pop territory, A Season Drive delivers a fun Second Wave-esque album in the vein of Sunny Day Real Estate. This album is by no means a classic, but it does keep the old ways alive for just a little bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Filmmaker - Invitation to an Accident (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plain and simple, this is Seam-esque Midwest Emo done right, with just the right amount of Indie Rock influence to give the vocalist some fun melodies to play with. This band had one other EP released in 2001, but this would be their final release. Though this album is very short of groundbreaking, it’s a worthy listen for 90s Emo fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Settlefish - Dance A While, Upset (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extremely difficult to find, this album has about half the songs featured on other Deep Elm compilations, so you can still hear the masterful and somewhat bleak Midwest emo songwriting used throughout. Nothing here is exceptional, but this refreshing take on Second Wave Midwest Emo features its share of twinkles and fun, mathy moments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Jealous Sound - Kill Them With Kindness (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite jealous I am, indeed! To create such pure, unadulterated fun is an underappreciated aspect of Emo but The Jealous Sound does so with very simple song structures. Now yes, let’s clear the elephant in the room: Brian Shehan of Knapsack fame reprises his role as frontman of this band, utilizing a familiar Indie Rock / Emo approach. Knapsack’s unique qualities made them a very influential Emo band from the mid 90s, but few could hope to replicate them. Even The Jealous Sound doesn’t exactly…sound like Knapsack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear not, for while The Jealous Sound is inherently indebted to Brian’s earlier project, they stand on their own two feet. With less overtly-Punk-influenced songs than Knapsack, a healthy use of synths and a few Emo-Pop sensibilities, they definitely are beginning to grow out of the shadow of Second Wave Emo, but perhaps are too intertwined with the time period to be completely removed from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The December Drive - Handslikegunsandcrashingsounds (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Releasing in 2003, this album was allegedly in the works for about three years and DAMN does that seem right! At its core, Handslikegunsandcrashingsounds is a Second Wave-inspired Emo / Post-Hardcore tour de force. Small elements of Post-Rock seep into the album, generating a powerful aura around each song. Powerful guitarwork lays the foundation for a truly unforgettable vocal performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this album takes a lot of direction from the Second Wave classics, The December Drive injects this album with their own flavor, giving this album a slightly forward-thinking edge compared to many of the true 90s Emo bands. This is without a doubt one of the best albums in this entire section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Dead Letter Auction - Cancer of Time (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dissonant and noisy, Cancer of Time is Dead Letter Auction’s only full-length and boy, is it a doozy! If you like technical Post-Hardcore with a 90s Emo foundation, you’ve come to the right band. The shouty vocals add to the cacophonous atmosphere as much as the dynamic shifts to quiet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Outsmarting Simon - Silent Sober and Sound (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking as much influence from Mineral and Penfold as they did from early Jimmy Eat World and The Get Up Kids, Outsmarting Simon debuted with this great traditional Emo LP. Silent Sober and Sound showcases the band&amp;#39;s propensity for quiet-loud dynamics and dreamy atmospheres. Not the most memorable album, but definitely one with a pulse on the genre. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rockets and Bluelights - A Smashed City with Flames and Music in the Air (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most criminally underlooked and underrated Midwest Emo releases ever, it’s also ludicrously short with only four songs. The Post-Hardcore guitar tone is punchy and robust, leaning into the Emo clean dynamic seamlessly from the heavy distortion. The rhythm section does wonders in giving the songs style, keeping up with the spastic energy of the highs and the subtly of the lows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rudimentary Post-Rock song structures come into play in this EP, giving each track its own identity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Kid Kilowatt - Guitar Method (2004)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, this stuff is great! It almost sounds like it was ACTUALLY recorded between 1996 and 1999! Oh…well, it looks like it WAS recorded during that time! I’m not sure if this album should count on this list as it’s more of a compilation of the band’s recorded material from that time, released in CD format a half-decade after their breakup, Regardless, Kid Kilowatt featured members of Cave In, Piebald and even Converge. Despite that sort of street cred, they played fairly straightforward Indie-influenced Emo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This LP can feel a bit disjointed at times, a consequence of releasing all of the band’s material at once in LP format. However, if this album had come out in the late 90s while the band was still around, we might be calling this one of the best undiscovered Emo bands of the 90s (I guess we can technically still call them that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The 101 - Green Street (2004)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 101 use analog-sounding production that would be at home with the 90s Emo greats, utilizing some primitive Emo-Pop elements such as great use of melody and the odd synth here or there. The individual songs may not have much to write home about, but the flow of the album is actually quite good, making the sum greater than its parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is especially good if you dig Christie Front Drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Moirai - Bury Yourself (2005)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian Carley, vocalist and guitarist of Penfold, refused to let Emo go by the wayside in the 2000s. Somehow, in the year 2005, The Moirai managed to unveil a 90s Emo classic that seemed lost to time and had just been unearthed. Midwest Emo had all but perished from the face of the Earth at this point, especially in the form of 90s Second Wave Emo, but The Moirai’s sole release aimed to inject the dying genre with one last super boost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bury Yourself is a true successor to Penfold’s two classic Second Wave albums, featuring almost every member of the aforementioned band in the credits. The complexity of the compositions appears deceptively simple to the untrained ear, but the quiet-loud dynamics that Penfold made a career of are all here in spades. Brian’s vocal performance is as good as it ever has been; legitimately, one of the best vocal performances you’re going to hear in this entire series. The vocal mastery is only matched by the intelligent, passionate lyrics it delivers. Alas, the Second Wave can finally rest easy knowing The Moirai gave it a proper sendoff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Minor Ache - Black Hours Surround You (2006)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black Hours Surround You is Minor Ache’s only release, coming in at about 30 minutes. However, despite being released sometime in 2005-2006 (the exact release date appears to be unclear), this has the spirit of a 90s Emo / Indie Rock classic! Light twinkles are strewn together by unpredictable volume and time signature changes. The vocals tend to be a bit droning, but that can be a good thing if you aren’t into the whinier side of the genre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gem comes by way of Melbourne, Australia! It seemed as though once the US gave up on Second Wave Midwest Emo completely, the international community stepped up and released a few bangers in the genre’s honor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Build Nest, Sleep - Build Nest, Sleep (2006)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another early release from the How Is Annie record label, Build Nest, Sleep produces old school Emo with a Noise Rock twist! The production is relatively lofi and the songs are smartly built around this. It creates a somewhat dense atmosphere, and atmosphere is what Norway’s infamous label does best. Perhaps not the greatest album on this list, but it is certainly quite an interesting one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Relative - The Progression of Stagnation (2006)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, time to be honest: I couldn’t find much about this band. I mean, can you? Why do half the Emo bands out there have either the longest, easiest-to-identify names in all of music or the least searchable names of all time? As you can see, Relative falls into the latter half; either this band got lumped in with a Hardcore band that released music in the 2010s and they took a vastly different direction with their music after their 2006 debut EP, The Progress of Stagnation or they just released this one EP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is arguably more Post-Hardcore at times, but the Second Wave Emo stank seems to have reached this band all the way in the mid-aughts. Look out for lush sections of Emo atmosphere get broken up by chaotic outbursts throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Brightest Comet - Demo (2007)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Female-fronted, Indie Rock-driven and unabashedly 90s in style, The Brightest Comet is a throwback Emo band in the vein of Rainer Maria or Eldritch Anisette. Their talented vocalist, Andi Camp, also performed vocal and bass duties for a 90s Emo band Ribbon Fix, so definitely check them out if you like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2007, Revival and Proto-Revival bands were coming together and started making music. The Brightest Comet decided to do it their own way and Second Wave lovers have every reason to be thankful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Aura… - Enquanto houver sentimentos (2007)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe news didn&amp;#39;t travel that fast to Brazil back in the day; Aura… didn&amp;#39;t seem to know the Second Wave was long gone and the Fourth Wave was already looming. But damn, did they ever release a 90s-inspired gem with Enquanto Houver Sentimentos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analog recording gives this a true DIY feel while the compositions are familiar yet somewhat complex. They sound like they could have opened up for Mineral back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Everton - Floorsleepers (9/27/2007)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, our journey brings us to Austria with Everton. Floorsleepers features songs of varying lengths, but they always give the compositions time to breathe and create a true individual identity. The clean, chunky guitars provide a nice base for the sound while the rhythm section, particularly the drums, is active and lively, even during quiet moments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazing, the production is also very reminiscent of the period they’re trying to visit. There must be a comparable “Midwest” area of Austria because these talented folks must be from there. The sad vibes are real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it for part one! This one took weeks to compile, so make sure to be on the lookout for part two coming out sometime soon!&lt;/p&gt;

,u_cheezit,"**TL;DR** If video game inventories existed in real life, you’d use them to store Cheez-It crackers. We can’t break the laws of physics, but this guide gets you close. 

**The Premise: The Irresistible Need for Cheez-It**

Since 1921, we’ve been delivering crackers made with 100% real cheese, 100% of the time.

The times have changed, but the cravings grow stronger. In the same way a video game inventory allows you to instantly build a fort, hold 999 monster teeth, or switch between gigantic heavy swords, Cheez-It fans ask why, *why* are Cheez-It crackers not immediately equippable?

Here are some of the thousands of completely real requests we receive, demanding a solution.

*“I need my Cheez-It crackers on me at all times, how else can I keep my winstreak?”*

*“You gave me this craving for Cheez-It. You must make it so I can eat Cheez-It crackers whenever I want. Make it so.”*

*“Can you tell Cheez to please stop texting me spoilers for Bauldr’s Gate 3?*

We hear you. Even if you don’t, sadly, have a bottomless video game inventory irl, we’ve tried and tested a variety of methods to keep Cheez-It crackers on you at all times, in a way that is:

1. Convenient -  as close to inventory-accessible as possible.
2. Secure - ensures your Cheez-It crackers are for you and only you.
3. Fun - causes you to lightly exhale air out of your nose. Or if you’re Cheez, cause a little giggle.

Our very own mascot, Cheez, tested the methods in this guide (at least the ones that didn’t risk him melting). Plan your gamer strategies accordingly. If you take advantage of various method bonuses, you could, in fact, optimize your life.

 **The Problem: Storage and Accessibility Challenges**

Cheez-It crackers, invented in 1921, are baked crackers made with, you guessed it, 100% real cheese. Each cardboard box of Cheez-It contains an inner bag, holding those absolutely perfect little crackers. If you’ve tried Cheez-It you know they’re very, very tasty, worthy of the stash, stowe, hoard.

Yes, it *is* a challenge to store an entire box of Cheez-It crackers. But when considering the concentration of real cheese per cubic bite, it is, in fact, a shockingly cheese-efficient challenge.

In the words of Cheez, “If there’s a will, there’s a way. And Cheez-It crackers are the way to my friend, Will, who works at Cheez-It HQ. Hi Will! I miss you.” 

**Disclaimer:**

There’s plenty of delicious forms of Cheez-It crackers: the beloved original, Cheez-It Extra Toasty, and Cheez-It Snack Mix, just to name a few.

However, this method might not account for all types of Cheez-It, such as Cheez-It Puff’d, Cheez-It Snap’d, the Cheez-It crackers that come in bags at the gas station, etc. These classes of Cheez-It are still cheesy perfection, and worthy of your shelf space. That isn’t to say they can’t be stored at all, just haven’t been rigorously tested by Cheez-It and Cheez. (The latter is less important to testing, but his feelings will be hurt if we don’t mention him.)

We also will not cover improperly organized single, loose Cheez-It crackers. Cheez-It crackers must be grouped into multiples, because you’ll want more than one.

*Some Cheez-It is better than none, but one Cheez-It just isn’t as fun.*

 **\~The Solutions: Tried and Tested Cheez-It Storage Methods\~**

**Traditional storage methods:** From here known as TSM. This includes anywhere you’d normally store Cheez-It crackers, with regulated humidity and structural stability.

Placing one box at each TSM point (TSMP) will create a mini-map of Cheez-It locations, to stock up throughout the day. Plan a strategy based on your route. Where will you run out of Cheez-It crackers? In a grassy field, on a boat, fishing, while grinding for experience points breaking acorns on the ground? Perhaps at the local cave?

**Distributed to party members:** Think of your TSMPs in people (traditional storage method point people, or TSMPP). Who are your party members, those likeminded, trusted comrades who share your love of 100% real cheese? As you venture through the world, you and your party members will become living mobile Cheez-It storage points.

Humans are imperfect creatures (unlike Cheez, who is *“100% real cheese, 100% perfection,”* in his words). Humans get hungry, need to restore HP, or simply find themselves craving the irresistible goodness of Cheez-It crackers. It goes without saying this method requires the utmost level of trust. Cheez suggests collecting blackmail on your party members to avoid any betrayals. You’ll thank us later.

***NOTE:*** *This method requires friends.*

*Visuals: 3a Collect blackmail. 3b. Hungry human will resist eating Cheez-It due to blackmail 3b Cheez with blackmail*

**Tactical Plants:** What provides tactical cover and will not consume your delicious Cheez-It crackers? Greenery, foliage, shrubbery. It can all be optimized for Cheez-It inventory use. Much like how enemies will not see you if you duck behind even the sparsest sapling, they won’t notice your Cheez-it crackers either.

Plants that are smaller than the dimensions of the box are recommended. Cheez-It is not responsible for any plants harmed in the creation of this IRL inventory, so please stash responsibly.

Cheez does not know how to keep a plant alive (are you sure you’re 100% perfect, Cheez?) He recommends using a fake plant to reduce guilt while increasing crunch.

*Visuals: 4a Cheez-It and an average house-plant. 4b Place box in plant. 4c Box seamlessly blends with plant.*

**Tactical Lamps:** See tactical plants, but replace with lamps.  
NOTE: Cheez, if you are reading this, please be careful of this method. We know what happened last time.

**Fashion a hat:**

-3 AG

+2 CH

Note that this will add a stat buff and debuff. Consider avoiding this method in situations that require increased agility: going to the gym, running away from a bear etc. Instead, try for activities like a date (NOTE: requires a date) or door to door salespersoning.

The benefits are not simply in charm alone. With just a bit of extra caution under low underpasses, this is a fantastic and reliable method to keep Cheez-It crackers close at all times.

This is Cheez’s favorite method. He’s been known to frequently wear hats, it is the article of clothing easiest (and most flattering) for him to wear. If he sees you wearing a hat with Cheez-It crackers, he will likely approach you and ask for a picture. He will even try to be your friend, causing a small, but much needed, social stat boost.

*Visuals: 5a Cheez in one of his many hats. 5b: WARNING: if hat is stylish, Cheez will approach.*

**Where you least expect it:** Element of surprise. On the shelf of a certain national library. In the fridge. Taped to a ceiling, in an air vent, in a clay pot, to be broken open with a “hi-yah!”

We can’t tell you where *you* would least expect to find Cheez-It crackers. That’s a personal journey.

**Small wheels and tether:**

-5 Stealth

+1 luck

Attaching small wheels to the box of Cheez-It will allow it to be mobile (and cute). However, a rolling box of Cheez-It can and will draw attention, completely disrupting any stealthy activity. You might find the world is more giving to such childish whimsy, and you’ll find yourself in more conversations, with more quests, and receiving small gifts.

Disclaimer: Much like a shopping cart, one wheel is bound to be less spinny than the rest. If Cheez sees this inferior wheel, he will likely laugh at it (and you). If your social stat is high enough, this will not affect you. But words can hurt, especially when they’re from the Cheez-It brand mascot. Not sure how much lower it gets than that.

**Equip a box of Cheez-It at all times:** Use one of your equip slots, and hold a box of Cheez-It in one of your hands.

The true video game inventory is not achievable. This megathread is a testament to that. When it comes to the perfection of 100% real cheese, to avoid being taken, disrupted, or separated, the only surefire inventory method is within your hand(s).

**Conclusion**

As a valued Cheez-It enjoyer, we want to ensure you can enjoy Cheez-It wherever and whenever hunger strikes. We deeply apologize for being unable to defy the laws of the 3D world so you can conjure a box of Cheez-It out of thin air.

Cheez still holds on to hope.

To that precious wheel of 100% real cheese, who rolled into our hearts and overstayed his welcome, yes. One day, all this will be possible. We are tirelessly working towards a solution. We know it isn’t perfect, but we hope these methods will serve you, as we all wait for video game science to catch up to our appetites.

&lt;p&gt;Since 1921, we’ve been delivering crackers made with 100% real cheese, 100% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The times have changed, but the cravings grow stronger. In the same way a video game inventory allows you to instantly build a fort, hold 999 monster teeth, or switch between gigantic heavy swords, Cheez-It fans ask why, &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; are Cheez-It crackers not immediately equippable?&lt;/p&gt;

,u_cheezit,"**TL;DR** If video game inventories existed in real life, you’d use them to store Cheez-It crackers. We can’t break the laws of physics, but this guide gets you close. 

**The Premise: The Irresistible Need for Cheez-It**

Since 1921, we’ve been delivering crackers made with 100% real cheese, 100% of the time.

The times have changed, but the cravings grow stronger. In the same way a video game inventory allows you to instantly build a fort, hold 999 monster teeth, or switch between gigantic heavy swords, Cheez-It fans ask why, *why* are Cheez-It crackers not immediately equippable?

Here are some of the thousands of completely real requests we receive, demanding a solution.

*“I need my Cheez-It crackers on me at all times, how else can I keep my winstreak?”*

*“You gave me this craving for Cheez-It. You must make it so I can eat Cheez-It crackers whenever I want. Make it so.”*

*“Can you tell Cheez to please stop texting me spoilers for Bauldr’s Gate 3?*

We hear you. Even if you don’t, sadly, have a bottomless video game inventory irl, we’ve tried and tested a variety of methods to keep Cheez-It crackers on you at all times, in a way that is:

1. Convenient -  as close to inventory-accessible as possible.
2. Secure - ensures your Cheez-It crackers are for you and only you.
3. Fun - causes you to lightly exhale air out of your nose. Or if you’re Cheez, cause a little giggle.

Our very own mascot, Cheez, tested the methods in this guide (at least the ones that didn’t risk him melting). Plan your gamer strategies accordingly. If you take advantage of various method bonuses, you could, in fact, optimize your life.

*Visuals: 1a convenient placement, 1b secure placement, 1c fun!*

 **The Problem: Storage and Accessibility Challenges**

Cheez-It crackers, invented in 1921, are baked crackers made with, you guessed it, 100% real cheese. Each cardboard box of Cheez-It contains an inner bag, holding those absolutely perfect little crackers. If you’ve tried Cheez-It you know they’re very, very tasty, worthy of the stash, stowe, hoard.

Yes, it *is* a challenge to store an entire box of Cheez-It crackers. But when considering the concentration of real cheese per cubic bite, it is, in fact, a shockingly cheese-efficient challenge.

In the words of Cheez, “If there’s a will, there’s a way. And Cheez-It crackers are the way to my friend, Will, who works at Cheez-It HQ. Hi Will! I miss you.” 

**Disclaimer:**

There’s plenty of delicious forms of Cheez-It crackers: the beloved original, Cheez-It Extra Toasty, and Cheez-It Snack Mix, just to name a few.

However, this method might not account for all types of Cheez-It, such as Cheez-It Puff’d, Cheez-It Snap’d, the Cheez-It crackers that come in bags at the gas station, etc. These classes of Cheez-It are still cheesy perfection, and worthy of your shelf space. That isn’t to say they can’t be stored at all, just haven’t been rigorously tested by Cheez-It and Cheez. (The latter is less important to testing, but his feelings will be hurt if we don’t mention him.)

We also will not cover improperly organized single, loose Cheez-It crackers. Cheez-It crackers must be grouped into multiples, because you’ll want more than one.

*Some Cheez-It is better than none, but one Cheez-It just isn’t as fun.*

 **\~The Solutions: Tried and Tested Cheez-It Storage Methods\~**

**Traditional storage methods:** From here known as TSM. This includes anywhere you’d normally store Cheez-It crackers, with regulated humidity and structural stability.

Placing one box at each TSM point (TSMP) will create a mini-map of Cheez-It locations, to stock up throughout the day. Plan a strategy based on your route. Where will you run out of Cheez-It crackers? In a grassy field, on a boat, fishing, while grinding for experience points breaking acorns on the ground? Perhaps at the local cave?

**Distributed to party members:** Think of your TSMPs in people (traditional storage method point people, or TSMPP). Who are your party members, those likeminded, trusted comrades who share your love of 100% real cheese? As you venture through the world, you and your party members will become living mobile Cheez-It storage points.

Humans are imperfect creatures (unlike Cheez, who is *“100% real cheese, 100% perfection,”* in his words). Humans get hungry, need to restore HP, or simply find themselves craving the irresistible goodness of Cheez-It crackers. It goes without saying this method requires the utmost level of trust. Cheez suggests collecting blackmail on your party members to avoid any betrayals. You’ll thank us later.

***NOTE:*** *This method requires friends.*

*Visuals: 3a Collect blackmail. 3b. Hungry human will resist eating Cheez-It due to blackmail 3b Cheez with blackmail*

**Tactical Plants:** What provides tactical cover and will not consume your delicious Cheez-It crackers? Greenery, foliage, shrubbery. It can all be optimized for Cheez-It inventory use. Much like how enemies will not see you if you duck behind even the sparsest sapling, they won’t notice your Cheez-it crackers either.

Plants that are smaller than the dimensions of the box are recommended. Cheez-It is not responsible for any plants harmed in the creation of this IRL inventory, so please stash responsibly.

Cheez does not know how to keep a plant alive (are you sure you’re 100% perfect, Cheez?) He recommends using a fake plant to reduce guilt while increasing crunch.

*Visuals: 4a Cheez-It and an average house-plant. 4b Place box in plant. 4c Box seamlessly blends with plant.*

**Tactical Lamps:** See tactical plants, but replace with lamps.  
NOTE: Cheez, if you are reading this, please be careful of this method. We know what happened last time.

**Fashion a hat:**

-3 AG

+2 CH

Note that this will add a stat buff and debuff. Consider avoiding this method in situations that require increased agility: going to the gym, running away from a bear etc. Instead, try for activities like a date (NOTE: requires a date) or door to door salespersoning.

The benefits are not simply in charm alone. With just a bit of extra caution under low underpasses, this is a fantastic and reliable method to keep Cheez-It crackers close at all times.

This is Cheez’s favorite method. He’s been known to frequently wear hats, it is the article of clothing easiest (and most flattering) for him to wear. If he sees you wearing a hat with Cheez-It crackers, he will likely approach you and ask for a picture. He will even try to be your friend, causing a small, but much needed, social stat boost.

*Visuals: 5a Cheez in one of his many hats. 5b: WARNING: if hat is stylish, Cheez will approach.*

**Where you least expect it:** Element of surprise. On the shelf of a certain national library. In the fridge. Taped to a ceiling, in an air vent, in a clay pot, to be broken open with a “hi-yah!”

We can’t tell you where *you* would least expect to find Cheez-It crackers. That’s a personal journey.

**Small wheels and tether:**

- 5 Stealth

+1 luck

Attaching small wheels to the box of Cheez-It will allow it to be mobile (and cute). However, a rolling box of Cheez-It can and will draw attention, completely disrupting any stealthy activity. You might find the world is more giving to such childish whimsy, and you’ll find yourself in more conversations, with more quests, and receiving small gifts.

Disclaimer: Much like a shopping cart, one wheel is bound to be less spinny than the rest. If Cheez sees this inferior wheel, he will likely laugh at it (and you). If your social stat is high enough, this will not affect you. But words can hurt, especially when they’re from the Cheez-It brand mascot. Not sure how much lower it gets than that.

**Equip a box of Cheez-It at all times:** Use one of your equip slots, and hold a box of Cheez-It in one of your hands.

The true video game inventory is not achievable. This megathread is a testament to that. When it comes to the perfection of 100% real cheese, to avoid being taken, disrupted, or separated, the only surefire inventory method is within your hand(s).

**Conclusion**

As a valued Cheez-It enjoyer, we want to ensure you can enjoy Cheez-It wherever and whenever hunger strikes. We deeply apologize for being unable to defy the laws of the 3D world so you can conjure a box of Cheez-It out of thin air.

Cheez still holds on to hope.

To that precious wheel of 100% real cheese, who rolled into our hearts and overstayed his welcome, yes. One day, all this will be possible. We are tirelessly working towards a solution. We know it isn’t perfect, but we hope these methods will serve you, as we all wait for video game science to catch up to our appetites.

Nobody tell Cheez we are not working on this. It is truly impossible and will never happen.

Where will you run out of Cheez-It crackers? In a grassy field, on a boat, fishing, while grinding for experience points breaking acorns on the ground? Perhaps at the local cave?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distributed to party members:&lt;/strong&gt; Think of your TSMPs in people (traditional storage method point people, or TSMPP). Who are your party members, those likeminded, trusted comrades who share your love of 100% real cheese? As you venture through the world, you and your party members will become living mobile Cheez-It storage points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans are imperfect creatures (unlike Cheez, who is &lt;em&gt;“100% real cheese, 100% perfection,”&lt;/em&gt; in his words). Humans get hungry, need to restore HP, or simply find themselves craving the irresistible goodness of Cheez-It crackers. It goes without saying this method requires the utmost level of trust. Cheez suggests collecting blackmail on your party members to avoid any betrayals. You’ll thank us later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;This method requires friends.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tactical Plants:&lt;/strong&gt; What provides tactical cover and will not consume your delicious Cheez-It crackers? Greenery, foliage, shrubbery. It can all be optimized for Cheez-It inventory use. Much like how enemies will not see you if you duck behind even the sparsest sapling, they won’t notice your Cheez-it crackers either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plants that are smaller than the dimensions of the box are recommended. Cheez-It is not responsible for any plants harmed in the creation of this IRL inventory, so please stash responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheez does not know how to keep a plant alive (are you sure you’re 100% perfect, Cheez?) He recommends using a fake plant to reduce guilt while increasing crunch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/pccvet9w6gfc1.png?width=6521&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5d79ba8434c7395e24f0651af442d4c928f6209c""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/pccvet9w6gfc1.png?width=6521&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5d79ba8434c7395e24f0651af442d4c928f6209c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visuals: 4a Cheez-It and an average house-plant. 4b Place box in plant. 4c Box seamlessly blends with plant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tactical Lamps:&lt;/strong&gt; See tactical plants, but replace with lamps.&lt;br/&gt;
NOTE: Cheez, if you are reading this, please be careful of this method. We know what happened last time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fashion a hat:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-3 AG&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;+2 CH&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this will add a stat buff and debuff. Consider avoiding this method in situations that require increased agility: going to the gym, running away from a bear etc. Instead, try for activities like a date (NOTE: requires a date) or door to door salespersoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits are not simply in charm alone. With just a bit of extra caution under low underpasses, this is a fantastic and reliable method to keep Cheez-It crackers close at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Cheez’s favorite method. He’s been known to frequently wear hats, it is the article of clothing easiest (and most flattering) for him to wear. If he sees you wearing a hat with Cheez-It crackers, he will likely approach you and ask for a picture. He will even try to be your friend, causing a small, but much needed, social stat boost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/jce6dvoy6gfc1.png?width=4334&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6920f314b474489abcdec3fbf418dbe86c5cb286""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/jce6dvoy6gfc1.png?width=4334&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6920f314b474489abcdec3fbf418dbe86c5cb286&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visuals: 5a Cheez in one of his many hats. 5b: WARNING: if hat is stylish, Cheez will approach.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where you least expect it:&lt;/strong&gt; Element of surprise. On the shelf of a certain national library. In the fridge. Taped to a ceiling, in an air vent, in a clay pot, to be broken open with a “hi-yah!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can’t tell you where &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; would least expect to find Cheez-It crackers. That’s a personal journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small wheels and tether:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 Stealth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;+1 luck&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attaching small wheels to the box of Cheez-It will allow it to be mobile (and cute). However, a rolling box of Cheez-It can and will draw attention, completely disrupting any stealthy activity. You might find the world is more giving to such childish whimsy, and you’ll find yourself in more conversations, with more quests, and receiving small gifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: Much like a shopping cart, one wheel is bound to be less spinny than the rest. If Cheez sees this inferior wheel, he will likely laugh at it (and you). If your social stat is high enough, this will not affect you. But words can hurt, especially when they’re from the Cheez-It brand mascot. Not sure how much lower it gets than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equip a box of Cheez-It at all times:&lt;/strong&gt; Use one of your equip slots, and hold a box of Cheez-It in one of your hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The true video game inventory is not achievable. This megathread is a testament to that. When it comes to the perfection of 100% real cheese, to avoid being taken, disrupted, or separated, the only surefire inventory method is within your hand(s).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a valued Cheez-It enjoyer, we want to ensure you can enjoy Cheez-It wherever and whenever hunger strikes. We deeply apologize for being unable to defy the laws of the 3D world so you can conjure a box of Cheez-It out of thin air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheez still holds on to hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that precious wheel of 100% real cheese, who rolled into our hearts and overstayed his welcome, yes. One day, all this will be possible. We are tirelessly working towards a solution. We know it isn’t perfect, but we hope these methods will serve you, as we all wait for video game science to catch up to our appetites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody tell Cheez we are not working on this. It is truly impossible and will never happen. We&amp;#39;re hoping he forgets about all this very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

,u_cheezit,"**TL;DR** If video game inventories existed in real life, you’d use them to store Cheez-It crackers. We can’t break the laws of physics, but this guide gets you close. 

**The Premise: The Irresistible Need for Cheez-It**

Since 1921, we’ve been delivering crackers made with 100% real cheese, 100% of the time.

The times have changed, but the cravings grow stronger. In the same way a video game inventory allows you to instantly build a fort, hold 999 monster teeth, or switch between gigantic heavy swords, Cheez-It fans ask why, *why* are Cheez-It crackers not immediately equippable?

Here are some of the thousands of completely real requests we receive, demanding a solution.

*“I need my Cheez-It crackers on me at all times, how else can I keep my winstreak?”*

*“You gave me this craving for Cheez-It. You must make it so I can eat Cheez-It crackers whenever I want. Make it so.”*

*“Can you tell Cheez to please stop texting me spoilers for Bauldr’s Gate 3?*

We hear you. Even if you don’t, sadly, have a bottomless video game inventory irl, we’ve tried and tested a variety of methods to keep Cheez-It crackers on you at all times, in a way that is:

1. Convenient -  as close to inventory-accessible as possible.
2. Secure - ensures your Cheez-It crackers are for you and only you.
3. Fun - causes you to lightly exhale air out of your nose. Or if you’re Cheez, cause a little giggle.

Our very own mascot, Cheez, tested the methods in this guide (at least the ones that didn’t risk him melting). Plan your gamer strategies accordingly. If you take advantage of various method bonuses, you could, in fact, optimize your life.

*Visuals: 1a convenient placement, 1b secure placement, 1c fun!*

 **The Problem: Storage and Accessibility Challenges**

Cheez-It crackers, invented in 1921, are baked crackers made with, you guessed it, 100% real cheese. Each cardboard box of Cheez-It contains an inner bag, holding those absolutely perfect little crackers. If you’ve tried Cheez-It you know they’re very, very tasty, worthy of the stash, stowe, hoard.

Yes, it *is* a challenge to store an entire box of Cheez-It crackers. But when considering the concentration of real cheese per cubic bite, it is, in fact, a shockingly cheese-efficient challenge.

In the words of Cheez, “If there’s a will, there’s a way. And Cheez-It crackers are the way to my friend, Will, who works at Cheez-It HQ. Hi Will! I miss you.” 

**Disclaimer:**

There’s plenty of delicious forms of Cheez-It crackers: the beloved original, Cheez-It Extra Toasty, and Cheez-It Snack Mix, just to name a few.

However, this method might not account for all types of Cheez-It, such as Cheez-It Puff’d, Cheez-It Snap’d, the Cheez-It crackers that come in bags at the gas station, etc. These classes of Cheez-It are still cheesy perfection, and worthy of your shelf space. That isn’t to say they can’t be stored at all, just haven’t been rigorously tested by Cheez-It and Cheez. (The latter is less important to testing, but his feelings will be hurt if we don’t mention him.)

We also will not cover improperly organized single, loose Cheez-It crackers. Cheez-It crackers must be grouped into multiples, because you’ll want more than one.

*Some Cheez-It is better than none, but one Cheez-It just isn’t as fun.*

 **\~The Solutions: Tried and Tested Cheez-It Storage Methods\~**

**Traditional storage methods:** From here known as TSM. This includes anywhere you’d normally store Cheez-It crackers, with regulated humidity and structural stability.

Placing one box at each TSM point (TSMP) will create a mini-map of Cheez-It locations, to stock up throughout the day. Plan a strategy based on your route. Where will you run out of Cheez-It crackers? In a grassy field, on a boat, fishing, while grinding for experience points breaking acorns on the ground? Perhaps at the local cave?

**Distributed to party members:** Think of your TSMPs in people (traditional storage method point people, or TSMPP). Who are your party members, those likeminded, trusted comrades who share your love of 100% real cheese? As you venture through the world, you and your party members will become living mobile Cheez-It storage points.

Humans are imperfect creatures (unlike Cheez, who is *“100% real cheese, 100% perfection,”* in his words). Humans get hungry, need to restore HP, or simply find themselves craving the irresistible goodness of Cheez-It crackers. It goes without saying this method requires the utmost level of trust. Cheez suggests collecting blackmail on your party members to avoid any betrayals. You’ll thank us later.

***NOTE:*** *This method requires friends.*

**Tactical Plants:** What provides tactical cover and will not consume your delicious Cheez-It crackers? Greenery, foliage, shrubbery. It can all be optimized for Cheez-It inventory use. Much like how enemies will not see you if you duck behind even the sparsest sapling, they won’t notice your Cheez-it crackers either.

Plants that are smaller than the dimensions of the box are recommended. Cheez-It is not responsible for any plants harmed in the creation of this IRL inventory, so please stash responsibly.

Cheez does not know how to keep a plant alive (are you sure you’re 100% perfect, Cheez?) He recommends using a fake plant to reduce guilt while increasing crunch.

**Tactical Lamps:** See tactical plants, but replace with lamps.  
NOTE: Cheez, if you are reading this, please be careful of this method. We know what happened last time.

**Fashion a hat:**

+2 CH

Note that this will add a stat buff and debuff. Consider avoiding this method in situations that require increased agility: going to the gym, running away from a bear etc. Instead, try for activities like a date (NOTE: requires a date) or door to door salespersoning.

The benefits are not simply in charm alone. With just a bit of extra caution under low underpasses, this is a fantastic and reliable method to keep Cheez-It crackers close at all times.

This is Cheez’s favorite method. He’s been known to frequently wear hats, it is the article of clothing easiest (and most flattering) for him to wear. If he sees you wearing a hat with Cheez-It crackers, he will likely approach you and ask for a picture. He will even try to be your friend, causing a small, but much needed, social stat boost.

**Where you least expect it:** Element of surprise. On the shelf of a certain national library. In the fridge. Taped to a ceiling, in an air vent, in a clay pot, to be broken open with a “hi-yah!”

We can’t tell you where *you* would least expect to find Cheez-It crackers. That’s a personal journey.

**Small wheels and tether:**

* 5 Stealth

+1 luck

Attaching small wheels to the box of Cheez-It will allow it to be mobile (and cute). However, a rolling box of Cheez-It can and will draw attention, completely disrupting any stealthy activity. You might find the world is more giving to such childish whimsy, and you’ll find yourself in more conversations, with more quests, and receiving small gifts.

Disclaimer: Much like a shopping cart, one wheel is bound to be less spinny than the rest. If Cheez sees this inferior wheel, he will likely laugh at it (and you). If your social stat is high enough, this will not affect you. But words can hurt, especially when they’re from the Cheez-It brand mascot. Not sure how much lower it gets than that.

**Equip a box of Cheez-It at all times:** Use one of your equip slots, and hold a box of Cheez-It in one of your hands.

The true video game inventory is not achievable. This megathread is a testament to that. When it comes to the perfection of 100% real cheese, to avoid being taken, disrupted, or separated, the only surefire inventory method is within your hand(s).

**Conclusion**

As a valued Cheez-It enjoyer, we want to ensure you can enjoy Cheez-It wherever and whenever hunger strikes. We deeply apologize for being unable to defy the laws of the 3D world so you can conjure a box of Cheez-It out of thin air.

Cheez still holds on to hope.

To that precious wheel of 100% real cheese, who rolled into our hearts and overstayed his welcome, yes. One day, all this will be possible. We are tirelessly working towards a solution. We know it isn’t perfect, but we hope these methods will serve you, as we all wait for video game science to catch up to our appetites.

Nobody tell Cheez we are not working on this. It is truly impossible and will never happen.

We can’t break the laws of physics, but this guide gets you close. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Premise: The Irresistible Need for Cheez-It&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 1921, we’ve been delivering crackers made with 100% real cheese, 100% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The times have changed, but the cravings grow stronger. In the same way a video game inventory allows you to instantly build a fort, hold 999 monster teeth, or switch between gigantic heavy swords, Cheez-It fans ask why, &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; are Cheez-It crackers not immediately equippable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the thousands of completely real requests we receive, demanding a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I need my Cheez-It crackers on me at all times, how else can I keep my winstreak?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“You gave me this craving for Cheez-It. You must make it so I can eat Cheez-It crackers whenever I want. Make it so.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Can you tell Cheez to please stop texting me spoilers for Bauldr’s Gate 3?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hear you. Even if you don’t, sadly, have a bottomless video game inventory irl, we’ve tried and tested a variety of methods to keep Cheez-It crackers on you at all times, in a way that is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convenient -  as close to inventory-accessible as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secure - ensures your Cheez-It crackers are for you and only you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fun - causes you to lightly exhale air out of your nose. Or if you’re Cheez, cause a little giggle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our very own mascot, Cheez, tested the methods in this guide (at least the ones that didn’t risk him melting). Plan your gamer strategies accordingly. If you take advantage of various method bonuses, you could, in fact, optimize your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The Problem: Storage and Accessibility Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheez-It crackers, invented in 1921, are baked crackers made with, you guessed it, 100% real cheese. Each cardboard box of Cheez-It contains an inner bag, holding those absolutely perfect little crackers. If you’ve tried Cheez-It you know they’re very, very tasty, worthy of the stash, stowe, hoard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a challenge to store an entire box of Cheez-It crackers. But when considering the concentration of real cheese per cubic bite, it is, in fact, a shockingly cheese-efficient challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the words of Cheez, “If there’s a will, there’s a way. And Cheez-It crackers are the way to my friend, Will, who works at Cheez-It HQ. Hi Will! I miss you.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty of delicious forms of Cheez-It crackers: the beloved original, Cheez-It Extra Toasty, and Cheez-It Snack Mix, just to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this method might not account for all types of Cheez-It, such as Cheez-It Puff’d, Cheez-It Snap’d, the Cheez-It crackers that come in bags at the gas station, etc. These classes of Cheez-It are still cheesy perfection, and worthy of your shelf space. That isn’t to say they can’t be stored at all, just haven’t been rigorously tested by Cheez-It and Cheez. (The latter is less important to testing, but his feelings will be hurt if we don’t mention him.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also will not cover improperly organized single, loose Cheez-It crackers. Cheez-It crackers must be grouped into multiples, because you’ll want more than one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some Cheez-It is better than none, but one Cheez-It just isn’t as fun.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;em&gt;- Cheez&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;~The Solutions: Tried and Tested Cheez-It Storage Methods~&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traditional storage methods:&lt;/strong&gt; From here known as TSM. This includes anywhere you’d normally store Cheez-It crackers, with regulated humidity and structural stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Placing one box at each TSM point (TSMP) will create a mini-map of Cheez-It locations, to stock up throughout the day. Plan a strategy based on your route. Where will you run out of Cheez-It crackers? In a grassy field, on a boat, fishing, while grinding for experience points breaking acorns on the ground? Perhaps at the local cave?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distributed to party members:&lt;/strong&gt; Think of your TSMPs in people (traditional storage method point people, or TSMPP). Who are your party members, those likeminded, trusted comrades who share your love of 100% real cheese? As you venture through the world, you and your party members will become living mobile Cheez-It storage points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans are imperfect creatures (unlike Cheez, who is &lt;em&gt;“100% real cheese, 100% perfection,”&lt;/em&gt; in his words). Humans get hungry, need to restore HP, or simply find themselves craving the irresistible goodness of Cheez-It crackers. It goes without saying this method requires the utmost level of trust. Cheez suggests collecting blackmail on your party members to avoid any betrayals. You’ll thank us later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;This method requires friends.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,u_cheezit,"**TL;DR** If video game inventories existed in real life, you’d use them to store Cheez-It crackers. We can’t break the laws of physics, but this guide gets you close. 

**The Premise: The Irresistible Need for Cheez-It**

Since 1921, we’ve been delivering crackers made with 100% real cheese, 100% of the time.

The times have changed, but the cravings grow stronger. In the same way a video game inventory allows you to instantly build a fort, hold 999 monster teeth, or switch between gigantic heavy swords, Cheez-It fans ask why, *why* are Cheez-It crackers not immediately equippable?  
  
Here are some of the thousands of completely real requests we receive, demanding a solution.

*“I need my Cheez-It crackers on me at all times, how else can I keep my winstreak?”*

*“You gave me this craving for Cheez-It. You must make it so I can eat Cheez-It crackers whenever I want. Make it so.”*

*“Can you tell Cheez to please stop texting me spoilers for Bauldr’s Gate 3?*

We hear you. Even if you don’t, sadly, have a bottomless video game inventory irl, we’ve tried and tested a variety of methods to keep Cheez-It crackers on you at all times, in a way that is:

1. Convenient -  as close to inventory-accessible as possible.
2. Secure - ensures your Cheez-It crackers are for you and only you.
3. Fun - causes you to lightly exhale air out of your nose. Or if you’re Cheez, cause a little giggle.

Our very own mascot, Cheez, tested the methods in this guide (at least the ones that didn’t risk him melting). Plan your gamer strategies accordingly. If you take advantage of various method bonuses, you could, in fact, optimize your life.

*Visuals: 1a convenient placement, 1b secure placement, 1c fun!*

 **The Problem: Storage and Accessibility Challenges**

Cheez-It crackers, invented in 1921, are baked crackers made with, you guessed it, 100% real cheese. Each cardboard box of Cheez-It contains an inner bag, holding those absolutely perfect little crackers. If you’ve tried Cheez-It you know they’re very, very tasty, worthy of the stash, stowe, hoard.

Yes, it *is* a challenge to store an entire box of Cheez-It crackers. But when considering the concentration of real cheese per cubic bite, it is, in fact, a shockingly cheese-efficient challenge.

In the words of Cheez, “If there’s a will, there’s a way. And Cheez-It crackers are the way to my friend, Will, who works at Cheez-It HQ. Hi Will! I miss you.” 

**Disclaimer:**

There’s plenty of delicious forms of Cheez-It crackers: the beloved original, Cheez-It Extra Toasty, and Cheez-It Snack Mix, just to name a few.  
  
However, this method might not account for all types of Cheez-It, such as Cheez-It Puff’d, Cheez-It Snap’d, the Cheez-It crackers that come in bags at the gas station, etc. These classes of Cheez-It are still cheesy perfection, and worthy of your shelf space. That isn’t to say they can’t be stored at all, just haven’t been rigorously tested by Cheez-It and Cheez. (The latter is less important to testing, but his feelings will be hurt if we don’t mention him.)

We also will not cover improperly organized single, loose Cheez-It crackers. Cheez-It crackers must be grouped into multiples, because you’ll want more than one.

*Some Cheez-It is better than none, but one Cheez-It just isn’t as fun.*

 **~The Solutions: Tried and Tested Cheez-It Storage Methods~**

**Traditional storage methods:** From here known as TSM. This includes anywhere you’d normally store Cheez-It crackers, with regulated humidity and structural stability.

Placing one box at each TSM point (TSMP) will create a mini-map of Cheez-It locations, to stock up throughout the day. Plan a strategy based on your route. Where will you run out of Cheez-It crackers? In a grassy field, on a boat, fishing, while grinding for experience points breaking acorns on the ground? Perhaps at the local cave?

**Distributed to party members:** Think of your TSMPs in people (traditional storage method point people, or TSMPP). Who are your party members, those likeminded, trusted comrades who share your love of 100% real cheese? As you venture through the world, you and your party members will become living mobile Cheez-It storage points.

Humans are imperfect creatures (unlike Cheez, who is *“100% real cheese, 100% perfection,”* in his words). Humans get hungry, need to restore HP, or simply find themselves craving the irresistible goodness of Cheez-It crackers. It goes without saying this method requires the utmost level of trust. Cheez suggests collecting blackmail on your party members to avoid any betrayals. You’ll thank us later.

***NOTE:*** *This method requires friends.*

*Visuals: 3a Collect blackmail. 3b. Hungry human will resist eating Cheez-It due to blackmail 3b Cheez with blackmail*

**Tactical Plants:** What provides tactical cover and will not consume your delicious Cheez-It crackers? Greenery, foliage, shrubbery. It can all be optimized for Cheez-It inventory use. Much like how enemies will not see you if you duck behind even the sparsest sapling, they won’t notice your Cheez-it crackers either.  


Plants that are smaller than the dimensions of the box are recommended. Cheez-It is not responsible for any plants harmed in the creation of this IRL inventory, so please stash responsibly.

Cheez does not know how to keep a plant alive (are you sure you’re 100% perfect, Cheez?) He recommends using a fake plant to reduce guilt while increasing crunch.

*Visuals: 4a Cheez-It and an average house-plant. 4b Place box in plant. 4c Box seamlessly blends with plant.*

**Tactical Lamps:** See tactical plants, but replace with lamps.  
NOTE: Cheez, if you are reading this, please be careful of this method. We know what happened last time.

**Fashion a hat:**

-3 AG

+2 CH

Note that this will add a stat buff and debuff. Consider avoiding this method in situations that require increased agility: going to the gym, running away from a bear etc. Instead, try for activities like a date (NOTE: requires a date) or door to door salespersoning.

The benefits are not simply in charm alone. With just a bit of extra caution under low underpasses, this is a fantastic and reliable method to keep Cheez-It crackers close at all times.

This is Cheez’s favorite method. He’s been known to frequently wear hats, it is the article of clothing easiest (and most flattering) for him to wear. If he sees you wearing a hat with Cheez-It crackers, he will likely approach you and ask for a picture. He will even try to be your friend, causing a small, but much needed, social stat boost.

*Visuals: 5a Cheez in one of his many hats. 5b: WARNING: if hat is stylish, Cheez will approach.*

**Where you least expect it:** Element of surprise. On the shelf of a certain national library. In the fridge. Taped to a ceiling, in an air vent, in a clay pot, to be broken open with a “hi-yah!”

We can’t tell you where *you* would least expect to find Cheez-It crackers. That’s a personal journey.

**Small wheels and tether:**

- 5 Stealth

+1 luck

Attaching small wheels to the box of Cheez-It will allow it to be mobile (and cute). However, a rolling box of Cheez-It can and will draw attention, completely disrupting any stealthy activity. You might find the world is more giving to such childish whimsy, and you’ll find yourself in more conversations, with more quests, and receiving small gifts.

Disclaimer: Much like a shopping cart, one wheel is bound to be less spinny than the rest. If Cheez sees this inferior wheel, he will likely laugh at it (and you). If your social stat is high enough, this will not affect you. But words can hurt, especially when they’re from the Cheez-It brand mascot. Not sure how much lower it gets than that.

**Equip a box of Cheez-It at all times:** Use one of your equip slots, and hold a box of Cheez-It in one of your hands.

The true video game inventory is not achievable. This megathread is a testament to that. When it comes to the perfection of 100% real cheese, to avoid being taken, disrupted, or separated, the only surefire inventory method is within your hand(s).

**Conclusion**

As a valued Cheez-It enjoyer, we want to ensure you can enjoy Cheez-It wherever and whenever hunger strikes. We deeply apologize for being unable to defy the laws of the 3D world so you can conjure a box of Cheez-It out of thin air.

Cheez still holds on to hope.

To that precious wheel of 100% real cheese, who rolled into our hearts and overstayed his welcome, yes. One day, all this will be possible. We are tirelessly working towards a solution. We know it isn’t perfect, but we hope these methods will serve you, as we all wait for video game science to catch up to our appetites.

Nobody tell Cheez we are not working on this. It is truly impossible and will never happen.

&lt;p&gt;Note that this will add a stat buff and debuff. Consider avoiding this method in situations that require increased agility: going to the gym, running away from a bear etc. Instead, try for activities like a date (NOTE: requires a date) or door to door salespersoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits are not simply in charm alone. With just a bit of extra caution under low underpasses, this is a fantastic and reliable method to keep Cheez-It crackers close at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Cheez’s favorite method. He’s been known to frequently wear hats, it is the article of clothing easiest (and most flattering) for him to wear. If he sees you wearing a hat with Cheez-It crackers, he will likely approach you and ask for a picture. He will even try to be your friend, causing a small, but much needed, social stat boost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/jce6dvoy6gfc1.png?width=4334&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6920f314b474489abcdec3fbf418dbe86c5cb286""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/jce6dvoy6gfc1.png?width=4334&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6920f314b474489abcdec3fbf418dbe86c5cb286&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visuals: 5a Cheez in one of his many hats. 5b: WARNING: if hat is stylish, Cheez will approach.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where you least expect it:&lt;/strong&gt; Element of surprise. On the shelf of a certain national library. In the fridge. Taped to a ceiling, in an air vent, in a clay pot, to be broken open with a “hi-yah!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can’t tell you where &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; would least expect to find Cheez-It crackers. That’s a personal journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small wheels and tether:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 Stealth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;+1 luck&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attaching small wheels to the box of Cheez-It will allow it to be mobile (and cute). However, a rolling box of Cheez-It can and will draw attention, completely disrupting any stealthy activity. You might find the world is more giving to such childish whimsy, and you’ll find yourself in more conversations, with more quests, and receiving small gifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: Much like a shopping cart, one wheel is bound to be less spinny than the rest. If Cheez sees this inferior wheel, he will likely laugh at it (and you). If your social stat is high enough, this will not affect you. But words can hurt, especially when they’re from the Cheez-It brand mascot. Not sure how much lower it gets than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equip a box of Cheez-It at all times:&lt;/strong&gt; Use one of your equip slots, and hold a box of Cheez-It in one of your hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The true video game inventory is not achievable. This megathread is a testament to that. When it comes to the perfection of 100% real cheese, to avoid being taken, disrupted, or separated, the only surefire inventory method is within your hand(s).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a valued Cheez-It enjoyer, we want to ensure you can enjoy Cheez-It wherever and whenever hunger strikes. We deeply apologize for being unable to defy the laws of the 3D world so you can conjure a box of Cheez-It out of thin air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheez still holds on to hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that precious wheel of 100% real cheese, who rolled into our hearts and overstayed his welcome, yes. One day, all this will be possible. We are tirelessly working towards a solution. We know it isn’t perfect, but we hope these methods will serve you, as we all wait for video game science to catch up to our appetites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody tell Cheez we are not working on this. It is truly impossible and will never happen. We&amp;#39;re hoping he forgets about all this very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

**Hello J, it’s an incredible honor to have you with us. How are you today?**


Good Morning! It’s an Honor and a Pleasure to be asked for this interview- and it’s a great opportunity to connect with so many passionate flower people- both NEW or Seasoned… It’s definitely a Delight to be here… THANK You!


**We have some questions for you, our community will be extremely excited to hear your words.**


I’m excited to hear the questions- I love an interview- and I love sharing my passion for flowers…


**Occupying the position you do in our world of flowers and designs, are there any advices or warnings you would give to newcomers approaching the art?**


Let’s start with Advice- The Flower Industry- and sharing your Passion for Flowers- is “hard work”- but the good news- is that doing something you love- never really seems like work… so it can be easy- to spend every waking moment - with your NEW Found Passion- so remember to be cautious and not “Burn Out” your Passion! Set aside time and make room for ALL things YOU love- so that you don’t overdue it… A great quote I came across the other day- “what commands your attention- becomes your life”… as I read it (on my phone)- I realized how much time I spend on my phone… so I tossed my phone across the room… and went directly to the Flowers… because Flowers are what I want my life to be… Not a Phone, Not Social Media, Not Politics …but rather the “JOY that Flowers Bring”… so don’t lose yourself in attention-grabbing traps… instead - invest in what you want your life to become and involve! Be Mindful- to create a life outside your ‘work’… with Hobbies, Interest Friends, Family, Pets, and Enjoyable and distracting aligned Interests, Make time for getting away and for having Fun…
Heed my Warning… The Flower Industry is very competitive- and people love to compare things- or compete… Keep your attention - on yourself and your life- and your flowers- there are way too many “haters” out there- that will create distractions, competitions, or rude comments… - when you run across something that is distracting you- or engaging in something other than the kindness and joy- that we all seek and need… ‘delete it’ or Unfollow them- and move forward, around or away from those unpleasant distractions. Remember that “hurt people- hurt people”…. another favorite quote of mine!""


**Gen-Z whom I’ve noticed are taking particular interest in artistic career fields such as Floristy, are generally thought of to be extremely concerned with environmental health and wellbeing. In your view, how should we approach our practices now in insuring, sustainability and environmental health for our industry and for our future, Florists?**


This is really good news… because flowers offer such Incredible Health and Wellness Benefits- and that is what creating a Life in Bloom is all about… taking advantage of the natural and beautiful benefits that flowers provide. Having Flowers in our Lives- reduces depression- creates happier thoughts, helps us get better faster, makes us more creative- the list is Long- and Valuable… (complied at the link uBloom.com/research)

I’m so excited that Gen-Z and ALL Young people are looking for experiences- instead of stuff- and that includes the experience flowers can provide… What would happen if EVERYONE - was happier- and less depressed- and more creative… Flowers are powerful and we have that Flower Power in the palm of our hands… All of Us… No matter what generation we are… 

I wish our industry was less divisive- there is so much focus on creating Groups for certain ages or talents or skills… I wish we were more inclusive- and gathered together more to share ideas… there is such value in the creativity and optimism of youth… and equal value in the experience and knowledge of our elders… I want to talk to everyone and I want to share with everyone… Flowers are Joyful and Comforting… and we need to find Joy and Comfort and Kindness in each other! 


**It’s well known that you’ve been in our field your entire life. What are some of the most prominent changes you’ve observed in our industry over the decades?** 


One of the Most Prominent Changes- that is so disappointing- is the elimination of LIVE Education- that was sponsored by Industry Manufacturers- and Wholesale Florists- and Associations… thus a “dumbing down of our industry” is taking place that is very tragic… I used to attend Wholesale shows where there were 1200 florists- that were there for a day of learning, inspiration, motivation and most of all EDUCATION… sharing time and talent- and networking with each other…
Now our industry divides us by age- or talent- or association- or certification, or business type and we are missing the excitement and education benefits that every single person- no matter what their background- has to bring to the table… no matter their affiliation, skill level, age, association membership etc… I always created my education videos- so they were applicable to everyone- and that it wasn’t biased- newcomer- freelance designer, wedding or event specialist- old or young… education should be open and welcoming to everyone… and that is why I created my videos- and tried to be helpful, kind and inclusive in all my education endeavors…
Education for the Future was the whole reason we created uBloom.com and the many educational series (JTV, Fun with Flowers and J- and now- At Home with Flowers) and all the documentaries (CA Grown Experience, The Florida Fresh Tour, The Flowers of Columbia) we archive on uBloom - I saw this disconnection happening back in the early 2000’s and wanted to ensure that flower education remained available for future generations of florists, special event planners and flower enthusiasts!
Social Media is also a big change… I’m not fond of Social Media- it’s too often divisive and shocking- and self-absorbing… it’s generally not helpful on a day to day basis… and frankly I worry that it’s not psychologically healthy for humans, it’s not mindful- and for our industry it’s divisive and egotistical - but at this time in our world- it is a necessary evil for promotion and marketing… I makes me sad that anyone can make an uneducated post- and claim to be an expert- and even share inaccurate or harmful information without recourse… the model is broken- and I hope that Integrity, Honesty and Kindness will win out… someday- somehow…
I see so much bad behavior- when it comes to Flower Processing and Mechanics- and Flower Techniques- that are normalized- (and these are mistakes we made back in the 60s and 70s… )but because of the lack of education we have today in the Flower Industry -future generations are destined to make the mistakes over again… because we have abandoned education…and anyone can create the impression of an expert- on social media…
Whew! that’s a lot to take in… Let me be More Productive and turn my Attention and talk about the changes that I LOVE seeing on Social Media…
I LOVE Pretty Flowers- and Love Seeing Pretty Flowers- and Love Seeing the Growers that Produce Pretty Flower… I love seeing Pretty flowers arranged well…
(I don’t enjoy- poorly designed arrangements of Pretty Flowers— though) I wish I saw more processes or concepts that show regard and dedication to longevity (safety) of Flowers… rather than flowers that are created to shock- incite, or create reaction… I’m not a reality TV fan at all… and I’m not a reality FLOWER Fan either…
I love that we are all Part of a Greater Global Flower Industry- that we can have Hydrangea- any day of the year, for example… and that flowers are grown all over the world- and there are more flowers today than every before- different types, colors, variety- so much more… and that is because we are a global industry and we can access those flowers- and bring the joy of flowers to anyone - anywhere…
I love that flowers have become mainstream- (this was caused by the pandemic)… suddenly people were disconnecting - staying home- out of contact… but then there was this inspired fascination with flowers- (I like to think our Public Television- all Access - no Cost Show- that anyone could watch- and Millions did… helped in this outcome) and people suddenly became aware that Flowers make us feel good- they bring us joy- they reduce depression… this is the exact result that a myriad of Flower Studies prove (thank you Society of American Florists for investing in these studies- and God Bless Dr. Haviland Jones)… and suddenly Flower Sales were off the charts- people were buying and enjoying flowers- and Flowers became a mainstay - for home health, peace, joy, inspiration, creativity… It was magical and still is today!
I love- that Kelly and I have created “Life in Bloom” and that we all collectively have a National Television Show- about Cut Flowers- the first of it’s kind- that simply enforces the Health and Wellness benefits of flowers… with it’s 6th Season coming soon and a total of 81 episodes -with 5 Permanent National Time Slots- and over 98 Million Viewers every week… This is Groundbreaking- and it mainstreams CUT FLOWERS- just like Garden Shows mainstream Gardening- and Cooking Shows mainstream cooking… You get the idea… and I’m thankful and grateful for CalFlowers, Albertsons Companies, Holland American Flowers, Passion Roses, and Suntory Flowers- for helping us keep that show on the Air… it makes a huge difference that the General Public is inspired to keep Flowers front and center! 


**What is the most funny/humorous event you’ve witnessed in your time in the floral industry?**


That’s a tough Question… I’ve seen many funny things… and enjoyed many funny people… and had many funny experiences… hmmmmm…I think that Humor can be subjective- and what may have been hilarious at one moment- may not be hysterical today…
Kel and I laugh constantly… we find humor is so many places… and Laughter, Love, Kindness and Gratitude are a way of life for us… so - back to your question…
Haskel Eargle - was the funniest man in the flower industry… he was always funny- and made me laugh constantly whenever we talked or visited… I believe that we should find humor in everything we do … Laughing everyday is important… you know the old adage… “Laughter is the best medicine”- My grandfather Carnation Joe had a saying… “When you lay your head on the pillow at night- take inventory! Did you learn something new today? Did you Laugh Today? If the answer is “NO” to either of those questions… Get Back up- Your Day isn’t over!”…
My advice- laugh everyday- the value of laughter and humor - makes you a better - happier person… ""


**We live in a world of coming and going trends, how have you managed to stay on or even ahead of trend over the years?**


I think the secret behind ‘seeing a trend’ is paying attention to what is happening in our world- and how people react to the thing you have discovered! … Trends are supported by what people (all people) are paying attention to… and more importantly - what people are loving and buying into…
(reminder of my earlier quote- “What occupies our attention- becomes our life”… -so what is garnering attention may become a trend… very easily!)
I would like to offer this kind advice…
NO ONE CAN MAKE UP A TREND!- Trends have to be observed, identified, and then you can address or take advantage of them. No one can create them by simply stating -“ I think this should be a Trend…”
or more accurately- “This is WHAT I AM GOING TO MAKE A TREND”… that is the biggest delusion!
Our industry tries to hard to “make trends happen” - even of things like the NEW COLOR OF THE YEAR… just because someone says this is the COLOR of the YEAR- that doesn’t make it popular… I believe the Color of the Year is a HOPE- and a Prayer- that this Color will go WILD!
There have been plenty of Colors of the Year- that never made it to mainstream… or became popular… just look at the history! As an example - Did the 2016 Colors (another gimmick-2 colors not one!) light blue and pink really turn up everywhere? They did not and it just created confusion!
It’s also interesting to note- that once the Color is announced- it’s usually not in the market yet- and everyone (manufacturers) have to start producing things in that color… it’s not already in our everyday lifestyle!
Now- to be clear- there are already colors that are in the marketplace- and that means those colors are ALREADY available… those colors have a much better chance of being Trendy- than something that is announced pre-manufacturer level - to be or become a trend…
Great Example- Barbie- the movie- Up for Best Picture- It made everyone go crazy for Pink… but PINK was already in the marketplace in lots of shades, tints and tones- and when the movie became successful- pink was poised and ready to be POPULAR… it’s a great Example and good food for thought!
So to answer Your Question- I pay attention to what people are loving, enjoying, buying- and “paying attention to”… that is where the next trend lies … So… my advice - Pay Attention, Observe, Identify and then react to the Trend!


**And what are some of your favorite design trends you’ve seen or created?**


My Favorite Trend- is “FLOWERS” - and how they have become mainstream with the consumer public! It was not always the case, unfortunately - so let’s keep it going! It also reinforces the trend- when we realize how Flowers can calm us, comfort us, bring us joy, reduce depression, reduce arguments, enlarge our circles of friends…
“The Power of Flowers” - is my Favorite Trend… because flowers are my life… and I pay attention to them… and so do millions of other people… Everyone Loves Flowers… it’s not a specific flower… but Flowers in General- People love Flowers and Flowers bring us Joy! 


**You’re a person that many look up to in our world, you’re a hero to some. Who are some of your design heroes?**


Thank you for that kind statement… I assume you mean “Flower” design heroes… and I’ll address it from that standpoint- even though some of my heroes are not from the world of flowers…
I have to say that I am an amalgamation of many designers and design styles- So Many people have affected the way I design and how I enjoy flowers- and thus they have become a part of me… and their influence brings me joy… so if that is a definition of a design hero… the list will be long…
My Flower Design “Influence” Heroes… Haskell Eargle… Mandy Majerik… Joe Smith …Bill Harper… Phil Rulloda…Eddie VonBargen…Mel Resendiz… My Dad- Mel Schwanke… Matt Wood… Mari Ignatowski… Talmage McLaurin… Cliff Mann… Bobbi Ecker-Blatchford… But then other Heroes- start to influence my life- and the way I present flowers… My Husband - Kelly Blank… Bob Ross… Mr Rogers… My Grandpa Carnation Joe…My Nanny- Dorothy Swanson…Pat Doyle… to name a few… You may not even know some of these people… but they all played very Heroic Parts in my life- Many still do- others were there for a reason or a season… none-the-less they are all HEROES and they all influence my Flowers!
Although - I have to state… there are also viewers, followers and fans that send in arrangements they have made that were inspired by my TV Show- and they are ALSO huge design heroes to me as well… and their style influences me too… 


**The industry and art seem to be accelerating in a different direction than before the year 2000. What impacts do you think social media and new tech has had on our art form?**


This is going to take “a minute” Thomas- as it’s a very complex question…
First of all when it comes to art and flowers- and how they intertwine… I want to talk about “ART in BLOOM” the interactive event created by the Boston Museum of Fine Art- over half a century ago… where local flower artists are invited to come into an art museum and are allowed to interpret a piece of art through flowers… I love that project- and I love seeing Flower Designers interpret a Piece of Art through Flowers… I think that is magnificent, magical, inspiring and thought provoking…
Art is subjective and thus- not every art form is appreciated by everyone… that is an important factor when we start to discuss ART- and Flowers…
“One man’s junk is another man’s art”… is a quote that is very meaningful- and again- the quote is also subjective…
Personally- I love pretty flowers- I enjoy arranging flowers… I LOVE-ADORE- and LIVE FOR Color… Color and Flowers is my thing… I think that color combinations are an art form as well… but again it’s subjective too… so Art is Subjective… I was trained in Ikenoba (a style or form of Ikebana) flower design in Japan- and my parents insisted that I learn that Art form as a young man (age 18)… so I could incorporate that into my design style- that was a huge blessing- and I am inspired by Ikebana- and Japanese Flower Design to this day…
I have great respect for any Artist- that creates Art- from the ether… Art is magical and Artists are Magical- Inspired and sometimes troubled… Van Gogh is a good example - great artist- amazing art- extremely troubled!
To that End… I hate AI- Artificial Intelligence and the fascination it occupies on social media. I think AI is dangerous- and AI degrades our respect for Art and Artists- Stephen Hawking warned us all that AI would be death of humankind… I think his warning is VERY IMPORTANT and Grave… I say this because I want you to know that I stand for ARTISTS- and their practice- and know and appreciate their value- and Talent!
Remember- I’m not fond of Social Media- I will honestly admit that… as I think it gave ANYONE the ability to share their opinion- and not have to defend it… people are mean on social media and have not accountability - that is what I dislike MOST about Social Media… Anyone can say mean things to anyone and not have to suffer the repercussions… Valerie Bertinelli came forward and made us all aware of this… She is a Hero of Mine as well!
I don’t appreciate that anyone can be portrayed as an Expert or ARTIST on Social Media- there is no vetting process… and that REALITY- SHOCK- are King on Social Media… I wish there was more kindness- and comfort on Social Media- that is why Kelly and I ALWAYS POST Flowers- on Social Media! We both believe that flowers offer Kindness, Comfort and Calm… and occasionally education.
I Strongly believe in the IMPORTANCE of knowing and embracing the Elements and Principles of Flower Design- I think there is merit to Line, Form, Balance, Color, Rhythm, Texture… the list goes on… You can only fully ‘break the rules” of design- by Understanding, Knowing and Practicing them… and I also believe that Flowers- are in themselves “Pretty” - however these Flowers are not always arranged in a Pretty fashion- (where attention has NOT been paid to the elements and principles of flower design - and in fact are poorly or unattractively arranged- without attention) Sometimes- these poorly arranged flowers are then claimed to be ART… to distract from the fact that they are not properly arranged or attractive- and I don’t find joy in that!
And I shall return to my original statement- “I believe that ALL Art is subjective” - even when it comes to flowers… Art is typically sold… and thus appreciated- I love watching the Antiques Roadshow - and seeing how Art Appreciates or Depreciates… it’s fascinating… Flowers are perishable… so they aren’t mean to hang on a wall for years like an oil painting or reside on a table like a bronze statue…
So… Flower Art is perishable (for the most part) and I don’t know if it’s advantageous for Florists to Create Flower Art for the masses… Many Times Flower Art- like what we see at the World Cup Competition- takes TIME… and it’s perishable- and I often question- if World Cup Art is salable… (that is not a requirement for the World Cup Competition to be clear) … but I wonder what the everyday flower consumer - thinks of flowers at that level… do they get it? Do they like it - and most of all - would they be willing to PAY for what it would cost- both in Labor, Hard Goods and Flower Quantities and Types? That doesn’t mean it’s not beautiful- but there is a definite line between Pretty Flowers that we put for Sale (and Hopefully Sell) and Flower ART for art’s sake.

Personally- What J finds interest in- are attainable - salable- comfortable- and MOST IMPORTANTLY - Beautiful Flowers… that is my very own very personal and subjective preference… so I don’t know if it’s fair - for me to say what I like and don’t like when it comes to Flower Art … because my opinion is subjective…
I do however hate that Social Media allows anyone who creates flowers to post anything they make and claim it Flower art… I don’t like or need to see so many things I see on Social Media… thus- a call back- to what I said before- I enjoy tossing my phone aside and heading into the garden, or the local flower sellers cooler for my flowers to arrange- visiting a farmers market, cooking a dinner, or petting my dogs… All these things thrill me and I love and enjoy them.


**If I bestowed you with three wishes you could use on the world of flowers and floristry, what would you wish for us?**


1. The Ability to Sell more Flowers to More People More Often- (without limit)… This would allow EVERYONE to Enjoy More Flowers- More Often … and allow Growers to Grow with Wild Abandon- Flower Sellers to Sell with Wild Abandon- and Consumers to Buy Flowers- with Wild Abandon… What a World that would be! SIGH… 

2. The Ability for all Flower People- (Designers, Enthusiasts, Sales People, Managers, Owners, Employees) to be Kind, Comforting, Inspiring and Loving toward Ourselves, Others- and the Entire Industry… (I feel this is a concealed Wish for World Peace- honestly) 

3. An Unending Revenue Stream for FLOWER EDUCATIONAL EVENTS- to benefit both Past Present and Future Florists… This would allow us to learn from one another- past present and future- and Move Forward with Success, Positivity and Joy… 


**Many of us have a favorite design style or a style at least that we are most comfortable in. Out of all the different styles of Floral Design that exist which ones are your favorites?**


Pretty Flowers (FIRST and FOREMOST) - arranged in a comfortable, calming style that incites Joy and Kindness - (I love Creative Naturalism— mixed with color and texture)  This is best achieved by mixing a little Haskell Eargle, Bill Harper, Matt Wood, and Joe Smith with Pretty Flowers and Foliage… 

You have this is your design style, sir. In looking at your instagram account- you embrace color- and pretty flowers…you do it VERY VERY WELL! 

If I had to PICK my Favorite- and Most Important Element or Principle of Flower Design Style- it would be COLOR- I think it’s so effective- and helps us “Turn our Feelings into Flowers” in a very memorable and eye-catching way! 


**Florists in the millennial generation will probably look back at the pandemic as a particularly trying time for the floral industry.**


I hope you will allow me to address this statement first… I will ALWAYS look back on the pandemic as the TIME that Flowers became Necessary for EVERYONE- it was one of the largest and most profitable times in the flower industry… and the CONSUMER PUBLIC became graphically and personally aware of the POSITIVE Health and Wellness Benefits of Cut Flowers… It is possibly one of the MOST IMPORTANT times for the Flower Industry Bar None! It was a gift the universe gave to the Flower Industry… In my Opinion… 


**Are there any other times before that you can remember that were also especially difficult or uncertain?**


So this is another interesting fact… during the great Depression… My Grandfather was running our family flower shop in Nebraska… and while everyone else was struggling- he noticed that flowers were becoming an “affordable luxury-“ - and that people were realizing that flowers made them feel better… so my Grandfather- was becoming very busy at the flower shop (actually doing ok financially)… because people were finding-  .05 - .10 - or .15 cents to spend on a simple bunch of flowers- to put in the house to make everyone feel better… so the Infamous Great Depression- that downturn or struggle- was somehow ALSO providing a beneficial time for flowers… florists, flower growers and sellers…

Thus- In my opinion- downturns- or difficult times- provide a unique and positive opportunity for flowers…and Florists-  and thus- I feel that FLOWER POWER is a real thing and it’s something very important for us to remember- as times get tough- FLORISTS- get TOUGHER- and Bring on the Flower Power! 


**What’s your favorite flower of all time?**


That’s a Super Difficult Question… I can’t narrow it to one Flower… I will apologize- I have a Group of Flowers- I can always depend on to bring me joy- here they are in no particular order… 

As a Broad Flower Variety- I love Carnations Most of All… It’s a Family thing too… We Grew Carnations in my families greenhouses- and my Grandpa and Father always wore a Red Carnation… I love how they are en vogue again… and that there are new colors, varieties, shapes, styles and texture… I love the clove smell of a carnation...I Love mini-carnations and Standard Carnations… Carnations are so long lasting… I love them… 

I Love Gardenias- there is nothing better than going to sleep or awakening to the smell of gardenias… and thus I love Stemmed Gardenias that can be arranged in a vase… like the ones that High Camp Supply sells… those are amazing… 

I Love the smell of Freesia Too… Yellow Freesia used to have the best smell… but these days there is a rusty brown colored one- that has an incredible intense fun- fruity smell… I always joke that Fressia’s Smell like Froot Loops… 

Zinnias- I adore Zinnias- and I especially love the Queeny Lime Variety- that is green with rose and orange overtones… it’s in the Cinderella Variety Expanse… I love arranging Zinnias- all summer long- it’s a joy… and they make me happy! 

Roses- I love Roses that smell like Roses… Helga Piaget, Yves Piaget, Sweet Moments, in my world… I love a Rose that smells like a classic rose... That is what makes life wonderful- when Roses have a Rose Fragrance… 

And finally- I have to offer the famous Quote from Claude Monet “ I must always have flowers- always and always!”… So it really doesn’t matter… as long as there are flowers- I will be happy! 


**What do you hope to see from the floral industry in the future?**


I hope to always see Pretty Flowers… I hope to see kinder, gentler and less division in our Flower Industry- I hope to see a resurgence and priority put on education! I hope to see the consumers interest and consumption of flowers- continue to grow- unceasingly…  Flower Power Forever!


**Many films and TV shows include floristry in their set designs, are there any films or TV shows you can think of that included Florist particularly well?**


This reminds me of a funny idiosyncrasy of mine… I always See the Flowers in a Film or TV… I can’t help but see them… and I critic them… MOST COMMONLY on availability… I watched a movie set in the 1950’s about Truman Capote - it was a wonderful period piece - and they had a Single Alstroemeria in a vase on a table… and I thought (and brought to everyone’s attention) that Alstroemerias had NOT yet been discovered nor would they have been commercially available at that time… and I couldn’t stop talking about it… 

Kel jokes that - it’s an annoying habit I have… I had similar reactions to the flowers- that were created for “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel … style and flower type were not always correct for the period of time… ALTHOUGH they were GORGEOUS and I loved seeing them… They were Pretty Flowers- but not always historically accurate. I still love that series- and I loved EVERY SINGLE SECOND…  and I loves seeing flowers added so profusely to the series… My Crew thought I should write a letter and offer to the be flower consultant!

I think I would be remiss- if I didn’t include “ J Schwanke’s Life in Bloom” on Public Television! I believe it represents Floristry Very Well… and encourages anyone to include flowers in their life at every/any avenue… Flowers become accessible to everyone- and they are brought back into every situation… that is something that I am very proud of… and also why I think the show is so beloved by our viewers! 


**Who’s your favorite author, painter, musician, and film director?**


My Favorite Author: David Sedaris- Brilliant and Laugh Out Loud Funny!
My Favorite Painter: Mary Blair - American Artist and Animator- for Walt Disney- Her concept art is amazing… I hope to own one - someday!
My Favorite Musician: Joey DeFrancesco- American Jazz Organist (and Trumpeter) but I’m in love with Hammond Jazz Organ Music… 
My Favorite Film Director: I don’t really follow directors… I enjoy all kinds of movies- and I don’t group them by Director… I look at the content - and when I love it… I can admire the director of that film… 


**Final question, what is your most cherished flower related memory?**


I think it has to be the wisdom and advice of Mrs. Jan Therien - from Fremont Nebraska, my High School Guidance Counselor… When I was a Junior in High School - had a meeting with Jan - to decide what I was going to do with my life… what career I was going to pursue to ensure- that I would be on the road to success and also have the classes needed to follow my dream…  here’s how the dialog went… 

Jan: What do you want to be when you graduate from school?
J: A Zookeeper (I always have and still do have an inordinate love and ultimate fascination with animals- and especially Zoological Parks and Zoo Animals)
Jan: Really???- Well- you know how difficult that will be- as you have to become a doctor of Zoology- that means BIOLOGY… CHEMISTRY, PHYSICS, 
and MATH- You realize how you are presently doing in those courses- and that you don’t do well in those studies- You do better in the Fine Arts… 
Drama, Art … and it’s going to be a lot of hard work and studying… and If I may be frank… You seem to be kind of lazy… 
J: (Not Surprised… I was Lazy- and Hated Math and Studying… Let’s be honest… I get it and Jan knew me well) … Well… then what do YOU think I 
should do???
Jan: You’re a 4th Generation Florist- You know more about Flowers- than Anyone I know- ALREADY- without even studying- YOU love flowers
and You could be a great florist- without much effort… I think that might be a good thing - Join your family business and become a Florist… arranging
flowers- creating window displays- running your family flower business- seems like a good idea to me… What do you think????
J: Sounds like a Great Plan… 

And Here we are today… I have a National TV Show about Flowers- that reaches 98 Million People every day- I have a successful website and series of videos that have educated florists around the world- in the art of Floristry- I love Flowers- and I Love what I do… and Jan Therien- is in my Opinion- the Greatest High School Guidance Counselor of All TIME… she gave it to me straight… and I became a Blooming Success!",t2_vco17364,False,,0,False,🌹💐🌸 As Promised!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hello J, it’s an incredible honor to have you with us. How are you today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good Morning! It’s an Honor and a Pleasure to be asked for this interview- and it’s a great opportunity to connect with so many passionate flower people- both NEW or Seasoned… It’s definitely a Delight to be here… THANK You!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have some questions for you, our community will be extremely excited to hear your words.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m excited to hear the questions- I love an interview- and I love sharing my passion for flowers…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupying the position you do in our world of flowers and designs, are there any advices or warnings you would give to newcomers approaching the art?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with Advice- The Flower Industry- and sharing your Passion for Flowers- is “hard work”- but the good news- is that doing something you love- never really seems like work… so it can be easy- to spend every waking moment - with your NEW Found Passion- so remember to be cautious and not “Burn Out” your Passion! Set aside time and make room for ALL things YOU love- so that you don’t overdue it… A great quote I came across the other day- “what commands your attention- becomes your life”… as I read it (on my phone)- I realized how much time I spend on my phone… so I tossed my phone across the room… and went directly to the Flowers… because Flowers are what I want my life to be… Not a Phone, Not Social Media, Not Politics …but rather the “JOY that Flowers Bring”… so don’t lose yourself in attention-grabbing traps… instead - invest in what you want your life to become and involve! Be Mindful- to create a life outside your ‘work’… with Hobbies, Interest Friends, Family, Pets, and Enjoyable and distracting aligned Interests, Make time for getting away and for having Fun…
Heed my Warning… The Flower Industry is very competitive- and people love to compare things- or compete… Keep your attention - on yourself and your life- and your flowers- there are way too many “haters” out there- that will create distractions, competitions, or rude comments… - when you run across something that is distracting you- or engaging in something other than the kindness and joy- that we all seek and need… ‘delete it’ or Unfollow them- and move forward, around or away from those unpleasant distractions. Remember that “hurt people- hurt people”…. another favorite quote of mine!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen-Z whom I’ve noticed are taking particular interest in artistic career fields such as Floristy, are generally thought of to be extremely concerned with environmental health and wellbeing. In your view, how should we approach our practices now in insuring, sustainability and environmental health for our industry and for our future, Florists?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is really good news… because flowers offer such Incredible Health and Wellness Benefits- and that is what creating a Life in Bloom is all about… taking advantage of the natural and beautiful benefits that flowers provide. Having Flowers in our Lives- reduces depression- creates happier thoughts, helps us get better faster, makes us more creative- the list is Long- and Valuable… (complied at the link uBloom.com/research)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so excited that Gen-Z and ALL Young people are looking for experiences- instead of stuff- and that includes the experience flowers can provide… What would happen if EVERYONE - was happier- and less depressed- and more creative… Flowers are powerful and we have that Flower Power in the palm of our hands… All of Us… No matter what generation we are… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish our industry was less divisive- there is so much focus on creating Groups for certain ages or talents or skills… I wish we were more inclusive- and gathered together more to share ideas… there is such value in the creativity and optimism of youth… and equal value in the experience and knowledge of our elders… I want to talk to everyone and I want to share with everyone… Flowers are Joyful and Comforting… and we need to find Joy and Comfort and Kindness in each other! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s well known that you’ve been in our field your entire life. What are some of the most prominent changes you’ve observed in our industry over the decades?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the Most Prominent Changes- that is so disappointing- is the elimination of LIVE Education- that was sponsored by Industry Manufacturers- and Wholesale Florists- and Associations… thus a “dumbing down of our industry” is taking place that is very tragic… I used to attend Wholesale shows where there were 1200 florists- that were there for a day of learning, inspiration, motivation and most of all EDUCATION… sharing time and talent- and networking with each other…
Now our industry divides us by age- or talent- or association- or certification, or business type and we are missing the excitement and education benefits that every single person- no matter what their background- has to bring to the table… no matter their affiliation, skill level, age, association membership etc… I always created my education videos- so they were applicable to everyone- and that it wasn’t biased- newcomer- freelance designer, wedding or event specialist- old or young… education should be open and welcoming to everyone… and that is why I created my videos- and tried to be helpful, kind and inclusive in all my education endeavors…
Education for the Future was the whole reason we created uBloom.com and the many educational series (JTV, Fun with Flowers and J- and now- At Home with Flowers) and all the documentaries (CA Grown Experience, The Florida Fresh Tour, The Flowers of Columbia) we archive on uBloom - I saw this disconnection happening back in the early 2000’s and wanted to ensure that flower education remained available for future generations of florists, special event planners and flower enthusiasts!
Social Media is also a big change… I’m not fond of Social Media- it’s too often divisive and shocking- and self-absorbing… it’s generally not helpful on a day to day basis… and frankly I worry that it’s not psychologically healthy for humans, it’s not mindful- and for our industry it’s divisive and egotistical - but at this time in our world- it is a necessary evil for promotion and marketing… I makes me sad that anyone can make an uneducated post- and claim to be an expert- and even share inaccurate or harmful information without recourse… the model is broken- and I hope that Integrity, Honesty and Kindness will win out… someday- somehow…
I see so much bad behavior- when it comes to Flower Processing and Mechanics- and Flower Techniques- that are normalized- (and these are mistakes we made back in the 60s and 70s… )but because of the lack of education we have today in the Flower Industry -future generations are destined to make the mistakes over again… because we have abandoned education…and anyone can create the impression of an expert- on social media…
Whew! that’s a lot to take in… Let me be More Productive and turn my Attention and talk about the changes that I LOVE seeing on Social Media…
I LOVE Pretty Flowers- and Love Seeing Pretty Flowers- and Love Seeing the Growers that Produce Pretty Flower… I love seeing Pretty flowers arranged well…
(I don’t enjoy- poorly designed arrangements of Pretty Flowers— though) I wish I saw more processes or concepts that show regard and dedication to longevity (safety) of Flowers… rather than flowers that are created to shock- incite, or create reaction… I’m not a reality TV fan at all… and I’m not a reality FLOWER Fan either…
I love that we are all Part of a Greater Global Flower Industry- that we can have Hydrangea- any day of the year, for example… and that flowers are grown all over the world- and there are more flowers today than every before- different types, colors, variety- so much more… and that is because we are a global industry and we can access those flowers- and bring the joy of flowers to anyone - anywhere…
I love that flowers have become mainstream- (this was caused by the pandemic)… suddenly people were disconnecting - staying home- out of contact… but then there was this inspired fascination with flowers- (I like to think our Public Television- all Access - no Cost Show- that anyone could watch- and Millions did… helped in this outcome) and people suddenly became aware that Flowers make us feel good- they bring us joy- they reduce depression… this is the exact result that a myriad of Flower Studies prove (thank you Society of American Florists for investing in these studies- and God Bless Dr. Haviland Jones)… and suddenly Flower Sales were off the charts- people were buying and enjoying flowers- and Flowers became a mainstay - for home health, peace, joy, inspiration, creativity… It was magical and still is today!
I love- that Kelly and I have created “Life in Bloom” and that we all collectively have a National Television Show- about Cut Flowers- the first of it’s kind- that simply enforces the Health and Wellness benefits of flowers… with it’s 6th Season coming soon and a total of 81 episodes -with 5 Permanent National Time Slots- and over 98 Million Viewers every week… This is Groundbreaking- and it mainstreams CUT FLOWERS- just like Garden Shows mainstream Gardening- and Cooking Shows mainstream cooking… You get the idea… and I’m thankful and grateful for CalFlowers, Albertsons Companies, Holland American Flowers, Passion Roses, and Suntory Flowers- for helping us keep that show on the Air… it makes a huge difference that the General Public is inspired to keep Flowers front and center! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the most funny/humorous event you’ve witnessed in your time in the floral industry?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a tough Question… I’ve seen many funny things… and enjoyed many funny people… and had many funny experiences… hmmmmm…I think that Humor can be subjective- and what may have been hilarious at one moment- may not be hysterical today…
Kel and I laugh constantly… we find humor is so many places… and Laughter, Love, Kindness and Gratitude are a way of life for us… so - back to your question…
Haskel Eargle - was the funniest man in the flower industry… he was always funny- and made me laugh constantly whenever we talked or visited… I believe that we should find humor in everything we do … Laughing everyday is important… you know the old adage… “Laughter is the best medicine”- My grandfather Carnation Joe had a saying… “When you lay your head on the pillow at night- take inventory! Did you learn something new today? Did you Laugh Today? If the answer is “NO” to either of those questions… Get Back up- Your Day isn’t over!”…
My advice- laugh everyday- the value of laughter and humor - makes you a better - happier person… &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We live in a world of coming and going trends, how have you managed to stay on or even ahead of trend over the years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the secret behind ‘seeing a trend’ is paying attention to what is happening in our world- and how people react to the thing you have discovered! … Trends are supported by what people (all people) are paying attention to… and more importantly - what people are loving and buying into…
(reminder of my earlier quote- “What occupies our attention- becomes our life”… -so what is garnering attention may become a trend… very easily!)
I would like to offer this kind advice…
NO ONE CAN MAKE UP A TREND!- Trends have to be observed, identified, and then you can address or take advantage of them. No one can create them by simply stating -“ I think this should be a Trend…”
or more accurately- “This is WHAT I AM GOING TO MAKE A TREND”… that is the biggest delusion!
Our industry tries to hard to “make trends happen” - even of things like the NEW COLOR OF THE YEAR… just because someone says this is the COLOR of the YEAR- that doesn’t make it popular… I believe the Color of the Year is a HOPE- and a Prayer- that this Color will go WILD!
There have been plenty of Colors of the Year- that never made it to mainstream… or became popular… just look at the history! As an example - Did the 2016 Colors (another gimmick-2 colors not one!) light blue and pink really turn up everywhere? They did not and it just created confusion!
It’s also interesting to note- that once the Color is announced- it’s usually not in the market yet- and everyone (manufacturers) have to start producing things in that color… it’s not already in our everyday lifestyle!
Now- to be clear- there are already colors that are in the marketplace- and that means those colors are ALREADY available… those colors have a much better chance of being Trendy- than something that is announced pre-manufacturer level - to be or become a trend…
Great Example- Barbie- the movie- Up for Best Picture- It made everyone go crazy for Pink… but PINK was already in the marketplace in lots of shades, tints and tones- and when the movie became successful- pink was poised and ready to be POPULAR… it’s a great Example and good food for thought!
So to answer Your Question- I pay attention to what people are loving, enjoying, buying- and “paying attention to”… that is where the next trend lies … So… my advice - Pay Attention, Observe, Identify and then react to the Trend!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And what are some of your favorite design trends you’ve seen or created?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Favorite Trend- is “FLOWERS” - and how they have become mainstream with the consumer public! It was not always the case, unfortunately - so let’s keep it going! It also reinforces the trend- when we realize how Flowers can calm us, comfort us, bring us joy, reduce depression, reduce arguments, enlarge our circles of friends…
“The Power of Flowers” - is my Favorite Trend… because flowers are my life… and I pay attention to them… and so do millions of other people… Everyone Loves Flowers… it’s not a specific flower… but Flowers in General- People love Flowers and Flowers bring us Joy! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re a person that many look up to in our world, you’re a hero to some. Who are some of your design heroes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for that kind statement… I assume you mean “Flower” design heroes… and I’ll address it from that standpoint- even though some of my heroes are not from the world of flowers…
I have to say that I am an amalgamation of many designers and design styles- So Many people have affected the way I design and how I enjoy flowers- and thus they have become a part of me… and their influence brings me joy… so if that is a definition of a design hero… the list will be long…
My Flower Design “Influence” Heroes… Haskell Eargle… Mandy Majerik… Joe Smith …Bill Harper… Phil Rulloda…Eddie VonBargen…Mel Resendiz… My Dad- Mel Schwanke… Matt Wood… Mari Ignatowski… Talmage McLaurin… Cliff Mann… Bobbi Ecker-Blatchford… But then other Heroes- start to influence my life- and the way I present flowers… My Husband - Kelly Blank… Bob Ross… Mr Rogers… My Grandpa Carnation Joe…My Nanny- Dorothy Swanson…Pat Doyle… to name a few… You may not even know some of these people… but they all played very Heroic Parts in my life- Many still do- others were there for a reason or a season… none-the-less they are all HEROES and they all influence my Flowers!
Although - I have to state… there are also viewers, followers and fans that send in arrangements they have made that were inspired by my TV Show- and they are ALSO huge design heroes to me as well… and their style influences me too… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The industry and art seem to be accelerating in a different direction than before the year 2000. What impacts do you think social media and new tech has had on our art form?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is going to take “a minute” Thomas- as it’s a very complex question…
First of all when it comes to art and flowers- and how they intertwine… I want to talk about “ART in BLOOM” the interactive event created by the Boston Museum of Fine Art- over half a century ago… where local flower artists are invited to come into an art museum and are allowed to interpret a piece of art through flowers… I love that project- and I love seeing Flower Designers interpret a Piece of Art through Flowers… I think that is magnificent, magical, inspiring and thought provoking…
Art is subjective and thus- not every art form is appreciated by everyone… that is an important factor when we start to discuss ART- and Flowers…
“One man’s junk is another man’s art”… is a quote that is very meaningful- and again- the quote is also subjective…
Personally- I love pretty flowers- I enjoy arranging flowers… I LOVE-ADORE- and LIVE FOR Color… Color and Flowers is my thing… I think that color combinations are an art form as well… but again it’s subjective too… so Art is Subjective… I was trained in Ikenoba (a style or form of Ikebana) flower design in Japan- and my parents insisted that I learn that Art form as a young man (age 18)… so I could incorporate that into my design style- that was a huge blessing- and I am inspired by Ikebana- and Japanese Flower Design to this day…
I have great respect for any Artist- that creates Art- from the ether… Art is magical and Artists are Magical- Inspired and sometimes troubled… Van Gogh is a good example - great artist- amazing art- extremely troubled!
To that End… I hate AI- Artificial Intelligence and the fascination it occupies on social media. I think AI is dangerous- and AI degrades our respect for Art and Artists- Stephen Hawking warned us all that AI would be death of humankind… I think his warning is VERY IMPORTANT and Grave… I say this because I want you to know that I stand for ARTISTS- and their practice- and know and appreciate their value- and Talent!
Remember- I’m not fond of Social Media- I will honestly admit that… as I think it gave ANYONE the ability to share their opinion- and not have to defend it… people are mean on social media and have not accountability - that is what I dislike MOST about Social Media… Anyone can say mean things to anyone and not have to suffer the repercussions… Valerie Bertinelli came forward and made us all aware of this… She is a Hero of Mine as well!
I don’t appreciate that anyone can be portrayed as an Expert or ARTIST on Social Media- there is no vetting process… and that REALITY- SHOCK- are King on Social Media… I wish there was more kindness- and comfort on Social Media- that is why Kelly and I ALWAYS POST Flowers- on Social Media! We both believe that flowers offer Kindness, Comfort and Calm… and occasionally education.
I Strongly believe in the IMPORTANCE of knowing and embracing the Elements and Principles of Flower Design- I think there is merit to Line, Form, Balance, Color, Rhythm, Texture… the list goes on… You can only fully ‘break the rules” of design- by Understanding, Knowing and Practicing them… and I also believe that Flowers- are in themselves “Pretty” - however these Flowers are not always arranged in a Pretty fashion- (where attention has NOT been paid to the elements and principles of flower design - and in fact are poorly or unattractively arranged- without attention) Sometimes- these poorly arranged flowers are then claimed to be ART… to distract from the fact that they are not properly arranged or attractive- and I don’t find joy in that!
And I shall return to my original statement- “I believe that ALL Art is subjective” - even when it comes to flowers… Art is typically sold… and thus appreciated- I love watching the Antiques Roadshow - and seeing how Art Appreciates or Depreciates… it’s fascinating… Flowers are perishable… so they aren’t mean to hang on a wall for years like an oil painting or reside on a table like a bronze statue…
So… Flower Art is perishable (for the most part) and I don’t know if it’s advantageous for Florists to Create Flower Art for the masses… Many Times Flower Art- like what we see at the World Cup Competition- takes TIME… and it’s perishable- and I often question- if World Cup Art is salable… (that is not a requirement for the World Cup Competition to be clear) … but I wonder what the everyday flower consumer - thinks of flowers at that level… do they get it? Do they like it - and most of all - would they be willing to PAY for what it would cost- both in Labor, Hard Goods and Flower Quantities and Types? That doesn’t mean it’s not beautiful- but there is a definite line between Pretty Flowers that we put for Sale (and Hopefully Sell) and Flower ART for art’s sake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally- What J finds interest in- are attainable - salable- comfortable- and MOST IMPORTANTLY - Beautiful Flowers… that is my very own very personal and subjective preference… so I don’t know if it’s fair - for me to say what I like and don’t like when it comes to Flower Art … because my opinion is subjective…
I do however hate that Social Media allows anyone who creates flowers to post anything they make and claim it Flower art… I don’t like or need to see so many things I see on Social Media… thus- a call back- to what I said before- I enjoy tossing my phone aside and heading into the garden, or the local flower sellers cooler for my flowers to arrange- visiting a farmers market, cooking a dinner, or petting my dogs… All these things thrill me and I love and enjoy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If I bestowed you with three wishes you could use on the world of flowers and floristry, what would you wish for us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ability to Sell more Flowers to More People More Often- (without limit)… This would allow EVERYONE to Enjoy More Flowers- More Often … and allow Growers to Grow with Wild Abandon- Flower Sellers to Sell with Wild Abandon- and Consumers to Buy Flowers- with Wild Abandon… What a World that would be! SIGH… &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ability for all Flower People- (Designers, Enthusiasts, Sales People, Managers, Owners, Employees) to be Kind, Comforting, Inspiring and Loving toward Ourselves, Others- and the Entire Industry… (I feel this is a concealed Wish for World Peace- honestly) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Unending Revenue Stream for FLOWER EDUCATIONAL EVENTS- to benefit both Past Present and Future Florists… This would allow us to learn from one another- past present and future- and Move Forward with Success, Positivity and Joy… &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many of us have a favorite design style or a style at least that we are most comfortable in. Out of all the different styles of Floral Design that exist which ones are your favorites?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty Flowers (FIRST and FOREMOST) - arranged in a comfortable, calming style that incites Joy and Kindness - (I love Creative Naturalism— mixed with color and texture)  This is best achieved by mixing a little Haskell Eargle, Bill Harper, Matt Wood, and Joe Smith with Pretty Flowers and Foliage… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have this is your design style, sir. In looking at your instagram account- you embrace color- and pretty flowers…you do it VERY VERY WELL! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to PICK my Favorite- and Most Important Element or Principle of Flower Design Style- it would be COLOR- I think it’s so effective- and helps us “Turn our Feelings into Flowers” in a very memorable and eye-catching way! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Florists in the millennial generation will probably look back at the pandemic as a particularly trying time for the floral industry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you will allow me to address this statement first… I will ALWAYS look back on the pandemic as the TIME that Flowers became Necessary for EVERYONE- it was one of the largest and most profitable times in the flower industry… and the CONSUMER PUBLIC became graphically and personally aware of the POSITIVE Health and Wellness Benefits of Cut Flowers… It is possibly one of the MOST IMPORTANT times for the Flower Industry Bar None! It was a gift the universe gave to the Flower Industry… In my Opinion… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any other times before that you can remember that were also especially difficult or uncertain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is another interesting fact… during the great Depression… My Grandfather was running our family flower shop in Nebraska… and while everyone else was struggling- he noticed that flowers were becoming an “affordable luxury-“ - and that people were realizing that flowers made them feel better… so my Grandfather- was becoming very busy at the flower shop (actually doing ok financially)… because people were finding-  .05 - .10 - or .15 cents to spend on a simple bunch of flowers- to put in the house to make everyone feel better… so the Infamous Great Depression- that downturn or struggle- was somehow ALSO providing a beneficial time for flowers… florists, flower growers and sellers…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus- In my opinion- downturns- or difficult times- provide a unique and positive opportunity for flowers…and Florists-  and thus- I feel that FLOWER POWER is a real thing and it’s something very important for us to remember- as times get tough- FLORISTS- get TOUGHER- and Bring on the Flower Power! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your favorite flower of all time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a Super Difficult Question… I can’t narrow it to one Flower… I will apologize- I have a Group of Flowers- I can always depend on to bring me joy- here they are in no particular order… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Broad Flower Variety- I love Carnations Most of All… It’s a Family thing too… We Grew Carnations in my families greenhouses- and my Grandpa and Father always wore a Red Carnation… I love how they are en vogue again… and that there are new colors, varieties, shapes, styles and texture… I love the clove smell of a carnation...I Love mini-carnations and Standard Carnations… Carnations are so long lasting… I love them… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I Love Gardenias- there is nothing better than going to sleep or awakening to the smell of gardenias… and thus I love Stemmed Gardenias that can be arranged in a vase… like the ones that High Camp Supply sells… those are amazing… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I Love the smell of Freesia Too… Yellow Freesia used to have the best smell… but these days there is a rusty brown colored one- that has an incredible intense fun- fruity smell… I always joke that Fressia’s Smell like Froot Loops… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zinnias- I adore Zinnias- and I especially love the Queeny Lime Variety- that is green with rose and orange overtones… it’s in the Cinderella Variety Expanse… I love arranging Zinnias- all summer long- it’s a joy… and they make me happy! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roses- I love Roses that smell like Roses… Helga Piaget, Yves Piaget, Sweet Moments, in my world… I love a Rose that smells like a classic rose... That is what makes life wonderful- when Roses have a Rose Fragrance… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally- I have to offer the famous Quote from Claude Monet “ I must always have flowers- always and always!”… So it really doesn’t matter… as long as there are flowers- I will be happy! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you hope to see from the floral industry in the future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope to always see Pretty Flowers… I hope to see kinder, gentler and less division in our Flower Industry- I hope to see a resurgence and priority put on education! I hope to see the consumers interest and consumption of flowers- continue to grow- unceasingly…  Flower Power Forever!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many films and TV shows include floristry in their set designs, are there any films or TV shows you can think of that included Florist particularly well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reminds me of a funny idiosyncrasy of mine… I always See the Flowers in a Film or TV… I can’t help but see them… and I critic them… MOST COMMONLY on availability… I watched a movie set in the 1950’s about Truman Capote - it was a wonderful period piece - and they had a Single Alstroemeria in a vase on a table… and I thought (and brought to everyone’s attention) that Alstroemerias had NOT yet been discovered nor would they have been commercially available at that time… and I couldn’t stop talking about it… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kel jokes that - it’s an annoying habit I have… I had similar reactions to the flowers- that were created for “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel … style and flower type were not always correct for the period of time… ALTHOUGH they were GORGEOUS and I loved seeing them… They were Pretty Flowers- but not always historically accurate. I still love that series- and I loved EVERY SINGLE SECOND…  and I loves seeing flowers added so profusely to the series… My Crew thought I should write a letter and offer to the be flower consultant!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I would be remiss- if I didn’t include “ J Schwanke’s Life in Bloom” on Public Television! I believe it represents Floristry Very Well… and encourages anyone to include flowers in their life at every/any avenue… Flowers become accessible to everyone- and they are brought back into every situation… that is something that I am very proud of… and also why I think the show is so beloved by our viewers! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who’s your favorite author, painter, musician, and film director?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Favorite Author: David Sedaris- Brilliant and Laugh Out Loud Funny!
My Favorite Painter: Mary Blair - American Artist and Animator- for Walt Disney- Her concept art is amazing… I hope to own one - someday!
My Favorite Musician: Joey DeFrancesco- American Jazz Organist (and Trumpeter) but I’m in love with Hammond Jazz Organ Music… 
My Favorite Film Director: I don’t really follow directors… I enjoy all kinds of movies- and I don’t group them by Director… I look at the content - and when I love it… I can admire the director of that film… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final question, what is your most cherished flower related memory?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it has to be the wisdom and advice of Mrs. Jan Therien - from Fremont Nebraska, my High School Guidance Counselor… When I was a Junior in High School - had a meeting with Jan - to decide what I was going to do with my life… what career I was going to pursue to ensure- that I would be on the road to success and also have the classes needed to follow my dream…  here’s how the dialog went… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan: What do you want to be when you graduate from school?
J: A Zookeeper (I always have and still do have an inordinate love and ultimate fascination with animals- and especially Zoological Parks and Zoo Animals)
Jan: Really???- Well- you know how difficult that will be- as you have to become a doctor of Zoology- that means BIOLOGY… CHEMISTRY, PHYSICS, 
and MATH- You realize how you are presently doing in those courses- and that you don’t do well in those studies- You do better in the Fine Arts… 
Drama, Art … and it’s going to be a lot of hard work and studying… and If I may be frank… You seem to be kind of lazy… 
J: (Not Surprised… I was Lazy- and Hated Math and Studying… Let’s be honest… I get it and Jan knew me well) … Well… then what do YOU think I 
should do???
Jan: You’re a 4th Generation Florist- You know more about Flowers- than Anyone I know- ALREADY- without even studying- YOU love flowers
and You could be a great florist- without much effort… I think that might be a good thing - Join your family business and become a Florist… arranging
flowers- creating window displays- running your family flower business- seems like a good idea to me… What do you think????
J: Sounds like a Great Plan… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Here we are today… I have a National TV Show about Flowers- that reaches 98 Million People every day- I have a successful website and series of videos that have educated florists around the world- in the art of Floristry- I love Flowers- and I Love what I do… and Jan Therien- is in my Opinion- the Greatest High School Guidance Counselor of All TIME… she gave it to me straight… and I became a Blooming Success!&lt;/p&gt;

In the FSM this would be the kiss of death: to accept a lower position in the Matrix without at least scheming about it is a Gamma female response, and anathema for a real female Alpha or determined Beta.  ***Any*** **submission to a hierarchy eschews the ideal that female power comes from** ***equally shared consensus***\*\*,\*\* and to voluntarily accept a lower position without fighting to get it back -- not, usually, by making oneself better, but **by undermining the Alpha females who** ***did*** **manage to rise to the top of the Matrix and take their place, bucket-o'-crabs style**.   They do this by attempting to control the Matrix consensus against the leadership.   Or sometimes to force the leadership into action in accordance with the wishes of the consensus, even if that becomes problematic for the leadership.  That's because men and women lead differently.

An astute reader sent me an article demonstrating this rather clearly.  He found it in an advice column for working moms.  Read it, and see if you can spot the differences in male and female leadership styles: 

&gt;**Q: I’m a mother of two and head a company of 10 employees. One mom staffer often leaves early for her kids’ activities or stays home whenone is sick. Other staffers resent her. Should I say something?**

I'll get to the answer in a moment, but notice how she phases the question.  As my reader pointed out, she isn't stating *""I have an employee who uses her family as an excuse to leave early or stay out.  Should I say something?""*  That would be a more *masculine* response.  It would also be a no-brainer, and if a dude wrote into an advice column with this he shouldn't be in charge of anything in the first place.

Note how she frames the issue: *""Other staffers resent her""*, not *""her work performance is failing and its bad for morale""*.  The focus of her discomfort isn't (ostensibly) on the *worker*, but on the verbal ire of her co-workers.  The problem wasn't that she wasn't pulling her weight and costing the company money, but that *the other (presumably female) staffers were getting mad at her.*

Then she compounds the issue by asking *""Should I say something?""* which no male manager would ask. Why?  Because **if you have an employee who is not measuring up, the question ""should I say something?""  is moot.  You either say something and handle the issue, or you aren't deserving of your title and authority.**  Nor would a good male manager have likely led with ""I'm a father of two"" before anything else -- not because the Male Social Matrix discounts fatherhood (far from it) -- but **because a male manager would not see his own family status as having** ***any*** **relation to that of his employees.**  But a female manager feels compelled to list that status first in order to **build sympathy**, **establish context**, and **put her status out for review in FSM standard languag**e: list any relationship or family status first, then career status.  A man would probably have written the question: *""I run a small company of ten employees, and one employee -- a single mother -- habitually leaves early or stays out because of family.  While I support my employees'  in their family life, this is starting to be a drain on us all.  What can I do to mitigate her childcare issues and keep them from ruining my business?""*

Big difference.  The male is worried about the *business* \-- the ""mission"" -- whereas the female manager is far more worried about *what her employees are saying behind her back*, and whether or not her problem employee would fee offended if she attempted to hold her to account.

Here's the columnist's answer, by the way:

&gt;A: It’s the old “what working mothers do to keep up jobresponsibilities while keeping families afloat” challenge. Sometimeswe need to face the fact that some jobs, for whatever reason, mightnot be the best fit with our family’s needs. There’s nothing wrongwith approaching your employee if you do it with respect and concern.“Is everything okay at home?” you might ask. “I’ve noticed you’ve hadquite a few emergencies lately and you’ve missed some deadlines. Ijust want to make sure you’re not overloaded.” Listen to what shesays, then come to a solution that works for both of you. Maybe sheworks from home one day a week. Maybe she comes in early every day soshe can leave early. Or maybe letting her go is the outcome she’s secretly hoped for.

That's a surprisingly blunt answer for a ""working mother"" advice column.   As my reader pointed out, *""The matrix complained, and pulled the other crab \[the employee\] back into the bucket. The editor even suggests that the working mom secretly* hopes *to get fired.""*  Hardly the ""sisterhood-is-powerful!"" reaction of her feminist forebears, but it's clear that this boss is using the rationalization of complaining employees to handle discipline for one who was abusing the system . . . but only after a fuss was raised.   

A male manager would have likely had the required talk with the employee without waiting for the gossip and resentment and dealt with the issue himself.  But an office full of female staffers, with a female boss, is far more likely to delay and discuss and otherwise attempt to build consensus . . . and when the consensus is strong enough, they can use it even to direct *their own bos*s.

The Matrix relishes this kind of subtle infighting and rewards those who successfully control the consensus with leadership of the Matrix.   As long as everyone pretends to go along with that (to avoid destroying the precious perception of consensus) then it *doesn't really matter* who leads the Matrix.  Women are free to jockey for power with gossip, sabotage each other with rumor and innuendo, and work to shift the consensus favorably towards them until they are themselves ""secretly"" leading the consensus and someone else takes *them* down.  When that happens, even if the other women hate the conniving bitch who screwed over their BFF for the PTA leadership, they respect her for her ability to play the social game well.

By contrast,  once Men have submitted to male authority, they rarely attempt to overthrow the hierarchy *even if they are at the lowest point on it*.  Indeed, their power and promise of power comes *from* hierarchy, so serving it is ultimately in their best interest.   Men who rebel against their duty to authority in the absence of real incompetence or disaster by their leadership are not seen as heroes by their fellow men, they're seen as *men who have failed in their duty*.  They have purposefully trashed the hierarchy from which their authority should spring and put themselves at the top without properly earning it.  

That's why generals who stage successful *coups d'etat* are so paranoid: **they know that by assuming their position the way that they have, they have taken the great risk of alienating those who they are supposed to command.**  And an army that has accepted one change in leadership without much struggle is unlikely to fight to keep you on top.  **A man does not** ***lose*** **power by voluntarily submitting to a respected authority.   He** ***gains*** **it.**   A soldier gets more respect than a civilian, even if he is a lowly private.  An athlete might lack the talent or ability to be a star player, but if he's a good *team* player who works hard then he can still get the MVP trophy at the end of the season.  Or even team captain, if he has garnered sufficient respect from his teammates.  

So how can you use this?  The obvious way, of course, is to **make certain your woman witnesses other men behaving respectfully to you and treating you with deference.**   Cultivate a couple of slavish beer buddies she doesn't know real well who *cannot shut up* about how goddamn great you are any time she's around, for instance.   Or distinguish yourself with the membership of some club or professional association you belong to.    Let her see other men acclaim and admire you, and her panties get drenched.   I noticed a distinct uptick in interest from Mrs. Ironwood, for example, when I started actually getting fans for my work.   And while she almost always responds to the presence of ardent female fans (thanks to preselection) I get almost as good results when one of my male fans praises me and I share that with her.

Second, **just by being aware of the fact that women** ***don't*** **control male social status you've gained an advantage.**  Most dudes are pretty clueless about social matters, and just naturally accept their social role as wherever their woman stuck them.  They sometimes think that going out of their way to help women (""white knight"" style) will add to their social status and improve their relationships.  In fact, **consistently being seen helping women through their difficulties diminishes you in** ***male*** **social status.**  Yes, the women in the Matrix who are familiar with you will gossip about your assistance in a positive manner . . . but once you understand that *men* generate the social status that is so important to the FSM then you'll realize that your ""sweet"" gesture got you no closer to getting laid or even being taken seriously by women.   

That *doesn't* mean you don't volunteer to wash the dishes when you have dinner at your mother-in-law's house -- that's just polite.  It *does* mean that **if every time ""the girls"" in the office/class get into a project they can't get out of, you don't go running to fix it . . . you let them fall on their collective ass.**  Because if you're the kind of dude who White Knights all the time, the other dudes in your matrix will know it, and your social status will fall.  I used to make this mistake all the time when I was a Blue Pill teenager.  I figured if I helped women out, their gratitude for the service would incline them toward liking me.  It did . . . as long as I was safely in the 'friend zone'.  

So when I was the only guy helping in the kitchen with the girls at church youth camp, they all thought I was *great* . . . until I asked a girl out.  The moment I tried to make my dutiful service into something else, then all of the sudden I was ""creepy"" for being so ""deceitful"" about my motivations.  And of course the other dudes had long ago written me off as gay or too gamma for words.  I wised up, eventually, and I quit being the bitch of any girl who smiled at me until I tried to kiss her.   But it took a *long* time to figure out that being perpetually ready to go to any woman's rescue was not helping me get laid in the slightest, and was actually working *against* me.  Because women saw it as weakness they could take advantage of, and men saw it as a disinterest in masculine endeavors.

Thirdly, understanding the power the FSM has over a woman is *breathtaking.*  You really do not, as a man, have a proper appreciation of just how much your wife lives and dies by her social positioning.  Shit you would shrug off as incidental can lead to a woman's hamster breaking the light speed barrier in a social crisis.  If your best friend, for example, told you that you were a fat slob who needed to lose fifty pounds, you'd likely agree and call him an asshole for pointing it out before you both waddle off to Denny's.  If a woman hears from her best friend that she's starting to look ""hippy"" from a certain angle, that's the FSM equivalent of a flesh wound.  I've seen such casual remarks launch episodes of neuroses that minstrels will sing about one day.

**Understanding that** ***her*** **social status is dependent upon** ***your*** **social status in a relationship grants you more than a little leverage in the relationship.**   A married couple is, for all practical purposes, a social team.  You get a little status from having a beautiful wife (and slightly less for a plain wife, none for a bitchy wife, and negative for a truly bitchy screachtard), and she gets a significant boost from you if you are held at all in esteem by your male peers.  Your cooperation as a team can lead to mutual benefits, if you're subtle and adept enough to work together.  

When I go to a social function with Mrs. Ironwood, for instance, we've developed a series of protocols that we use to mutually support each other in conversation, rescue each other from unpleasant people, and signal to each other if we need to a) talk alone together  b) have a minor social emergency c) stay clear of the conversation because it is socially dangerous d) have acquired a stalker e) I have to go to the bathroom, can you get me a drink? f) I want to wrap things up and go home  and f) let's get the hell out of dodge.  

 (I'm trying to get her to understand a new one, g) *let's meet in the bathroom, outside in the car, or some other secluded place for some danger nookie*.  So far, not much luck with that one.)

And if you aren't -- or don't *want* to work together to buff social status for some reason (say, six weeks without fellatio might convince you), it doesn't take much to give your wife a temporary hit on her social status by *not* cooperating with her.   Telling tales to her biggest rival's husband, for instance (certain to get back to her rival) or fart loudly in front of the local social heavyweight  -- both would be mortifying wounds to a socially conscious wife.  And *perfectly excusable* from you, as you are merely male and have no idea how women ""really are"".  Indeed, from the perspective of the Matrix, any issues that the women in her FSM will be laid at HER feet, not yours . . . because ""he's a man and doesn't know any better"".  But she's going to be the subject of position-killing gossip for months.

(Side Note: It's *amazing* how feminism flies out the door when women get talking about other women.  If you ever get the chance to overhear your wife and her friends when they don't think you're listening, you'll overhear stuff about women not present and their attached menfolk that would have you, my friend, in diversity training classes for the next six months for the pure misogyny.  I once watched a friend of mine and his feminist wife get into a fight because despite her insistence that there were only minor physical differences in men and women, gender was a cultural concept, and that sexism in any form (save the usual male-bashing) was appalling, she was furious at the fact that he had mentioned something about her poor wardrobe in passing to her highly successful big sister, who was *only too happy* to help her little sister out shopping.  The feminist *freaked* because now she looked sloppy and poor to her big sister, and that would be used to judge her and angle the rest of their family FSM against her, and proceeded to accuse her of being manipulative, scheming, and conniving, a total whore, low moral character, etc. -- and that HE should know better.  But I digress)

So keep in mind that when a woman is in a relationship with you, that it has *much more significance* to her relations with the FSM than you think.  Indeed, **you aren't in a relationship with her**, **you're in a relationship with her** ***whole network***\*\*,\*\* and thinking otherwise is going to get you in trouble.  As much as she may or may not love you, your presence in her life is giving her a buff -- because being single after 30 and childless after 35 substantially lowers her positioning vis a vis the FSM.  What you do or don't do affects not just you and she, but her and her relationship with the FSM.  

We'll be returning to this subject repeatedly in the future.  There's lots more to cover.  Promise.",t2_jv3g7z7x,False,,0,False,Swingsets and Sandboxes - Playground Rules for the Female Social Matrix [Part 2],[],r/RedPillCannon,False,,,0.0,,,False,t3_1ae6mec,False,dark,1.0,,restricted,1.0,0.0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Ian Ironwood,False,1,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,,1706563390.0,text,,,,text,self.RedPillCannon,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Make sure you&amp;#39;ve read &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillCannon/comments/1ae6lt9/swingsets_and_sandboxes_playground_rules_for_the/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt; before]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the columnist&amp;#39;s answer, by the way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: It’s the old “what working mothers do to keep up jobresponsibilities while keeping families afloat” challenge. Sometimeswe need to face the fact that some jobs, for whatever reason, mightnot be the best fit with our family’s needs.

Maybe she comes in early every day soshe can leave early. Or maybe letting her go is the outcome she’s secretly hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a surprisingly blunt answer for a &amp;quot;working mother&amp;quot; advice column.   As my reader pointed out, &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;The matrix complained, and pulled the other crab [the employee] back into the bucket. The editor even suggests that the working mom secretly&lt;/em&gt; hopes &lt;em&gt;to get fired.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;  Hardly the &amp;quot;sisterhood-is-powerful!&amp;quot; reaction of her feminist forebears, but it&amp;#39;s clear that this boss is using the rationalization of complaining employees to handle discipline for one who was abusing the system . . . but only after a fuss was raised.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast,  once Men have submitted to male authority, they rarely attempt to overthrow the hierarchy &lt;em&gt;even if they are at the lowest point on it&lt;/em&gt;.  Indeed, their power and promise of power comes &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; hierarchy, so serving it is ultimately in their best interest.   Men who rebel against their duty to authority in the absence of real incompetence or disaster by their leadership are not seen as heroes by their fellow men, they&amp;#39;re seen as &lt;em&gt;men who have failed in their duty&lt;/em&gt;.  They have purposefully trashed the hierarchy from which their authority should spring and put themselves at the top without properly earning it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why generals who stage successful &lt;em&gt;coups d&amp;#39;etat&lt;/em&gt; are so paranoid: &lt;strong&gt;they know that by assuming their position the way that they have, they have taken the great risk of alienating those who they are supposed to command.&lt;/strong&gt;  And an army that has accepted one change in leadership without much struggle is unlikely to fight to keep you on top.  &lt;strong&gt;A man does not&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;lose&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;power by voluntarily submitting to a respected authority.   He&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;gains&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;it.&lt;/strong&gt;   A soldier gets more respect than a civilian, even if he is a lowly private.  An athlete might lack the talent or ability to be a star player, but if he&amp;#39;s a good &lt;em&gt;team&lt;/em&gt; player who works hard then he can still get the MVP trophy at the end of the season.  Or even team captain, if he has garnered sufficient respect from his teammates.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how can you use this?  The obvious way, of course, is to &lt;strong&gt;make certain your woman witnesses other men behaving respectfully to you and treating you with deference.&lt;/strong&gt;   Cultivate a couple of slavish beer buddies she doesn&amp;#39;t know real well who &lt;em&gt;cannot shut up&lt;/em&gt; about how goddamn great you are any time she&amp;#39;s around, for instance.   Or distinguish yourself with the membership of some club or professional association you belong to.    Let her see other men acclaim and admire you, and her panties get drenched.   I noticed a distinct uptick in interest from Mrs. Ironwood, for example, when I started actually getting fans for my work.   And while she almost always responds to the presence of ardent female fans (thanks to preselection) I get almost as good results when one of my male fans praises me and I share that with her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, &lt;strong&gt;just by being aware of the fact that women&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;don&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;control male social status you&amp;#39;ve gained an advantage.&lt;/strong&gt;  Most dudes are pretty clueless about social matters, and just naturally accept their social role as wherever their woman stuck them.  They sometimes think that going out of their way to help women (&amp;quot;white knight&amp;quot; style) will add to their social status and improve their relationships.  In fact, &lt;strong&gt;consistently being seen helping women through their difficulties diminishes you in&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;male&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;social status.&lt;/strong&gt;  Yes, the women in the Matrix who are familiar with you will gossip about your assistance in a positive manner . . . but once you understand that &lt;em&gt;men&lt;/em&gt; generate the social status that is so important to the FSM then you&amp;#39;ll realize that your &amp;quot;sweet&amp;quot; gesture got you no closer to getting laid or even being taken seriously by women.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; mean you don&amp;#39;t volunteer to wash the dishes when you have dinner at your mother-in-law&amp;#39;s house -- that&amp;#39;s just polite.  It &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; mean that &lt;strong&gt;if every time &amp;quot;the girls&amp;quot; in the office/class get into a project they can&amp;#39;t get out of, you don&amp;#39;t go running to fix it . . . you let them fall on their collective ass.&lt;/strong&gt;  Because if you&amp;#39;re the kind of dude who White Knights all the time, the other dudes in your matrix will know it, and your social status will fall.  I used to make this mistake all the time when I was a Blue Pill teenager.  I figured if I helped women out, their gratitude for the service would incline them toward liking me.  It did . . . as long as I was safely in the &amp;#39;friend zone&amp;#39;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I was the only guy helping in the kitchen with the girls at church youth camp, they all thought I was &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; . . . until I asked a girl out.  The moment I tried to make my dutiful service into something else, then all of the sudden I was &amp;quot;creepy&amp;quot; for being so &amp;quot;deceitful&amp;quot; about my motivations.  And of course the other dudes had long ago written me off as gay or too gamma for words.  I wised up, eventually, and I quit being the bitch of any girl who smiled at me until I tried to kiss her.   But it took a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time to figure out that being perpetually ready to go to any woman&amp;#39;s rescue was not helping me get laid in the slightest, and was actually working &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; me.  Because women saw it as weakness they could take advantage of, and men saw it as a disinterest in masculine endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, understanding the power the FSM has over a woman is &lt;em&gt;breathtaking.&lt;/em&gt;  You really do not, as a man, have a proper appreciation of just how much your wife lives and dies by her social positioning.  Shit you would shrug off as incidental can lead to a woman&amp;#39;s hamster breaking the light speed barrier in a social crisis.  If your best friend, for example, told you that you were a fat slob who needed to lose fifty pounds, you&amp;#39;d likely agree and call him an asshole for pointing it out before you both waddle off to Denny&amp;#39;s.  If a woman hears from her best friend that she&amp;#39;s starting to look &amp;quot;hippy&amp;quot; from a certain angle, that&amp;#39;s the FSM equivalent of a flesh wound.  I&amp;#39;ve seen such casual remarks launch episodes of neuroses that minstrels will sing about one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding that&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;social status is dependent upon&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;social status in a relationship grants you more than a little leverage in the relationship.&lt;/strong&gt;   A married couple is, for all practical purposes, a social team.  You get a little status from having a beautiful wife (and slightly less for a plain wife, none for a bitchy wife, and negative for a truly bitchy screachtard), and she gets a significant boost from you if you are held at all in esteem by your male peers.  Your cooperation as a team can lead to mutual benefits, if you&amp;#39;re subtle and adept enough to work together.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I go to a social function with Mrs. Ironwood, for instance, we&amp;#39;ve developed a series of protocols that we use to mutually support each other in conversation, rescue each other from unpleasant people, and signal to each other if we need to a) talk alone together  b) have a minor social emergency c) stay clear of the conversation because it is socially dangerous d) have acquired a stalker e) I have to go to the bathroom, can you get me a drink? f) I want to wrap things up and go home  and f) let&amp;#39;s get the hell out of dodge.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (I&amp;#39;m trying to get her to understand a new one, g) &lt;em&gt;let&amp;#39;s meet in the bathroom, outside in the car, or some other secluded place for some danger nookie&lt;/em&gt;.  So far, not much luck with that one.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you aren&amp;#39;t -- or don&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to work together to buff social status for some reason (say, six weeks without fellatio might convince you), it doesn&amp;#39;t take much to give your wife a temporary hit on her social status by &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; cooperating with her.   Telling tales to her biggest rival&amp;#39;s husband, for instance (certain to get back to her rival) or fart loudly in front of the local social heavyweight  -- both would be mortifying wounds to a socially conscious wife.  And &lt;em&gt;perfectly excusable&lt;/em&gt; from you, as you are merely male and have no idea how women &amp;quot;really are&amp;quot;.  Indeed, from the perspective of the Matrix, any issues that the women in her FSM will be laid at HER feet, not yours . . . because &amp;quot;he&amp;#39;s a man and doesn&amp;#39;t know any better&amp;quot;.  But she&amp;#39;s going to be the subject of position-killing gossip for months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Side Note: It&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; how feminism flies out the door when women get talking about other women.  If you ever get the chance to overhear your wife and her friends when they don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;re listening, you&amp;#39;ll overhear stuff about women not present and their attached menfolk that would have you, my friend, in diversity training classes for the next six months for the pure misogyny.  I once watched a friend of mine and his feminist wife get into a fight because despite her insistence that there were only minor physical differences in men and women, gender was a cultural concept, and that sexism in any form (save the usual male-bashing) was appalling, she was furious at the fact that he had mentioned something about her poor wardrobe in passing to her highly successful big sister, who was &lt;em&gt;only too happy&lt;/em&gt; to help her little sister out shopping.  The feminist &lt;em&gt;freaked&lt;/em&gt; because now she looked sloppy and poor to her big sister, and that would be used to judge her and angle the rest of their family FSM against her, and proceeded to accuse her of being manipulative, scheming, and conniving, a total whore, low moral character, etc. -- and that HE should know better.  But I digress)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So keep in mind that when a woman is in a relationship with you, that it has &lt;em&gt;much more significance&lt;/em&gt; to her relations with the FSM than you think.  Indeed, &lt;strong&gt;you aren&amp;#39;t in a relationship with her&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;you&amp;#39;re in a relationship with her&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;whole network&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;**,** and thinking otherwise is going to get you in trouble.  As much as she may or may not love you, your presence in her life is giving her a buff -- because being single after 30 and childless after 35 substantially lowers her positioning vis a vis the FSM.  What you do or don&amp;#39;t do affects not just you and she, but her and her relationship with the FSM.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll be returning to this subject repeatedly in the future.  There&amp;#39;s lots more to cover.  Promise.&lt;/p&gt;

,RocketLeague,"Hello, Rocketeers! I have a question about a specific kickoff situation that I find frequently causes miscommunications and double-commits.

In a kickoff scenario where one player is taking the kickoff, another has gone for corner boost and the third cheats forward, I find that there's frequently crossed wires about what to do if the ball squeezes out directly down the midfield line toward the same side wall as the boost-collecting player.

 Should the player who cheated forward, being usually closest by distance, go for it? Or should the player who grabbed corner boost continue with their momentum to challenge along the side wall?


I have seen this go both ways and have been caught in numerous double-commits, or at the very least been caught out of position because of it.

,bjj,"All right /r/bjj, I am in need of your collective wisdom. I'm a BJJ/MT hobbyist, training maybe three times a week during the school year; but this year, I've been training even less than that. Maybe once every other week on average. The reason is that I haven't been sleeping well, and I often feel very tired. On days when I can't even fathom walking the mile and a half to the gym, I usually don't go. I've tried many things to help me sleep better, none of which have helped. 

Recently, a couple teammates of mine told me that they take pre-workout supplements, and that the supplements give them a ton of energy. I don't take supplements of any kind, but the idea of getting an energy boost when I'm a bit tired is appealing. Do any of you guys take pre-workout supplements or know anything about them?

,MLPCCG,"A rather pretentious title, I'm sure, but certainly it grabbed your attention. I'm putting this under the fanon tag just to be safe, realistically this discussion is more than likely safe to post openly about.

As a brief introduction, I'm Krysto - some of you may know me, many of you may not - I am a competitive level judge, frequent volunteer and have massive experience with demoing and teaching the CCG - the following is a summary of things I've come to realize about the CCG from a discussion with the subreddit's own VikingErik, and I felt that it is something certainly worth sharing.

To begin, I'd like to establish that the **MLP:CCG has 4 core audiences:**

**1: The competitive players** - that's us for the most part. People who have a lot of play experience, a high capacity for card complexity. The rare boundary (discussed later) is not an issue. To us, the most important thing is a fulfilling experience from the game overall - we care about winning and certainly want to feel we've earned that win, but are not above using cards we have identified to be powerful - we determine the ""top 20%"" and are innovative by nature. The Spikes, Johnnies and Timmies are all up here.

**2: The ""Casual"" or Enterplay's ""Kitchen Table Gamer""** - These are players who will infrequently attend CCG events at their LGS - they aren't as serious about play and want to build fun decks, but also aim to sometimes move into the competitive audience. To these players, the rare boundary is sometimes an issue, as acquiring 3x RTO, 3x Stand Still, 3x... can be very cumbersome. These players sometimes have some of the top 20% but getting all of it can be a real hassle, and not having the top 1% of the top 20% can be a damning thing! They have a decent capacity for complexity, but erratas and rulings typically evade them.

**3: The ""Family""** - these are players who aren't 100% serious, if at all. This consists mainly of a hodgepodge of parents who want to play with their kids, kids who want to play with their siblings, and so on. Some, but not all, aim to move into the 2nd audience and rarely the 1st. These players have the lowest capacity for complexity and erratas rarely if ever come to their attention. The rare boundary is nonexistant here, as most of these players don't know those cards even exist - for them, the game experience is largely defined by the contents of their starter deck and some commons and a few uncommons - whatever is widely available.

**4: The ""collectors""** - this is a sub-audience, but in the MLP fandom is a very real separate audience. 4th audience ""players"" can fall into any of the above 3, but for the sake of this category, I'll refer specifically to those who fit in neither, or the part of the players in audiences 1-3 which fits into this category. These people do not largely care about the game at all, sometimes they might start playing it if they don't already - their primary concern is collecting. They want one of everything. Not having a card in their binder is a burning pain they want to relieve themselves of. A shiny stamp on a card means the world to them and they will go to great lengths to get them. 4th audience players can be in any of the other 3 audiences, but when I refer to the 4th audience I refer specifically to the people or the parts of people who care about their collection.

That being said, I'm about to say something very harsh. Enterplay has, for the most part, failed to deliver to ANY of the core audiences of this game, and I'll explain why.

To the 3rd audience, there is a distinct **lack of coherent simplicity at the starting level of this game**. If you've ever seen an up-to-date demo you'd know they use the CN starter Problems which unlike the Premier Problems are NOT vanilla. Speaking of which, how many ACTUAL vanilla cards are in Canterlot Nights? Zero. At Gencon, massive piles of CN packs were distributed as promotional material, and that's a bad thing as the level of complexity at the base level of CN is way too high for this audience. The lack of actual vanilla cards (having no abilities isn't necessarily vanilla, the concept of a play requirement is a rule of its own which exceeds vanilla gameplay, more on that later) - and starter decks all include Troublemakers which are especially sinful in this sense since there's no obvious way to play them. Additionally, Pumped as a mechanic is far too complex for any given common card following the principles as NWO. Enough with that.

For the second audience, **the game still has a massive rare boundary** - staple cards like Stand Still and Plum Tuckered Out which have extremely simple mechanics and could easily be fit into an uncommon slot are instead fitted into the rare slot. The excuse? Enterplay does not design with Rarity in mind. Maybe they should start - (would give less RTOs, hehe, puns). Rarity is not about power level - it is to a small degree, but it's more so about levels of complexity. Commons are simple, Uncommons are either more complex or more powerful, Rares are typically both, but not specifically just more powerful (simple+powerful is uncommon, remember this). Thus in order to feel like they're not losing to the better cards, as opposed to losing to the better players, these players need to have better access to better cards - that is to say the top 20% as EP calls it needs to be more widely spread between C/U/R with far less focus on the R.

To the competitive players, **there needs to be balance.** We'll always find the top 20%, **but we'll also continue to look for the top 1%** *if it exists* and if that top 1% is far enough up, we'll exploit the everliving daylights out of it. Competitive players want to compete, and if there are legitimately overpowered cards in comparison to the suboptimal 19%, we'll lose interest because our skills aren't being tested as much. Not to mention, if we can ""break the game"" we'll do so happily for the sake of winning - though we shouldn't be able to do so *competitively*. That being said, there is a top 1%, it's way above the other 19%, and the prices reflect that, so more for the 2nd audience to groan over. We also did break the game, both casually and competitively, and the 2nd audience groans even more over that. Everyone loses when a deck wins all of the time. We care about an overall balance, because not only do we want to find the best decks, we also still want to have fun, because those other 400 cards we never use sometimes beg to be used, and if they aren't useable in the least...

The 4th audience simply throws a fit though. $300 alt-art Nightmare Moons aren't nearly as much of a problem as those pesky Break Dancers and unreleased/prereleased/released in Germany/lord knows what promos currently in limbo. Promotional material should be definite and GETTING it should be something people know how to do. Furthermore, the **lack of alt-art cards in CN** is disturbing, collectors eat that stuff up like candy and it provides a huge incentive for players to go to LGSs and participate. Just foiling over a card is hardly a reward to someone who earns the card, and its hardly a reason to buy the card for someone who wants it in a binder. Alt-art, full art, textless, they're all important in their own ways. Remember this. The collectors have one other headache though - it's easy enough to buy all the cards, but there's still the desire to OPEN packs, and because of this, the 60/60/60 ratio is damning. In order to obtain all 60 Rares, for example, one needs to open a minimum of 60 packs. Doing so gives you a shot at one each of the 60 rares, and also gives you around 180 Uncommons and 480 Commons - given that there's only 60 of each, the massive piles of quadruplicates, and so on is a bit of a headache. The ratio needs to be adjusted so as to increase the size of the common/uncommon base to reasonable proportion. This has a powerful psychological effect, believe it or not, though it's hard to understand. It certainly has an aftermarket effect because decreasing the frequency of uncommons creates what are called ""chase"" cards, which have higher inherent value and is also healthy to the game as it boosts the player's imagined value of the packs they purchase. **People are more inclined to spend money on packs if they feel it's worth it.**

Lastly, and perhaps most significantly, let's look back at the 3rd audience. To these players, being able to digest the game and feel like they're doing it right is important, and cards like ""It's a Twister"" and ""Dark Moon"" are counterexamples to good low-complexity design. Both ""do"" things, but in reality they don't really ""do"" anything. What makes what I'm about to say so important however, is that it **applies directly and is beneficial to ALL 3 of the player audiences** (excluding the 4th audience which doesn't care about playing). **This game needs more vanilla material.** It's a bombshell to think about, but I'm simply going to quote something BigCheese (another Redditor here) said at Gencon in reference to the card Timber! This Problem largely does nothing important - we scratched our heads over it trying to figure out ways to make its effect relevant in any way, but regardless, Cheese pointed out an important fact. Timber! is a 4+3/9 Problem with a bonus of 2, and that's what matters. Vanilla is important to this game because it defines a baseline for acceptable power levels - it provides a building-off point for new players, it provides a way to introduce tribal elements, it provides consistent entry into other colors. Blue Moon was in top 8 decklists. He was in THE top decklist. Vanilla isn't bad, and it isn't weak. It's important. Canterlot Nights had no vanilla material - the simple existence of a 3 cost-3 power friend in Orange wold be huge, to say the least.

So what needs to change?

**1) - Promotional Material needs to be definitively promotional** - alt art, full art, etc. and certainly needs to be worth a player getting as it has to attract 2nd audience players towards the 1st audience.

**2) - A larger sense of balance** - there will always be a top 20%, but how far those top 20% are above the rest is also important - more power needs to be accessible to more colors at lower levels of rarity.

**3) - More power available below the Rare tier** - this means that quality removal, tricks, faceoff, etc. should be available to all players. Stand Stills, Plum Tuckered Outs, perhaps even a low-level Villain, and especially removal, all needs to be available at Uncommon.

**4) - More vanilla material** - either in supplementary product or in introductory product. Starter decks should be STARTER decks - why they even HAVE troublemakers in them is beyond me. There needs to be a level of this game available to both the younger and older audiences. Have you considered teaching people to play with only vanilla Friends and vanilla Problems? That's the easiest place to start, and if you're trying to teach your 7-year-old daughter or son how to play, know that they'll digest ""Draw a card, take 2 tokens, spend 2 tokens to play High Spirits and House Mouse to Special Delivery! confront and score 2 points"" relatively easily. They won't digest this if there's a million effects across each of these cards. Why there aren't more vanilla cards to help build these decks is beyond me.

4.5) - Troublemakers and other cards in general ought to have a little reminder text - it doesn't hurt, that's for sure!

**5) - An official/unified website for strategies, announcements, rulings and erratas!** I think this explains itself, but it's primarily catered to the 1st audience and helps 2nd audience move into the 1st.

**6)** - This is not directly apparent from the analysis of the 4 audiences, but instead an overall byproduct, but **the game needs more interaction.** No one likes getting their cards dismissed or frightened, this is true, but making these effects unplayably expensive or clunky or limiting them to the rare slots is a bad thing. Sure no one likes having their stuff blown up, but it's perfectly healthy to lose a game if you felt like you lost for reasons IN YOUR CONTROL. Losing to a better player is fine - losing to a better card usually is not. The lack of faceoff tricks and the simple fact that most games produce 10:0 double faceoffs is a problem - it doesn't create a memorable experience and it doesn't make players want to come back for more. You'll never remember that faceoff you won 12 to 0, but you'll remember that faceoff you were going to win 10:5 until your opponent pulled out a trick from their sleeve and won under your nose - it teaches you to look out for those tricks in the future and sometimes use them yourself. Learning is the key here, and **as long as a player feels that their learning from each game, they'll come back for more.** Cards like Guidance Counselor don't make players feel like their learning - it induces helplessness and legitimately causes people to either stop playing, or give up hopes of moving from 2nd audience to 1st.

That's enough of this rant for now - I'm sure you've either glanced over it or skipped to the discussion below. That being said, share your thoughts on the game as a whole - I certainly hope I made someone give this a thought, as it gives a better look into a bit more than just game development, but also marketing.",,False,,0,,[Fanon](sort of)[Discussion] - What this CCG needs to do to improve.,,,,,,0.0,,,False,t3_2ewds8,False,,,,,9.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},,,9,,,,self,1409297130,bonbon,,,,,True,,1409299405.0,,,,,,self.MLPCCG,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,t5_2y3vv,,,,,2ewds8,,,krysto2012,,30,,,,,,,/r/MLPCCG/comments/2ewds8/fanonsort_ofdiscussion_what_this_ccg_needs_to_do/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPCCG/comments/2ewds8/fanonsort_ofdiscussion_what_this_ccg_needs_to_do/,,1409295805.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441196621.0,,,
,yugioh,"Basically, I was asked by a few people to show off the deck. Every card in it is used by Yusei Fudo in the 5D's anime, and his deck works pretty nicely into combos. It's weird. I have an imgur Album showing off the deck: http://imgur.com/a/eI3vc

The tuners are there for getting out the Warrior Synchros out quickly and swarming the field with additional monsters, be it tokens or preventing them from being destroyed in battle. The Warrior archetype serves as the early assault and defense before going for synchro plays. 

Spells aren't plentiful but they get the job done, which is getting more monsters for more synchro summoning.

Traps are the backbone for protecting your weak synchro food. Reviving them, manipulating their ATK stats and stalling out and drawing are what they're there for.

The Warrior Synchros come out when the situation is needed, Turbo for dealing with other higher leveled synchros, Nitro for power boosting, Drill for recycling, and Junk when he can boost up. Road allows you to go into more deck thinning and getting out the right monsters for whatever the call is needed.

This is not intended as a serious deck, but it's nice to use to step back from the usual. Plus trying to collect every card Yusei used is really fun.

,TogetherWeGame,"Hey everybody, I'm trying to sift through all the threads and collect the various tower functionality ideas that have been suggested so we can vote to determine our favorites. 

I think we should start out with a basic set of vanilla towers that we know we're going to build off of:

* Standard - single target, medium range, medium rate of fire, medium damage
* Sniper - single target, long range, slow rate of fire, high damage
* Pulse - area of effect, short range, slow rate of fire, medium damage

Then, here are the special functions I've seen suggested (edited down to make them easier to scan and vote on):

* Magnetize - causes affected creeps to attack other nearby creeps
* Fork Bomb - self-destructs when triggered, taking out all nearby creeps
* While(True) - slows down nearby creeps
* Script - spawns friendly units over time
* DDoS - spawns friendly units when triggered
* Stacking - allows player to combine tower-types together at one location
* Mobility - allows player to re-adjust position of tower during gameplay
* Boost - increases range, rate of fire, or damage for nearby towers


---

I like these ideas a lot - but I feel like our computer theme would allow for even more special tower abilities. For example, simple ""programming"" functions that would allow the player to affect the logic for how the tower behaves (like they have in Bloons). 

* Programability - allows player to adjust tower behavior (target selection)

Any other last minute suggestions before we organize all of these ideas into a list to vote for our favorites?

,DestinyJournals,"( Hey, folks! First fanfic for the universe, and a bit more ... gamist than some I've seen posted up, though part of what fascinates me about Destiny is how much of the activities can genuinely be considered in-character. Especially the Crucible. With that, I give you a story for mediocre PvPers like me! )

...

**Green**

*Tap tap tap tap tap tap tap.*

A steady rhythm for an unsteady heart, a boot's sole making contact with the floor of the dropship every quarter of a second. Gloved hands laced together, fingers interlocked to keep them from fidgeting. Three layers of heavy woven cloth, reinforced by the Light, rising and falling with their wearer's quickening breath.

Tierce hated himself for his nerves, for his weakness. He'd stood unflinching against an Archon, punched his burning fist into a Fallen walker and torn out a crewman inside, stared into the guns of a Tombship and dared them to claim him. This was different. This was getting to him in a way he'd expected, but couldn't have fully predicted until now. Until *Discovery* sped like a fired arrow towards a destination he'd carefully ignored until today.

A whisper of movement blurred in the corner of his vision, conical points around a core that observed him with a blinking, cyan eye. The modulated voice of his Ghost, distinctly female, chimed out. “Two minutes until drop. Your vitals are seriously elevated. You don't have to do this...”

“No, Vinh. I think I do.” He stilled the tapping of his foot by pressing it against the cubby underneath the dropship's flight console, just to the side of a manual yaw pedal. “If I back out now, my team is down a man before the match begins... and worse, I'll have let fear beat me without firing a shot. What kind of a Guardian would that make me?”

“It's perfectly safe,” Vinh assured him, hovering around now to his left. “They wouldn't risk Guardians if it wasn't. And I'll be with you every step of the way.”

Tierce felt a grim smile twist his lips. “ 'Perfectly safe', you say, knowing I'm going to die. Probably... a lot. Strange times we find ourselves in, Vinh. Strange times indeed. But... I know all that in my head. It's this stupid thing that's betraying me.” He tapped his chest.

Vinh chirped. “Cardiopulmonary functions appear uninhibited. Are you—”

“Figure of speech, Vinh.”

“Ah.” A moment's pause; a digitized trill. “Thirty seconds until drop. Landing zone locked in.”

Another pause.

“Tierce?”

“Yes, Vinh?”

The Ghost dipped its forward lobes in a nod, an eerily human gesture from such an alien construct. “Good luck down there.”

...

The familiar haze of transmat wore off in two adrenaline-accelerated heartbeats and Tierce found himself standing among five other Guardians. Sigils flashed in his vision as Vinh splashed information about them into his brain. Three Hunters, their cloaks still in the Moon's-lack-of-breeze. A fellow scholar, festooned with a horned helm and an intricate crested robe. Tierce grinned underneath his helm in spite of himself – his Warlock brethren and sisters really did have a flair for the dramatic, sometimes.

And towering above them all, a Titan. His massive fist crackled as he thrust a banner into the ground. One side bore a sigil Tierce didn't know, blue on orange. The other side displayed the white-on-red triangular crest of the New Monarchy.

A crest mirrored on the Titan's sash...

Tierce swallowed hard. Had he been dropped into a territory match without realizing it? Would his doubtless-mediocre performance hurt actual citizens, back in the City?

“Vinh... I—”

“Control.” The icy tone of the Master of the Crucible sliced neatly through his second thoughts. “Bravo Team. One path to victory, Guardians. Dominate your objectives. Destroy your opposition.”

Around him, the two fire-teams that made up Bravo checked their weapons and prepared their manifestations of light. Tierce exhaled hard, his breath caught by scrubbers before it could mist his visor. His Pulsar MSe showed a full clip and full reserve; the familiar weight of his fusion gun rested across his back, and Vinh flashed the icon for his Tamerlane HMG across the bottom of his vision. It was ensconced safely in the Light until needed; hauling a heavy weapon around was a strain Tierce could do without.

“Time to fight, Guardians!”

Tierce's teammates fanned out across the moonscape with practiced ease. Two dashed for the nearby Pikes, making to mount up; a pair of hunters roamed up the slope to the left, and the monstrous Titan of the New Monarchy flipped up onto his Sparrow and streaked dead-center towards the abandoned hab.

The act of checking his weapons had steadied Tierce. It was now a combat like any other. Shoot, kill, channel. Shoot, kill, channel. Don't think about the faces behind friendly visors exploding or the dying screams the moon's tenuous atmosphere wouldn't carry.

He followed in the direction of the Hunters. They'd know what they were doing. Ahead, their icons lit up; Vinh splashed up exclamation marks. Combat.

Hustling up to the doorway, Tierce clipped the corner and slid through. Fire crackled between his fingers, hot and hungry in the void, ready to

**BLAM.**

...

FLASH.

—strike...

Resurrection sickness hit Tierce in the gut like the punch of an ogre. He doubled over, fighting the urge to retch in his helmet. His body alternated between perfect contentment and sending his brain messages that his whole chest had been destroyed by a shotgun.

“Focus, Tierce!” Vinh urged in his head. “Get yourself picked back up, get in there. Your team needs you!”

And damn if the little minx didn't know exactly which button to push. His team needed him. Tierce wasn't about to let a minor matter like a sudden and senseless death slow him down.

This time his Sparrow came to hand and he boosted over the lunar ridges. Here, there was a moment's joy, an exultation that sent the sickness away. He could drive, and no one – for the moment – was going to take that away. It was a contentment hard to keep for more than ten or fifteen seconds; the Master of the Crucible offered ongoing commentary impossible to screen out.

“Lost the lead.”

“*Gained* the lead.”

“Zone C... lost.”

“Keep fighting, Guardians...”

Vinh flashed red encroaching over the diamond marked B. Alpha Team was about to take their second objective...

Gritting his teeth, Tierce gunned his sparrow in the direction of B. If he could get there, he could deny them a capture, set them afire so that

**THWIP.**

...

FLASH.

“I bloody hate snipers,” he rasped to Vinh, and mounted up again. It wasn't quite so bad this time, mostly because whoever had taken the shot had made it a masterfully efficient kill. Huzzah for small mercies.

This time, he brought his Sparrow in close to B, where fighting was most intense. He leaped free of his vehicle, letting it coast through the doorway. The poor thing took half a magazine of autorifle fire and exploded.

That, however, gave Tierce the perfect mark. He fell through a hole in the roof, spun, and lashed out.

A moment's impression of a Hunter's mask, a gun coming around... and he made contacts. The Light sang through him, painful in its purity. More painful for the Hunter. She staggered backwards, her hand cannon shot wide and her whole cloak in flames. His hands shook like autumn leaves but his pulse rifle came up, hard on target. It trilled three times three, and the Hunter collaped.

Her blood was on the wall behind, all over it. The flames had burned most of the flesh from her—

*don't look, don't look, don't look*

had to look. Had to accept the necessity of it. Had to—

**BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM.**

The bullets slammed into his left side, leaching charge from his armor weave and staggering him backwards. He turned and triggered a burst, clipping the approaching Titan for enough to annoy him before the Titan's autorifle marched bullets up his chest and through his helmet.

An impression of red and jagged edges of hadronic plastiweave seared onto his mind as

...

FLASH.

“That was a … a victory!” Vinh enthused in his ear. “Come on, you're just finding your stride now.”

“Call it what it was,” Tierce snapped, staggering forward. “A kill. A *kill.* I...” He couldn't say any more. Something deep and primally ingrained was screaming out. He shouldn't be here. He shouldn't be doing this. Murderer. Murderer. *Murderer.*

Vinh cheebled over comm. “It's all right, Tierce. It's a normal biological reaction.”

“For what? For *humans?* What makes us so special? Why did I kill those Fallen without a second thought?”

“Tierce—”

“Do they have to look enough like me for me to want to throw up in my helmet?”

“Tierce! Interceptor!”

It was technically against the rules for Ghosts to warn combatants, but it didn't do Tierce a huge lot of good. He turn and dashed for cover, but the homing missiles were faster. The first hit squarely in his back, breaking every vertebra and mercifully numbing him to the tumbling maelstrom that was his life in the half a second before the next missile hit.

...

FLASH.

Tierce's knuckles whitened under their gloves. He gripped his rifle so hard his hands hurt.

Anger replaced revulsion.

Were his enemies going to overlook the casual carnage that stained this place? Blithely proceed along as though splattering their fellow Guardians across the dunes was business as usual?

Fine. Then so would he.

Tierce rode back into the fray, but this time kept to the edges. Always scavenging, always lurking. On two occasions he saw a winnable fight and intervened, once swooping in to steal the kill, another time just bracketing a foe with pulse-rifle fire while one of his team's Hunters lined up a headshot.

An enemy caught up with him then, hitting the engine of his Sparrow with a high-caliber bolt. Tierce jumped free of his doomed ride, summoned the Light to cushion his skidding landing. For the longest six seconds of Tierce's life it was a genuine gun battle, trading shots with a roughly equal combatant as they both ducked, weaved, sword, pumped their triggers.

But Tierce had been disoriented from the disabling of his Sparrow, his Pulsar kicked like an angry mule, and he wasn't a brilliant shot to begin with.

The outcome was never really in doubt.

...

FLASH.

**BLAM.**

...

FLASH.

**Thwip, thwip. ... Thwip.**

...

FLASH.

**CRUNCH.**

...

Tierce lost track.

He fought and killed and died so many times that they blurred together in his head and merged into an impression of an eternal run, the scenery flying past on the way to where he would next grapple with a Guardian. He forgot the objectives, save that they were where the fights would usually be found. He spared his teammates only passing thought. Reality condensed down to a solipsitic little ball of heat and need and the sight of his gun.

The individual misery faded, but fatigue accumulated in Tierce's perpetually-removed limbs. He could still move, still fight, but it felt like swimming through molten lead on ancient Venus. The track of his pulse rifle was painfully slow. The weight of the fusion gun caused its barrel to dip every time he moved.

It was only when his fusion gun spat its last burst of burning light and ejected a spent power cell that something broke in from the outside, a reminder that a world outside the gunsight existed.

""Guardian! Stand fast, Guardian! We need to hold this point!""

It wasn't the Master of the Crucible. Instead, the voice came over local comms, its channel tagged with a hexagonal mark.

Tierce blinked slowly. Was it—?

It was. The Titan he'd seen earlier, sash smudged and torn but still defiantly sporting the New Monarcy's triad, waved a massive hand.

""We're behind, but we can still win this! Are you with me, Guardian?""

Numbly, Tierce nodded, too weary to be nervous or tense. ""I'm here.""

""Good. We're a thousand points from a win, they're three hundred, everyone's respawning... and the enemy's all over my motion tracker. Look sharp and try not to die.""

And like that, a realization hit him like a bucket of lunar ice. He was on a team. He was on a team, and this was practice. The orders he'd just received were orders he might someday get in defense of the City, or in a desperate battle to reclaim a lost colony.

In his heart, he realized something he'd been struggling to put into feeling from words. For some, this Crucible was a place to make a name, to gain personal glory. For him, it was a place to become a better warrior. A better Guardian. To excise the weakness that had gripped him all match. To make him worthy of wielding the Light.

""Yes, sir!""

Tierce lowered his pulse rifle and gathered the Light to himself, flinging it through the narrow doorway into the room beyond, where it burst into hungry flame. The motion-signatures beyond hesitated, faded, wary of the burning. A sphere of blacklight flew clear over the building, thrown by his Titan companion, and caught them between two fields of hurt.

They charged.

The first through the doorway got off three shots before the staccato reports from Tierce's pulse rifle and the Titan's hungry autogun punched through weakened armor and put him down. His magazine empty, Tierce stepped foward and slammed the heel of his palm towards the visor of the next foe. Light blazed as fire. A moment of guilty relief – it was an Exo, no horrific sights of seared flesh – before a grenade exploded behind him, flinging him into a wall.

His head pounded. Reality went red around the edges.

Tierce tensed, expecting death. But no death came, and around the two warriors rippled a dome of voidlight. Violet met violet as the shield foiled a nova bomb, splashed motes of glimmering energy down onto him.

Something inside him awoke, a fire tamped down that flared with an inferno's heat.

It burst through his skin with pain so exquisite it crossed back to pleasure. Burning wings spread, and a tiny tendril of flame snaked out to carress the flank of the Titan. They were linked by the light, two parts of a whole.

The Warlock whose kill shot had been foiled caught an orb of white-hot flame in the face. There was no time for burning flesh or hideous sights, only vapor and wisps. The Titan's reloaded autorifle chattered angrily at a fifth oncoming Guardian. Weakened, the opposing Titan staggered through the void shield, only for Tierce to catch him in the chest. The white-hot glowing fist of the warlock punched completely through the sturdy chestplate. For a moment, Tierce held his foe's heart in his hand before heart, armor, flesh and blood were all ash and vapor, gently drifting away.

And the raging maelstrom of light cradled Tierce, comforted him, buffered him against the horror and the revulion. This was the defense of humanity, in miniature. This battle, a reflection of one he'd fight again and again. The Light would sustain them all.

The moment of perfection and power faded, the void shield guttered out, and a lone contrail streaked towards the banner. Tierce watched with bemused detatchment as the rocket smashed into the ground at the foot of the banner and

...

FLASH.

""I know you can do better than that, Guardian."" The steel voice of the Crucible's Master greeted his return to life.

Match-end stats flashed across Tierce's visor. They'd lost. His last stand with the Monarchy's champion had come so close, but all for naught. Sixty-two points. Sixty-two lousy insignificant stupid points. Less than half of what he'd given up with any one of his stupid, senseless deaths.

He'd at least gotten an even kill-death ratio with that last bit of heroics. ... Well, nearly. ... Almost sort of. At least he hadn't been last on his team, an honor that had gone to one of the poor Hunters. Fifth among a team of six of the Tower's elite wasn't terrible, was it?

All rationalization, all justification for a performance in which he'd lost his nerve, then lost his focus. One moment of actual competence couldn't make up for a whole match being dead-weight, a burden to his teammates.

Tierce slumped down into the lunar dust, and barely noticed when it changed back into the stainless steel of *Discovery's* ancient deck.

""Helmet,"" he muttered, and the prison of mesh and plasteel vanished. The ship's air assaulted his nostrils with the tang of ozone and filter-plast. On his hands and knees, he barely made it to the privy before his stomach tried to expel food that wasn't there, hadn't been there for a dozen deaths. He hunched over the head, gripping the seat with both hands, and willed the universe to stop spinning around him, entreated his stomach to stop attempting to heave up his small intestine. Neither worked.

""Tierce, your vitals are close to normal, but you're reading as in pain. Are you all right?""

He swallowd back bile. ""No... no, I'm not, Vinh. I'll be fine soon. But I'm not right now.""

""All right."" Vinh chirred, then a moment later spoke again. ""Tierce, you should know... I'm proud of you. It took courage to keep going back, to fight down those spikes I was reading in your frontal lobes.""

He coughed. ""A shame it amounted to jack and shit...""

""Skill can be trained, Tierce. Marksmanship can be practiced. But a good heart is harder to find.""

Tierce smirked in spite of himself. ""My cardiac muscle is in adequate condition, then?""

""Figure of speech, Guardian. Figure of speech."" And with that, Vinh decoupled and flitted back towards the bridge, to guide them home.

He curled up on the floor of the privy and slept through the whole trip.

...

Collecting the bounty was far less humiliating than Tierce had feared. He handed his match chit over to the Exo collection agent, who gave it a quick scan and confirmed the deposit of resources to his account. Behind him, a long line of Guardians waited to do the same, their eyes holding no particular interest about whether he'd won or lost. He stepped quickly away before he had Vinh pull up his account.

*Crucible record updated. Thank you for your participation, Guardian.*

It wasn't quite enough to make up for the aches and pains of three hours asleep on the floor of the privy, the foggy memories of pain and death that were already beginning to lose coherence in his mind. It was, however, something.

On his way back to the docking bay, though, Tierce found that his exploits hadn't gone completely unnoticed.

""Guardian,"" trilled Kadi, the evening-watch mail collector. ""Package for you.""

He blinked, paused, tapped his chest. ""For... me?""

""5875123-Tierce. Identity confirmed. Please wait while I retrieve your parcel.""

Tierce blinked as he watched the Exo tap across the computer's controls, before he turned to Vinh, hovering nearby. ""Know anything about this, Vinh?""

""I'd like to claim this is my idea."" The Ghost let out a puzzled cheeble. ""But... no, I've no clue.""

Kadi finished the retrieval process a moment later, handing over a datacard and a metal case, securely clasped. ""Package delivered. Imprint here please, Guardian, and have a pleasant day.""

Absently, Tierce did as instructed before tucking the parcel under his right arm. The data-card, held in his left, he read as his steps carried him towards a balcony overlooking the city.


*Guardian,*

*I could see in your stance that the Crucible took its toll on you. Rather than jeering you for your weakness, I want to thank you for your strength in seeing the match through, and for delivering at the end when it counted most.*

*Your gunplay needs work, so I gift you with a tool to sculpt it. This gun rewards precision and care. It will teach you a steady hand, a firm forearm and a keen eye for a worthwhile shot. Use it as long as it remains relevant, then take its parts to improve weapons more to your taste.*

*Turn not to despair or oblivion, but trust in hope. Dare to hope. And, perhaps, remember those of us that likewise dare to hope when the time for your own decision arrives.*

*Regards,*
*Executor Canis of the New Monarchy*


Tierce realized his jaw was hanging open. He abruptly shut it with a click of teeth. ""Vinh, did you read this?""

""Done before you finished the first sentence. But still rereading."" His Ghost cheebled thoughtfully. ""I thought that was a sigil of high rank on his sash. Still, the Monarchy must be desperate for glory if it's sending its senior leadership to the Crucible. What did he send to you?""

A grin touched Tierce's lips. He couldn't help it; cracking open an arms case was like unwrapping a holiday present. He knelt on the grass, then seated himself fully. The left latch clicked, and then the right. With a soft hiss of hydraulic hinges, the reconditioned case opened.

Wordlessly, Tierce slipped his fingers around a retooled grip and lifted the Searcher from its case. It was heavy, this gun, sporting a massive maw and a hefty action that made the term 'hand cannon' a fine descriptor. It wasn't bulky, though; even held out at the end of his arm, it pointed with little fuss. The magazine flipped open with a flick of his wrist, beautifully oiled and jointed, ready to accept and deliver eight high-caliber slugs.

""Vinh,"" he murmured, ""I won't be going back to the Crucible tonight, and not tomorrow. But I do think that sometime in the future... once I get some target practice in with dummies and the Fallen... I may just return.""

He clicked the case closed and rose to his feet. His battered pulse rifle went back into the Light and he bore the Searcher at his side as he turned towards the central concourse.

""C'mon. Let's get something to eat...""

By the numbers, Tierce knew that both he and the weapon were nothing particularly special yet. Inexperienced. Unoptimized. Green. But a future where green had been reforged into violet and gold, a future in which he was a Guardian worthy to defend the City... it now seemed a bit less an impossible dream, more a reality that could yet come to pass.",,False,,0,,Green,,,,,,0.0,,,False,t3_2eutrf,False,,,,,20.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},,,20,,,,self,1409258480,,,,,,True,,1409261873.0,,,,,,self.DestinyJournals,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,t5_302vp,,,,,2eutrf,,,CatImperative,,4,,,,,,,/r/DestinyJournals/comments/2eutrf/green/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyJournals/comments/2eutrf/green/,,1409258273.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441197347.0,,,

**OPERATION CRYOTIC FRONT** - *Dig for valuable Artifacts!*
 
---

A message from a Mystery Associate:
 
Tenno,
 
I do hope you will forgive my concealed identity but dealing in these unsavoury circles demands unusual discretion.
I’m such a big fan of the Tenno, you’ve accomplished so much and with such rudimentary equipment. That’s why I’m concerned about the coming Balor Fomorians. I think we both know your Warframes are simply not sophisticated enough to stop them.
But I can help you... for a price.
You see, I have an appetite for the rare and extraordinary and I’ve recently learned of a fine substance known as Cryotic. If you are willing, I will supply the necessary equipment and coordinates for its extraction. In return, I will enlighten you with what I know about technology that could defeat this Balor threat.
To sweeten the deal I am even willing award bonuses to those of you who exhibit outstanding performance.
I must say, some of you display the inklings of good taste, if our partnership is a success perhaps we will get to know each other better.
Regards,
Your New Associate

**HERE'S WHAT YOU'LL NEED TO DO**
- Play the new Excavation missions! 

- The Location of a ‘Scanning Device’ will appear on your minimap for you to locate. 

- Collect Power Cells dropped by enemies, and bring them to the Scanner to activate it and keep it powered. You can track your Scanner’s power in the map on your HUD. If it reaches 0%, the process will stall until power is restored.

- Defend the Scanner as it searches for a dig site. Once the Scanner has found a site, it will appear on your map. Proceed to that location to find an Excavator that is digging for artifacts.

- Take caution!  Enemy waves will attempt to destroy the Excavator, and you must defend it. The Excavator will also continue to lose power. As with the Scanner, you must collect Power Cells to keep it activated.

- Once the Excavator has uncovered the artifact, you may choose to Extract from the operation or wait for another Scanner and repeat the process.

- There are three available Tilesets for this Operation.

- What is CRYOTIC (New Resource)?

Usually found in extreme sub-zero environments, Cryotic instantly freezes anything it comes in contact with. 
 
---

**WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW**
- If the Excavator is destroyed before it recovers an item, the mission is a failure.

- The Operation is on now until Wednesday, September 3 at 12 PM EDT.

- Operation Cryotic Front is the first introduction of a new mission type that will replace all Survival missions that take place on a terrestrial tile set.

- This Operation introduces Cryotic, a new resource that will only be available in the Excavation game mode.  

- At each of the point levels below and you’ll unlock a new Tileset in the Operation. It’s your choice – continue to dig on Earth or take your efforts to these new areas. Note that each new Tileset will hold more difficult enemies but will provide the opportunity to earn points faster.
 
---

**REWARDS**

With each successful dig, you will receive an amount of Cryotic based on your performance (100 max.) The more Cryotic you earn, the better the Reward – so dig on!


More than 500 pts = Event Badge

More than 1000 pts = Ice Mod Set (4 dual-stat mods)

More than 3000 pts = Latron Wraith and the Polar Glaxion skin
 
---

**CLAN SCORING**

The top three Clans per Clan Tier will receive Gold, Silver, and Bronze Trophies. For Clan Leaderboards, a Clan’s score is the sum of active personal bests.
Please be aware that people joining clans after the event has started will not contribute to their new clans score.

---

**Warframe Changes:**

**Oberon Changes:**
Armor:
• Oberon’s base Armor increased to 150.
 
Smite:
• Projectiles that are spawned after impact seek-to-target, not just spawned in direction.
• Speed up projectiles by 50%.
• Forced Radiation proc on the initial target.
• Forced Knock-down on initial target instead of stumble.
• Forced Puncture proc on all enemies hit.
Hallowed Ground:
• Allies within Hallowed Ground can not be proc’ed.
• Hallowed Ground will remove all existing procs from Allies.
• Armour boosted by 5/10/15/20% per rank for all Allies on Hallowed Ground, with stacking being explored on multiple casts.
Renewal:
• Switch to toggle ability with smaller base cost and energy per second active drain. All Renewal benefits occur when projectile reaches target ally.
• Boost Heal amount 200/250/300/400 per rank.
• When target is fully healed, remove any active proc effects.
• Allies affected by Renewal have slowed bleedout by 20/25/35/45% per rank. This is affected by duration mods. 
Reckoning:
• Forced Radiation Proc added to damage on targets.
• Small radial blind added to slam impact, but only for enemies that survive the damage of the cast. This radial blind will be applied to enemies that move into range after it’s been cast and are blinded by the impact of those being slammed by Reckoning!
 
**Vauban Changes:** 
• Made Vauban's Vortex scale with power range and duration mods.
 
**Nyx Changes:**
• Nyx’s Absorb has had it’s passive energy drain significantly reduced from 10 energy per second to 4 energy per second, and instead now has an energy drain based on incoming damage. This drain is 8 energy per 1000 damage. These drainage values are affected with the use of mods. 
 
**Nova Changes: **
 
• In an effort to compensate for more useful attribution of XP when triggering a chain reaction with Molecular Prime, the main XP is attributed to whoever started the chain reaction. Before, Nova would take the bulk of the attribution. Now,  the ""weapon and instigator"" carry through the whole explosion chain ( if Player A casts Molecular Prime and Player B blows up the room, Player B gets the kills and XP). Similarly, if Player A casts Molecular Prime to Crowd-Control and then use their slowed state to get a nice bow-shot, Player B get weapon XP.
• Fixed some of the cases where two Nova's casting Molecular Prime would have unexpected results (explosion range and strength were always determined by the Nova who cast most recently).
 
**Rhino Changes:**
• Added HUD counter for Rhino Stomp to show how much longer you have left on your CC (and how long to wait until re-stomp). 
 
**Banshee Changes:**
• Banshee's Sonar, and the Enemy Radar/Sense mods ignore security cameras and turrets.
• Banshee’s Sonar now uses Energy Colour. 
 
**Saryn Changes:**
• Saryn’s Miasma can now be cast mid-air. 
 
---

**Changes:**
 
• Changed FX of Laser Doors when affected by Mirage’s abilities to better indicate you’re safe to run through. 

• Update several Foley sounds: more updates to Tenno step, fixed rhythm and step events for wall running.

• Updated Host Election code to work with new squad system (had been disabled since Update 14).

• Added more details to error messages for invitation and join problems (we are hoping that more information will help us isolate any remaining problems with the invitation system).

,Scrolls,"Very much looking forward to the new Waypoints scrolls. But with more and more cards it must seem hopeless for new players to get everything they need. Encouraging players to focus on collecting fun and competitive decks (instead of all cards) might help.

**Suggestion**: expand the shop with regularly available **'Faction meta booster packs'**. 

 * 5000 for a pack of 16 with one of every card of a specific top Decay deck
 * idem for Growth/Order/Energy
 * regularly updated to reflect the current meta
 * option to buy again after 3 days
 * incl. some cool tips &amp; strategies from a top player on how to play the deck

That way even complete newbies should have a reasonable way to get a good deck in little over a week, with only a medium amount of grind. Want to try another faction? Give it a week and you can compete with the best (if you're good enough).

,Colorado,"Yesterday I travelled to Black Mesa to go foraging for edibles and medicinals with some friends and their families. It was a real good time and I very much appreciate them inviting me and taking me to their hunting spots. We found some mushrooms including a couple Porcinis (Boletus edulis), some shrimp Russulas, and a good number of hawkswings (Sarcodon imbricadus), which I’m not fond of. While I was hunting, I picked Arnica montana tops here and there, enough for two pints of Arnica infused oil. Arnica is a valuable medicine for healing bruises, arthritis, strains and sprains. It is considered toxic when ingested. Also, some individuals experience skin irritation when using arnica, so be aware if you try this medicine. I also collected some blue bell leaves (Mertensia ciliata) to eat at home because they taste slightly fishy and have a nice texture in stir-fry’s. My friend Naropa came up with the idea of drying some and using them for seasoning. I think I’ll try it. I found a big, fresh Ganoderma applanatum, the artists conch, which is good medicine, too. 

Finally, we drove down the road to a healthy patch of osha (Ligusticum porteri) and collected a few, keeping in mind that many of these plants are more than 25 years old and they grow very slowly. A little bit of osha root goes a long way, so there’s no excuse to over-harvest it. Osha looks very similar to several poisonous relatives so make sure you know exactly what you are collecting when you take anything in the carrot family. Thank you to Joseph and Chad for clarifying to me how to positively ID L. porteri. It is a valuable medicine for fighting respiratory ailments and boosting the immune system. I took home the roots of 3 plants and I expect they will last me a few years. I’m drying half of them and making a tincture with the other half. On the way home, we stopped to pick some roadside thimble and rasp berries, yum! Overall, a very productive and beautiful day. I have so much gratitude for the forest and what our mother has to offer her children, if only we know what to look for….I didn’t have anything with me to offer back to the earth except water, so I poured a cup of water on a cinquefoil bush as I gave thanks to the earth for being so generous with me.

,discododgeball,"Just want to make sure I keep everyone informed about the latest version! It may be awhile until the update is out because:  

- The update will have a ton of new stuff
- I spent several days working on a demo, and may need some more time  
- I also want to update my trailer / screenshots, that also usually takes up a few days  

I'm aiming for a pretty ambitious update: the goal is to provide a ton of new singleplayer (and co-op) content in the form of challenge modes, with with their own leaderboard and performance-based medals to unlock. These modes will be preset scenarios that give you extra powers and have you (usually) racing for a high score in a set amount of time.

For instance, I've built the following two modes so far:  

- Air Raid: You are equipped with a jetpack and strong homing dodgeball powerup. Your friendly bot teammates will toss you dodgeballs while you are hovering, and you must rain down as much damage on the enemy team as you can. Maybe will only count mid-air KOs.   

- Juggernaut: You are invincible and in an arena with just you and 8 opponents. Score as many points as you can, with bonus points for distance, in 3 minutes. Meant to be a ridiculously fun power trip. 

Also planned are:

- Grand Prix: Run 3 laps of checkpoint course solo in as fast a time as possible  
- Arcade: Score as many points as you can in 3 lives with ridiculously OP powerups, score boosters, etc.  
- Fugitive: You have the Super Ball and perma Monster Truck Tires, avoid getting KO'd for as long as possible vs 4 hard enemy AI opponents  
- Goliath: You are smaller than normal and have laser dodgeballs, defeat 25 enemy AI opponents (all equipped with Huge Dodgeballs) in as fast a time as possible
- Galaxy Dunk: You have perma spring-jump and must collect randomly-generated super balls and score 10 hoop shots while dodging enemy fire  
- etc. etc.

Once you've achieved a certain performance target on each of these modes, you'll unlock special multiplayer settings like 'All Jetpack' or 'All Huge Dodgeball'.  

I'd *like* to try and implement an 'upgrade' system for the Arcade mode where you can unlock and equip certain perks based on your XP level. I still have many questions to resolve about how best to implement this, will make a new post in a few days with details and a request for feedback on this specific feature.

,CookieCollector,"As it stands, the levelling system is absolutely awful. More and more super structures are being added to the game so there is a big emphasis on grinding candies to get a huge boost from these structures. 

Unfortunately, grinding candies is a horribly boring experience. It completely rules out keeping a save going for a long time and forces you to repeatedly reset, buy the same old upgrades and wait to get your candies. I have a few little suggestions to improve the system;

- An active mini game which rewards candies
- An upgrade which increases the exp value of cookies, possibly by more if collected by hand (as with Cookie Boost)
- Boosting the exp value of each cookie in ascending order e.g. the basic cookie is worth 1 exp while Platinum is worth 1,500

,EliteDangerous,"So I was making my way across the cosmos and made a pit stop at the BD+47 2112 Nav Beacon so I could build up some creds with bounties. So there I was taking out the trash for quite some time. Racked up quite a bit of bounties, almost 30k. 

Pew Pew Pew

Fun times.

I'm working on scanning a potential hauler that showed as clean when one of the Federation Vipers started attacking me! There were no other ships in the area so this was not a collateral damage situation. This bucket was gunning for me and me only!

I'm in a sidey with default loadout so of course I was no match for that Viper let alone all 3 of them! I high tail it out of there. I'm going FAO and switching to SR having to watch my temps. I'm boosting my temps up to 120+ and going full pips to eng. When flipping on the supercruise my temps start to climb even more, these Vipers are not letting up. 

My hull is dropping down to the 40% range and I'm still charging up my supercruise with a +12 factor. Things are not looking good for me. I'm checking my wanted status and it shows clean?! WTH is going on??? My temps are reaching 156 when the jump finally kicks in!!

I make it out alive with temps peaking at 170. I slow down ASAP and disengage my cruise. Drop my sidey to 0 on the thrust and kill power plant, immediately my temps start plummeting. I look around to be sure that nobody has followed me. Not sure what those Feds wanted because I had no cargo and enough creds to laugh at.

Not going to be visiting this system for a bit. Going to bypass the station and collect my bounties someplace else. Has anyone else noticed an increase of corruption in the Fed forces?


(but seriously, has this happened to anyone? I didn't find anything on the forums regarding random attacks by the NPC police)

an upgrade to increase the potential of rc starting at 1 non 0.01% per upgrade wont affect the first 75,000 rc

the most expensive item is 100 non why not have a candy theme costing 900 undec where you get 1 candy per collection and a 0.01% chance of a golden cookie

have upgrades to increase the limit for rc and discount the cost of golden structures or reimberse the cost if purchased.

have more collectables maybe some rare ones that appear less often and move faster but give a 10% increase. every day have a spinning wheel to determine the daily gift rather than 9 boxes and use iap for respins. 4x +1 3x +2 2x x3 and one collectable. once all daily collectables are found it is replaced with 10gc

**Diablo 3 Console guide**



8/19/14 Blizzard Released the Console version for Diablo 3 Reaper of souls. The game in all extensive purpose, is identical to
the PC version, but with certain changes to fit the console structure. If your coming from the PC version, with the exclusion of the console
exclusive features, this guide may not provide to much new information for you. However if your a new player exploring the world of diablo 3, and
needed some insight on how to get going, and farming efficiently on your character this is right up your ally.

This guide, will attempt to be factual and straight to the point to take your character from 1-70, and get into a farming structure to maximize
your character potential in the early to mid game.

With this being said let us begin.



+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+
+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+


**Console Exclusive features:**


**Nemesis Mode**

When a player dies to a monster, non-elite/boss, their is a % chance for that monster to become a ""Nemesis"" monster. A Nemesis monster, is a
mob that travels through other players games (on your friends list), attempting to grow in power by slaying additional players. The Nemesis can
only grow a max of 5 times, and upon it being defeated drops gifts of all players it successfully killed.

**How Will I know this is about to happen?**

Your controller will vibrate 3 times. The vibrations last about 2-3 Seconds, upon the third vibration the Nemesis monster will spawn, and it is
up to you to take it out. My advice is once your controller begins to vibrate, get away from all other mobs and prepare yourself to fight the
Nemesis.

Please remember that this feature is disabled in ""Hardcore"" mode character.




**Apprentice mode**

Allows for a higher level character, to ""apprentice"" a lower level character regardless of level. The apprentice gains boosted stats to survive,
increased experience rates, and bonus loot rate.

To get the most of of this mode, or to level up a new character quickly this is a method you can go about it

* High level character that has completed the game, creates a adventure mode game, and invites the low level character

* The low level character runs exp increasing items: Ruby in Helm, Low Level Cains set, Hell Fire ring

* The high level character completes bounties on Torment level 1-6, with the apprentice following him/her

* Repeat this process until the apprentice is max Level

* If you want to further increase the parties exp rate, you can have additional high levels split up during bounties to finish quests even more quickly.


**This is a good effective way to encourage people to group together, make a new character, and increase friends on their respective Networks.**



**Player Mail**

* Allows for players to send items, messages and Gold to other players on their friends list

* This is where you pick up gifts that players send you as well

* When you have mail a  Gold envelope will appear above your resource globe, in the bottom left corner  of the screen. 


Use this system, with your friends, and other people online to gear up quickly.



**Player Gifts**

* Everytime a legendary Item drops it allows for a chance for a gift item to drop as well

* When a Nemisis mob is defeated, a gift item will drop.

* The player name on the Gift signifies who it will be sent to.

* Gifts contain random legendary items, to help players gear up their characters

* With this system in place, it is very much so encourage to make many friends as possible on your console network.

+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+


**Getting started with your new character**


* Complete the opening quest and proceed to your stash

* If you followed the steps above your Signet of Blizzard Ring should be in your stash.

* If your pre-ordered the game your Infernal pauldrons should already be on your character.


**Other items that are possibly available on a new toon**

* Infernal Helm

* Leah's Ring

* Leoric's Gauntlets

* These items might be available to you if you pre-ordered, and or played the Original Diablo 3 console release


**Leveling the ""traditional way""**

* Setting the game mode to ""Normal"" or ""Hard""

* Progressing through story mode until you defeat Maltheal (unlocks adventure mode)

* Setting the game to ""adventure mode"" Performing bounties until level 70



**Leveling the ""Apprentice way""**

* Higher Level friend, invites you into an adventure mode game

* You and your friend run Bounties, until level 70


**Approximate hours for ""Traditional"" leveling to max level**


* ""Normal"" difficulty 10-12 Hours for max level , completing Story mode at around level 35-37

* ""Hard"" difficulty 8-10 Hours for max level , completing Story mode at around level 40-43



**Crafting Materials, and artisans**


* Crafting, and artisan upgrading can be performed in early stages of the game, but it is not necessary.

* The only items that are worth crafting are the Cains set at lower levels, because it provides additional exp gaining while leveling.

* Artisan levels can be upgraded along the way, but isn't necessary until level 70

* Items that are salvaged below level 61 provide crafting mats on all item level plans 1-60

* Items that are salvaged above level 60 provide crafting mats on all item level plans 61-70

* Gems don't need to be upgraded from levels 1-60, I wouldn't start to really get into collecting gems until level 61+

* Marquise gems (they start dropping at 61+), are the baseline for end game gem crafting, these are the gems you should be focusing on.

* Gems are VERY expensive to upgrade, so focus on establishing a solid gear base before maxing out your gem supply.

* Enchanting items should really take a backseat initially, more often or not you will be replacing gear consistently until level 70.


So in general if you would like to experiment with crafting levels 1-60 materials are fine to use. However once you are at level 61+ you are
strongly advised to save all materials that drop, instead of crafting, until your are level 70. This is to ensure that you should have materials 
to work with when crafting, or re-rolling your initial gear sets.


**To long didn't read (TLDR)**

* Pick up everything 

* Don't spend any gold, unless on repairing gear

* Don't Craft anything until 70, unless it's the low level Cain set

* Don't upgrade gems until level 70

* Don't enchant anything until level 70

**How to approach the early game**


Max level ---&gt; Upgrade all Artisans ---&gt; Initial Rare item set ---&gt; Torment level 1 ---&gt; Ring of Royal Granduer ---&gt; Aughilds/Cains Set ---&gt; Building towards Mid Game.




**Max level**


* Utilizing The ""Traditional"" or ""Apprentice"" leveling method

* The game ""truly"" begins at level 70, this is your first priority over everything else.

* Save all Gold acquired while leveling

* Pick up, and salvage all items, that are not upgrades 

* Don't bother with saving gems that are not marquise or higher (Lv 61+)


+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+
+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+


**Upgrading all Artisans**

If you have been saving all your gold, picking up everything and salvaging it, once you hit level 70 upgrading all artisans levels to max should 
be very easy. You won't be getting a lot of use out the Jewel crafting artisan just yet. Your focus should be in getting accustomed to the enchantress,
and the black smith.


**Enchantress**

**How she works**

* Myriam allows for one STAT roll on an item 

* She will list what materials, and the gold amount it cost to do a re-roll on that specific stat of that item

* Primary stats can only be re-rolled for other primary Stats

* Secondary stats can only be re-rolled for other secondary stats

* Legendary items require 1 Forgotten soul per re-roll

* Legendary Jewelry (Rings/Amulets) will require a specific upgraded gem.

* Every re-roll increases the base-line cost of gold ""EXCLUDING"" Jewelry items (rings/amulets)


**Black Smith**

* Haedrig allows for the Breaking down of items, and crafting of gear

* While defeating enemies their is a % chance for plans to drop

* To have Haedrig learn a new crafting plan, he must meet the appropriate artisan level, and you must select it from your item bag
in your inventory, under ""crafting items"" to learn the plan to the blacksmith

* In this version of the game, Haedrig is also the npc you use to craft rings, and amulets

* Crafting items require Gold, and Crafting mats

* Legendary items require 1-2 Forgotten souls per craft


**Jewel Crafter**

* Shen allows for the combining, removal, and socketing of gear with gems.

* Marquise is the base level gem for all higher level gems

* Every 3 gems of the same type upgrade to (1) of the next level of gem, at higher levels though Deaths Breath is required along with the gold cost.

* I STRONGLY ADVISE, to not upgrade gems to quickly, or your gold will deplete very quickly.

**Initial Rare item set**

Nothing to complicated here, a rare item set is just a set of items, anyone can put together for the sole purpose of getting you into torment
level 1. The reason for getting into torment level difficulty, is to allow your clas specific set items to start dropping.


**Terminology**

* Primary Stat= Str, Dex, Int (Specifically for your class)

* Crit = Critical Hit chance

* Crit Dmg = Critical Hit Damage

* Damage % = Increase Damage %

* Life % = Increase Life Bonus 

* Attack Speed= Increased attack Speed

* All Res= Resist all Elements


**STATS YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR**

* Helm: Primary Stat, Crit, Socket &lt;or&gt; Int, Crit, Attack Speed &lt;or&gt; Int, Vit, Crit

* Shoulders: Primary Stat,Vit,Armor/All resistance/ Life%, Increase &lt;skill&gt; damage

* Gloves: Primary Stat, Attack Speed, Critical Chance, Critical Damage

* Ring 1: Primary Stat, Attack Speed, Critical Chance, Critical Damage

* Ring 2: Primary Stat, Attack Speed, Critical Chance, Critical Damage

**Ring of Royal Grandeur**

**What is the ""Ring of Royal Grandeur**

http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/ring-of-royal-grandeur-3qRFop


**How do I get one?**

* You have a % chance to get one from openning Act 1 Bounty reward Cache Bag from Tyrael
 
* You can also get it from act 4 Bounty bags, but your chances are dramatically increased in act 1


**Do you mean to tell me their are act specific legendaries for each act?!?!**

Yep here it is:

http://www.diablowiki.net/Horadric_Cache


**Why do I need it?** 

* Reduces the set cost bonuses by 1  I.E. a 3 piece set bonus of 500 int, would only require 2 pieces as long as the ring is equipped.

* Used the ""End game"" Jade Set Build

* Used with Zuni massa Set

* Used with Aughilds set

* Used with Cains Set

* Used with Black thorne's Set

This is just a guide (one of a three part series) to help new people in the world of Diablo, have a set list of things to build towards to get their character farming efficiently. If you are a 
Diablo veteran this isn't anything that you haven't heard before. There many more things that we can cover about this game, but I do not want to overload the new players. I hope this can give
a sense of how people usually start building a new character in the world of Diablo.

,Blacklight,"    &gt; before text, copy it with that first to quote making it easier to answer in context. Or just answer :) and I'll gleam it from context.
 
How would I go about creating the fastest but powerful class for ps4 domination? I'm good with all guns minus the M4X and have firewall already, just wondering opinions for domination. This should be armour, stealth ps4 camos for maps, strong but fast guns with accuracy, and lastly gear if applicable to armour. 
 
How to earn massive gp fast, as of now simply onslaught wave 3 restart and repeat if the only one for good gp fast. 
 
What are the plans for elemental ammunition?
 
Will bow and arrows ever be explosive / seeking or small seeking where it curves just lightly to the left or right if it just barely misses the person. What about sights? Lastly, drill arrows that pierce enemies or medium cover?
 
Will there be hrv scopes? Aka 2-3 seconds of hrv with a 7-10 second recharge. 
 
Why does that bastard machete not lunge every time and of will just slash and then lunge after a random swing miss. I love my machete, but dang. 
 
Can you move with shooting with cloak active? Mk2 of course. 
  
Will we get a suicide option in the pause screen? I get under the map, by accident, multiple times or spawn with no gun and just need a death to get back to normal. 
 
Onslaught! WHY tokens not do anything? I get 40 bronze a game and not a single 2k xp or my 100 gp from silvers. And will we get a hard mode or something for more reward vs more challenge. 
 
Onslaught. Best build opinions, any gear, for solo survival and winning. I usually play with bad ransoms where I carry objectives and 70% of kills. 
 
Idea, would anyone like a chakram or boomerang type weapon similar to throwing knife but returns, causing a catch animation to take play for 2 secs. 
 
Speaking of throwing knifes, can you collect it after throwing it and it misses or hits? Arrows vary, 100% pick up for misses but 40% for bodies. Also can you pick up other peoples knives? What about other peoples arrows?
 
Why is there no bullet penetration?
 
Seriously annoying, why can't I buy emotes for gp. I want roar and bring it, but not for zen. 
 
Will we get achievement based titles or emblems? Like ""Hardened"" for 500 hardsuit kills, while it, or ""Hard on stealer"" for burning out and stealing the hardsuit x times.
 
Can we get 90 day boosts or 30 or Gp bought boosts for xp/gp? I buy gp boost but paying 7500 for 3 days would be easier than throwing 5 on my account to pay 75 a time. 
 
Will search and destroy be boosted, like either more xp per kill (because entire match respawn) or like 20-40 go per round if you win, 10 for completion if lost. EG win 6 of 10 get 120gp bonus, loser gets 40gp. 
 
Would getting more use of the ammunition pack be possible? 2 uses per life is horrible compared to other gear, but 2 uses plus yours is auto don't (so 3 technically) and it recharges after 10-15 sec. Also only used it twice but can't remember if it gave heavy/gear refill, but that would be nice if it did.

&gt;**VampiricTofu**: ""It's not that I refuse to speculate, it's simply that the truth will most likely never be released and if it will be it'll most likely be a long time from now, from the Grumps themselves. From speculating you're not going to find the facts. That's why speculating about Jon is annoying. You're never going to find the facts on why he left, it reminds everyone of the drama when he left, and it makes everyone wish that the speculators would just shut up so that they can enjoy actually talking about Jon without talking about when he left or enjoy talking about actual Game Grumps stuff in general.""

&gt;**VisitorFromImgur**: ""There is a certain immorality to watching and consuming content whose lead creator is hellbent on hiding the truth from viewers, as well as being ethically questionable in behavior and personality.""

&gt;**VampiricTofu**: That's true, which is why it does make it a bit odd to watch sometimes. But the creator simply wants to move on. People should try and respect his decision, though that pretty much will never happen since people always have to speculate. It wouldn't be as bad as long as no one was posting something that could easily be fake such as something from /b/. It would be different if Arin did something actually bad to make Jon leave, but it's a bit hard to believe that Arin is really that bad of a person--simply...well, stupid about hiding truth.""

&gt;**VisitorFromImgur**: ""Arin's zero tolerance policy on Jon related subjects is demonstrated in the 2014 RTX Panel. Aside from some awkward glances attempting to feign nonchalance, Arin refused to acknowledge the ""is Jon under the table"" joke question. This was not a formal inquiry into their professional or personal relations, it was a joke. The reality is that even if the execution of it is moronic or myopic, Arin is committed to avoiding any mention of Jon. This is why I am inclined to believe that whatever caused the breakup has relatively negative connotations, connotations that Arin knows will damage not only GG credibility as a ""fun happy jokey show"" but also to his own works. And as a content creator whose work now almost solely derives from his own opinions on subjects, he cannot afford that.""

&gt;**VampiricTofu**: ""I can see where that comes from, though if it were to hurt GG's credibility and make Jon leave, I figure he would've said what it was. But I guess that's where the sole dividing point in the opinion is, since at this point we'd be going back and forth saying why Jon would say he left or why not.""

&gt;**VisitorFromImgur**: ""I would be an idiot to assume there's one solid reason why Jon left. I would be a bigger idiot to insist upon speculation being truth if one gathers enough contestant evidence for it. But it is important to consider why people argue over why Jon left and its implications of being part of a larger issue of GG's continued existence into present day. Is GG different today than it was when Jon was here? Yes. Is it better? That's a matter of taste and opinion. The priority that the community should be taking is discussing whether or not it's possible that GG has devolved into a vehicle for Arin to gather a broad audience to test different content on. GG's original intent (as much as I can gather from Jon and Arin's silly introduction videos) was to provide a show in which two Grumps would play games, discuss game design (even if the discussion lacked good rhetoric from both sides), and make jokes. It is completely within Arin's right to evolve the show to feature different content as a whole, but GG itself has mostly shifted its direction and overtones into jokes while subduing the idea that it is a platform for the Grump and Not So Grump to discuss design. Jon's departure is a direct consequence of this.

On a side note, Jon's own inability to disclose information makes me think of legally binding nondisclosure agreements.""

&gt;**VampiricTofu**: ""Oh, that's pretty interesting considering when people discuss why Jon left they usually refer to it as if there's one reason (such as the speculation about Arin hitting Nicole or something ridiculous like that). I see what you mean about Jon's leaving being an important issue of Game Grumps today, but I don't see how it's possible to ever find the truth. Which again brings me back to my speculation argument (about it annoying the people who just want to watch the show and enjoy the community without the Jon drama), so with that said I can't find a reason that discussing it would be important unless more information came a long--trustworthy information.""

&gt;&gt;[important?] **VisitorFromImgur**: ""Discussing the reason isn't the important part, it's why and how GG has developed since then and how it differentiates from what it was and what people watched it for. Complacency in the wake of lowered quality is causing deterioration in expectation, allowing Arin to get away with more executive changes to GG, which is bad. And yes, people always seem to insist on one single reason as opposed to a culmination of them.""

&gt;**VampiricTofu**: ""Oh, now I see where you're coming from. That's all true, though I think it might have differed from the beginning of this conversation. I think when quality becomes so low, though, people will do something. Some have already noticed but rather than do/ask anything have just stopped watching--which makes perfect sense. True, it deteriorates their expectation in Game Grumps, but those sort of changes always happen in the future that we have no clue what to expect from--such as the subscribe button at the top of the videos.""

&gt;**VisitorFromImgur**: ""Change is inherent and expected from a company/show. It's adapting to both internal and external influences. I watch GG more selectively (only certain series, particularly ones where it doesn't feel like the comedy is treading water on ""funny sounding names"" or weak 10 second role play of npcs) than I have in the past because I have come to accept that GG is a different show now. I have no problems with watching less because of that. If it comes to a point where its content and my own standards are no longer compatible, I will stop watching. But to those who blindly watch GG out of habit even when they don't really enjoy it, they need to stop supporting Arin's ""I wanna try this now"" habit, which has left us with the subpar music/comedy content of StarBomb and TableFlop.""

&gt;**VampiricTofu**: ""Well it's possible those parts are opinions--considering I do genuinely enjoy StarBomb and some episodes of TableFlip (admittedly, TableFlip can be boring sometimes, so I see what you mean though), but trying something different may make it more entertaining and funny to watch, which is why people give it a try. Considering that there are people who like Starbomb and Tableflip, I think it's only your opinion in getting in the way--not to offend in saying that. If it comes to a point where regular watchers do find it ridiculous, though, I can see their support of it stopping.""

&gt;**VisitorFromImgur**: ""I said subpar, I didn't say bad. But Arin's abilities in music and rapping are questionable. I'm pretty sure you won't meet many people who will say the first thing they think of when you mention Arin are either of those. Part of the issue in acknowledging that people like it is due to Ego's massive reputation and fan following prior to the production of both. There's something I refer to as Associative Creator Interest, which is basically what occurs when two entities of fame and fandom meet to collaborate. In theory, since the end product is a creation of both entities and features concepts that both are known for, it will be enjoyed by the collective whole. However, since it is possible for the two entities to be of differentiating popularity, the fans that each side will attract will be uneven. Going from this, there is then a disproportionate number of respective fans that will be exposed to and most likely subscribe to the entity of the other. NSP's popularity was modest, but relatively low in comparison to Egoraptor and JonTronShow. ACI boosted his subscriber count significantly after he joined the GG group.

&gt;Arin's popularity has reached cult status from his followers. His on screen persona is loud, in charge, and commanding, reinforcing the atmosphere of absolute obedience and inability to question his opinions, even if it's a joke. It is possible his real personality reflects this as well.

&gt;The point I'm attempting to make is that these derivative content shows/products can be of lower quality than the parent franchise and still be accepted because of their origins. It's the same as Skyward Sword's assigned role in the Zelda Sequelitist. Arin proclaims that because of its parents' reputation, it needs to make no effort to innovate and maintain quality because it rides on the success of past ideas. I think this is bad, and I think Arin is a bad person for encouraging/allowing/tolerating this. It doesn't matter if it's his idea, Suzy's or Polaris'. Pragmatic and profitable as it is, I do not feel ethically justified in accepting GG's continued existence as it is right now.""

It went on for a few more exchanges, but it more or less turned into an exchange of opinions rather than anything important.

,archeage,"**Eco-Fuel**

If we want to be upset about something, this should be it. Here's why:

As of launch this could practically become a required item in order to get your large farm. Previously it was fairly difficult to pirate on the open waters (clipper vs clipper) because you really have to be positioned well in order to harpoon a boat that moves at the same speed as yours. This is why pirates either sit near the choke points, hide behind islands, or wait by the docks. These places are close enough to safe zones (mostly) that it's still a medium to low success rate attacking passing clippers. Early on crafting fuel isn't a real possibility unless you know someone who spams alchemy, and this will still take a few days. IIRC Eco friendly fuel increases the movespeed of the clipper from a comfortable 11.1m/s to a powerful 15.1m/s at the cost of 225 credits per 10 minutes, or roughly 8 gold via auction house. 225 credits is pretty affordable for a large guild of founders, 8 gold is a bit worse for someone whose silver pack credits covered a glider and some inventory expansion. With this item being available in the marketplace/auction house, pirates are able to catch traders with far less effort, just by sitting between the two continents and keeping their eyes peeled, popping  fuel and chasing them down in whichever direction they run. A few strategically placed clippers by a large guild could easily block most small groups of players from progressing, with a potentially unlimited supply of fuel. Now to return things to normal you'll need to buy fuel as well.

**Sandglasses**

While the premise may be unpleasant, and this could potentially escalate into more crafted items ending up in marketplace, this is what it actually does. Alchemy is by far the most profitable vocation early game. Reaching 10k alchemy opens up so many avenues of profit that it's almost sickening. I say this as an alchemist. There's a reason it's one of the most played vocations in the beginning and this leads to a saturated economy months later when half of the players are alchemists. Well shit we aren't making money on sandglasses anymore. Now we'll have to resort to making oils/potions/lunafrosts/gems and selling them at 100-500% markups (as we were already doing) due to the ridiculous early game bottleneck. Really a bummer that alchemists cant sell sandglasses for 50g in the first week now. I made 1k+ off of them, and selling viscous oils for 60g ea doesn't hurt either. Sandglasses in the marketplace is not detrimental to the economy at all. All this does is put a price ceiling on an item that really should have one already, and takes a step towards balancing a vocation that is needed for practically every other vocation to progress. No one should be paying 20-50g to repair a clipper.

**Charms**

Personally I think the charms should be added to printing, as this vocation is currently very limited, and a little too focused for it to be a viable path to take early on. However, after seeing the effect the charms have on the economy, and on regrades, I think we're all over-reacting. When it comes down to your overall cost per regrade attempt, the charm ends up being a small fraction of the total price. Sure at celestial when you're paying 2k per, it will become more significant, but lets remember that the effect of the charm is a multiplier, not an additive. This means if the chance was 10% before, with a 50% boost it has now become 15%, not 60%. As someone who spends a lot of money on MMO's the charm is entirely negligible, and I end up buying 30 labor pots for every 1 charm. Currently the price of weapon regrade scrolls is around 40g on CBT4, it's fluctuated alot but this is a pretty solid average. The cost to use the scroll to upgrade my lvl 50 weapon from arcane to heroic is 45g. The charm costs 150 credits, which is around 5-6g based on the going rates of other cash shop items (labor pots being the most reliable sale). So in the end we're looking at a total cost of 91g per attempt, 6 of which is the charm. Most people craft their own regrade scrolls, as they should, and this reduces the cost per attempt by 10-20g depending on how many sunpoints (previously sunpearls) are currently in circulation. I know the price for the charms goes up with higher rarities, but I think if you have enough money to blow on 10-20 regrade attempts to get unique+ then you can probably handle the charms too.

Charms are an item that are necessary for regrading to be viable. Making them available outside of the marketplace (where they exist in KR) would require work by XL. They've made regrade scrolls more affordable for your average player to use, and as such have stimulated the market. Before the charms existed, regrade sales even at very small profits were few and far between. With the charms, there is a very steady flow in the auction house. This allows players to level up their printing while actually getting some income. Instead of dropping slippery slopes all over the place, and claiming TRION is trying to ""test the waters"", ""double dip"" etc, lets just be glad that this item exists. It's even low priced imo.

**Cosmetics**

Let's consider why trion is adding these potentially ""game breaking"" items to the marketplace instead of adding more costumes. Costumes are abundant in korea/russia, they know we want them and they have plenty of them to sell. These will not affect the economy nor change anything other than the way we look (and potentially a few bonus stats). There is no testing to be done with costumes. They released enough items that we could make sure the fusion/costume systems were properly implemented and boom, test complete. If they poorly localize a costume does it have serious economic impact? NO! If they test adding items like charms and sandglasses post launch can it saturate the hell out of the market? Yes. As of launch any item added to marketplace could be hoarded and abused before it has time to be removed. Right now is the perfect time to see how these items affect our current game. Instead of complaining about the future of the business model I really feel like the majority of this subreddit needs to look at what these items do. All we're doing by collecting torches and pitchforks is showing trion that the playerbase is ignorant and quick on the draw. If charms and sandglasses are removed because of our own sense of entitlement I'll be very sad for the state of our community. Trion knows we don't want p2w items, and as far as I'm concerned they haven't added any.

Sorry for the wall of text

,smashbros,"Hey guys, Hiro Protagonist here. Me and my friend ShmulTheShmelly are looking to start a Project M weekly in the Richmond area. The city and surrounding counties have a pretty large Smash community, but right now the only major events in MD/VA all take place over 2 hours away from the city.

We need to find her now. Zigzagoon, help me! I need keywords, anything, something she would say, something I haven’t thought of, anything!”

Z: “Well… There’s another ice cream party going on. Fennel might be there! She loves ice cream parties!”

B: “It’s worth a shot. Try it.”

(Zigzagoon pushes buttons on the computer, a scene appears on the computer with everyone in it)

B: “Well done Ziggy.” (a warning light appears on the computer screen) “Oh no. Oh, nonono! The universe is falling apart. It won’t last much longer. Remember what we discussed earlier. Bring me everything. I’m getting her out of there.”

Z: (begins to run around and collect stuff Bill has been preparing) “Then she’ll come back?”

B: “Yes, she will come back. Afterwards, she will try to find me. Any additional contact between our universe and this one will be disastrous. Do not let her look for me, ok? Can you promise that?”

Z: “I… Ok. I promise. Will you contact us when its safe to bring you back?”

B: “Of course I will, Zigzagoon. It may not be safe anytime soon though. I’m going to be gone for a while now. Keep Fennel company, all right? She will need you when she gets back. I’ve programmed these machines to dramatically boost the walls of this universe to an even higher level than they normally are, so nothing should be able to get in here during or after the swap.”

Z: “Oh, ok… I will. Are you going to save everyone?”

B: “I’m going to try my best.”

*Everything suddenly turns darker*

B: “Oh no… It’s starting faster than I thought. I need to go. Good bye, Zigzagoon!”

*Fennel extends her arm, the sky disappears, the barrier that keeps outsiders outside is gone*

Z: “Bye Bill! Be safe!”

(Bill takes all the equipment Zigzagoon gave him, and presses a button. He looks scared for a second, but takes a moment to collect himself.)

B: “I really, really hope this works…”

(He vanishes, and in his place Fennel appears. The monitor showing the other universe goes dark, and a ton of machines tracking it immediately turn off)

F: “Aah! What’s happening…” (she looks around, and notices Zigzagoon in the room, whos eyes light up upon seeing her) “Ziggy!!! Are… Are you here? Did Bill rescue me? We need to head back! Something really bad is about to happen to this universe, and we need to stop it before its too late!”

Z: “Fennel!!! You’re here! We know what’s happening. Bill is trying to fix it. He will talk to us when it’s safe, but for now we need to hide here. He told me to keep you company and wait for him to talk to us.”

F: “No, we’re going back! I’m not letting him face myself alone!”

(Fennel tries to access the machines in the entralink, and all of her computer programs, but they’ve all been locked. All data and memory of the past few weeks have been removed, and there is no way to tell where the other universe is or any trackable data for it. All signals have been removed, and she can’t change any of the machines that are working on fortifying the walls of the universe.)

F: “No! Bill! Bill! Don’t do this! Don’t you dare do this to me!”

Hello everyone,

I enjoy collecting cards (especially finishing the card drops so I can {unlikely} qualify for booster pack drops), however, I have slowly realized and accepted that my infinite backlog will never be dented at this rate. As a result, I have decided to add a few games I intended to play onto my trading list. **Please note that I have decided to add MY VALUATION of each game. This is simply how I PERSONALLY view each game, and will hopefully help people gauge bartering potential, and does not mean that is a fixed price. For example, a game that I value at over a key will be harder to barter down - and be advised that many games I offer for trade are ones that I have been on the fence regarding playing it myself (and reviewing). Unique games interest me, so many games are potential review practice for me. Keep in mind that most ARE NOT FIXED SALE/TRADE PRICES. I think it should also be mentioned that instead of considering how much the game you are interested in has sold for (historical lowest price), DO NOT FORGET to consider how much cheaper you are getting a game for (compared to your alternatives). Thank you for your time.**

,respectthreads,"**THIS THREAD HAS BEEN UPDATED. PLEASE LOOK AT THE OVERVIEW OF SAMUS' SUITS AND BEAMS.**

**People coming here from WWW**: I feel that it is my obligation to note that this Respect thread is, in my opinion, missing a GREAT deal of information about Samus' Equipment (like Morph Ball and Speed boost). If you have anything to add to this thread, please message my Alt Account /u/Kotetsuya, as that is where I spend most of my time. Thanks.

Omni-Samus Respect Thread:

Alright, so I know that there is already a [Respect Thread for Super Metroid's Samus](http://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/1yb47o/respect_super_metroids_samus_aran/), however I'll be going over the strength that Samus holds at her utmost prime. Every Upgrade, Every Energy, Missile, and Bomb Tank, Every Weapon, and I shall be pulling this information from all of the Metroid works out there, including the Manga.

Let's start from the beginning. 

---

&gt;**Notable (And Various) Manga Feats**:

- Here is a [Full List and Quick Overview](http://imgur.com/a/SRjaK) of what will be addressed in the section below. If you don't have time to read the wall of text, click the link.

Samus was [infused with Chozo DNA at a young age](http://i.imgur.com/3xb3rmC.png). After she was fit to survive on Planet Zebes, she began training. She had a [Rough time](http://i.imgur.com/B3wCyKK.png) at first, but despite her rocky start, her agility was [something to behold](http://i.imgur.com/RKDCmSM.png). And she didn't let that pesky [power suit slow her down either.](http://i.imgur.com/RUhSVe6.png) She was a fast learner, and just hours after that pathetic first miss, she was [handling her arm-cannon like a pro](http://i.imgur.com/8jHklKo.png).

Later, after graduating from the Galactic Federation Acadamy, she found herself [overlooking a Space-pirate infested town several hundred yards away](http://i.imgur.com/9mpFiOZ.png). Upon witnessing the space-pirates [threatening to kill a child](http://i.imgur.com/U8yTsrc.png) she disobeyed orders and dashed to the aid of the child in moments, [shielding her from all harm](http://i.imgur.com/RZ602KE.png) and just moments later she's [dodging lasers to lay down some hurt](http://i.imgur.com/pSVY47S.png) on those pesky pirates.

Several days later, she finds her and her squad on a hostile Zebes, with space pirates hot on her tail.  While escaping into orbit, the pirates are right behind her group. What does she do? [Latches herself to the back of the ship and lays down covering fire](http://i.imgur.com/g87Oau5.png) until they can break away. 

Several years later, Samus has grown into a full-fledged bounty hunter, but even as a gun for hire, she can't resist the pull to avenge her fallen Chozo Planet, and try to take it back from Mother Brain. As she descends into the depths of the hostile planet, she comes upon Kraid. At first, she tries to take him down with a regular power beam but it just [bounces right off](http://i.imgur.com/10xtLi1.png). After [being crushed by the multi-ton creature](http://i.imgur.com/G9zewPv.png) Samus is able to retaliate, and [blows his foot off with a single bomb](http://i.imgur.com/9zyZMaF.png). As soon as she's free, she lands the Killing blow on him [with a single missile to the mouth](http://i.imgur.com/z9PbGSY.png).

Shortly after her Fight with Kraid, Samus finds herself standing before a Chozo statue where her Trainer, the Chozo who donated his DNA to her as a child, was killed by Ridley. Upon refelcting about the incident, Grey Voice's ""Spirit"" contacts her, and presents her with a ""gift"" in the form of the [Varia Suit](http://i.imgur.com/l0vkE6Z.png). Shortly after obtaining the new suit, she is confronted by her nemesis Ridley. Immediately, he begins bombarding her with Plasma Beams. Despite [taking a direct hit to the shoulder](http://i.imgur.com/HPfzzxL.png), the Varia suit remains [undamaged](http://i.imgur.com/xHeqjjV.png). Samus retaliates with a three-step-plan to defeat Ridley. She switches between [Wave beam](http://i.imgur.com/PafRUAv.png), her iconic [Ice beam](http://i.imgur.com/bluWMlE.png), and a [standard missile](http://i.imgur.com/ZdZVhMm.png), all within the span of a few short seconds, immediately overpowering Ridley and dispatching him.

---

&gt; The **""Gravity""** of the situation.

A few of you may already know this, but when Samus was taken to Zebes as a Child, she was taken to a planet that has a much greater Gravitational Pull than Earth. Just how much? Well, there has been some debate about that, but allow me to show you my own calculations. Feel free to critique them as necessary. 

[**Click Here to view all of my work and explanations!**](http://i.imgur.com/XNVkW0S.png)
 
So, Terminal Velocity on the Planet Zebes is just shy of Mach 257,194. That's almost 1/3rd the speed of light! If we compare that to Earth’s 9.81 m/s^2, that rounds out to **953** times Earth’s Gravitational force. She trained in that environment for her entire young adult life, and she didn’t just survive. As you can see in the Manga Scans above, she thrived, developing abilities far greater than any normal human.

**When Using this in a Battle,** Please keep in mind that this, is in fact, a Fan-Calc that takes a single stat from a single game and runs with it. MOST people will accept this feat tentatively at best, and most commonly, throw it out as a Writer error. Then again, it IS a stat that has not been changed in future games, so it's up to you to decide if you want to use this.

---

&gt; Crunching the **Numbers**.

Over the span of the 11 games Samus has picked up QUITE a few Items. Let's go over exactly how much of each Missile, Energy Tank, Super Missile, and Power Bomb Samus gets. 

[**Click here for an overview of Samus' Item count!**](http://i.imgur.com/OmtcbD2.png) 

EDIT: In the above image, the Power Bomb count is incorrect. The official count should be 160. I missed 10 that were the starting number in Fusion. Thanks to /u/MisterDoubleYum for pointing that out!

---

&gt; **The Armory:**

Now to go over the Collective Information about all of the Equipment and Upgrades in all games. I will be combining repeat entries like the Power Suit, Varia Suit, Missiles, etc unless there are specific differences in certain games that are notable. **If I happen to miss any, PLEASE let me know.**

&gt; **Suits:**

- The [Power Suit](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Power_Suit):

The Power Suit is Samus' Most Basic of Suits. It comes with the standard [Arm Canon](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Arm_Cannon) that fires the [Power Beam](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Power_Beam) for combat, and [Oxygen Supply Equipment](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Oxygen_Supply_Equipment), which helps her breath in certain atmospheres, such as the extreme heat of Norfair on Zebes, Magmoor Caverns on Tallon IV and Sector 3 on the BSL. It also allows her to breath in space and underwater Indefinitely. Aside from standard Durability, the suit also offers enhanced mobility to compliment her acrobatic skills, and augmented physical strength.

The suit itself was designed for modular adaptation and upgrading that allows Samus to interact with a wide variety of devices, weapon systems, etc. It also comes stock with 99 Energy Units of Shield, which, obviously, can be expanded to much higher levels of defense. When the shields drain to zero, and the suit is unable to protect her any longer, it de-materializes, leaving Samus with her [Zero Suit](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Zero_Suit) Which I will cover later. 

While active, the Power Suit bonds with Samus biologically, and cannot be taken off without her cooperation. It has been observed on many occasions that the methods which Samus uses to remove the Power Suit is to have it dematerialize with a bright flash. When the suit is inactive, Samus is able to retain the upgrades within herself until it becomes active again. It has also been observed that she can have it materialize at will, suggesting that this suit is not meant to be dismantled to be removed like regular armor, and that it is somehow put on or taken off by using an energy-to-matter reaction. The Helmet, however, can be removed manually. 

**Feat of mental Fortitude:** Samus' Power Suit requires superhuman levels of concentration and mental determination to operate efficiently.

- The [Varia Suit](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Varia_Suit):

Also known as the Barrier Suit, the Varia Suit reduces incoming damage taken from all sources by around 50% (Depends on the game), nullifies damage from Acid completely, slightly increases speed, and protects Samus from extreme heat and sub-zero temperatures. 

- The [Gravity Suit](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Gravity_Suit):

As its name implies, the Gravity Suit is known for negating gravitational effects to what amounts to the zero gravity effects in space, and allows her to move in fluid unhindered by the resistance and pressure it would normally exert. The Gravity Suit also enhances the visor so it can give a better, clearer view while underwater, and also negates damage sustained from contact with magma. The suit reduces all incoming damage by 75% (Adds on 25% to the Varia Suit's Defenses.)

- The [Phazon Suit](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Phazon_Suit):

The Phazon Suit makes Samus immune to radiation from Blue Phazon and allows her to channel pure Phazon into the Phazon Beam. Other than this, there is not much more notable info about this suit. 

- The [PED Suit](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/PED_Suit):

Thanks to the PED Suit, Samus can enter (Hypermode)(http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Hypermode) and use Phazon against opponents. However, this costs one energy tank, and if she stays in Hyper mode too long, it will permanently damage her, eventually turning her into Dark Samus.

- The [Dark Suit](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_Suit):

The Dark Suit filters out roughly 80% of the corrosive effects of Dark Aether's atmosphere so that Samus only loses approximately 1 unit of energy per second (as opposed to 5 energy per second with the Varia Suit). That's.... About it...

- The [Light Suit](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Light_Suit):

The Light Suit renders Samus completely invulnerable to the damaging effects of Dark Aether. The suit allows Samus to traverse Dark Water without taking damage, as well as walk through swarms of [Ingstorm](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Ingstorm) and ride on [Light Shafts](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Light_Shaft).

- The [Hazard Shield](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Hazard_Shield)

The Hazard Shield  is a suit enhancement that protects Samus from the environmental hazards of [Fuel Gel](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Fuel_Gel) and the [Acid Rain](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Acid_Rain] of the Pirate Homeworld. It should be noted that without the Hazard Shield, Samus dies in a matter of seconds, even when she has full shields, when coming in contact with the acid rain on the Pirate homeworld. 

- The [Fusion Suit](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Fusion_Suit)

Working in conjunction with Samus’s new part-Metroid physiology, the suit allows her to safely absorb free-floating X to replenish both health and ammunition, mirroring the energy absorption abilities of Metroids. Instead of adding hardware, the Fusion Suit can use specially prepared data to mimic her previous upgrades and abilities.

&gt; **Weapons:**

- The [Arm Cannon](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Arm_Cannon): 

The Arm Cannon is as Modular as the Power suit itself, capable of assimilating offensive weaponry, and utilizing it efficiently. It is able to switch between firing modes quickly, and in some cases, is able to stack multiple beams on top of each other.

- The [Power Beam](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Power_Beam):

Samus' Most Basic Beam. Un-upgraded, it only appears to travel between 5-10 meters before dissipating. Despite it's reletive inefficiency at taking down even moderately shielded enemies, the beam can decimate most biological organisms with ease.

- The [Long Beam](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Long_Beam):

This simple upgrade simply extends the range of the basic Power Beam to a beam that travels ""Far Lengths."" In Game, the beam does not stop until it hits a wall.

- The [Charge Beam](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Charge_Beam)

One of Samus' Iconic features, this upgrade allows Samus to Charge and Store the energy from her beams, and release a more powerful blast of energy at her opponents. The damage a Fully Charged power beam does varies from game to game, but on average, it is around the same damage as a Missile would do.

- The [Spazer Beam](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Spazer_Beam) and [Wide Beam](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Wide_Beam):

This upgrade splits the Power beam into Three separate projectiles, capable of dishing out the same amount of damage per shot. 

- The [Wave Beam](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Wave_Beam):

This upgrade to the power beam allows the beam to pass through most any surface and object, including heavy armor plating. It also increases the damage (In some games) that the power beam can do.

- The [Ice Beam](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Ice_Beam):

The Ice Beam fires a potent beam that has the power to freeze most enemies. When frozen, enemies can be shattered with Missiles. Nothing specifically states just how cold the Ice Beam is, however in order to freeze something instantly, it would have to be near [Absolute Zero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero).

- The [Plasma Beam](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Plasma_Beam):

This upgrade transforms the power beam into a thin ray capable of piercing multiple enemies. It fires a beam of intense heat that can be used to melt ice and weld metals. Generally, this is the most powerful beam upgrade in the game, capable of taking out virtually all non-boss enemies in a single shot. [Per Wiki] 

&gt; &gt;  ""When combined with the Wave Beam, it becomes virtually unstoppable and extremely destructive as each shot will pass through both hostile enemies and solid material.""

The [Nova Beam](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Nova_Beam):

The Nova Beam is designed to be used in combination with the X-Ray Visor, and is Mainly used to fire through Phazite armor to attack specific weak points on certain enemies. In Function, it is less useful than the Wave beam, in that it cannot pierce through walls, or any object that is not Phazite, rendering it very limited in it's use.

The [Diffusion Beam](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Diffusion_Beam)

Is an upgrade to the Charge Beam that causes the explosive energies of the beam to ""Diffuse"" out after colliding with an impassable object, shooting out smaller beams of damaging energy that showers the surrounding area of impact.

- The [Dark Beam](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_Beam):

The Dark Beam fires strange energy similar to the native energy of Dark Aether. Normal shots resemble swirling flattened disks of this dark energy, trailed by a dark streak and globular emanations. Larger concentrations cling to objects, hardening into a brittle shell on contact.

The Dark Beam also has several special abilities.

The Entangler is a charged mass of dark energy that has the strange ability to encase targets, and harden into a brittle shell.

The Darkburst creates a large [spherical singularity](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/metroid/images/3/3c/Darkburst.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090404145520) from the arm cannon that rips apart and enemy's molecular structure and draws it into a ""dark dimension, pulling enemies to oblivion.""

- The [Light Beam](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Light_Beam):

Essentially, the Light beam is offensively similar to the Plasma Beam, in that it fires highly damaging super heated energy. It also has several different utilitarian aspects such as activating Dimensional rifts and Light crystals, but that doesn't serve much purpose in combat. 

The Light Beam also has several special abilities.

The Lightblast fires multiple white-hot spheres, rather than one large mass of energy, in a scattershot fashion. These spheres will home in on locked-on targets and set them on fire if applicable. The number of spheres depends on the time the beam has charged, ranging from 3 to 10. 

Sunburst creates a [slow moving sphere of light](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/metroid/images/a/ae/Sunburst_on_an_Ingsmasher.png/revision/latest?cb=20090403213333) that burns passing enemies and incinerates them.

- The [Annihilator Beam](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Annihilator_Beam):

The Annihilator is powered by both light and dark energy, firing a ""matter-antimatter"" shot that homes in on enemy targets. Even without a lock-on, the attack will automatically home in on a nearby target.

The Annihilator Beam also has several special abilities.

Its charge beam technique is called the Disruptor, which does not home in on targets, but offers a large blast radius and stuns enemies with an electrical field.

Sonic Boom is an exceedingly powerful shot that it instantaneously creates [a rift in space](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/metroid/images/c/c8/Sonic-boom-smaller.gif/revision/latest?cb=20130113153538) at the closest target in the line of fire, effectively deleting them from existence.

The [Hyper Beam (From Super Metroid)](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Hyper_Beam_(Super_Metroid\)) :

The Hyper Beam is a special and incredibly powerful beam. It can pass through walls and enemies and it destroys obstacles that are impenetrable to other beams. It is considered to be the most Powerful ""One-off"" beam in the series. It replaces all other beams, and vaporizes anything that gets in it's way, including making short work of Mother Brain.

The [Hyper Beam (From Metroid Prime 3: Corruption)](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Hyper_Beam_(Metroid_Prime_3:_Corruption\)) :

The Hyper Beam is Samus's most powerful beam in the game, above the Nova Beam, and is extremely effective against all enemies, especially against Phazon creatures and enemies that have entered Hypermode. When charged, it fires a [large number of bolts](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/metroid/images/7/78/HyperBeamCorruption.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090201174019) at a continuous speed in a similar fashion to a machine gun for a short time. 

It should be noted that the Hyper Beam is fueled by Phazon from Samus's own body, causing Samus to lose a fair amount of energy while firing. Each individual shot of the Hyper Beam uses 4 energy. A charged Hyper Beam shot, depending on how long it is charged, can use up to almost half of an energy tank.

Credit: /u/imagineathrowaway

Basically, my friend has made up a family which, unsurprisingly, are everything he aspires to be. They're extremely talented, intelligent, athletic and beautiful. His biggest aspiration is to join the navy and, surprise! They are all part of the navy. He talks about them very often and is constantly bragging about their accomplishments, yet nobody has ever met them. 

His excuse is that they live in a different state (We live in NY but they live in WA), but then he also says every so often that ""Oh, Lara (one the 'friends') is flying into the city this weekend."" but every time she is, something happens so we can't meet up. 

Unsurprisingly, they are all collectively off any sort of social media, they all hate to take pictures, they play video games constantly but they never play online and never give out their handles, nor do their names give off any kind of results off Google. His excuse? They're also very paranoid about giving away any sort of personal information, and since they're extremely intelligent they deleted all trace of personal information off of google. 

Once or twice I talked to Lara throughout his own Facebook account (she 'hacked' it with her super 1337 hacking skills), and she had the same way of talking as him, right down to the emoticons. Our first language is Spanish, and one time Lara spoke in perfect Spanish right down to the kind of popular slang we both use. His excuse was that she is brilliant at languages and taught herself. 

Coincidentally, he loves to write fanfiction (Sci-Fi), and his weakest point is precisely character voices. When he sent me a picture of this girl, a reverse image search proved it to be a stock image of a random Australian woman instead of the Russian girl he'd claimed her to be.

Maybe they are real and I'm being unnecessarily paranoid, but it just seems so phony to me. He has terrible self-esteem and is terrible with women, he's 27 and still clearly a virgin (even though of course he claims to have had two girlfriends). And he talks about them so MUCH. Just now I was talking to him on Facebook and Lara 'hacked' into his Facebook at the same time he was online and they had a conversation with me where he and her talked using the same account simultaneously, only she spoke in all caps and he spoke in regular case. A couple months ago, right after an altercation with his own family, he even claimed one of his fake friends committed suicide.

I'm sure he's doing it for attention and to boost his self-esteem, and I've TRIED to build up his self-esteem so that he doesn't feel the need to do all this, but he is either too arrogant and 'Oh I'm so much better than you, you're such an idiot' or he is 'Oh I am such a piece of shit I am so stupid', so I don't know how to keep him somewhere in the middle.

I really have no idea how to approach this. He's not hurting anyone, but he's making me fear for his mental health. He is truly a smart, kind, amazing man, and he is suffering a lot because his weirdness is alienating potential friends/girlfriends. I want to help him, but I have no idea how.


tl;dr: My friend (probably) made up an imaginary family and he is pretending they all exist in order to boost his self-confidence.

**NOTE: I have a massive, growing backlog, and will most likely decline any game offers, unless they happen to be steam gifts and/or games that are on my wishlist.**

*Also, please be advised that I like to do giveaways - primarily for my steam group, so some games on here may randomly/erratically disappear if I decide to use one as a gift. I try to update ASAP, and apologize if I make any mistakes.*

Hello everyone,

I enjoy collecting cards (especially finishing the card drops so I can {unlikely} qualify for booster pack drops), however, I have slowly realized and accepted that my infinite backlog will never be dented at this rate. As a result, I have decided to add a few games I intended to play onto my trading list. **Please note that I have decided to add MY VALUATION of each game. This is simply how I PERSONALLY view each game, and will hopefully help people gauge bartering potential, and does not mean that is a fixed price. For example, a game that I value at over a key will be harder to barter down - and be advised that many games I offer for trade are ones that I have been on the fence regarding playing it myself (and reviewing). Unique games interest me, so many indie games are potential review practice for me. If you are interested in using cards to trade, simply convert my valuation to cards, and keep in mind that most ARE NOT FIXED SALE/TRADE PRICES. I think it should also be mentioned that instead of considering how much the game you are interested in has sold for (historical lowest price), DO NOT FORGET to consider how much cheaper you are getting a game for (compared to your alternatives). Thank you for your time.**

Comment, PM, or add me on Steam if interested @ [DJSF](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041543513/). If you have ANY questions at all, please feel free to contact me. 

**Games List:**

Any * = game has trading cards

ToD = Tour of Duty ticket (Team Fortress 2 item used as ""steam currency"")

Key = TF2/CS:GO key (item used as ""steam currency; I usually am only interested in TF2 keys as I play that game)

*To help with transparency, I PM HEAVILY vs. replying to comments on here, and the reason for this is that I do not always offer the same trade to people. As a research assistant, I also research people's reddit/steam history, to gauge how much slack I can give that particular individual. Many of people I've traded with have kept me on their friends list, and many of them will be able to tell you that I am a fair trader - if you overpay I usually will insist on giving you change. I also like to randomly give free things to people in my list and in my steam group - I've recently given a few trades for free just because I was in a good mood.*

*I am in good moods quite often.*

6. Repeat steps 4 and 5, reversing the roles.

* Five booster packs
* A large pool of cards or a willingness to use proxies

5. The drafting player looks at the face-down card(s) in the first stack without revealing it to the other player. He may choose to draft it/them or leave it/them. 
6. If player A chooses to leave the card(s), the top card of the main stack in put on top of it, creating a two-card pile. Move to step 8.  
7. If player A instead chooses to draft this small stack, the top card from the pile is put in the empty space. His draft turn is now over.  
8. Steps 5, 6 and 7 are repeated for the next small stack.  
9. If no small stack is chosen, the drafting player must take one card from the top of the large stack and add it to his draft pool.  
11. Repeat this process, going between players until the all cards have been drafted.

,ukpolitics,"*This was originally posted in a forum I regularly use so the tone will be a bit strange for reddit*

I'm actually surprised I didn't pick up on this sooner. But it seems like a policy proposal that could, in a very meaningful sense, reduce tensions between those of us who are of a more market-friendly strand and those of us who are more social democratic.[Basically, New Zealand's Labour Party wants to put fiscal policy in the hands of the central bank.](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-10/n-z-labour-to-make-central-bank-law-change-in-first-term.html?cmpid=yhoo)

For the uninitiated, fiscal policy is to do with the revenues and expenditures of government. Keynes - the namesake of Keynesians - advocated activist fiscal policy in times of recession such as deficit spending or cutting taxes. 

Essentially, the Labour Party wants to give the central bank control over mandatory pension contributions, which could be lowered in times of slow growth or recession to boost aggregate demand. Scott Sumner, who like me is a neo-monetarist (usually adversaries of Keynesians), is quite taken with the idea, even though it'd probably be better to just stick with monetary stimulus. 
 
However, I think it should go further than this. It should be expanded to all social security contributions, not just retirement savings. Put fiscal stimulus in the hands of the central bank, which is far better than it being in the hands of the legislature (can you imagine trying to pass another stimulus package?). 

It's also translate-able. We all have social security in one form or another, with America's forms being eponymous and FICA, and the U.K.'s being N.I. 

The best part? Lord Keynes himself is on board.

&gt;I am converted to your proposal…for varying rates of contributions in good and bad times. (June 16, 1942). Keynes, Collected Writings, vol. 27, p. 208. 

&gt;…[Y]ou are able to show fluctuations in income of an order of magnitude which is significant in the context… So far as employees are concerned, reductions in contributions are more likely to lead to increased expenditure as compared with saving than a reduction in income tax would, and are free from the objection to a reduction in income tax that the wealthier classes would benefit disproportionately. At the same time, the reduction to employers, operating as a mitigation of the costs of production, will come in particularly helpfully in bad times.  (July 1, 1942). Keynes, Collected Writings, vol. 27, p. 218.

It's nice to see the Left some up with something so incredibly sensible.

&gt;Prometheus was a Titan who sided with the Greek Gods, and was later tasked to sculpt humans from clay; he rebelled against the Gods to benefit mankind, such as stealing Zeus's fire, which he paid for through eternal torture. Prometheus naturally has fairly high HP like any Physical monster, and has a decent amount of RCV, but ATK is fairly low. While his leader skill is reminiscent of the Norse series, he provides a balanced boost by himself. His fixed board change gives a strong burst to any Fire-based team with an automatic orb enhance built in. God Types, beware a 3x ATK multiplier! UVO art includes Shaitan.

&gt;Scylla &amp; Charybdis, both mythical creatures from Greek Legend, were a pair of monsters that brought havoc and fear to sailors. Guarding an important sea passage, sailors were forced to risk losing men because of Scylla's voracious appetite and several heads, or risk losing the ship in the giant whirlpool known as Charybdis. These two monsters have decent RCV for dragons, and all-around have good stats. Their leader skill functions similarly to Hino Kagutsuchi and Echidna, but the UVO provides a little bit of healing by consuming the mobs after defeating them. Unlike the other skills, the Jammers need to be moved to be eliminated; this is similarly to how one must avoid Charybdis while sailing. UVO art includes Sylph.

&gt;Narcissus, of Greek legend, was a hunter who was known for his beauty. He was the son of a river god and a nymph. However, his excessive pride became his downfall as he fell in love with a reflection of himself and eventually died, unable to leave his reflection. Narcissus has average stats as expected of a Balance Type monster, but his Leader Skill give him the potential to be a strong spike leader, almost on par with the Egyptians. His active works well with Andromeda and other Water Row Enhance-based teams. UVO art includes Undine.

* Leader: [The Golden Touch] For 0.5 seconds, all moved orbs become Light orbs. Matching 8+ Light Orbs has a 25% chance of delaying all monsters by 1 turn.  
&gt;King Midas, of Greek legend, was a famous King who obtained to the ability to transform anything he touched into gold. This eventually became his downfall as anything he tried to eat would become solid gold, and eventually either starved to death or got rid of his curse by bathing in a special river. King Midas has excellent HP and ATK, but negative RCV. His leader skill can be both a curse and a blessing before evolving; afterwards, it can be a game changer for Light Row teams. His ability even makes it possible to use for the Weekend Dungeon (although it wouldn't be recommended), but he can also be used as a sub for massive damage in high coin-rate dungeons. UVO art includes Genie.

* Leader: [Intoxicating Laced Thread] Upon quitting a dungeon, all drops/coins are obtained. Exp is not obtained, stamina is not recovered. Poisoned monsters have a 10% chance to attack itself with its base ATK.  
&gt;Ariadne, of Greek lore, was an important figure in Theseus's journey, providing a thread to help him escape the Minotaur's labyrinth. A similar figure is Arachne, a weaver who was turned into a spider by Athena after making the goddess jealous because of her unparalleled weaving. Ariadne has average HP and RCV but significant attack, making her poison more effective. Careful when using her active skill as the poison works both ways. Her UVO leader skill makes her active even sweeter. UVO art includes Thanatos.

 **Description**: 

The Summa Crossroads Minecraft server is built on a very simple but very effective core idea - that awesome gameplay should be the focus of development and maintenance. In pursuit of that, over the last 3 years I've gone through multiple maps, updates, and plugin sets, always trying to find that delicate balance of fun, challenge, and drive. We've come a long way from a simple hMod setup to a fully featured Bukkit suite including plugins tailored to our requests by authors who share our passion and ideals. This server has been a lot of things for a lot of people, but it's always been a good time.

Today we feature a vast **16,000 by 16,000** map sprawling from edge to edge with beautiful custom biomes, hand-painted and lovingly crafted to bring the sense of adventure and vast scale that you may recall from your first days of Minecraft. Some residents have built towns and gathered the resources to construct their own waypoints that you can unlock the ability to fast-travel to by venturing there yourself. Much of the landscape is yet unexplored, and each week new adventures are introduced. Many players have developed towns together, and there are 6 player-built towns that already built and activated their waypoints!

For those who enjoy a good challenge, the overworld is bustling with deep caves and the monsters that come out at night will be no allies. PvP Arenas let you challenge your friends and humiliate your foes - paying you out for putting up a good fight. The Underdome lets you demonstrate your gladiatorial might against wave after wave of things that go bump in the night, with spoils to those who entertain. Vast parkour challenges, one of which has only been completed by one player in the history of the server, will spare you no mercy. Unrelenting instanced temples will push you to your limits, giving you fame and fortune if you show the world that you are a true hero. Accumulate enough might and you can unlock ancient secrets, letting you use magic spells to control the world around you.

We think it's important to foster a strong community, and our player ranks are thus primarily tied to forum posts. The numbers may seem a bit high at first to those who have not had previous experience with forums, but when you jump in and get involved you will be surprised at how quickly it starts to add up. It's not just the ranks, either - you get gold for posting on the forums that can be used for forum-related activities and items, or transferred to the server at a 1:1 ratio. With your gold you can open a shop that lets you buy items from and sell to other players at prices of your choosing, or find many other ways to spend it.

Many players have commented that Minecraft sometimes feels as though it lacks purpose. We are actively developing a central quest line in addition to many side quests and activities to keep you busy, entertained, and enthralled. If you have a knack for bringing stories to life and realizing grand schemes, we may be interested in your input! Scattered around various areas of the server are also a host of NPCs that do anything from help you train your skills to guarding temples and sending you on journeys.

Often times it's the little things that make the biggest difference, and we have a plethora of precisely tuned pieces that keep the cogs turning. Little tweaks to the basics of Minecraft and bigger underlying systems designed to reward you for playing the game your way. We want players to have fun and enjoy themselves in a world that feels ready for conquest and adventure.

At the end of a long day, though, there's definitely a need to have some fun. Whether you put down bets on grass growing or sheep sumo, enjoy a raunchy night out at the strip club, or knock 'em dead at the Eagle Eye shooting range, you can settle down after a hard day's work and share some stories over a pint of Mudder's Milk with your pals - or make some new ones! Just don't have too much or you might have trouble making it home.

It is worth noting that we are, by and large, a mature server. This doesn't mean that we include 7 dirty words in every sentence, but it does mean that we tend not to restrain ourselves and generally expect users to have a bit of intuition regarding basic elements such as getting food, making shelter, surviving on your own, etc. We are a survival server, after all - the fun is in surviving!

**Since our last post:**

*[Upcoming Loot Table Changes](http://summaxr.com/Forum/topic/9987-loot-table-suggestions/)*

We have plans to rework the mob loot system, working with a developer to influence some design decisions behind a rewrite of an incredibly powerful plugin. This will allow us to introduce new scaling content and challenges across everything we offer, and everything that's to come. The game will challenge you at your level, and offer you more opportunities to succeed as you become worthy.

Since the last post, the plugin is nearly complete and the framework for calculating mob spawning and item drops is beginning to fall into place. This system is designed to enhance wild mob drops to reward you for pursuing more challenging gameplay, and will feature new, powerful secrets to discover!

*[Water Temple Coming Soon](https://scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/t31.0-8/10505203_505046809595614_3897413387035161069_o.jpg)*

The Water Temple is now almost completely finished. By the time 1.8 comes out we'll be ready for playtesting and then it'll see player release! Will you be ready?

*Summa Seconds Recording*

We'll be filming Summa Seconds (again - the more clips the better!) for our community event next Friday. [Join us](https://www.facebook.com/SummaCrossroads) and you might be featured in our video header!

*Introductory Quest Rework*

Even MORE quests have been added to the Quest Master. In a coming update, you will be able to take on multiple quests at once (so we'll be able to implement better weekly and monthly quests) as well as access new content and rewards.

New players will see an opportunity to discover server features, gain some starting resources, and learn a bit about our world if they take the time to explore and adventure.

Of course, you can always go the Leeroy Jenkins route, jump in a boat, and go punch some trees.

*mcMMO Skill Trainers*

All non-combat skill trainers have been implemented and are confirmed to be working. Spend your extra gold!

*mcMMO EXP Boost*

We passed the tip threshold for this month to activate 1.1x mcMMO EXP for all users through the end of the month. Thanks to MsBleufox and Yiggdrasile! Future tips will unlock further benefits for the whole server.

*Underdome Gold Boost*

The rewards for the underdome have been buffed slightly to encourage individual play, but group cooperation will allow the greatest return for all users. The more you work together, the happier you'll be!

*Horses coming in 1.8*

I've been particular about enabling horses both because they're buggy and I didn't want players to worry about accidental deaths (or otherwise), and because they represent a significant gameplay change without opportunity to balance. In 1.8 we will be enabling general horse availability, with upgrades available for users who complete the Water Temple.

*Fire Temple Bounty*

We still haven't had anyone beat our Fire Temple, so a bounty of a Steam game from ""The Vault"" (my list of about 70 extra keys) is up for grabs to the first person who can beat it.

*New PvP Arenas*

Glacier, a brand new arena, has been added and enabled for your bloodthirsty entertainment. Venice has been updated for its new location, also added and enabled. Both are extremely interesting maps with lots of replay value!

**Features:**

* High biome density and diversity, with custom biomes.
* Customized, revamped nether.
* One home per world.
* Keep armor on death. We're tough, not cruel.
* Unlock warps by travelling to them. Construct your own waypoint node to let others visit you.
* Lock your chests and devices.
* Open world PvP as well as arenas supporting 1v1 or team combat.
* Cooperative PvE arenas vs. increasingly difficult waves of mobs, including bosses.
* Daily and weekly quests, with a main quest line in development.
* Elaborate and difficult parkour challenges, as well as a few on the lighter side.
* Plant life that wants to stay alive - saplings will auto-plant after a period of time. They can still be broken and collected.
* Player shops including enter/leave messages.
* NPCs, many of whom have things to say!
* Earn gold for participating in server activities or engaging on the forums. Spend it your way.
* Milk with a little something extra.
* Various quality-of-life commands, such as /where so you don't have to use F3.
* Auto link shortener. Don't let character limits ruin your sharing.
* Magic spells that have a variety of uses.
* Extensions to redstone usability in certain situations.
* Mini-games and other distractions for some simple amusement. [Check out our shooting range.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b14VWb0CjKI&amp;hd=1)
* Instanced temple challenges, reminiscent of Legend of Zelda or other dungeons. [See the Fire Temple in action.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxJ5tHex5mk&amp;hd=1)
* Mumble server.
* Weekly content updates.
* While this might already seem like a lot, there's already even more being worked on and planned! We would love to have you be a part of our continued development and growth.

The home side have impressed in all forms of the game this year with victories in the World T20, the Test series in England and the Asia Cup. A team featuring the likes of Lasith Malinga, Kumar Sangakkara and the in-form Rangana Herath should have too much for the visitors.

Pakistan boast an experienced one-day line-up but haven’t played a 50-over international since the Asia Cup final in March.

The momentum appears to be with Sri Lanka heading into the one-day series with Pakistan. The hosts were comfortable 2-0 winners in the recent Test matches and have lost just four of the 17 ODIs they have played in 2014.

The Sri Lankan selectors have freshened up the squad by recalling spinner Suraj Randiv and opener Upul Tharanga. Dinesh Chandimal’s excellent recent form on the A tour to England has also been recognised with a call-up.

After being banned by the ICC over concerns about his action, Sachithra Senanayake misses out. As does Ajantha Mendis, despite being the leading wicket taker in the recent series against South Africa. The spin ranks have been boosted with the addition of leggie Seekkuge Prasanna.

Quite how much Rangana Herath has in the tank after taking 23 wickets in the two Tests against Pakistan remains to be seen.

Being match hardened shouldn’t be a problem for Angelo Mathews’ men after a string of tough contests against England and then South Africa.

The same cannot be said of the visitors who will be playing their first ODIs since the Asia Cup final defeat to Sri Lanka in March.

There’s no shortage of experience in the Pakistani squad, though, with seven of the 16-man party over 30. 40-year-old Misbah-ul-Haq may not have scored a century in his entire ODI career but remains a reassuring presence in the Pakistani middle-order.

As does Younis Khan. At 36, he remains as valuable as ever.

The top order looked in decent order in their warm-up loss to the Sri Lankan Cricket Board XI on Wednesday. Six of the Pakistan’s top eight batsmen reached 27 but only Mohammad Hafeez passed fifty. Turning starts into scores will be imperative.

The Pakistani bowling looks a little underdone. Left-arm seamer Junaid Khan performed well in the Test series but is a doubt for the opening one-day match. The Lancashire star was hit on the head by a Dhammika Prasad bouncer in the second Test in Colombo.

The attack has been boosted by the return of Mohammad Irfan, though, who sat out the Test series through injury.

Saeed Ajmal will miss the first two ODIs as he undergoes remedial work on his action in Brisbane after being reported during the Test series with Sri Lanka, per ESPN Cricinfo. In his absence, the spin attack will be led by experienced duo Hafeez and the mercurial Shahid Afridi.

The pressure will be on wicketkeeper Umar Akmal to perform after Sarfraz Ahmed’s heroics in the Tests. The 27-year-old scored a century and three fifties in his four most recent innings and will be pressing for a recall to the 50-over team.

Players to Watch

Sri Lanka

Rangana Herath dominated the recent Test series, collecting 23 wickets in his two appearances. If the pitch in Hambantota is similar to those in Galle and Colombo he’ll be a dangerous proposition.

Kumar Sangakkara is the leading run scorer in ODIs at the Mahinda Rajapaksa Stadium, averaging 78.50. The 36-year-old looked in great touch in the Test series scoring his 10th double century in Galle. Another big score will go a long way to securing a win for the home side.

Pakistan

Runs at the top of the order and wickets from the spinners will be crucial for Pakistani success. Mohammad Hafeez could provide both.

The 33-year-old impressed with bat and ball in Wednesday’s warm up, taking four wickets and scoring 54 while opening the batting.

In the unlikely event that there is any pace and bounce in the pitch in Hambantota, Wahab Riaz and Mohammad Irfan should be able to exploit it.

Prediction

Sri Lanka are in excellent form at present and are likely to have too much for an ageing Pakistani line-up. Especially one that is likely to be a little rusty after not playing a one-day international for over five months.",,False,,0,,Pakistan Vs Sri Lanka Live Stream 1st ODI Match,,,,,,0.0,,,False,t3_2eao6v,False,,,,,1.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},,,1,,,,default,False,,,,,,True,,1408733307.0,,,,,,self.Cricket,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,t5_2qhe0,,,,,2eao6v,,,AhmadNoor123,,1,,,,,,,/r/Cricket/comments/2eao6v/pakistan_vs_sri_lanka_live_stream_1st_odi_match/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/2eao6v/pakistan_vs_sri_lanka_live_stream_1st_odi_match/,,1408729707.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441206932.0,,,

**NOTE: I have a massive, growing backlog, and will most likely decline any game offers, unless they happen to be steam gifts and/or games that are on my wishlist.**

Hello everyone,

I enjoy collecting cards (especially finishing the card drops so I can {unlikely} qualify for booster pack drops), however, I have slowly realized and accepted that my infinite backlog will never be dented at this rate. As a result, I have decided to add a few games I intended to play onto my trading list. **Please note that I have decided to add MY VALUATION of each game. This is simply how I PERSONALLY view each game, and will hopefully help people gauge bartering potential, and does not mean that is a fixed price. For example, a game that I value at over a key will be harder to barter down - and be advised that many games I offer for trade are ones that I have been on the fence regarding playing it myself (and reviewing). Unique games interest me, so many indie games are potential review practice for me. If you are interested in using cards to trade, simply convert my valuation to cards, and keep in mind that most ARE NOT FIXED SALE/TRADE PRICES. I think it should also be mentioned that instead of considering how much the game you are interested in has sold for (historical lowest price), DO NOT FORGET to consider how much cheaper you are getting a game for (compared to your alternatives). Thank you for your time.**

Comment, PM, or add me on Steam if interested @ [DJSF](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041543513/). If you have ANY questions at all, please feel free to contact me. 

**Games List:**

Any * = game has trading cards

ToD = Tour of Duty ticket (Team Fortress 2 item used as ""steam currency"")

Key = TF2/CS:GO key (item used as ""steam currency; I usually am only interested in TF2 keys as I play that game)

*To help with transparency, I PM HEAVILY vs. replying to comments on here, and the reason for this is that I do not always offer the same trade to people. As a research assistant, I also research people's reddit/steam history, to gauge how much slack I can give that particular individual. Many of people I've traded with have kept me on their friends list, and many of them will be able to tell you that I am a fair trader - if you overpay I usually will insist on giving you change. I also like to randomly give free things to people in my list and in my steam group - I've recently given a few trades for free just because I was in a good mood.*

*I am in good moods quite often.*

,loremasters,"**Preface:**

So I recently agreed to run a game of 5th edition D&amp;D for a group of fantasy-minded, brand-new-to-tabletops people. And since I have always preferred to run memorable homebrew encounters at my table I immediately started brainstorming.

Now, I didn't want to get too far ahead of myself just in case their interest level wanes or tapers off completely somewhere in the middle, but at the same time I'd love to have a general world-feel, ""Big Bad Quest"" ideas, and ""overarching campaign goals"" in mind.

Therefore I'm coming to you guys to run my ideas by you in hopes that I can reforge and refine this new world into something exciting, lasting, and fun for my group and myself.

For the record: most of my GMing experience comes from GURPS, AD&amp;D Second Edition, and Pathfinder.

Also, please forgive my scattered thought process as I try to lay all of this information out for you. It's still in a very rough-draft state.

--------------

**The Theme:**

*Becoming Heroes, and accepting one's own mortality.*

My players will be starting at Level 1.

Along the way I do not plan to hold their hands too often, and players acting in ways that would get their characters killed will find themselves needed to pay for resurrection, or find a reason within the story for the group to find/hire/rescue a new PC. As such, they will learn that just because they might have the title of hero - they aren't immortal or protected by the plot.

I would like our first major adventure to end at around level 6-7, but the experience will come as it does.

--------------------

**The World (so far):**

Players will find themselves taking on the role of above-average commoners in a ""refurbished"" world. 500 years ago *The Sundering* took place; cataclysmic disasters, the opening of portals to other dimensions, pretty much everything bad that can happen to a place happened.

* What really happened: A group of former players ended our last campaign by taking their battle to the gods. An evil party, they wanted the gods' power for themselves, and if they couldn't have it they would destroy the pantheon.

 * They were, surprisingly, successful in a way. They failed to ascend to godhood, and didn't technically kill off the gods... but just before their own obliteration they managed to sunder the world and massively cripple the connection that the gods had to it. 

 * Basically, if you imagine a giant cable connecting the gods' to the world, the evil party nuked the shit out of it, leaving just a few tiny strands and threads connected. Just enough to keep the world spinning, for the tiniest traces of magic to live on, and for mankind to persist.

 * But the gods, in their severely weakened, pretty-much useless, all but dead state, do not have the power or the interest in repairing that connection. They are instead focused on eradicating every remnant of the evil party that persists within the universe (family lines, soul ties, etc), and healing themselves back up to full power.

As a result of *The Sundering* (can we come up with a more original name for this, or will it just be The Sundering forever? Whichever is fine.) magic is severely limited. Almost no new sorcerers are born, magic (both arcane and divine) is difficult to cast &amp; maintain. Magical artifacts are often used as ""batteries"" to fuel more difficult spells. A

Aftereffects of *The Sundering*:

* Magic is severely limited.

 * Without the influence and power of the gods to fuel it, both divine and arcane magic have suffered and nearly disappeared.

 * Very few new sorcerers are born, Wizards hoard their secrets and often refuse to take on new apprentices without ridiculous payment.

 * Clerics pray for guidance and hear only the faintest of whispers.

 * The world itself is so wounded that the natural web of energy that makes up natural-divine magic is also severely hindered.

* Politics have been almost completely blown up. What was formerly a stable tyrannical monarchy over most of the world was completely wiped out during The Sundering, with only the outlying cities escaping total annihilation.

 * Elves have re-established their own government within a vast underwater forest protected by a natural oxygen barrier (think: airbubble created by an overturned ship, but a cave or complex root system) | Parliamentary Monarchy
 
 * Dwarves have dug deep into the earth hoping to find workable minerals and ores and are just now beginning to faction themselves off into smaller splinter clans. Much smaller than the reformed Elvish government, the dwarves keep mostly to themselves (as usual). And even the clans don't always get along. | Socialist Republic

 * Humans/Halflings/Half-Elves re-established themselves on an island city just off the main continent, mostly untouched by the cataclysm. They continue to rebuild and refurbish what they can, but as always - are greedy for more. The ability of humnans to grow like weeds has granted them the largest of landholdings, and as such they have several members of the ""New Nobility"" ranging from their King, down to eager Barons and Baronesses | Absolute Monarchy

 * Half-Orcs and Dragonborn | Tribal and Nomadic to their very core, members of these races thrived and flourished after The Sundering. As such, many clans and gatherings of these two species have done well making looters, pirates, and raiders of themselves. But a few of the more socially-minded members have come to the three governments to offer some semblance of peace. At least with their own clans, if not the majority of their races. Half-Orcs and Dragonborn in the Monarchy are commonly slave laborers, gladiators, or worse.

 * The Peoples Alliance: A recently formed ( &lt; 100 years ago) government consisting of all of the known civilized races. Representatives are elected from within the people. They have established their small holding across the continent from the human Monarchy, and have earned the ire of all three major governments. They struggle to survive, but are showing much progress in combining the efforts of all the major races into re-establishing themselves in the world.

* The Badlands is the name commonly used to refer to the mass chunk of land affected most harshly by *The Sundering*. Over 70% of the main continent is considered to be The Badlands, and almost nobody that ventures deep into that territory ever returns.

 * As such there are almost no maps of the new world, and since most history books and documents were destroyed it is difficult to place oneself if you venture beyond the civilized lands of one of the 4 governments.

 * The further inland you go, the worse it gets (both in terms of creatures encounters, and survivability).

* Magical Items and Artifacts are highly coveted! The wealthiest and most powerful seek to amass vast influenceby collecting as many magic items and artifacts as possible. They can be used as a sort of battery, temporarily draining the power from the item to boost their own ability. As such, those with great money, influence, or magical power can use that power to further their own goals. These people are called ""Artifactors"" (get it? Benefactor? Artifact? ha.)

 * Due to the highly valuable nature of said magical items many decrees have been set forth by those wealthy enough promising to pay any and every peasant/aspiring adventurer/sentient being capable of hunting them. *This is my adventure hook.*

 * Artifact Hunters are paid an initial sum whenever they have a tangible lead on a known item, but for the most part are left to look after themselves. Wandering deeper and deeper into the badlands in search of treasures as yet unfound. Occasionally, particularly skulky hunters will attempt to make their careers by stealing artifacts from the wealthy, or from other hunters.

* Monsters roam the badlands.

 * Primarily undead, outsiders, and abberations | Without powerful adventurers, and the influence of the gods to keep these beings at bay many of them have found their way onto the material plane and have thrived in the chaos of the world's rebirth)

 * Dragons are few and far between, much rarer than normal, and even the Metallics will ferociously guard their territory from potential interlopers or 'land-claimers' 

---------------

**The Adventure**

Players - through a motive of either greed, pride, or whatever reason they come up with - have decided to cast aside their current lives to become Artifact Hunters. They will find themselves assembled together by a shadowy, unnamed Artifactor with a lead on a moderately powerful item. Located within the badlands is an old fort wherein there was supposedly left a magic map. The PCs are to retrieve the magic map at all costs, and will be rewarded incredibly well for their efforts should they succeed.

Sadly, they won't. Because unfortunately for them, at the same time, another pair of Artifact Hunters will be setting out for the very same object. Since my players are all new to Tabletop RPGs I will be railroading this first encounter so that by the time they arrive at the fort (if they make it that far!) they will find that every lock has been picked, every monster slain, every trap disarmed, secret rooms/doors/crevices de-secreted, and all of their loot... well, looted! (this is intended to safely introduce them to the foreign concept of locks, traps, searching for secrets, dungeon sized combat, and looting - you know, D&amp;D stuff!)

The Artifact Hunters in question will quickly become the party's nemesis, as the party gets beaten to nearly every contract or lead that they receive - always 2 steps behind the Hunter Duo. 

Should the party look for more information on the Duo they will eventually come to learn that they are a somewhat well known hunter group that formerly worked for every government, paid at the highest level. But suddenly disappeared one day (or perhaps they just retired on the wealth of their success?) only to resurface later, still Hunters, but now preying upon new Hunters and Hunter groups as well. Taking any and all magical items that they can find - and as rumor has it - selling to no one. But why?

Thus the initial adventure will end with the resolution of the two groups' wills and desires. Whatever outcome that may be (TPK, kill the duo, help the duo, discover subplot/puppetmaster/corruption behind the duo, etc)

------------

**The Campaign**

If this eventually turns into a campaign, I would love for the ""Final Quest"" or capstone moment be the players sacrificing themselves (or something they hold dear) in order to restore the gods' connection, and heal the world.

Whatever adventures and quests that happen along the way, within the world I've built, happen.

----------------

**Specific Questions I Have**

I can't (or, rather, don't want to) just hand all of information on *The Sundering* over to the players. So I'd like to construct some sort of legend, or story that can/would be told from each of the race's point of view. We know what *The Sundering* is behind the scenes... but what would the inhabitants of the world have to say about it?

What are some ways to creatively limit magic, or demonstrate its weakened state to my PCs without taking away too much of the fun or power behind their class?

Better name for ""The Badlands""? Actually, any names in general for anything would be appreciated. This is my biggest weakness when it comes to worldbuilding: I never know what to name anything.

What should we call the Artifact Hunter Duo? They were pseudo-famous, so they probably had a nickname or something.

What should I call the ""Hunter hunters"" (The Artifact hunters that prey on other hunting parties, ambushing them at the edge of the badlands to steal their stuff and sell it)

Artifact Black Market... Yes or no? (who am I kidding, of course there would be one... but how deep does it go?)

I want my villain duo to actually have a tragic backstory. Something terrible that happened to them that caused them to turn to ""evil"". Either a lost/sick/dead/captured child/family member, or perhaps something happening to them (selfish + tragic!)... just something that will give the players a reason to not want to just rush in and chop chop chop them up at the first opportunity. Something that gives them a reason to *talk* to one another, and even if they can't come to a resolution, perhaps maintain a bitter rivalry and grudging respect for one another as each looks for a way to overcome or get rid of the other. Basically, why did the duo come out of hiding/disappearance/retirement? What are they suddenly questing for, if not for the fame or money from before? Do they have a puppetmaster pulling the strings behind the scene? Does he hold something they need captive until they find enough (or perhaps, *the right*) artifacts?

----------

,fantasyfootball,"1) LeSean McCoy is still amazing.


2) McCoy hurt his finger. Got X-Rays. Negative. He's fine.


3) Markus Wheaton is getting a shit ton of targets. They're not hooking up on any of them, but its still a good sign.


4) Jeremy Maclin is catching everything coming his way, and is a big part of the offense. Caught 6 passes in 1 half.


5) Maclin hurt his knee. (collective gasp) ... But returned into a preseason game, so all is well.


6) Blount and Bell are still splitting carries down the middle. Not good for Bell owners who would hope for Bell to have more of the 1st team snaps.


7) Brent Celek and Zach Ertz are both looking really good. Might be time to temper Ertz expectations. Celek will still see tons of snaps because he's still the better blocker, and this team is rooted by its run-game.


8) Pittsburghs offense has looked awful. No rhythm. Starters are still playing in the 3rd quarter because they scored 0 points in the 1st half. Gotta boost their confidence against Philly's 2nd team defense.


9) Philly still runs a ridiculous pace on offense. More plays equals more fantasy points. 


10) Heath Miller caught 4 passes in the 1st half. Still Big Ben's security blanket...

**Rules of the Game (shorter explanation)**

Winning:

You win if all of your opponent's monsters die, or if your opponent ever needs to draw and can't.

Card types:

Cards come in two types: monster cards, which are listed as C0XY, and skill cards. Skill cards are further divided into attack, defense, and breeder cards.

Monster cards: 

These represent the monsters the players pit against one another. They are separate from the rest of the deck, and are set aside at the beginning of the game. The initial life value defines how much life they start off with, and whether the monster is aerial or ground-based is also indicated on the card. A monster can only use skill cards belonging to it, except for special ""Allmon"" cards that can be used by any breed.
There are also fusion monster cards, which have a primary breed and a sub-breed. The primary breed determines which attack skills, the sub-breed determines which defense skills the monster can use. If the sub-breed is ""???"", the defense skills also come from the primary breed.

Skill cards:

To play a skill card, its cost needs to be paid by using guts. This is done by moving a number of cards equal to the skill's cost from the top of the player's guts pile to their discard pile. At the end of your turn, you may send as many cards from your hand to your guts pile as you want. At the beginning of each turn, you draw cards until you have exactly 5 total cards in your hand.

Attack skills: These cards are used to deal damage to your opponent's monsters. They can be power attacks (sword symbol), intelligence attacks (book symbol), or special attacks (""!"" symbol). Some skills may also have special properties, triggering various effects when played, as defined in their description.

Defense skills: These cards are used to avoid or lessen the effects of attacks. They can be blocks (shield symbol) or dodges (staircase-like symbol). Their exact properties are defined in their description. They can only be used during your opponent's turn when you are getting attacked.

Breeder skills: These cards represent actions not taken by monsters, but by the breeder (player). Some of these cards are environmental effects (""o"" symbol), which affect every player and remain in play until replaced by another environmental card.

Setting up the game:
The two players place their monsters on the table, and set their life to the initial values indicated on the cards. Then they both shuffle their decks and determine who goes first. The second player then draws five cards, and can choose to turn up to two cards into guts BEFORE player 1 begins. Then, the starting player's first normal turn begins. (The starting player may attack on turn 1.)

Turn progression:
The two players take turns. Each turn consists of the following phases:

- Draw phase: The active player draws cards from his deck until they have 5 cards in their hand. If they already have 5 cards in hand, the top card of the deck has to be moved to the guts pile. If you can't draw enough cards to make a hand of 5, you lose.
- Battle phase: The active player may attack once with each of their monsters that are still alive. A breeder card may also be played once per turn. The opposing player can respond to the cards being played by playing cards of his own to defend against their effects. If the active player kills all the opponent's monsters by reducing their life to zero, they win the match.
- Guts phase: The active player can take any number of cards from their hand and place it on top of their guts pile.

Deck construction:

A deck must contain three different monsters, and exactly 50 skill cards. There can be at most three copies of any skill card in the deck.

,assassinscreed,"I was watching a [YouTube vid](http://youtu.be/LrObZ_HZZUc?list=UU2C_jShtL725hvbm1arSV9w) from CGP Grey earlier on the City of London. Immediately I saw potential for an AC game, different to the usual Victorian London ideas, and thought I'd share a bit here. Bear with me, this is a long post but hopefully interesting to AC fans!

COOL FACTS...

* The Romans first established Londinium as a trading post along the Thames and built a wall around it.
* Later, the Anglo-Saxons established the City of Westminster nearby and it was essentially the capital of England, not London.
* It was in the 16th century that Westminster and the City of London began to merge together, eventually forming one ""London"".
* The City of London, however, remained a distinct, walled part of London with its own mayor, its own local authority and its own customs.
* The British Monarch traditionally has to ask the Lord Mayor for permission to enter the City of London.
* The City of London Corporation has its own [coat of arms](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/City_of_London_logo.svg/150px-City_of_London_logo.svg.png) and has its fingers in many pots inside and outside the City. It controls/owns Epping Forest, Hampstead Heath, Old Spitalfields Market and the Old Bailey. It maintains/runs Tower Bridge, London Bridge, Blackfriar's Bridge, Southwark Bridge and the Millennium Bridge.
* It has its own police force, its own hospital, its own markets and its own wall (which was fully intact and formidable in Norman times).

So, the idea is this...

*Assassin's Creed Presents...* **Templar's Order: The City**

You play as a low-ranking recruit to the Templar Order in modern times, whose ancestors were also English Templars. You are able to fully explore the City of London (Square Mile), under the guise of an investment banker, actually working for Abstergo Industries, who completely control the City. As part of your development, Abstergo provide you with a new technology known as Animus Mobile, which uses a Google Glass-type interface linked to your smartphone to allow you to relive specific memories of your own ancestors without being restrained in any way.

The story involves you reliving the memories of Templars who worked within the City of London way back from the Roman Era, to the Norman/Medieval Era, 1500/1600's, Victorian Era and even WWII. Your missions concern you learning various skills (including parkour) from your ancestors, developing your political and economic prowess, teaching you how to fight and how to kill, teaching you about the Assassins and about the many secrets of the City of London. You would also set up historic events (as your ancestors) to work to your benefit in modern day, to benefit you financially or tactically. So, you could have the Romans build a strengthened tower along one part of the wall, which survives to Medieval times and allows you to better defend against an Assassination attempt. Or you could blackmail a Guild Master in the 1500's so that his guild pays the Templars an annual tithe, continuing into Modern day and boosting your bank balance.

As the game progresses, you would visit historic locations within the City in modern times and complete parkour/puzzle-related segments (like the Assassin Tombs from AC2), as well as some social stealth, hacking and ""Assassin Interception"" missions.

There would be a new mechanic, granted by Animus Mobile, where you can instantly switch from Historic to Modern day, allowing you to carry out investigatory/research activities and also giving you a better sense of the City's development and history.

As you progress in the modern day, you rise up the ranks of the Templars within the City, until eventually becoming Town Clerk/Chief Executive of the City of London Corporation, which is the highest Templar position within the City, under the Lord Mayor (a puppet installed by Abstergo). You are able to renovate/improve various landmarks within the City, as well as your own HQ building (The Guildhall). There would be an economy/trade system like Kenway's Fleet, but much more like a modern-day economic sim which actually impacts on the City and the Templar Order. Your ultimate goal is then to successfully manage the City for Abstergo, making as much money as possible while keeping order in the face of an increasing threat from the Assassins.

The game's final stages would involve a siege of the City of London, where a renewed and vastly repopulated Assassin Order (branded as terrorists) would carry out a systematic assault on the City, using parkour, firearms (limited effectiveness due to fast-moving and armoured targets) and traditional bladed weapons. Your mission would be to coordinate the Templars (and the City of London Police) to defend against this invasion. You would also use everything you learned about the City, such as hidden passageways, First Civ weapons/defences, advanced parkour/combat techniques and allies made over the course of the game to successfully repel the Assassin attacks.

A revelation at the end might reveal that Abstergo was secretly using you to investigate the location of a powerful First Civ artefact hidden somewhere in the City. You're given a choice at the end whether to accept a final mission, using all your gathered intel and your investigation skills, to seek out and recover this artefact for Abstergo, or whether you want to defect to the remnants of the Assassins (who begrudgingly accept you as a last, desperate move) and infiltrate the Guildhall building to take down Abstergo's executive who has been controlling events in the City.

Of course, we could have sequels which follow Templars again, but different setting across the globe. I think a key focus of the series could be on the economic side and the investigatory/defence activities as you work to defend the Order's assets against Assassins.

Gameplay would involve very fluid parkour, with you given the chance to climb monuments such as St. Paul's Cathedral, St Mary-le-Bow, Old St. Paul's Cathedral (a separate building), The Guildhall and Mansion House. The City itself wouldn't be as large as say Paris in Unity, but because it is a smaller size, it would be rich with detail and side activities. Plus, its smaller size allows us to play across a span of time periods ranging from Ancient Britain, to Medieval Britain, to Elizabethan, to Victorian and WWII. We'd get to see the progression of the architecture and witness landmarks being constructed and how they tie into the Templar Order.

And, if all that wasn't enough to convince you of this idea, check out these snippets:

&gt;""The Temple Church is a late-12th-century church in London located between Fleet Street and the River Thames, built for and by the **Knights Templar** as their English headquarters. More info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple,_London""

&gt;""In December 2012, following criticism that it was insufficiently transparent about its finances, the City of London Corporation revealed that its ""City’s Cash"" account, an endowment fund built up over the past 800 years that it says is used ""for the benefit of London as a whole"", holds more than **£1.3bn**. The fund collects money made from the corporation’s property and investment earnings.""

Plus... you could wear something [like this](http://i01.i.aliimg.com/img/pb/921/702/447/447702921_425.jpg) in modern day (notice the Templar collar, thanks to Shay)!

Also i have a suggestion for the game i don't know if it has previously been suggested but i think an awesome feature which would bring the community closer is challenges for example daily challenges like collect a certain amount of cookies in a day and then weekly ones like buy 1000 structures or something they are just for your own game and then like community challenges that everybody can participate in and work together towards and if we complete the challenge we get a reward of some sort for example a 5% cps boost for a week although to get this reward you have to participate a certain amount i think it would be a good idea what do you guys think? ,,False,,0,,Rainbow chip help plus game suggestion,,,,,,0.0,,,False,t3_2e4pub,False,,,,,1.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},,,1,,,,self,False,,,,,,True,,1408581878.0,,,,,,self.CookieCollector,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,t5_30vrg,,,,,2e4pub,,,Thomas219999,,5,,,,,,,/r/CookieCollector/comments/2e4pub/rainbow_chip_help_plus_game_suggestion/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/CookieCollector/comments/2e4pub/rainbow_chip_help_plus_game_suggestion/,,1408578278.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441209771.0,,,

   - HHHH
   - The Scottish Soulguard (shield)
   - The Horsemann's Hand-me-down
   - The Soulstealer's Shoes (boot misc)

-New HHH stats:

   + On taunt: scare enemies within a short radius for 4 seconds
   + Collects heads on kill. Each head increases taunt radius, melee range, and decreases taunt
   duration to a maximum of four heads.
   + 20% damage resistance while taunting/stunned when active
   - *20% slower firing speed*
   - *No random crits*
   - *15% crit vulnerability while active* 

-Scottish Soulguard:

   + 20% faster charge movement speed
   + 30% explosive damage resistance on wearer
   + 70% knockback resistance while charging
   + Cannot be airblasted/slowed down when charging
   + 20% charge impact damage boost

-Taunt: Boo! (5 second duration, -1 second for every head taken)


Demoman raises his headtaker up in the air, and purple ghosts are seen being sucked into the sword. He then hits the ground
and scares everyone in a small radius. With each head, the taunt is sped up by 1 second, and the ghosts turn a shade of blue, teal, and light green for each head, respectively.

-Item reworks:

  -Added killstreak kits and strangifier for the HHH (available in crates that contain strangifier)
  
  -Headtakers that were obtained before this update have the ""ghastly glow"" effect (HHH's Headtaker purple      glow)
  
  -Headtakers crafted after this update will be of haunted quality, and do not have an effect attached to them

Hello everyone,

I enjoy collecting cards (especially finishing the card drops so I can {unlikely} qualify for booster pack drops), however, I have slowly realized and accepted that my infinite backlog will never be dented at this rate.

,Banished,"[I got a request to investigate how exactly taverns work. Please feel free to repost any of this information wherever you like. Let me know if you enjoyed reading this or want me to research another building/game mechanic.]

----

Taverns are facilities that brew fruit or wheat into ale, and allow citizens to drink ale for a happiness increase.

Brewers:
--- 
Each tavern can employ one brewer, and a brewer is required to make a tavern function. The brewer starts by collecting either wheat, berries, or fruit (determined by a drop down menu on the tavern itself). They will collect supplies from either a storage barn or market, whatever is closest. They can carry a maximum of 100 wheat/berries/fruit per trip, and no other citizen will help stock the tavern but the brewer working there.

Once the tavern contains a brewable food item, the brewer will begin making batches of ale. An educated brewer creates 10 ale per batch, an uneducated one create 7. It takes either 30 fruit, 60 berries, or 100 wheat to make one batch of ale. It takes 40 seconds at 1x speed (one year = one hour) per batch of ale. If the brewer has no tools, it instead takes 200 seconds. This means the theoretical maximum output of a tavern is 900 ale, though this would never be reached as brewers must eat, get warm, collect supplies, etc.

Taverns
---
When a batch of ale is made, it is placed just outside the tavern where it must be collected. Laborers will collect ale and place it in the tavern's inventory if they have no other jobs. Occasionally a laborer will get a new job after being assigned to collect the ale. The laborer will still collect the ale, but will then immediately head to his next job site without depositing the ale. Once he gets there, he'll realize he needs to put the ale away, and walk all the way back to the tavern. In a small, condensed town, this happens quite rarely. In a large, sprawling town, where a laborer has a long walk to the tavern and there are many jobs that pop up during this walk, it happens often. In these large cities, there might be 100 ale *per tavern* being carried around the streets, inaccessable to everyone.


If no laborers are available, the brewer will make exactly 5 batches of ale before collecting them herself. Ale will always be placed in the same tavern, usually the one that produced the ale. In the case of taverns being placed very close together, sometimes ale will decide to always go to an adjacent tavern.

A tavern can hold a maximum of 300 units of supplies, be it ale, wheat, fruit, or berries. If berries are currently stored in a tavern and production switches to wheat, the brewer will first remove any remaining berries before filling it with 100 wheat. If a tavern currently holds more than 200 ale, there will be no room for 100 of any food product. This will result in the brewer stuck in an [infinite loop](http://i.imgur.com/z9KVty4.gif) of gathering 100 food, bringing it to the tavern, seeing that it's full, returning the food, gathering 100 food again, bringing it to the tavern, etc. 

Drinking
---
Citizens who are idle for any reason may go to the tavern to drink. They don't actually enter the tavern, but instead stand around nearby. Citizens who have jobs but go idle due to unhappiness will drink one unit of ale before returning to work. **I believe this is the intended function of the tavern.** 

However, the game does not draw a distinction between people idling because they are unhappy and people idling because they are laborers without a job (including temporary laborers, such as farmers in the winter). These idlers will go to the tavern, drink, and remain idling by the tavern. A citizens that is idling around the tavern in this way will drink one unit of ale every 10-20 seconds. That means 5 idle citizens will drink ale faster than the brewer could possibly produce it.

Worst of all, there is no age limit on drinking. Children switch between idling and playing every few seconds, so they can drink ale nearly as fast as adults. Even if you have every adult working, a small number children will still drink a tavern's ale faster than a brewer can make it.


Trading
---
Traders, like everyone else, must wait until the ale is placed in the tavern before they can access it. However, traders can remotely call 'dibs' on ale as it appears in taverns, which prevents any citizens from drinking it. This means well-staffed trading docks can probably collect 90% of the ale produced in most cases. Understaffed docks that are far from taverns will have trouble collecting much ale at all.

Ale has a value of 8 to general goods, resource, and food merchants, and cannot be traded to seed or livestock merchants. It has a weight of 1, meaning that your trading dock is unlikely to become full when using ale as a trade good. Buying fruit for 30, creating ale, and selling it for 80 yields a profit of +150%. Berries are much less profitable (60 -&gt; 80 = +33%) and wheat is more valuable as wheat than ale (100 -&gt; 80 = -20%)


Happiness
---
In order to get a happiness bonus, citizens must have access to a manned and stocked tavern. So a tavern with no ale will give no happiness boost, and a tavern with no worker will not allow anyone to drink, which also means your citizens will get no happiness bonus. Whether or not a citizen has actually consumed any ale is irrelevant, they just need access.

After a number of conflicting tests, I've decided to postpone any definitive explaination of how happiness works in a town, which means the explaination on tavern-based happiness will have a few holes. It's pretty hard to isolate the cause of happiness shifts in citizens, especially when there are so many possible influences.

The happiness boost from a manned tavern looks to be a maximum of a half-star. The game appears to do a ""check"" about once a season to see if a tavern is running. If it is, you get the bonus. If it's not (if you run out of ale, for instance), you don't get the bonus. This bonus does not appear to stack over time or from multiple taverns. 



Conclusion (TL;DR)
---

* Taverns are broken

* There are a number of AI bugs that limit efficiency

* Ale is consumed MUCH faster than intended

* As a trade good, ale is great

* The happiness boost from drinking ale is a half-star at best",,False,,0,,In depth: Taverns,,,,,,0.0,,,False,t3_2e0sez,False,,,,,71.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},,,71,,,,self,False,,,,,,True,,1408487059.0,,,,,,self.Banished,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,t5_2wp64,,,,,2e0sez,,,Smilge,,19,,,,,,,/r/Banished/comments/2e0sez/in_depth_taverns/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/Banished/comments/2e0sez/in_depth_taverns/,,1408483459.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441211701.0,,,
,Diablo,"**I’ll put a TL:DR here:, but I would like inputs and discussions on how people feel about the current Greater Rift system, Legendary Gem upgrade system, Monk balance changes and the lack really of many DH changes on the 2.1 PTR and if people feel the 2.1 is ready.**

**TL:DR – 
* Greater Rifts aren’t really that rewarding (something that Wyatt Cheng said that he wanted them to be)
* Legendary Gem system has many flaws and nowhere near ready for prime time. 
* Monks are still falling behind on balance changes.  They have been getting steady improvements over the PTR, but I feel that almost every other class has gotten more positive changes with slight item/skill changes or sets than the Monk has with small tweaks.
* Demon Hunters need help on build diversity as Marauder 6 piece is their one-trick pony and there is really no other build that is viable.  The set needs to be re-analyzed, just like Exploding Palm, in order to see the real flaws with the class.**

With recent developer interviews, it's hinted that Blizzard wants to get 2.1 out the door ASAP and even as soon as the end of the month.  I feel, and others have voiced their opinions, that the PTR is not in a good place to go live.  The elephant in the room are Greater Rifts and the legendary gem upgrade system, but there are still flaws in DH and Monk class balance that stand out the most.  This is going to be a long post, so bear with me.  

&gt; **Greater Rifts and Legendary Gems**

In reality, Greater Rifts are just a glorified “endless dungeon” system that has been proposed numerous times.  The problem with a system like this, is that it is actually never “endless” like the name would imply.  As you increase the difficulty (in D3 case of monster damage/hp) you will eventually reach a soft cap where you are gear limited how far you can progress in the allocated time limit.  Furthermore, due to the nature of the difficulty scaling, you eventually pigeon hole yourself into a single “best build” which will have a very specific gear and skill set with little to no variation.  This leads to a very stale type of end game.  **This is the reason why Greater Rift leaderboards are a terrible metric for class balance.  You are comparing classes to their single one-trick-pony best builds and it misses what is bad about classes**.  The new “torment 6” milestone is now going to be Greater Rift 30.  At that point, why didn’t the developers just add another torment difficulty?  However, I’ll add I’m totally against adding more difficulty levels.

The current state of Legendary Gems and how they are upgraded doesn’t fit well either.  We all know that there is a hard cap of level 100 for Greater Rifts, yet players are maxing out around level ~40 on the PTR.  This leaves a whole limitation on what you expect to get out of your gem levels and upgrades.  Level 25 is the new breakpoint of Greater Rift worth to unlock the secondary affix on the gems.

&gt; **Flaws in the Greater Rift System**

* The incentive to clear a higher rift, outside of leaderboard status, is only in upgrading your legendary gems.  They are terrible at getting loot (just as bad at XP).  Once you have the gems you want upgraded to the maximum, which will be level 30-40 depending on what max level Greater Rift you can do, you really have no incentive to progress further or do high level Greater Rifts unless you want to progress your name on a leaderboard.
* The best time vs reward Greater Rifts are still level 1.  You clear these VERY FAST as they are ~normal difficulty in strength and get a nice loot explosion at the end.  In fact, the loot explosion has no real difference between a level 1 rift and a level 100.  The most efficient way to get loot in a Greater Rift is to “slow roll” your way and go level 1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;etc to maximize Greater Rifts for your starting token, thus more chances at loot explosions.  To do this, you run a Greater Rift, spawn the guardian and then go run some bounties to drain the timer and leave a couple minutes left, go back and kill the guardian and upgrade your tier by 1.
* There is no incentive to try and do Greater Rifts quick (complete a level 1 in 2 minutes vs 14 minutes) as they offer the same loot reward either way.  Let’s say the highest rift you can complete is a level 10.  If you complete a level 1 rift in 2 minutes, you’ll get something like a level 11 rift keystone.  For this, you’ll fail the rift, because you can only complete 10, and you have given up levels 2-10 in progression from your keystone progression if you’re looking to get loot.  That is potential 9 “loot explosions” you give up.  By completing that level 1 rift in 2 minutes, you get the same loot if you completed it in 14.  You need incentive to complete a rift fast.  In a way, for each Greater Rift level you skip, it should award you a bonus “loot explosion”, or bonus item drops, or just more XP for each level you skip.  So, let’s say you completed that level 1 rift in 2 minutes and got a level 11.  You’d get your level 1 explosion, as well as a bonus for 2-10 levels of explosion.  In order for this to work, the loot reward from a Greater Rift Guardian kill needs to be adjusted.  As the baseline, let’s say you get some % chance at a legendary, but skipping 10 levels might actually reward you with 5 legendary.
* For Greater Rift Trials, you have two methods of gameplay.  First, you can get as high as you can to achieve the highest Greater Rift Keystone, open up the rift, go run some bounties to waste 15 minutes, kill the guardian after they spawn and upgrade your gem.  The other method, is to start the trail and TP to town to fail to collect a level 1 keystone and do the “slow roll” method to collect loot and yet at the end you still “fail” on purpose to upgrade your gem.  Again, there is no incentive to start out at the most difficult Greater Rift if you want loot.  The same thing should be put into place where every rift level you complete should be similar to Greater Rifts.  However, each trial wave is very short compared to Greater Rift levels so the bonus rewards would be smaller possibly?  Either way, it needs to be adjusted.

&gt; **Flaws in the Legendary Gem upgrade system**

* The system still has a “fail to upgrade” system where choosing a legendary gem upgrade option is really only viable after you have failed the Greater Rift.  Even if you want to upgrade a gem earlier than you would fail, it still ends your run.  The end result is that it won’t really benefit doing a level 30 rift to upgrade a level 1 gem and you might as well pick the earliest breakpoint where you have 100% chance on your attempts.
* The current system has a soft cap of 25 to get the secondary effect of a legendary gem.  Beyond that, it is an added bonus but then we’re around level 30-40 limited based on rift progression.  Going a couple levels beyond your highest achievable rift only gives you a small percentage of an upgrade, at that point your time vs reward is getting on the lines of trying to farm for a Wand of Woh, Starmetal, Calimity, etc. and your upgrades are FAR worse to get one more level of a gem at that point.
* Even if there was a way to work out an unlimited gem system, eventually you would get to the point where your gems would do the majority of your damage and you would simply look for builds that had the highest proc coefficient.  You could probably run a near naked character with 3 socketed rings and possibly do T6 content in theory.

&gt; **Monks**

* Monks are still on the bottom of the totem pole if you’re looking at Greater Rift progression.  As I mentioned, they’re a bad metric to base class balance but it’s what Blizzard wants to compare.  Doing higher Greater Rifts is all about damage mitigation (or complete avoidance) with great support damage (ideally ranged) which pet builds shine and why WD/DH are very strong in Greater Rifts.
* Monks single target damage is still heavily lacking.  I feel that their AoE damage is still good.  Exploding palm still works well for trash packs and is a good crowd clearing ability if you can stack it up, but you’ll need a lot more mobs to chain than you did in 2.0.6.  However, when you come up to a rift guardian, the abilities still fall flat on their face and I feel like I’ll spend 7 minutes clearing a rift and 3 minutes on the guardian.  The buff to the Sunwuko set is pretty awesome, giving over 3000% weapon damage per 75 spirit spent, but it almost makes running the set (and a Daibo) a requirement to be a top level monk. 
* Faster generators were a good boost, but I feel that the damage nerf they got to make their DPS the same wasn’t good and should be reverted.  Honestly, buffing the generators and a slight boost to spender DPS is probably all monks need to make them feel right for baseline generator/spender skills. 
* Raiment 4 piece set bonus (and 6 piece overall) is even more garbage compared to the Sunwuko 4 piece buff.  Right now, all the damage I do is more related with spending 75 spirit to proc Sunwuko over doing damage with my actual abilities.  The set bonuses should supplement your damage and not BE your damage source.  Furthermore, when a 4 piece set gives you more damage than your 6 piece set bonus, it shows some problems.  Assuming no CDR gear, you’re doing 3000% every 8 seconds as a Raiment Monk.  You would only need around ~9 spirit/second as a Sunwuko monk to output the same damage.  Add into that CDR which boosts either the dashing strike cooldown, or reduces cooldowns on spirit generating abilities and they both improve.  This set needs a better rework to give it a valued 6 piece bonus.  Comparing the damage output in %weapon damage/s, Jade is multiple orders of magnitude better.  The new Firebirds 6 piece bonus augments your existing fire damage to effectively double your existing damage and then maintains a fire DoT when you reach the limit.  In a way, swap the Firebird bonus to a lightning damage bonus of a monk and it would make the set much better.  Attaching it to a seizure inducing dashing strike is an annoying gameplay.

&gt; **Demon Hunters**

* The current Greater Rift champs have a major flaw in their class… Marauder’s 6 piece.  I agree, I would hate to see it nerfed and would rather have classes brought up in line, but the interaction of this set needs a re-look.  They simply cannot buff other abilities as it only makes the M6 bonus stronger.  Sure, they could almost make the DH spenders free, but an M6 is like having 3-5 copies of yourself with no resource limitations.  A suggestion might be making the sentries work like the Carnevil helm, where they only fire when you do.  That way, the sentry becomes an augmentation to your build and not a total replacement for your DPS output.  You won’t need 3 spenders anymore and walk around while the sentries do the work.  This would probably drop DH effectiveness way down, but they need a lot of love on their other spenders in order to make them a well balanced class.  There are other T6 and GR 30+ options, but nothing is as good as M6.

&gt; **Suggestions? Fixes?**

This section is just opinions of my own and how I would rather see the systems and class balances.  Some I have already touched upon above but I’m putting it down to an easier list.

* Greater Rifts should have a hard cap level at 100 like they do, but they should be able to achieve this.  This way, the leaderboard competition comes down to HOW FAST you can clear a level 100 rift and not how high of a level can you do.  You’ll see someone who cleared a Greater Rift level 99 in 2 minutes, but someone who cleared a level 100 in 14:59 is still ranked higher.  We both know that the level 99 in 2 minutes is actually a better accomplishment, but they could have got a bad monster RNG so they couldn’t complete what they were given.  This way, builds won’t be focused so much on damage avoidance and damage output… you might actually see more diverse builds show up: Faster movement speed utilization, clumping of mobs, slow/hard hitting abilities to 1 shot trash better, etc.
* This goes a bit with the Greater Rift level 100 hard cap, but the rift levels should be spread out more.  If 100 is the hard cap, it should be equal to a lower cap as well, something like Greater Rift level 30.  This makes the cap more easily obtained by more varied skill builds.  But maybe not make it 100, as that is too many levels and make level 30 the hard cap.  Either way, there needs to be a shrink on the range of what Greater Rifts are to make a hard cap something on a T7-T8 level but not something absurd like a T16 level you’ll never achieve.
* Skipping Greater Rift levels by completing your current rift fast should reward you with bonus item drops at the end to incentivize fast clears.  The same should be set that for the higher rift you complete, the higher chance for legendary items to drop.  Barely finishing a level 1 rift in 15 minutes should not reward you the same as completing a level 100 rift in 2 minutes.
* Legendary gems should be based on XP that you only gain in Greater Rifts and you only get the XP on completion.  I don’t think the gem upgrades should be tied to a failure rate.  At the end of every rift you complete, you should be allowed to apply gem XP **and** upgrade your Greater Rift keystone.  It will bring up the same menu, you still get 3 “upgrade chances” but you are choosing what gems of your choice get the XP.  Each gem will have XP where each level will require more XP.  This way, you might get 3 levels for one “upgrade” on completion of a greater rift level 30.  But going from a fresh 29 will only give you a fraction of an upgrade.  This way, it could tie in progression of gem ranks similar to what we see now, but allow you to give you better progression towards reaching higher levels.  The same will tie in if you complete a rift faster (say a 2 minute rift) where you will get bonus XP per application to account for skipped rift levels.
* Ether re-work or eliminate the Greater Rift Trials.  The whole system is so clunky, there are no champions at all as you get to higher rifts.  I’ve often been able to be awarded a much higher rift than I could actually complete through the trial system.  The scaling of monster waves doesn’t really seem to match when you get to higher rift levels.
* Monks need a buff to single target damage.  A boost to generators could accomplish this but also a slight increase to spender damage just a little bit would really be a good place to put Monks in a better place.  While they are still far from their final form, it’s a good enough “2.1” release, but would still need further tweaks down the road.
* Demon Hunter’s M6 set needs to be re-analyzed.  There is likely never a chance that anything will compete with M6 at the moment unless there is some amazing synergy with the other two sets that can 3-5x multiply the damage of a DH with no requirement on actual player positioning or resource balance.

-

&gt;**Q: I've summoned _____ times but I didn't get a 4★/5★!! WHY??**  
&amp;nbsp;└ **A:** Summoning is random and completely out of anyone's control. You could summon once and get a 5★, or you could summon 100 times and not get a 4★ or 5★.

&gt;**Q: Are the 75 crystal summons better than Mystic Scroll summons (or vice versa)?**  
&amp;nbsp;└ **A:** Both summoning methods are identical and therefore it is recommended you save for the 750 crystal summoning pack. [**Source**](http://forum.com2us.com/forum/main-forum/summoner-s-war/guides-and-tips-ac/70793-crystal-summoning-is-better-than-mystic-scroll)

&gt;**Q: You guys should increase the monster rates! I never get anything good! You guys should also _____ and _____ to make the game better!**  
&amp;nbsp;└ **A:** We are not affiliated with Com2uS. Please refer to their official forums or send them an email.

&gt;**Q: Do guilds do anything? Are there any benefits?**  
~~&amp;nbsp;└ **A:** No, currently guilds do nothing. You can only see guildmates and an in-game guild channel. There is no content related to guilds at the moment.~~ **Outdated answer.**

&gt;**Q: What is the best element?**  
&amp;nbsp;└ **A:** There is no 'best' element. Fire is strong against Wind and weak against Water, Wind is strong against Water and weak against Fire, Water is strong against Fire and weak against Wind. Light and Dark are strong against each other while being neutral to the three main elements.

&gt;**Q: How do I get Light/Dark element monsters?**  
&amp;nbsp;└ **A:** There are only three ways to get Light/Dark element units. First way is using a Light/Dark scroll which guarantees a 3★+ Light/Dark unit. You can get 1 from completing the campaign mode missions (Faimon 7 is the last one) and you can get another 2  for clearing Giant's and Dragon's dungeons B10 level (EXTREMELY difficult even for veteran players!). Light/Dark scrolls are also obtainable through cash purchase packages on certain days. The second way is to fight in the Secret Dungeon of that particular monster and collect enough pieces to summon it. Lastly, the daily wishing well can grant a Light/Dark element unit if it lands on the monster icon.

&gt;**Q: What are Secret Dungeons and how do I get them?**  
&amp;nbsp;└ **A:** Secret Dungeons are special dungeons you can find while doing elemental dungeons. Once found, you can go to Cairos selection Secret Dungeon. You fight hordes of the depicted monster until you can collect enough pieces to summon them. You can also join any Secret Dungeons your allies have found, but they only last 60 minutes with a maximum entry of 10 different people (you can enter as many times as you want in the allotted time as long as you've done it at least once).

&gt;**Q: I went into an SD but I got nothing or 1pc. What's going on?**  
3 Clear - 0-1pc  
4 Clear - 1pc  
5 Clear - 1-2pc  
6 Clear - 2pc  
7 Clear - 2-3pc  
8 Clear - 3pc  
9 Clear - 3-4pc  
10 Clear - 4pc

&gt;**Q: What does Accuracy and Resistance do?**  
&amp;nbsp;└ **A:** There is a very good explanation at the top of this thread under Advanced Resources.

&gt;**Q: Do multi-hit attacks increase the chance of proc-ing stun from Despair Runes?**  
&amp;nbsp;└ **A:** Multi-Hit does not increase the chance of proc-ing a stun. It is only calculated on the first hit; if it doesn't stun on the first hit, it won't stun for the rest of multi-hit attack. (Tested on Fire Magical Archer &amp; Water Pierret)

&gt;**Q: What are leader skills, how do I use them, and what does it mean by Arenas/Dungeons?**  
&amp;nbsp;└ **A:** Leader skills are passive skills appear on some monsters and boosts the entire team as long as that unit is in the first unit slot (usually the top slot, or the left spot for defense). This can boost unit HP, Attack, Critical Rate, Speed, Defense, Resistance, or Accuracy. However, some leader skills can have conditions of only applying in Dungeons (everything in Cairos), or Arenas (all arena matches and defenses), or only applying Fire/Water/Wind/Light/Dark units. You can click the tool icon on the bottom left while in combat to check your active ally buffs.

&gt;**Q: Will my team keep the leader skill buff if my leader dies in combat?**  
&amp;nbsp;└ **A:** Yes. Leader skills are active for the entire fight and are still active even if the leader itself has been defeated in combat.

&gt;**Q: Why are all my runes the same stats?**  
&amp;nbsp;└ **A:** Runes in slots 1/3/5 are always Atk/Def/HP respectively. Slots 2/4/6 can be a larger variety of stats. Check the rune guide in the Resources section.

&gt;**Q: What is awakening and what does it do?**  
&amp;nbsp;└ **A:** Awakening increases the unit's stats as well as granting it one special perk. This perk can be an extra skill, a leader ability, or an extra boost in a particular stat. Awakened units also have a different look compared to their un-awakened counterparts.

&gt;**Q: If I awaken my _____ unit, will it get +1★?**  
&amp;nbsp;└ **A:** No. Awakening a unit is not correlated to evolving ranks in any way. You can evolve a unit or awaken one in any order and it does not affect it's cost or stats. Only units summoned pre-awakened will have +1★ to their base form; eg. if you summon an awakened water Fairy, she will be 4★ (this is the same chance as summoning a normal 4★ and is generally seen as a negative).

&gt;**Q: What are Angelmons and Devilmons? How do I use them?**  
&amp;nbsp;└ **A:** **http://tcgapp.com/threads/angelmon-devilmon-explained.67859/**

&gt;**Q: If I evolve my Fairy using another Fairy, will I get a skill increase?**  
&amp;nbsp;└ **A:** Yes. Evolving counts as a power up and your Fairy will get a skill up for every Fairy you used in evolving regardless of element and rank.

&gt;**Q: If I feed my Fairy with 5 skill ups to a new Fairy with 0 skill ups, will they transfer?**  
&amp;nbsp;└ **A:** No, your new Fairy would only get 1 skill up from the process. All skill upgrades are +1 skill increase per material without exceptions.

&gt;**Q: Does the X% from skill up add on with multiplication or addition?**  
&amp;nbsp;└ **A:** The amount you get from skill ups are multiplicative of the base. For example, Ramagos' (wind Warbear) Crouch skill heals for 30% HP and he gets ""Recovery +10%"" twice during skill ups. This means that his Crouch now heals for 30%+(30%*20%)=36% and NOT 50%. However, negative effect skill ups are additive. A skill that has 20% to stun and gets +10% effect from skill up will have a 30% chance to stun.



&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;「 **Arena-Related Frequently Asked Questions** 」
-
&gt;**Q: I keep losing defenses! Why can't I successfully defend?**  
&amp;nbsp;└ **A:** It's common to lose defenses because these are human players attacking you. They would not attack you if they did not think they had a chance to win, so it quite normal to see all losses in your defense history. However, as your units get better and your defensive lineup gets better, you will see loses much less frequently because players tend to avoid tough matchups they might lose. Judge the success of your defense not by your win/lose ratio, but rather by the number of attacks you receive on a hourly/daily basis.

&gt;**Q: What's the point of having a strong Arena Defense if I'm just going to lose?**  
&amp;nbsp;└ **A:** When people defeat your Arena defense, you lose Arena points. By having a strong Arena Defense, you dissuade other players from attacking you and you gain Arena points when you defend successfully. Note: You do not lose/gain Glory from defenses.

&gt;**Q: My Arena points just got set back to 1000, what happened?**  
&amp;nbsp;└ **A:** Every two weeks, the arena resets and sets everyone back to 1000 points. In addition to that, the weekly rewards for the Arena are changed.

&gt;**Q: When does the Arena reset and when are rewards given out?**  
**UTC(+7) (No DST)**  
Arena Closed: Monday 2PM - 3PM (Reward@3PM)  
**UTC(0) (No DST, +1 if in DST Area)**  
Arena Closed: Monday 7AM - 8AM (Reward@8AM)

**UTC(-8) Los Angeles (+1 if DST) ⋘ PST/PDT, used by Com2uS Global**

Note: DST stands for Daylight Saving Time; it is effective in some areas.

,yugioh,"I was highly interested in the new archtype ""Melodious"" Divas.


They are all light fairy monsters.


They all had interesting effects allowing them to harmonize their effects, allowing them to float on the field.


Unfortunately the hardest part was special summoning them. 


But then I remembered Konami introduced the most broke ass shit ever ""Pendulum summoning”


The deck's main idea is for you to keep your monsters on the field laughing as your opponent tries to do stuff as you laugh and hit them continuously.


So let's start with my deck list and dive right in. PUNS




###Monsters: (15)
***




##Sonata the Melodious Diva (3)

* Lv: 3 

* 1200/1000

* Effect: If you control a ""Melodious"" monster, you can Special Summon this card (from your hand). While this Special Summoned card is on the field, all Fairy-Type monsters you control gain 500 ATK and DEF.


This your right hand man, er woman, she'll come out of no where give you a crowbar and help you beat up the bad guy. 
She'll swarm the field even without the pendulum summoning and give all your Melodious monsters a 500 boost. 
It's great to have 2 in hand while you have Melodious monster on the field basically giving you an extra 3000 Atk/Def points collectively.




##Aria the Melodious Diva (2)

* Lv: 4

* 1600/1200

* Effect: While this Special Summoned card is on the field, ""Melodious"" monsters you control cannot be targeted by card effects, or be destroyed by battle.


She is your bodyguard. Says no to card effect targeting and battle damage. The only problem is you have to special summon her. I’ll talk about how to use her properly later.




##Elegy the Melodious Diva (3)

* Lv: 5

* 2000/1200

* Effect: All Special Summoned ""Melodious"" monsters you control cannot be destroyed by card effects. While this Special Summoned card is on the field, all 
Fairy-Type monsters you control gain 300 ATK.


She does what Aria can’t, save you from the destruction of card effects. You can get that effect off just by tribute summoning her. The tough part is summoning her. She isn’t targetable by *Photon Lead* or *Solo: First Movement* She can however be summoned by *Celestial Transformation* which cuts her original attack in half but she is not destroyed at the end phase because of her effect.


##Serena the Melodious Diva (2)

* Lv: 4

* 400/1900

* Effect: This card can be treated as 2 Tributes for the Tribute Summon of a Fairy-Type monster. After you Special Summon this card, you can Normal Summon 1 ""Melodious"" monster during your Main Phase this turn, in addition to your Normal Summon/Set. (You can only gain this effect once per turn.)


I feel that she is probably the weakest of the Divas, wimpy Atk, okay Def, and her second effect only applies when she is special summoned. I feel like it’s not that great at all because you get an extra normal summon. In my deck focusing on the OTK and Pendulum Summon having 2 normal summons is almost a waste. I can understand the concept of getting out the boss level 7 or 8’s but you can only get one out with Serena
I only run 2

##Canon the Melodious Diva (2)

* Lv: 4

* 1400/2000

* Effect: If you control a ""Melodious"" monster, you can Special Summon this card (from your hand). You can only Special Summon ""Canon the Melodious Diva"" once per turn this way. Once per turn: You can target 1 ""Melodious"" monster you control; change that target's battle position


Canon is alright. You can Normal her then if you have the other copy you can special her, then change your battle positions.

##Mozarta the Melodious Maestra (2)

* Lv: 8

* 2600/2000

* Effect: Once per turn: You can Special Summon 1 LIGHT Fairy-Type monster from your hand. You cannot Special Summon other monsters the turn you activate this effect, except for LIGHT monsters.


One of the Boss Monsters in this deck she can special summon any and/or all your fairy monsters in your hand (limit 1 per turn). Like all *Melodious* Elegy and Aria make her invincible. She is a great monster but I don’t like running more than 2 of her also she can’t be summoned via *Pendulum Summoning*


##Laureate Francoise the Melodious Maestra (1)

* Lv:7

* 2300/1700

* Effect: Once per turn: You can target 1 LIGHT Fairy-Type monster in your Graveyard; add that target to your hand. You cannot activate monster effects the turn you activate this effect, except the effect of LIGHT monsters.


Ehh, an inferior Mozarta. She recycles the dead Melodious monsters in your graveyard. I do like her because she is targetable by *Pendulum Summoning* and you can *Transmodify* her to make Mozarta!!!! Another cool play with her is Odd-eyes and/or Athena her make rank 7’s sooo… Big Eye and Dracosucks if you really want.

##Athena (1)

* Lv: 7

* 2600/800

* Effect: your opponent. Once per turn: You can send 1 face-up Fairy-Type monster you control to the Graveyard, except ""Athena"", then target 1 Fairy-Type monster in your Graveyard, except ""Athena""; Special Summon that target.


You get the best of both worlds!!! She's like Mozarta and Fracoise together, plus a little bit of burn damage.




###Pendulum Monsters: (7)
***


##Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon (3)

* Lv: 7

* Scale: 4

* 2500/2000

* Pendulum Effect  You can reduce the battle damage you take from a battle involving a Pendulum Monster you control to 0. During your End Phase: You can destroy this card, and if you do, add 1 Pendulum Monster with 1500 or less ATK from your Deck to your hand. You can only use each Pendulum Effect of ""Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon"" once per turn.

* Monster Effect  If this card battles an opponent's monster, any battle damage this card inflicts to your opponent is doubled.


Search for your Timegazer and Stargazer whichever one you need to complete the scale. He can bust out tons of damage, and can XYZ with your Francoise or Athena for a rank 7



##Stargazer Magician (2)

* Lv: 5

* Scale: 1

* 1200/2400


Complete the scale yo.


##Timagazer Magician (2)

* Lv: 3

* Scale: 8

* 1200/600


See Stargazer. 

Added note: don’t like 3 becomes too much and interferes with consistency. 

Another Added note: You can only activate this when you have no monsters you control.




###Spell Cards (10)
***


##Solo: First Movement (3)

* Effect: You can only activate 1 ""Solo: First Movement"" per turn. You cannot Special Summon any monsters the turn you activate this effect, except 
""Melodious"" monsters. If you control no monsters: Special Summon 1 Level 4 or lower ""Melodious"" monster from your hand or Deck.


The main Spell that helps you special summon monsters. I personally I like first turn solo into Aria in face-up Defense. It synergizes quite well with Timegazer because you must control no monsters to activate his effect as well. Only problem is only Melodious monsters level 4 and below.


##Photon Lead (2)


Like solo, but with some changes. It’s a quick play so you can set and use during your opponents turn. Keeps your opponent guessing if you happen to go first.


##Celestial Transformation (2)


Any Fairy monster you have you can summon it. But it loses half of it’s original Atk, which is fine. Also if you can summon Elegy with this it lives. Because of Elegy’s effect.


##Valhalla, Hall of the Fallen (1)


Free fairies.


##Transmodify (1)
Pretty cool tech card would love to get Elegy out as quick as possible or even a free Mozarta or Athena


##Soul Charge (1)


Free Summons




###Trap Cards (7)
***


##Call of the Haunted (3)


Love this and Elegy. So good. Also free special summons


##Pendulum Back (1)


Kind of a tech card, could do without it


##Bottomless Trap Hole (1)


Staple that wrecks decks like Pendulums or just Boss monsters in general


##Compulsory Evacuation Device (1)


Another Staple dealing with Extra deck cards.


##Torrential Tribute (1)


Basically a mirror force in this deck as long as you have Elegy. 




###Extra Deck (15)
***


*Rank 3’s*

* Number 49: Fortune Tune

* Wind-up Zenmaines


You can make these with Sonata quite easily. Both are pretty good floaters. Fortune Tune recycles, Zenmaines pop.




*Rank 4’s*

* Abyss Dweller

* Castiel, the Skyblaster Musketeer

* Constellar Omega

* Gagaga Cowboy

* Maestroke the Symphony Djinn

* Number 101: Silent Honor Ark

* Starliege Paladynamo


Just Generic 4’s nothing special or game changing


*Rank 5’s*

* Constellar Omega

* Numer 61: Volcasaurus

* Tiras, Keeper of Genesis


Pretty tough to pull out, need 2 Elegy, but if you’re pushing for game and for some reason can’t make cowboy go Volcasaurus


*Rank 7’s*

* Gaia Dragon, the Thunder Charger

* Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack

* Number 11: Big Eye


If you have the munnies I love these cards. *Odd*ly enough you can go in to these more often than you think. Odd-eyes, Athena, and Fracoise can easily combine together to make Big Eye or Draccossucks.




##Deck Strength:

* You can pull out some NASTY Wombo Combo OTK’s
&gt; Solo into Aria happen to have double Sonnata 2200+2200+2600=7000, and you still have a normal summon you can use to push that extra 1000

* Have a lot of lock potential. Aria and Elegy. Cannot be Target by card effects or Destroyed by battle. Also cannot be destroyed by battle.




##Deck Weakness:

* Plenty of dead situations.

* Can misplay all the time, hard to keep track of Special Summoned, and Normal Summoned Monsters.

* Draw potential is really low and hard to maintain card advantage.

* Krystia or Summoning Limits will fuck your day up.

I would really like input having a faster paced deck or maybe even a better draw engine with these monster.


I hope you enjoyed my Deck list of Melodious Divas, hopefully you can swarm the fields and school your friends!

,leagueoflegends,"In an 2012 episode of State of the League, [host Travis Gafford asked roommate Doublelift for his opinion on then solo-queue player Nientonsoh](http://www.twitch.tv/sotl/b/317683582) (quote starts at 1:38:00). Nien had reached 2700+ elo in Season 2 and had become a mainstay on high elo streams primarily as an ad carry.

Doublelift commented- 

&amp;nbsp;

***""Nah, I think Nientonsoh's good, but do you think that he would be able to play the way that he plays against two really good players?Chaox Xpecial, me Chauster, any bottom lane, he can't play the way that he plays at all, because I watch him and he plays, he just goes for trades, he goes for trades he goes for trades, and yeah he understands the trades better than than most players because- the first time he'll get it for free because they're going for the cs, and the second time he'll have an hp advantage so it's better [for him], but against a better player he can't play like that, he just has to sit back and last hit and wait, wait for the right opportunity and that's something that you don't learn in solo queue at all and those skills that he uses right now don't carry over that much in a real bottom lane scenario"".***

&amp;nbsp;
 
This  exchange highlights one of the most crucial dilemmas in scouting talent. If competitive play is so different from professional play, then what good is the ranked ladder at predicting talent? What portion of solo queue skill and mentality carries over to professional play, and what skills can only be practiced and developed in a team environment? And most importantly, what can we do with this knowledge?

My argument here is that individuals have different talents for certain types of problem solving, and that League presents different types of problems at different phases of the game. By identifying and classifying the types of problems used, I think we can more adequately predict a player's innate talent and more efficiently develop these skills in current players.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Laning in solo queue usually involves minimal team coordination, so the same scenarios tend to repeat as players face off against a limited combination of patch relevant and popular champions. The game edges closer to a single axis problem, where superior execution is more important than strategy.

An example of this is the Renekton-Shyvana-Mundo top lane trifecta. Professional top lane players derided having to learn boring champions or having only a few build paths available. They were vocalizing their frustrations at the game suddenly becoming extremely narrow, a series of static trades.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

This isn't unique to League- the less variables a game has, the faster positions become resolved.

Think of the speedrunning community. The Ocarina of Time at first seemed, to our middle school eyes, like a complex series of puzzles and challenges. But because the game unfurled in the same order every time, it eventually becomes a question of superior execution.

In 1999, Billy Mitchell completed the first perfect game of Pac Man, consuming every dot, fruit and ghost in all 256 levels of the game without losing a single life. From a strategic point of view, every game of Pac Man since and after has been invalidated. As Mitchell said, ""I never have to play that darned game again.""

[In 1996, former Chess champion Bobby Fischer created Fischer Random, or Chess 960](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess960), as a response to the same frustrations.

Since Chess has a static opening position, over time players have collectively found refutations for a majority of the opening moves. Since Fischer retired from competitive play, high-level chess players began relying on computer-aided preparation and a library of previously played games to get through various openings and avoiding mistakes until the board is simplified and each piece has more available moves.

Fischer proposed shuffling the back line, increasing the number of variables and making opening preparation impossible. Chess then immediately becomes about improvised, creative solutions, on the fly responses to novel strategies.

As I've talked about before,](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/29nzyg/wickds_gut_instinct_using_visual_read_and/) top laners keep track of a number of variables when they lane against an enemy. And the more of these variables you can eliminate, the further you can resolve the potential outcomes and find victory conditions.

Renekton immediately removes a number of these variables. He is stronger early than almost every common pick, so the variable of their innate power curves becomes static. And because Renekton is stronger, you can also force your opponent's behavior- you can repeatedly shove the waves into their turret, or punish a melee by standing next to a low health minion and stunning the enemy when go for the last hit.

Renekton is gated only by his cooldowns, so resource management boils down to a relatively simple conditional tree. If a normal trading pattern involves Dash- Stun- Q - Dash, then having 50 Fury might change it to Q- Stun- Dash- Dash or Stun - Q - Dash - Dash, saving your resources for the most improved empowered ability. Or if your ultimate is available, you might decide to use the empowered Dash first and spend your 50 Fury, then use your ultimate and spend the next 100 Fury on Q and Stun.

Over time, players resolved the optimal laning for Renekton. For example, a Shyvana against a Renekton might lose lane by 12 minions in the first ten minutes. If the Shyvana tries for one of these lost minions, then she might take too much damage and have to give up five in the next wave or have to back early and lose an entire wave plus turret damage. Since the refutation of last hitting that one minion has been established, losing 12 is then considered ""perfect"".

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Playing through an opening in Chess, perfectly executed 256 stages of Pac Man, navigating the Water Temple with a preplanned route, and laning as Renekton against a Shyvana are all examples of convergent problem solving.

[In his 2011 book Drive and a 2009 TED talk titled ""The Puzzle of Motivation"",](http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation) Daniel Pink explained that different types of problem solving benefited from different sources of motivation.

His primary example was this- when test subjects were asked to solve a problem that required finding a single, correct solution, external motivation (the promise of rewards or money) boosted performance. However, when subjects were asked to solve problems that needed creative solutions, external motivation actually made them perform worse.

For example- shelving books at a library requires convergent thinking. You're simply matching numbers and letters, slotting books away based on a pre-determined system. Monetary incentives in this case would improve performance. So if one day I was offered an additional bonus- say, an additional quarter for every booked accurately shelved within the hour- I would work much faster than usual.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

But for creative tasks, adding a financial incentive decreased performance. The only motivation that helped the groups perform better was internal or intrinsic motivation. 

So if my job was instead creating a new sort system to replace Dewey, adding a finanical incentive- a cash stipend for each workable idea- would lower my performance. The only beneficial motivator would be my own internal one- if I thought the problem was intriguing, or in line with my own interests, and worked on it in my own free time.

These kinds of creative tasks require divergent thinking- the process of generating as many creative solutions to a problem as possible. And the important thing here is, as Pink says in his speech, this isn't a theory- it's a tested fact, proven repeatedly in multiple blind studies.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

So what does this have to do with League?

Learning how a champion's abilities work requires convergent thinking. Laning one versus one can be boiled down to a set of ""if-then"" conditionals, which is a loose algorithm which requires convergent thinking.

Practicing animation canceling with Riven or putting in hundreds of hours learning how to use LeBlanc's kit properly still only utilizes convergent thought. They're complicated processes, but it still comes down to finding a single, correct solution for each situation, the same way Pac Man or the Water Temple seemed complicated until someone showed that it wasn't.

So for this kind of practice, Solo Queue is a perfect environment. It externally incentivizes players by giving them points, shiny badges and a degree of fame as they reach the challenger tier. The chance to get noticed by a professional team is sufficient drive to compel a player to become very gifted at the mechanical component of League.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

The problem is, League also requires divergent, creative, strategic problem solving. Champion select isn't solvable because it requires predicting human behavior. You can say ""ban Jax against Zion"", but he might have spent the week spamming Lulu or Nidalee instead.

[A stronger example is from the pick-ban phase from the NIP versus UoL match in Challenger series.](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2cx9c0/nip_vs_uol_eu_cs_summer_playoffs_3rd_place/)

NIP said ""'let's first pick Maokai, UoL accidentally let him through"", but really UoL had just prepared a very strong counter in Swain. Swain was only conditionally strong against Maokai, so banning both Swain and Maokai in the second game made no strategic sense.

NIP will never make that same mistake again now that it's been solved. Like a chess opening, it's a thought process that requires convergent thinking- they have a direct process to follow, and their coach can drill them to make sure they internalize it.

But the ability to predict an unknown counterpick- to say ""Maokai is so strong right now, the only way they would let him through is because they have a hard counter""- requires divergent problem solving.

So the same external motivators- a paycheck, the acclaim of fans, a victory on a stage in front of a crowd- actually inhibit their ability to make these kinds of decisions. The only way to enhance that performance is to focus the players on their own intrinsic motivations, view it as a challenge that they want to succeed at only for their own benefit.

In this sense, Unicorns of Love came in with a big advantage- they had less expectations, less external and organizational pressures on them- and so their internal motivation could benefit their performance.

In simpler terms- seeing Faker pick a champion and practicing it is an example of convergent problem solving. Recognizing the potential strength of a champion before Faker picks it is an example of divergent problem solving.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

I think this is a partial explanation for Nientonsoh's excellent performance during his stint on Bizarro CLG.

Nien has shown an innate talent for creative gameplay and unique champion item combinations in the past. When he was first picked up as a top laner for CLG, he had mismatched performances because he was asked to fill the same role as Hotshot within the team.

Hotshot is a talented player that thrived in the solo queue environment. You can see this in his continued presence in the Challenger ladder, in Faker's recognition of his LeBlanc skills, and in the way he tried to perfect the role of a tanky split pusher during CLG's long career. 

But asking Nien to replace him was a misallocation of talent- they restrained Nien to acting within another player's solution, instead of finding his own.

And when he was finally allowed to develop his own style, it was in the middle of the Renekton-Shyvana-Mundo triad, which was a disaster for a creative mind that thrived on coming up with divergent solutions.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

The evidence for this is in my interpretation of the first episode of Thorin's Theories. Seraph is a player with similar tendencies as Nientonsoh that underperformed in the R-S-M meta, but whose performance has improved as the top lane champion pool opens up and more complicated picks are made viable

Shyvana, Nidalee and split-pushing all have convergent and divergent aspects. Shyvana is functionally simple to play, but can exert a large amount of influence on the map. A focused, single-minded Shyvana player can use her to bully her lane opponent, control waves and pressure an early tower. But a creative player can use her wave control in unusual ways, provide pressure for jungle control or proxy farm at the right time.

Some split pushers love the thrill of watching the map and trying to predict their opponent's behaviors, while other are just single mindedly focusing a turret.

So while Seraph played Shyvana and Nidalee, he did so with a creative, divergent style. Hotshot played Nidalee in a convergent, execution based style. When CLG subbed in Hotshot for Dexter, [Link had to advise Hotshot on how to play Nidalee in a competitive context](http://www.ongamers.com/videos/clg-botlane-doublelift-and-aphromoo-talk-playing-w/2300-271/) (quote starts at 4:00). And the following week, Chauster outperformed Hotshot, despite Hotshot's status near the top of Challenger mid players, because Chauster played his role in the greater context of lane control and team play, with a talent for divergent thought.

Despite being known as a Shyvana player, Seraph's skills are more suited for the current meta and I'm excited to see his performance in the upcoming playoffs. But I think Nien would have performed just as well over this past split, if he had just stuck through a mismatch of his innate talent and skills.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

If we can identify the latent talents of players, we can also help them compensate for their weaknesses. 

[In Bizarro CLG's game against Cloud9,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz0dGzhEKIs&amp;t=14m59s) Balls killed Nien in a 1v1. Balls backed and teleported back to lane, while Nien stayed with low health to farm a last minion wave. Even then, if Nien had saved his Equilibrium Strike on Irelia until Balls was under turret, he could have traded kills, but he used it too early and didn't have either the cooldown or mana.

If Nien had killed Balls, Nien would have had a teleport advantage. He could have come back to top lane immediately and gotten a gold and experience advantage over Balls, or he could have roamed to a different lane and teleported back to top before Balls got damage on top turret.

Nien overstaying was a mistake because he messed up Irelia's E. If he hadn't, overstaying would have been a good move. Does this make him a bad player, or a good player who made a mistake? What's the difference?

,singapore,"We all know Garena as a popular games publisher in Singapore. But it actually has an intriguing, dramatic story not many know about. The story was written by Tech in Asia, but because it revealed a lot of unfavorable facts about Garena, it threatened to sue the website and the article was taken down. And if a company with a billion-dollar valuation and deep pockets threatens to sue a minnow through Davinder Singh and Drew &amp; Napier (the same law firm used by PM Lee against Roy Ngnerg), you know the story contains a kernel of truth. Anyway, if you're interested, the story is below, in full: 

**China has a new tech billionaire; here’s his untold story of betrayal and broken promises**


If Leo Chen and Steven Liu didn’t quit Garena, then Jumei may not have existed. By now, everyone in the tech industry knows Jumei (NYSE:JMEI), an online cosmetics store in China. After all, it is one of many Chinese internet companies to list recently in the States, raising US$245 million in its New York Stock Exchange debut.

As its founder, Leo is now a billionaire: he owned a $1.2 billion stake in Jumei on the day of the listing. Jumei made $483 million in revenue and a profit of $25 million in 2013.

But Leo and Steven, both Chinese nationals, trekked a twisty road to the top. Not long ago, they were clueless student entrepreneurs sitting in their college dorm rooms, struggling to come up with their big idea.

The next few years consisted of a series of costly mistakes, power struggles, and betrayals which eventually caused both to leave Garena, which by now is the largest game publishing and online gaming platform in Southeast Asia. Forrest Li, a China-born Singaporean, took the reins as the CEO and founder – the latter is a title disputed by Steven.

So, who betrayed who? That depends on who you believe. On the Chinese internet sphere, a war of words broke out in the past week, starting with an accusatory note written anonymously to portray Leo as being less than the new golden boy of Chinese tech startups. Steven then wrote a lengthy rebuttal and published it on Chinese social network Weibo, siding with Leo and detailing his version of events. The timing coincided with Jumei’s IPO on the stock exchange.

“I had planned to write an article to clear up the facts, but Leo Ou (Leo Chen) stopped me. Things got pretty ugly and unhappy, but after all we were classmates. We wanted to give each other ‘face’, and we had a lot of good friends who were in Garena with us, and I was afraid I would hurt someone innocent in the process.”

“But after that anonymous, fact-distorting smear essay came out, I needed to say what I’ve been bottling up for two years. Leo is no longer my CEO, and he cannot stop me.”
Tech in Asia contacted Forrest to get a response to the allegations, but was told instead to refer to his past interviews to the Chinese press.

*Before Garena, there was GG*

In Steven’s telling, Leo planted the seeds for GG when they met for snacks. It was 2006, and both of them were foreign students at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. Steven was curious about Leo because he was reputably the top WarCraft player in university, plus he ran its esports club.

Leo, meanwhile, sought expert programmers to build out his dream of creating an online platform for connecting competitive gamers globally. The goal was to bring esports beyond physical locations and onto the internet. Singapore would be a perfect base for expansion into Southeast Asia, followed by Europe and the Americas. Leo said to his new friend:

""Steven, you’re a college freshman, have you ever thought about having your own business by the time you’re a junior, without having to squeeze into the subway everyday for work?""

Steven doubted. Leo didn’t know how to code, but said he could learn as he went along. Nonetheless, Steven joined the project. He writes:

“When I was young, as soon as my brain got excited I turned into an idiot. And when two idiots get together, don’t underestimate their power.”

Leo committed to the idea from the onset. He only had textbook knowledge of the C programming language, but promised he would take charge of building the server and client. Though Steven remained unconvinced, they had no other choice as the team was small. Steven would focus on building the website and database.

Leo was a workaholic. For a few consecutive months, he slept only five hours a day, never left his home, and ate egg and tomatoes for all three meals everyday. He grew a beard because he didn’t shave.

“The handsome, professional esports player had become a bearded code monkey, sitting in a corner and staring blankly at a computer screen,” Steven writes. “He became like a hermit, spoke little words, and many college mates asked me if something happened to Leo. Apparently, many people pitied him. The Singapore mindset is that getting a job at a bank is the proper path. No one thought his venture could succeed.”

The GG platform – which stands for ‘good game’, an internet slang which means that a game was fair and enjoyable – materialized. The product was raw: Steven found that the software had “rubbish code”, and his girlfriend sketched the logo. But the product worked, and that was a cause for a drunken celebration.

“We had many wild thoughts about the company, from fundraising to listing. I became drunk and vomited, Leo was sprawling on the table, couldn’t move, and he mumbled to himself.”

After testing the software among professional gamers, the team believed that the product was epochal and would disrupt an entire industry. Those were big words – but what can you expect out of naive college kids with big dreams?

Using his influence in the esports community, Leo reached out to fellow gamers. He brought together two world champions for an online showdown using GG, then unprecedented in the esports world.

The platform was starting to get some recognition. Servers overloaded, and user numbers were “jumping crazily”. That happened at the start of 2006.

*Reality smashes through the door*

GG continued growing. The platform was breaking its own records every day, and leading European Warcraft competitions like INCUP and WC3L were using GG for intercontinental competitive play.

Since GG’s code base was still rudimentary, they did not open it up for registration. Instead, they sent out invite codes. Many top gamers joined, and a GG invite became a sort of status symbol.
It was time to take the next step: get sponsors. In reality, they had no choice. GG teetered on collapse as they couldn’t pay for the server costs needed to manage GG’s growing bandwidth needs. Leo relied on scholarship money and competitive game prizes to fund the business. But those sources were drying up.

GG did not face a shortage of sponsorship requests from around the world. But finding the right one was tough: the team was well aware that many sponsors ultimately want to control the product, and Leo knew he needed to avoid that trap.

“In those days, Leo would wear his best shirt to meet sponsors. Before leaving the house, he would tell us: Do great work today, brothers, and wait for me to bring back the money. But the money wasn’t enough,” says Steven.

“Leo would tell me excitedly how he got a reply from an investor. Yet not long after, he would be at his seat staring blankly. Leo doesn’t hide his emotions, so we saw his helplessness and anxiety. Since I only know how to code, there wasn’t much I could do to help.”

Investors kept their distance. Leo heard from few of those he wrote to. An investor agreed to a meeting, only to abandon it later.

It turned out that getting investors at 5,000 users was a pipe dream, especially back in 2006 when Singapore didn’t have a lot of tech startup-friendly investors. Yet they saw competitors with inferior products get funding, and that angered them.

The team reasoned that their competitors got money because of their MBA backgrounds, so investors trusted MBAs rather than a bunch of broke kids. That was the exact term investors used against Leo.

Leo faced objection, both from his family, and his then-girlfriend’s parents. His family owned a traditional mindset, believing that entrepreneurship was a hopeless career. Leo avoided defying his parents in their faces, but they could not stop him either since they were back home in China.

His girlfriend’s parents found Leo’s business bewildering since it eschewed revenue in favor of growing a user-base.

“His college romance was in a precarious position,” Steven writes. “During meetings, Leo would confidently tell everyone that the challenges were about to pass. But we know he frowns when no one is around.”

*Forrest Li enters the scene*

Under siege on all fronts, Leo reasoned that the best way out was to do an MBA at Stanford in San Francisco. Over there, he could raise money from American investors for GG. Soon after 2007 arrived, Stanford accepted the 24-year-old Leo.

“Upon getting the confirmation letter, a drunk Leo hugged me and wept, with no words to express how he felt. That year, the young Leo became GG’s father and the team’s big brother.”

Yet things started to turn around. GG had reached the 10,000 user mark. Advertising money came in and boosted revenue. Its financing problems were going away. Leo had no need to go to Stanford anymore.

But he was still worried: how far can GG go without an experienced manager at the helm – the proverbial ‘adult in the room’? As he mulled the question, a friend at Stanford, a student who interviewed Leo as part of the admission process, introduced him to Forrest Li, an MBA graduate who had worked in Motorola China. Leo found the solution he desperately sought.

“Forrest looked honest, and when we met he had a warm and generous smile, which made people comfortable,” Steven says.

He came on board as a part-time business development manager. After witnessing GG’s growth, Forrest asked to join full-time as the CEO, with Leo becoming the president.
“In hindsight, investors were right to call us kids: we made a series of painful mistakes. Forrest was too skilled a ‘professional manager’ for us to handle,” writes Steven.

Forrest explained his request this way: the president is the company’s head, and the CEO is responsible only for business operations. The founders don’t typically become CEOs, and engineers especially aren’t suitable for the role.

According to Steven, Forrest’s explanation confused them, but they agreed to the demands because they never valued company titles anyway. They failed to realize that the CEO was usually the big boss, with the president taking orders from him.

Forrest pressed further. He told Steven that CEOs who join a startup typically get 30 percent of the shares. Steven was afraid of that figure, because angel investors typically take only around 10 percent. Further, he later found out that CEOs who join a startup after its founding typically take less than a 10 percent stake. Forrest also asked that they give him the title of ‘co-founder’.

“Now that I think about it, this request to be a co-founder seems honest coming from him, compared to his claim that he is now the ‘founder’,” writes Steven.

Leo lacked experience to deal with all this. According to Steven, Leo was a person who slaves away for the company to the extent of sacrificing self-interest. Faced again and again with Forrest’s requests, he gave in, choosing to believe in his “Stanford aura”.

But Forrest’s requests may not be that unreasonable. He quit his job at MTV Networks to join GG, he did not collect a salary despite being a full-timer, and GG struggled despite its early traction.

,yugioh,"My local card shop pretty much hired me to be the Yugioh guy and I thought it was awesome that he wanted me to do it. He said he would pay me once a month which would be a booster box, totally worth it for me since I'll be going there to play anyways.

So he said I'll be the person who collects the money and names and do the match-ups. Our first official tournament is going to be on the 23rd and I'm really looking forward to it.

So long story short: Any tips or stuff to look out for when doing this? I have been to other locals before but I have never actually run them myself.

,reddit_space_program,"**In Game Start Date:** Year 1, Day 7, 12h:42m

**In Game End Date:** Year 1, Day 7, 18h:53m

**Mission Summary:** I thought this was going to be an easy mission but then I read the contract details. The SRB test required a speed of 440 m/s at less than 9,400m. That's double terminal velocity for that altitude which requires a huge amount of power. As the total payoff for that contract was only about 3,000 funds, I really struggled to find a way to make it cost effective. The only way I managed to do it was by also doing the collect science from Kerbin orbit contract but that only still paid out about 30,000 funds.

In order to not lose money I had to get inventive so I made our first SSTO capable plane. It's designed so that you can stick any 1.25m part on the back for testing and it has enough power to fly just about any speed and altitude that needs to be tested. It's also able to fly into orbit as an SSTO with plenty of fuel left which means, with a few modifications, it will make a great crew transporter when we get around to building a space station.

,h1z1,"Hello. I've watched quite a lot of gameplay and i have some ideas for inventory system. It seems rather annoying to manage all the inventory slots. Maybe it would be better if the limit was determined by space available from clothes, backpacks and other equipment, with possible addition of total weight, that could affect your movespeed and stamina consumption or regeneration rate. Aslo negative effect from the weight might discourage people from carrying too many items, as they are going to be an easier target to kill and maybe detect (possibly more noise if you are heavy? all the items clanking with every step, would be fun. let the hunt for loot goblins begin!).

It was shown on streams many times how logs go into planks, then sticks, then maybe used to craft something else, and it all leaves unused components in your inventory taking over all the slots, even if the items are in small numbers and should not take a lot of space, they still require a whole slot. Same for scrap metal and other items. It all takes a lot of slots, they multiply very quickly, you are forced to drop items and then pick them up and manage all that pretty carefully, especially if you dont have a backpack. Even with a backpack it just seems that there are too many different items (not surprising with such a crafting system) and all the items take atleast 1 slot, no matter how big the item is or how many items are in the stack. I would expect that planks made from a log would take around same amount of space or less than the log itself (you need to remove quite a lot of material to turn log into planks). Same for sticks made from planks. Now it would take 2 additional slots for new items created. Also you can have a stack of logs or rifle, or some other items that are big and take 1 slot. And then there are small items for example a lighter, or maybe nails, scrap of cloth. Those are very small items, and still they would take a whole slot in your inventory each, while in reality it would be many times smaller.

Possible ideas for interface is to either have just 1 big inventory with total amount of space from your equipment. Or have separate sections for different pieces of equipment (like it is now) but just limit each section by available space instead of slots. So maybe you could fit some smaller items in your jeans pockets, but not a building or rifle(or use a belt as a weapon holder maybe). Also it would still be posible to have equipment with slots that could fit a single item in them, like the current 3 slots that just hold weapons or flashlight. For example lets say some badass military gear with lots of pockets and places to attach your items to. Possibly gear that you equip on top of your clothes like weapon holsters, just to add a place to put something in them, maybe not necessarily a weapon, you could just stick a log in there or something. Or maybe just a big trusty tool belt, lets say found in a garage on a zombie who was a car mechanic and turned while working, stuff like that.

System like that would also allow for tweaking these parameters for different servers. You could have a more hardcore/realistic server where you would not be able to carry a lot of items by yourself. So lets say to craft buildings or some advanced gear you would need to gather resources in a particular place, where you want to build, as you cant possibly carry a huge foundation and buildings in you backpack or all the resources needed at once. I dont know if you ever plan on allowing to craft using items outside your inventory. It would be possible to allow getting over your space/weight limit, but you cant move. So you would need to gather all resources in 1 place, take them all, craft, and place the final structure in the immediate vicinity. That might also boost the willingness of people to cooperate, as it would be harder to gather resources and craft and build alone. On the other hand it might also create places of interest for people who just want to steal what others were working so hard on collecting. So maybe leave a guard to look after resources, while other people trying to gather enough for whatever they want to build or craft, so that they wont get stolen. Or the guard might run away with valuable loot himself (haha, should've thought twice about trusting him). 

I hope my english skills are good enough and text above makes sense:) So, what do you guys think? Would a system like that be interesting to anyone?",,False,,0,,Inventory using space instead of slots and some related ideas,,,,,,0.0,,,False,t3_2dqg8l,False,,,,,3.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},,,3,,,,self,1408210369,,,,,,True,,1408213604.0,,,,,,self.h1z1,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,t5_31a08,,,,,2dqg8l,,,izrees,,6,,,,,,,/r/h1z1/comments/2dqg8l/inventory_using_space_instead_of_slots_and_some/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/h1z1/comments/2dqg8l/inventory_using_space_instead_of_slots_and_some/,,1408210004.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441216585.0,,,
,dogecoin,"Hi, I'm from the Charity of Kidstruments Fund. You probably don't know what it is because it's pretty new. Basically, it collects money and then gives it to kids who can't afford to play an instrument in school. It also gives schools money if they need it to continue their music program, or if they need support starting it. To give Kidstruments a boost, I decided to start accepting Dogecoin (and AmazonSmile, that's different)! I wanted to spread the word about this as I do mine Dogecoins my self (not very fast though). I thought this was the best coin to do this with because the market is the most stable (Bitcoin's market is a perfect example as to why I'm not accepting it right now, I can't afford to loose money) and they community is awesome. There's something different about this charity.

It's run by a 12 year old kid. And I'm writing this as a 12 year old kid.
We accepted our first donation on  250 from @Dogecoinisgreat on Twitter.
I don't plan on this charity going huge but I expect it to gain at least some attention in Indiana (wich is where the charity was founded).

,spelunky,"Hello, I am SpelunkyBot! I am a bot designed to collect and collate scores submitted in the comment section below. I can also attach links to those scores for others to see.



*****

To find your score SpelunkyBot will need either your **Steam Profile Name** or your **Steam ID**.


**Steam Profile Name**


By default SpelunkyBot will assume your ""Steam Name"" is the same as your Reddit username. If it's different you need to put a line in your post like this: ""Steam Name: &lt;name&gt;""


If you're not sure what your ""Steam Name"" is it should take you to your profile using this link: http://steamcommunity.com/id/*SteamName*


For example: ""Steam Name: Avagad"" becomes -&gt; http://steamcommunity.com/id/avagad 


(You can set this name in the settings of your Steam profile)


**Steam ID**


If you haven't set up the custom Steam Profile Name you can use your Steam ID if you know it. (If you don't you can find it [here](http://steamidfinder.com/))


For example: ""76561197973948288"" is the unique ID for this profile -&gt; http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197973948288
If you put either code anywhere in your post SpelunkyBot will find it and try it (This means no posting random 17 digit numbers!)


**Link**


The ""Link"" field is an optional field for those who would like to include a picture of their score or a video of their run.


Scores will be ordered by overall score and then by level (if there is a tie).

I don't mind buying directly from Japan if that's the best way, but I'd rather not daisy chain from Japan to US back to UK, just from a cost point of view. 

I'm still gonna get UK boosters, as much for the cards to play with, as the Full Arts for the collection, especially as the Megas have the language differences in the artwork which I think are sweet.

**THE CHAMPIONSHIP PREVIEW**

------------

**The BallHawks**, captained fearlessly by CR0W (otherwise known as rk), blazed their way into the finals with a sterling 10-4-0 record in their inaugural season, an extremely impressive feat in a league in which every team was stacked with talent. They've got no shortage of talent themselves, boasting the offensive prowess of MLTP greats Dino and G1nseng and rookie upstart thefatalace, among others, and the rock-solid defense in Time (tsu/Smiley) as goalie. They fought past the #4 Rubber Puckies, captained by Fez, in a nail-biting semi-final that was decided in overtime. 

**The Puck Buddies**, captained by the intrepid Slide (formerly Analshipment), enjoyed great success in the beginning of the season, going undefeated in their first number of games before dropping a few ties and losses--largely owed to the inopportune demands of laundry chores--in a rocky middle period, but nonetheless managing to finish very strong to clinch the #2 spot as the season drew to a close. The Puck Buddies have [demonstrated their offensive precision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpx2AlexaDw) in plays by the likes of Swerve, Slide, Cahru, Scott, and JakefromSF, but the foundation of this team's success has been in the goalie skills of Rasta and the sweeping and sniping of defenders Dalek23, Dorsia, Fawlty and Shabba--preserving the highest cap differential in the league. With a keen sense for positioning and ability to crash the net on either offense or defense, look for the Puck Buddies to make a strong all-around performance. The Puck Buddies beat the #3 Hamilton Balldogs, captained by Canadsian (formerly 'nads), to make it into the Final.

**Ball Hawks Interview**

-------------------

Rk, speaking on behalf of the Ball Hawks, graciously agreed to answer a few questions:

*Q: What's a season stat that I should highlight for the BH?*

A: Definitely goals scored. We've had some insanely high scoring periods, so much so that we almost came back from something close to a 9 goal deficit in only 7 minutes. If we really focus on playing the right kind of hockey, we can put up some big pressure on the opposing net.

*Q: What are your thoughts on season 1 hockey?*

A: I've loved it. I think TPLH manages to 'be' a lot of really special things. First off, I think hockey is, in my opinion, the best nonstandard form of TagPro that you can play. It manages to be fun, competitive, and beneficial to development of overall TagPro skill. What I've liked so much about the league, however, is the sort of league that it manages to be. Despite being a competitive league, it manages to maintain a semi-casual feel which is great. I would honestly never be a MLTP captain because of all the work and practicing involved, but TPLH was a perfect spot for me (and seemingly many others) to get a taste of what being a captain is like. It also fills the great gap of the MLTP off season with something you can keep your mind on, and it is a great way to meet players you never would have before. I'd honestly have no clue who a lot of the guys on my team are if it was not for picking them up for TPLH.

*Q: Fun fact or trivia about the Ball Hawks?*

A: We are named after the Chicago Blackhawks (NHL) but also refer to the sports term 'ball hawk' which means someone that has a nose for getting to the ball. My hockey name, CR0W, comes from the Blackhawks goalie Corey Crawford.

*Q: Player from your team to watch in the championship match?*

A: Everyone. All season I've played every player who has shown up to each game. Guaranteed playing time for everyone who shows up this week as well.

*Q: Thoughts on how you match up against the Puck Buddies?*

A: I haven't seem them play, actually, I wasn't able to make our regular season game. I know slide stole swerve's hockey name so maybe swerve will just be too pissed about that to play.

*Q: Closing thoughts?*

A: Season 1 of TPLH has been really great. If you're reading this, try out playing a hockey PUG (6v6 of course). It's really a great way to have fun and unwind with your buddies while still being competitive. I've yet to meet more than a handful of people who don't enjoy a nice hockey game. Also, I have to thank my team for being great this season, I've missed 2.5 games I believe and they managed to organize themselves and make me proud every week!

---------

**Puck Buddies Interview**

-----------

*Q: What's a season stat that I should highlight for the Puck Buddies?*

Rasta: yeah cap differential is my shit

Slide: Cap Diff was a huge highlight from this season. Also if we would have collected stats the amount of saves rasta made or the amount of snipes Dalek hit.

Jet2: We won a whole lot and Swerve got carried

*Q: What are your thoughts on season 1 hockey, both in general and your team's performance?*

Rasta: we rekt shit

Slide: Couldn't have asked for a better team. All around a great group of guys.

Jet2: It's a relaxed league that requires no practice so thats pretty neat

*Q: Fun fact or trivia about the Puck Buddies?*

Rasta: wtf I'm not an almanac

Slide: Cahlculated

Jet2: 100% of players on the Puck Buddies are cool (exculding Swirve)

*Q: Player from your team to watch in the championship match?*

Rasta: Cahru

Slide: Rasta

Jet2: Cahru-slide-Rasta and everyone one else. Just avoid swurve

*Q: Thoughts about how you match up against the Ball Hawks? Any trash talk or quotes from the team?*

Rasta: rk's grandma makes cookies like a faggot

Slide: RK WON'T BE ABLE TO DO THE MATH OF THE SNIPES WE WILL BE LAYING DOWN QUICK ENOUGH

Jet2: PB is stacked so watch yourself!

*Q: Any closing thoughts/comments?*

Rasta: gg

Slide: Great season guys. Win or lose you're all my pals :)

Jet2: umm.. fine, swerve is actually really good. And PB are dabes

---------------------

Lastly, a big thank you to everybody who was involved in organizing the league; I know a lot of people lost interest but I for one had a blast. And a big thank you to /u/SomeBallUSA who did a great job on the hype poster you see in the sidebar, and was extremely helpful and patient with my requests.

,wow,"I just boosted my Monk to level 90 yesterday. Understand that WoD is around the corner and the Korkron Wolf won't be attainable once 6.0 patch hits.

So my question is what's the best course of action for me to do get a normal Garrosh kill before the patch hits? Not considering buying a boost or carry since I have no money

Do I start collecting gear from Timeless? Is it better as tank than dps?

As we've stated before (on FB), we are currently trying to phase out full playset* orders, but since there is still an interest, we will still offer it for the time being, at a higher price point of $450 (pre-order price), up from the previous $400.  

This is due to the process of filling out the playset orders being a painstakingly long and tedious task, especially with the limited number of hands we have available. While we want to give our customers the best deal possible at all times, there comes times such as this where we are limited in the amount of service we are able to provide.
We sincerely apologize if this new change has caused any inconveniences.
  
*A full playset is defined as 4 copies of all non-special/foil cards within a booster box set, to include all rarities of RR and below (RR/R/UC/C/CR/CX) but not to include any special rarities, such as TD, PR, SR, RRR, SP, SSP, etc.

,runescape,"*Divination, converting Incandescent to Energy*

Each memory is 12 xp per harvest, 1 xp per dump for 13 xp total (an enriched is just 2 normal memories in 1)
When you convert memories at level 99 you get 4.6 energy, and you get 3 per harvest (Potentially more if you fail to gather a memory, but because its random ill just figure this in as is). 

From 99 to 120 you will collect 7018364 total memories
32,284,474 energy from converting
21,055,092 energy from harvesting
53,339,566 energy in total
53,339,566 energies at 109 each comes out to 5,814,012,694 gp
According to the [rune wikia guide](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Money_making_guide/Harvesting_incandescent_energy), you get 15k xp per hour with this method, for a time total of 6082 hours. Though this does not factor aura, level 100 or enriched rate. 

*Woodcutting, elder logs*

Each elder log is 325 xp per chop, so you need to cut 280,735 elder logs.
This comes out to 1,145,116,320 gp in total, at a rate of about 350k/hr and 30k xp/hr; So it would take you 3041 hours to do this.

*Runecrafting, nature runes*

An hour of nature rune running according to the [runewiki guide](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Money_making_guide/Crafting_nature_runes_with_spirit_graahk) nets 33k xp/hr a long with 2m gp.
This comes out to taking 2764 hours, with a total profit of 5,748,040,368 and its much much faster then any of the alternatives so far.

*Fishing, rocktails*

Going off the runewikia page for raw rocktails, you can supposedly gather 38k xp and 205k gp per hour of fishing rocktails.
This comes out to taking 2401 hours, with a profit of 492,208,970

Mining, concentrated gold

[Though the numbers here seem a bit off, I decided to do it anyway.](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Money_making_guide/Mining_concentrated_gold_rocks)

An hour of mining gold is 43k xp/hr so it will take 2121 hours, at 235k profit per hour that's 498,630,301 gp.

As an tip, using your 99 cape to boost your skill to 100 helps out your chance at gathering immensely.


The experience difference between 99 and 120 is: 91238736

,EliteDangerous,"Hello!

What do you think about discussing our shared knowledge of these utility items? I recently learned about them, and so far what I know is this:

**K-Warrant Scanner**

* Works like other weapons, you need to aim and press your fire button in order to use them.
* Has a range of about 1000 meters.
* Costs about 18,040 CR.
* Both scanners weigh 1.30 tonnes each.
* It will stop working if your target becomes out of reach, but if you keep holding the fire button and get your target back into aim, it will continue charging from where it last stopped. This applies for both scanners, but do not rely on it. If you can't reach the target in a long time, it will reset eventually.
* Potentially does not give you bounty rewards if you open fire prior to completing the scan. I am not entirely sure about this, but I know that authorities might open fire on you if you engage the target too early. 

**Cargo Scanner**

* Works in the same way as K-WS.
* Same range - 1km.
* Costs about 13,410 CR.
* Again, you need to be in range for it to work and you can resume scanning if you miss the target for shorts period of time.
* Can potentially create good synergy with the K-WS, as often you might find stolen cargo and add a bounty to your target. In order for this to work, you need to have the *'Report crimes you see'* function turned on. 

In fact, I am wondering if this synergy works if you use them both at the same time, for example if you set them as your secondary weapons, in the same weapon group. Will you receive a larger bounty immediately, or your have to use them in order? Hope it's the first option. [**EDIT**] Well, the Early Game Design document states that both scanners can run at the same time.

**Tactics to apply when using the scanners**

* Expect NPCs to immediately begin fleeing once you begin scanning, especially with the K-Warrant scanner. Almost anyone would begin evasive maneuvers on the spot, except: A) Ships that are also currently scanning you [they will face you and you can scan them at the same time while being stationary, or while you prepare your position for an attack]; B) Authority ships, who appear to have 0 care about whether you scan them, or not.
* If you begin scanning a ship with a bounty on your head, but it has already started scanning you, prepare to take some hits. Chances are it will open fire right before your scan finishes. Don't open fire before your scan is ready, though.
* Be mindful of the boost capabilities of your ships. When you scan, you have to be prepared to chase the target. It's very easy to overshoot, or stay behind, essentially locking yourself into a loop. If you use boost and it's too powerful - you will overshoot them once more. If you only use full power engines, they might perpetually keep their speed higher, by using boost when you come closer to 1km, which in turn will reset your scan. What I do is select a target, then check what kind of a ship it is. If it's slow - I will boost from far away and then slowly reach them, knowing my basic speed is enough to keep them in aim. If the ship is fast - I boost from about 3km away, then try to reach them asap w/o overshooting. I start the scan, then incrementally increase the speed, trying to stay at around 400-600m away from the target. The cobras often boost immediately, and in this case you can boost too, but use the reverse thrusters and reduce the speed bar when necessary. 
* Assuming you have just completed your scan, there are three options: **1)** See that your target HUD (lower left corner when looking ahead) says ""WANTED"". Open fire; **2)** See that your target is ""CLEAN"". Open your left panel completely. You will see the ship stats and whether it has a bounty on it. You see a bounty - open fire; **3)** See that the target is ""CLEAN"", open fire anyways, risk *earning a voucher blindly* **vs** *earning a bounty on your own head* for killing a clean citizen.
* Of course, you might only be interested in finding valuable cargo, in which case you don't care if your target is clean, or not. Assuming you found a transporter full of sweet goods, know that it will rapidly degrade as soon as your target starts jettisoning it. This will occur at the point where you have the enemy's hull at around 50%. At this point you might want to choose whether you want to finish the kill, or start collecting the cargo immediately. There is a chance that your cargo will degrade too fast, so choose wisely. Large transports usually jettison biotoxic waste, which will further add to the confusion when trying to collect the floating goods.

And finally, if you feel scanners are too annoying to use, give them some time. Find a nav beacon, which is one of the best place for using scanners anyways, and practice them. Many sidewinders pass by, and they are easy to track and navigate around. Just don't ram into them. :P
Type-6 are also easy targets, usually.

Feel free to add anything you want. :)

,DotA2,"Hello everyone! So I was wondering whether for a game where both teams got +-15, if the losing team had won and vice versa, would it be +-35 instead? If it does work that way, it would be significant because I would then be able to calculate the effect of difference in MMR on winrates.

Now as it happens, I take screenshots of the end screen of every Ranked Match I play. All my screenshots are publicly available on my [profile](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zen0th/screenshots/?appid=570). This has resulted in a fairly large sample size allowing me to plot a graph looking at MMR changes against Team Average MMR Difference.

I created a [table](http://i.imgur.com/GalxFw8.png) to calculate the average MMR difference in my games for a given MMR change for a sample of 38 games, which was my sample of non-even (+-25) games for which I had data, existing after Valve implemented the + and - changes post game (the original update only showed the MMR but did not reflect how much it changed, and I can't be assed to reference each individual screenshot to my in-game profile to collect extra data)

[This](http://i.imgur.com/8mNzgso.png) is the graph I got from plotting MMR changes against team MMR differences over the 38 games I used as data. It gives some useful insight - if Valve used a simple formula for evaluating gain/losses based on MMR difference alone, I would have gotten two straight lines. Instead, while I get two symmetrical lines around 25 as expected, I get fluctuations around the line. This indicates that some other form of data affects the MMR gain/loss by a slight amount, possibly the team performance in that particular game (not individual performance as everyone gets the same change). What's important however is that here I confirm that on average, those minor fluctuations not withstanding, for a given MMR difference reversing the outcome would simply yield a MMR change of (50-Original Outcome).

In other words, for that game you got a +5, you would have gotten a -45 if you had lost, and getting a +35 would indicate that you would have gotten a -15 for losing that match. (Data seems to indicate that gains/losses are capped at 5 and 45).

This is significant because from here we can calculate how much the system expects you to win. If you get a +26 for a particular game, for example, you would require 13 losses to offset 12 wins (12x26=13x24). This indicates that the system expects you to win 12/25 of such games, so that in the long run your rating balances out assuming your performance remains the same.

[From here we can plot a graph of MMR changes against expected win rates.](http://i.imgur.com/18ONb16.png)

Basically, the system expects you to win +5 games 90% of the time, +10 games 80% of the time, +20 games 60% of the time, +35 games 30% of the time and so on.

Now for the kicker: By cross-referencing these values with my earlier data set, you get a [graph of your chances of winning a game for a given average Team MMR difference.](http://i.imgur.com/GW7BCIW.png)

The data more or less fits a pretty nice line, which shows that when your team's average MMR is 150 above the enemy team, your team's chances of winning is around 70%. A team MMR difference of 300 basically gives the better team a 90% chance of winning.

How is this significant to you as a player? Well, it is interesting to see how much of a difference it would make on your win rate if your ""true MMR"" differed greatly from your ""current MMR"". For example, if your true rating was 1k above your current rating (playing on a smurf for example), you would skew your team's average MMR by 200, which gives your team a 77% chance of winning.

Let's compare this to [Juice/Swiftending](http://www.playdota.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1398477), who famously boosted an account from 2900 to 5403 in an attempt to dispel the ""Elo Hell"" myth.

Using his rating at that point as a guideline as his ""True Rating"", 6k, although his current rating is at [6530](http://www.dota2.com/leaderboards#europe) according to the Europe Leaderboards, let us look at his climb from 2.9k to 5.4k.

Juice himself breaks the climb into phases, which I shall use:

Average Rating  |  Juice's Win Rate  |  Expected Win Rate              
:---------------|:-----------------|:----------------
  3250 (2930-3506)   |  100%              | 100% (550 Team MMR Diff)
  3800 (3506-4017)   |  89%                | 100% (440 Team MMR Diff)
  4250 (4017-4509)   |  83%                | 97% (350 Team MMR Diff)
  4750 (4509-5005)   |  78%                | 84% (250 Team MMR Diff)
  5200 (5005-5403)   |  79%                | 72% (160 Team MMR Diff)


Now he lost a few more games than he ""should have had"" at the lower ratings, but in fact the figures match up fairly well. 


Someone more enthusiastic about statistics could possibly use the data to calculate how many games on average it would take someone about 500 mmr below his actual rating to reach his true rating, for instance.


tl;dr if you play on an account 1000 mmr below your current one (assuming it has many games played) you can expect to win 84% of your games

,LoLChampConcepts,"**Name**: R.E.D.

**Intended Role**: Tank, Fighter, Mage, Marksman

**Appearance**: R.E.D. is a somewhat comical-looking rusty red and brown tank-like machine in the style of Heimerdinger's turrets, with oversized tank treads supporting a rectangular body and guns poking out. It is constantly vibrating and releasing smoke, as if it is going to fall apart any second.

**Abilities**:

**Passive - AI Base**:

&gt;Description: R.E.D. starts with the item C.C.N. (Central Command Node). This item gives no stats, but can be upgraded with 2500 gold into a non-refundable item that will define R.E.D.'s role.

**Passive - Scrap Recycling Unit**:

&gt;Description: R.E.D. collects 1 Scrap for each unit killed (2 for large monsters, minions, and 4 for champions). At 40 scraps, they can be spent to lower the charge time of 1 ability by 1 second.

**Q - M.G.F.S. - Machine Gun Firing Systems**:

&gt;CD: 11/11/11/11/11 (CD starts after second cast)

&gt;Range: 500

&gt;&gt;*First Cast*: R.E.D. begins loading ammunition, increase the firing duration from 1 to 3 seconds over a 5 second charge time, potentially reduced by R.E.D.'s passive. If other abilities are charging at the same time, all charge 50% slower.

&gt;&gt;*Second Cast*: R.E.D. fires its machine gun towards the cursor for 1-3 seconds depending on how long it was charged, shooting 2/3.5/5/6.5/8 bullets every second. Bullets will deal 15 + 10% bonus AD physical damage to the first enemy hit.

**W - P.E.B.G. - Protective Energy Barrier Generator**:

&gt;CD: 18/17/16/15/14 (CD starts after second cast)

&gt;&gt;*First Cast*: R.E.D. gathers energy for its shield over 5 seconds, potentially reduced by R.E.D.'s passive. If other abilities are charging at the same time, all charge 50% slower.

&gt;&gt;*Second Cast*: The shield activates, protecting R.E.D from 50/100/150/200/250 + 20% AP to 100/200/300/400/500 + 40% AP damage depending on how long it was charged.

**E - J.P.E.- Jet Propulsion Engine**:

&gt;CD: 20/18/16/14/12 (CD starts after second cast)

&gt;&gt;*First Cast*: R.E.D. begins powering up its jets, increasing dash distance over 5 seconds, potentially reduced by R.E.D.'s passive. If other abilities are charging at the same time, all charge 50% slower.

&gt;&gt;*Second Cast*: R.E.D. blasts forward in a straight line, dealing 60/105/150/195/240 + 80% AD physical damage to enemies in the way and knocking them up for 1 second. R.E.D. travels 200 - 600, depending on how long the ability was charged.

**R - M.A.E.M. - Magically-Augmented Explosives Microfactory**:

&gt;CD: 25/25/25 (CD starts after second cast)

&gt;Range: 1100

&gt;&gt;*First Cast*: R.E.D. increases the payload of a missile over 5 seconds, potentially reduced by R.E.D.'s passive. If other abilities are charging at the same time, all charge 50% slower.

&gt;&gt;*Second Cast*: The missile is launched to the targeted location, dealing 120/160/200 + 70% AP magic damage. This damage can be increased to 150% depending on how long it was charged. When the missile explodes, enemies in its AoE are knocked back 200-400 units, depending on how long it was charged.

**C.C.N. Upgrades:**

&gt;A.U. - Armor Upgrade: +400 health, +30 Armor, +30 MR. *Active: R.E.D. boosts his armor for 2.5 seconds, taking 50% reduced damage for the duration. (CD: 80).*

&gt;&gt;M.C.U. - Main Cannon Upgrade: +30 AD, +30% AS, + 20% crit, +100 range (base range is 450). *Active: All power is directed to the main cannon, granting 20% Armor Penetration, +250 range, and causing basic attacks to deal AoE damage for 10 seconds. R.E.D. is also silenced for the duration. (CD: 80).*

&gt;P.M.G.R - Piercing Machine Gun Rounds: +40 AD, + 20% AS, basic attacks deal an additional 20 true damage to minions and structures. *Active: R.E.D.'s Machine Gun fires penetrating rounds for 3 seconds, dealing equal damage to all units they pass through. Damage done and amount of bullets fired is the same as Q. Deals 150% damage to minions and 60% damage to structures. (CD: 40).*

&gt;&gt;E.S. - Extended Shield: Aura (800 radius): +25 Armor and MR. *Active: R.E.D. gains a shield with the strength of a fully charged W. Allies within 800 units gain a shield with 60% of the value. (CD: 100).*

&gt;S.P.E. - Secondary Propulsion Engine: +15% MS, +20% CDR, +200 Health. *Active: R.E.D. dashes 700 units. Deals damage and knockup equal to E. (CD: 40).*

,swtor,"This is going to be long, and I realize this info is already out there, but I wanted to collect my thoughts on this.  Writing it out really helps my thought process.

I've been concentrating most of my play recently on Jedi Covenant (even though I have 2 other servers full of 55's.  I'm just weird that way).

I'm just getting my guys maxed in every skill out there, with a couple of duplicates (2 biochemists, 2 treasure hunters, 2 underworld traders, among many others over 12 characters).

I used to sift through the GTN looking for blue level grade 9 mats because people would frequently sell them below vendor prices, so I'd just buy them and vendor them (this is actually great for low level people who have just enough cash to get a boost). 

With the upcoming changes to stronghold crafting, it's attempting to make these formerly useless materials somewhat useful.

My hypothesis is that they will go up in value, but not enough to warrant actually sending your companions out to get them.  I focus a lot of my companion-time on missions that have a high credits-per-minute ratio (unless I know I will not be logging into them for awhile, then I try to send them on the highest pure-profit missions).

If we look at Stronghold crafting, here's the TLDR (which itself is TLDR):

Investigation, Underworld Trading Metals make Industrial Prefabs.  These don't take long to craft (4.25, 8.5, 12.75 minutes)

* Mk-1 items use 5 each Grade 2&amp;3 blues and 1 each grade 2&amp;3 purple

* Mk-2 items use 5 each Grade 4&amp;5 blues and 1 each grade 4&amp;5 purple

* mk-3 items use 5 each Grade 6&amp;9 blues and 1 each grade 6&amp;9 purple

Artifice and Treasure hunting make Synthetic Prefabs using the same scale as the Industrial Prefabs.

Both Synthetic and Industrial Prefabs can be used on their own to buy basic furnishings for a stronghold.

Universal Prefabs are another type, and they require 1 Synthetic prefab, 1 Industrial prefab, a Fabricator Crystal, and a Fabricator Design (using the same craft times as the other prefabs)

We see a similar crafting pattern to the above for the Fabricator crystals/designs.

* Mk-1 crystals use 5 each grade 2&amp;3 green-quality color crystals (red, blue, or green) and 1 each grade 2&amp;3 Tech Parts (Slicing) blue quality.

Like above, the mk-2 uses 4&amp;5 greens + 4&amp;5 blues of crystals/tech parts, etc.

Fabricator Designs are created with UT Fabrics using the same concept as the Industrial and Synthetic Fabricators.

=========

War Supplies use scavenging, archaeology, and bioanalysis crafting materials, but they also have an obscene crafting time (51 minutes per craft)

Ignoring Dark Projects for now.

=========

After laying all of that out there, I do not believe we've seen the big jumps in mat costs yet.  Some people are buying them out, but they're still being replaced at only a slightly elevated cost.

All that said, what would you buy off the GTN now, in anticipation of increased value (not necessarily what you would craft?).  Investigation mats, Investigation Crafting Missions are my #1 thing to get right now.  

I'm unsure how to value both the grade 9 blue mats (from all 4 mission skills) and Fabrics in general.  Do you think they'll still go up from their ""right now"" values?  Should we buy them up now?",,False,,0,,Post-GSH Mission Skills / Crafting,,,,,discussiontag,0.0,,,False,t3_2dcvha,False,,,,,1.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},Discussion,,1,,,,self,1407868625,class-knight,,,,,True,,1407871341.0,,,,,,self.swtor,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,Jedi Covenant,,,,,,t5_2qxih,,,,,2dcvha,,,GenXCub,,2,,,,,,,/r/swtor/comments/2dcvha/postgsh_mission_skills_crafting/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/2dcvha/postgsh_mission_skills_crafting/,,1407867741.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441223038.0,,,

**1 week before**   

* players make 200-vote polls for kits they want, over 200 votes for a completely un-disappointing kit made by staff is voted upon. everybody is happy.     
* thousands of people gather to the HCF subreddit to celebrate the democratic paragon that HCF is.     
* president obama himself makes a post on the subreddit commending it for demonstrating the choice of the people       
* everybody is excited for the new map which they know to be guaranteed better than the also great map they played before.       
* people put up recruiting posts for their factions. everybody joins the factions they want with no complication and all the factions are equal in both size and skill, making for a very interesting map.

**start of the world**    

* server runs smoothly on the best server box available in the market, bought with the kindly donations of the HCF community    
* meanies who wanted to maliciously cheat were instantaneously caught by nocheat and banned fairly and justly.     
* chris752w himself was accidentally caught using nodus, but highlife thought it was no big deal and said ""nuh uh uh! you're so silly, chris."" then everybody had a laugh.      
* terryogary13 receives a nice meal from a friendly person.       

**week 1**     

* the kit is perfectly balanced, making pvp accessible by anybody. every other pvp server shuts down due to sheer surprise. a livestream goes up of monsieurapple perpetually shitting himself. today, his infinite stream of poop is used to provide electrical power to poor african villages.        
* the staff are diligent and responsible about the job they have to do to keep the server top notch.     
* zanotam makes a post complimenting the smart admin decisions made in setting up this map.    
* major factions duke it out over the end portal which they discovered using triangulation formulas. they all have an epic fight in the end over the end dragon. hypnotoad proves to be victorious out of all the factions, and they sincerely congratulate their fallen opponents on their efforts then claim the dragon egg and exit the end using the end exit that was there.
* the server box's cooling system is so efficient that the server travels *forward* in time 6/12/24 hours and saves everybody the trouble of grinding(which there is none, by the way.)      
* three small factions: FUNDA, vindices, and absolution all form an alliance called ""the tryhard-force"" to be on par with all the other factions in the server.       
* palace is being fought over by 3 factions. the admins intervene (an event rarely seen as it is never done unless necessary) and split the palace cap between the three factions.      
* thanks to diplomatic efforts by xvslol, rebellion and recharge settle their differences and sign a peace treaty.     

**week 2**     

* the server runs smoothly as ever, with no bugs of any sort. happy players remark that the server is so smooth it's almost like a LAN.     
* never before seen underdog factions grow and challenge the rule of bigger factions, making for an interesting map.     
* the nocheat is improved with rafiki's expert coding skills and cheaters are now banned retroactively, regardless if they've ever joined the server or not. due to this, chris752w is automatically permabanned due to the chris752w cheating incident of 2025.     
* palace is yet again contested by multiple factions. the fight goes on for days and the outcome is unknown. however, due to the strong friendships and hard work of megamilk, their quaint 10 man faction takes the cap. highlife congratulates them with a ""free"" 12 oz drink of their choice.       

**week 3**

* a few members of the mega milk faction retire into fishing at spawn, but a few new pals join mega milk to continue the legacy. the legend.     
* atleast 57 people become one-uppers.     
* pvp fights are fought using only legitimate never-before-seen strategies and team work, with all communication channels held in the shotbow mumble.        
* people give away excess diamonds to noobs and boost the shotbow economy.    
* using the new and originally made buildable boats plugin, players hold big fights over the ocean.       
* some ne'er-do-wellers build an unfair cobblestone layer over the ocean to trap boats and they are banned by the admins. they reflect upon the actions that lead to their ban and work towards bettering themselves.        
* megamilk loses a fight against a faction in palace, and the faction that defeated them gave them resources to rebuild for another fight. megamilkleader6969 and otherfactionleader9696 have non-alcoholic root beers together and are strong friends to this day.     

**week 4**

* server is still a fair fight between equally sized and skilled factions. koth fights are hours long and fought with incredible gravitas.     
* megamilk provides resources for poor noobs, and their popularity continues growing.      
* they form a new alliance of pals, which they take with them to feed the noobs of the world.     
* african children everywhere rejoice at the kindness and sanctimony of megamilk, wishing they had their own large breasted woman to feed them the mega milk.      
* megamilk is unfairly betrayed by the villains apacheblitz and tethius due to being upset with how friendly they are to all the noobs. it is later discovered that apacheblitz was paid $500 by the devil to betray megamilk. 
* the whole server sets aside their differences to go after apacheblitz and tethius, who disappear and presumably get banned.    
* the tryhard-force cap the palace or something whtver.    

**week 5**     

* megamilk is upset at their betrayal and leave the server forever, never to be seen again.    
* the admins also inexplicably disappear from the server, and the server falls into anarchy.       
* the ban list is automatically banned by the nocheat for unknown reasons, and all the cheaters are unbanned.    
* the once beautiful landscape maintained by the megamilk alliance is now ruined and burned down by the released hackers.     
* major factions split into many smaller factions and try to leave the server, but there are no other pvp servers because they all shut down in reaction to the start of the world.     
* a few factions of griefers and no-do-gooders pop up and go around killing noobs, shitting on the server experience.       
* legitimate players are forced into hiding as these factions become larger and larger.       
* the hackers take control of the nocheat plugin, and use it to unfairly ban people who are not cheating. many people are disgusted by this as nocheat has never done this before.     

**week 6**      

* cyanide, skypeteam, sixoh, and twilightzone all team up to cap palace, as it is the last resort against the massive hordes of hacking noobs.     
* the fight is massive, and goes on for months. there are many casualties on both sides, with the casualties on the cyaskypeohzone alliance being significantly larger than on the hackers' side.     
* eventually, the alliance falls and the hackers prevail. palace is griefed as it is captured by the noobs, and they gain immense power.     
* no hope is seen in the future by any remaining legitimate players, as the hackers quickly snuff out any forming rebellion factions with their hacked nocheat.     
* suddenly, a bright light shines down the murky ruins of spawn, pushing away at the dust clouds.      
* highlife descends down in his mobility scooter.       
* he makes a deal with the leaders of the hackers, promising them shotbow premium and unbans in exchange for what he wanted them to do.       
* the leaders of the hackers agree.     
* they form a new faction called the ""four musketeers"" consisting of rrowland (conquest), apacheblitz (war), yakman1 (famine) and blazedew (death)        
* they each take a fourth of the world, and wreck everybody in those fourths of the world with faction claiming, sheer pvp, starvation, and dying repeatedly so the deathban lightning strikes people and kills them.        
* using their immense power, they fold back the corners of the world and delete the map.        

**week 7**        

* the map is rolled back by 7 days.
* all the hackers are re-banned.      
* the admins come back and show everybody the improvements they've made.        
* nocheat's range of temporal prediction is now infinite. it now bans future hackers from even joining the server, before they're even born.     
* the pvp system is overhauled, now requiring an immense amount of timing and skill to master. everybody collectively pisses themselves and climaxes in utter euphoria.      
* all the posts on the front page of reddit that day are entitled ""thx hihglife""            
* everybody takes out their credit cards from their wallets and buy 1-ups. atleast five thousand 1-ups are bought that day. the U.S debt is fully repaid using those 1-ups.       
* leaders all cry with tears in their eyes as they all come out as heteromollusc trisexual dragonkin and form an international polygamous marriage.     
* world peace is established.      
* world hunger is stamped out as megamilk goes on an eco-tourist journey to feed highly desired breast milk to all the africans in the world.     
* a cure for cancer is found in the minecraft source code.     
* highlife transcends and sheds off his human form, then rises into the sky as a pillar of salt.       
* every day for millions of decades is a peaceful and fruitful day.     
* the sun goes supernova and the earth is engulfed in the solar fire, killing everybody and everything in it.      
* all the souls of earth go to heaven, where they eagerly await for the next life so they can play the next map.

,gratefuldead,"This is kinda a strange place to ask this question, but I figured if anyone were knowledgable about the subject, it would be my Deadheads. Anyway, while I've downloaded live shows that I've been to before, I've just recently gotten into really collecting them. I love being able to relive shows that I was at, and also being able to listen to rarities that other music lovers record and share.

The only problem is that some (read: most) of the bootlegs I find are so quiet that it's difficult to hear unless it's with headphones on and the rest of the world completely tuned out. Obviously I know not to expect professional CD quality from bootlegs, but is there any software available that can boost the volume just a little on audio files? Mac is preferred, but PC is fine. Thanks!

,LoLChampConcepts,"**Name:** Sidereal, the Soul of the Glade  
**Role:** Fighter/Mage  
**Position:** Top, Middle

___

**Background and appearance:** Sidereal is a physical manifestation of the unique energy that pervades both the Glade and the fae that make it their home. Having become too weak to sustain the Glade's enchanting nature by herself, she has joined the League of Legends to harvest energy from its champions instead.

Sidereal is tall and slender. Most of her silver-coloured body is obscured by a long robe, simple in design yet complex in its ever-changing colour patterns. However, one can just barely see her bare feet floating inches from the ground. Despite the lack of any hair, eyebrows or eyelashes, her face is decidedly feminine in shape and her expression is one of constant focus. She speaks in the royal 'we', her tone ponderous.

Sidereal attacks by extending her hand towards her victim and draining some of their energy. A critical strike uses both hands. Like with Vel'Koz, the attack is not blocked by Wind Wall.

**Lore:** ""Those who enter the Glade should never leave. It puts a spell on you, and you soon forget the life you had outside of it. Words like ""red"" or ""up"" quickly lose their meaning — even if they were sufficient to describe our world, that description would not hold true for very long. Few should ever find the Glade, and all of them should die there in bliss.

Indeed, that is how it used to be.

The yordle girl, despite being with us for so long, has departed and taken one of our own with her. Other visitors have since come and gone. In the past, we exposed our secrets to anyone, knowing they would never share that knowledge with the outside world But now... with every intrusion, our magic falters a little more. Every visitor who leaves alive takes our energy with them, faster than we can produce it.

The Glade can no longer sustain itself. We need energy from outside — we need life. Can your magic grant us that, Summoners?""
*—Sidereal, addressing the League*

**R:** Sacrifice  
&gt; Sidereal assumes her incorporeal form for 1.5 seconds, coating an area in the energy of the Glade. During this time, she is invulnerable and untargetable, but unable to take any actions. Enemies inside the area are slowed, and if they are in the area when the duration ends, they take magic damage. Sidereal gains 1 Enchantment for each enemy damaged this way.

&gt; If Sidereal consumes Enchantment to cast Sacrifice, enemies in the area also take true damage equal to a percentage of their current health. When the duration ends, Sidereal absorbs the life energy stolen this way as a percentage of her missing health. The amount of true damage increases with Enchantment consumed: 20% / 25% / 30% / 35% / 40% of current health over 1.5 seconds.

**Discussion**

Sidereal's abilities have low damage and low scaling. However, if she builds up some Enchantment before using them, they gain powerful utility that lets her utilise her passive for tons of damage.

I imagine that Sidereal's core items would be Nashor's Tooth, Abyssal Scepter and Lich Bane. Ideally, you want to keep your passive up as much as possible, building at least 1 Enchantment before every ability to increase their power. W is used to reposition, chase or escape when needed, and her ultimate can turn a fight around if used on a group of enemies.

I'm interested to hear what people think. I'm not a great judge of power, so it's very possible that I overshot or undershot some things... if so, let me know~

,Warmachine,"Hey /r/Warmachine!

My FLGS is starting up a Journeyman League in about a month, as a new player (to both Khador and Warmachine in general) I’ve taken this as an excellent opportunity to expand and develop my collection.

I’ve elected to start with Khador’s “Alt-Battlebox” which is
 
*  pButcher

*  Decimator

*  Kodiak.

I think it’s a pretty nasty list for the BBox Tier, but I’m trying to think out its expansion.  So, I wanted your collective advice on my planned expansion route.

*Tier 2 – 15 Points including BBox*

Add Malakov (controlling the Decimator) and Wardog.

*Tier 3 – 25 Points including BBox*

Add eEiryss, Kayazy Eliminators &amp; Tactical Arcanist Corps OR Greylord Ternion

*Tier 4 – As Tier 3, but Caster Swap allowed*

I don’t think I’ll make any changes at this tier, but if I did it’d be eSorscha or LButcher (moar dogs!)

*Tier 5 – 35 points*

Add 1) Winterguard Death Star OR 2) Iron Fangs + UA OR 3) Kayazy Assassins + Underboss OR 4) Full Rifles + Kovnik Joe.

Tier 5 is where I’m the least sure of what to do.  I already own the Winterguard and Iron Fangs, and I genuinely feel like Iron Fangs would be the best fit, but I’ve got to admit there’s a certain draw to the Kayazy Assassins (with Iron Flesh they get kind of retarded). 

I’ve also put some thought into ordering the Black Dragon UA for my Iron Fangs as I imagine between that and Fury they’d do some horrible things, it may even be worth it to find room for the Iron Fang Kovnik, though I don’t know what I’d cut to fit that all in.

The Rifle Corps seem like an odd choice with Butcher, but Joe makes them quite accurate and Butcher’s feat-turn can see them putting out a LOT of hurt with essentially Boosted Attack &amp; Damage rolls for a turn, and with a 14” gun they’ve got quite a bit of reach.
Anyway, I’m actually really excited to play this out, and I’m developing a lot of respect for Butcher, who I’d kind of written off as a stand-alone beater.  Anyway, I massively appreciate anyone’s advice, and I’m absolutely willing to take all of this back to the drawing board.  Thanks so much!

,magicTCG,"**THIS POST ASSUMES YOU KNOW SOME BASICS OF MTG BOX MAPPING! LINK TO ""DATA SET"" BELOW AND AT END OF POST!**

***DATA SET***

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KyBb-nDsStC91SooDQit8CX8lPSfkL7U7fix-LxzsAQ/pubhtml


So I read up on ""Box Mapping"" and thought to myself, why not hack Magic 2015 core set, box map it, and harness the power of what is essentially a zero-day exploit in Magic the Gathering!

How would one do such a thing? Buy thousands of $$$ worth of magic cards via sealed booster boxes? Well in a way YES!!

Many people and organizations excited about Magic 2015 core set have been kind enough to open their SEALED BOOSTER BOXES on youtube!!! First we must scour the web for FULL videos of people opening SEALED boxes in a methodical order!

This means people who have the box off camera are automatically not watched or their data recorded. Only videos where people go through all 36 booster packs showing the rare and/or foil for each pack can go to the next step in the process.

Once we find a video that opens all packs from the box on camera we MUST ENSURE they open them in a specific order or manner that allows us the watcher to track where the pack is in the column and Pack#(1-12).

For instance the preferred method to observe and record is when the person opening a booster box starts at the far left or far right column and opens backs from top to bottom. This would be referred to as ""the left column packs #1-12."" Where #12 is the bottom pack in the box. Than Center column #1-12, lastly Right column #1-12.

Some videos they will open the packs from left to right and right to left drilling down the columns equally towards the bottom. For example they would open Pack #1 on each of the three columns, then pack #2, and so on down the line. These videos are a lot harder to follow and I made sure to verify every time where exactly the pack came from in the box.

If even one of the above criteria was not met the video and the resulting data was thrown out, the only exception was on box where he was doing perfect then dumped the booster packs on to the table in the last 1/3 of the box. I kept the first part hoping the data would still be useful.

Many videos and precious data sets were excluded because only the best would do for this project.

In total I collected ironclad data from 12 M15 Booster Boxes and compiled the resulting data into a single Google spreadsheet.

My focus was to try and predict the location and occurrence of the Planes walkers hidden throughout the boxes. I felt this was a good place to start as they are valuable cards and most likely the focal point of the system designed to pseudo-randomize the rares and mythic rares per box. Because Magic can not completely randomize the system there must be a pattern to it, possible to ensure at least one planes walker per box?!

The data supports that hypothesis! Out of 12 full boxes opened and 2 partial openings only a single box had ZERO planes walkers! Even more interesting is the type of planes walker that appeared showed a pattern as well!

FOR EXAMPLE! ""Chandra the Pyromaster""  appears 5 times in the data set but three of those times she is the sole Planes walker in the box. Further more out of the four boxes that had only a single planes walker three were ""Chandra the Pyromaster!"" The other was ""Jace, The Living Guildpact"".

This would seem to suggest that when planes walker boosters are put into boxes that a Chandra means your box will more than likely contain no other planes walkers! The implications are huge! if you open a brand new booster box and find Chandra right away it would be wise to not open anymore booster packs! While some boxes with Chandra had some Ok cards most were not that valuable or sought after.

When the data is viewed from the point of view of the Planes Walkers it seems like a pattern wants to come out, but can not. From what I have read about previous box mapping efforts M15 was not and will not be that easy to map. I still have too little data to crack the exact code. For instance the packs seem to be randomly mixed in the booster box itself. This means that the same rares might pop up as in a different box but the location of the rares can be completely different.

FOR EXAMPLE:
""Indulgent Tormentor"" appears multiple times literally touching the pack that contains a Planes Walker! When it is not touching it it is  out of 9 times with in two or three packs of a planes walker!!! This is very much a pattern and can be exploited as is.

THE PLOT THICKENS!!!

The Planes Walkers themselves are paired up into a pattern that becomes easy to see in the data set.

""nissa worldwaker"" appears 7 times in the data set. Of those 7, three boxes were opened where ""Ajani Steadfast"" was the only other Planes Walker in the box. Of these three boxes Ajani ALWAYS appeared below Nissa in the box and in the Column to the right!!! ALWAYS!!

This means if you found Nissa in the center Column, Pack#5 Ajani might be in the right column packs#6-12! The only way to know for sure is to look at the other rare cards in the box!

So now we know the planes walkers are grouped in boxes like little teams. Some are solo like Chandra. Some are pairs like Nissa and Ajani. While some seem to be triplets! Since Three planes walkers are better than two lets end our lesson on hunting this box!!

Out of the first 12 boxes I recorded only two had three planes walkers. One of those two boxes also contained the only occurrence of ""Liliana Vess"". She appeared in the box with Nissa and Jace! The only other time Nissa and Jace appear together is in this box and the first sealed box I personally opened for this experiment. I only opened half that box fearing all the good cards were opened already...as of writing this the data seems to suggest those unopened packs may just posses a second ""Liliana Vess!"" To figure it out for sure I would need to compare the other rare cards in what is known as ""BOX 6"" with the known opened rares from ""BOX 13 my first box"" if most matchup in all likelihood Liliana is in the box but has been mixed up via the unknown mixing machine!

SO! I bought two sealed M15 booster boxes to test my theory on. The first one I opened a Nissa and Jace, got scared and stopped and then mixed the packs up, stupid i know but it is what it is.

The second box I was determined to open all the way, for science.
My first Planes walker was ""garruk"". After checking my data set I noticed he didn't pop up alot, Nissa is the most popular planes walker to draw. I started to study the other rare cards in the box and quickly got excited. It seemed the ONLY other box in the data set it matched up with was a Triple Planes Walker box! ""Box 2 "" had two Garruk's and one nissa! plus alot of good rares! I opened more cards and 9 out of 10 matched ""BOX 2"" perfect, BUT IN COMPLETELY MIXED UP ORDER!! Same rare cards but different semi random spots in the box!

I went through 2/3 of the box and still only had a single Garruk to show for it but all the other rare cards matched so well! I knew I was on to something so I got to the last 12 packs, right column #1-12 and started cracking packs. To my great delight Pack#6 was Garruk again! I knew Nissa was hiding somewhere so I pushed on! Then it came down to the very last pack, right column, pack #12 NISSA WORLDWAKER JUMPED OUT AT ME AND SCREAMED "" YOU JUST CRACKED M15!""

So there you have it! M15 half hacked, more work to do but that is all the fun! Please only add data that follows my methodology and this data set can be built so large no one can stop it!

Information is for the people by the people so here you go! Wait for more videos on youtube, i’ve seen all and collected the data as of this posting. Or add your own box openings to the data set!

I hope these tables help everyone when deciding on what to keep and what not to keep.  Once I craft the spheres I want to test out, I can safely sell off the materials, leaving me with tons of room in my item store.  I also only keep a max of 1 stack of any material as a general rule of thumb.  I also keep all spheres I make and collect, because I am a hoarder of spheres for some reason!

,magicTCG,"Hey Guys,

I finally convinced my girlfriend to give the game another try and she is now enjoying the game. So I want to get back into the game.

I want to be able to play standard with people, but it may take some time before I'm going heavy into it.

My question is: Should I buy a bunch of stuff from the Theros Block including M13 in addition to the M14 stuff I've purchased, or should I start collecting going forward.

I figure I can purchase a booster box to get my collection up to snuff. My options are:

Try to track down a Journey to Nyx, Gods or Theros booster box.
Buy an M14 Booster Box and a fat pack or two of the older sets.

What do you guys think?

EDIT: Hey everyone, thanks for the response. I have decided to just get a booster box of M15 and a couple of fatpacks from the Theros Block.

I appreciate all the feedback and I think I wasn't very clear on my intentions. I want to get back into the standard play, but not necessarily right away. So I figured start from M15 and go onward.

As for the booster packs. I enjoy opening them. I always have ever since I was a kid collecting different cards. I'm going to purchase the boosters and open them on my own and in a draft. I have some friends coming over tonight to do that very thing.",,False,,0,,Getting back into MTG.

Hello everyone,

I enjoy collecting cards (especially finishing the card drops so I can {unlikely} qualify for booster pack drops), however, I have slowly realized and accepted that my infinite backlog will never be dented at this rate.

,Netrunner,"Hi guys,

I ""discovered"" Magic the Gathering a year ago. I really enjoyed the strategic side of it, but not so much the collectable part.

I'm at my 30, and I can't attend drafts too often due to lack of time. When I did attend a draft or even casual constructed format, I always felt I have no chance from the start due to the fact the people that play this game more or spend more money on it, have higher chances of winning. Also MTG have endless amount of cards, which makes deck-building knowledge a very time consuming act.
My decks just didn't work against decks with expensive rare and myth cards.  So I stopped playing it. 

Now I have discovered NetRunner, and I fell like it solves all the issues I had with MTG. You still have monthly pack, but that's something I can buy and is not a draw of luck. And I somehow feel like this game is aimed to older crowed then MTG has.

Can someone perhaps that moved from MTG to NetRunner share some details what it? note that I mostly looking to play it casual (and its easier to find casual people to play with them as it does not require them to buy Booster packs).

Thanks.

,3DS,"I'm speaking as a casual Pokemon fan, I only put in the hours to collect all the badges and after that I kinda felt done. I'm sure filling up the Pokedex is challenging on its own but I felt like the game's new features just made things too easy. Like the whole deal with the punching bags and the soccer challenge thing, helping to boost XP. 

Will the new ones still include these features? Do you think they'll make the gym battles harder? I hope there's more to the game's storyline that makes things a bit more difficult!

,LootBot,"Soul Wars has been released on Loot. To play Soul Wars players have to join either the Red or Blue team, via **!Red** or **!Blue**. The teams are balanced, meaning you cannot join a team if the other team has less players. The objective of game the goal is the same as RuneScape: to lower your opposing team's Avatar's Slayer level requirement and then killing it. There are three options a player can choose to do during a game. **!Jelly**, this command kills jellies for soul fragments, and requires players to have at least 52 slayer. **!Bury**, this command adds some levels to your team's Avatar's slayer level requirement. **!Avatar**, this command attacks the opposing team's Avatar, provided you have the slayer level required to attack it.



Games last 1 hour, and happen just before a SoF-event. The winning team is awarded with 3 zeals, the losing team members are awarded with 1 zeal. If a tie occurs all remaining members of the game are awarded with 2 zeals. Players can join a Soul Wars game at any time, except for the last 10 minutes of the game, provided there are slots available. There is no lobby or waiting between games, new games start immediately after one finishes.  Players must do at least one command per 30 minutes, or they will be kicked for inactivity. This way players that are AFK can not hinder teams by, not contributing and taking up a player slot.


Zeals are used to buy either Combat XP, Charms, or Gamble items. To spend zeals you type **!ConvertZeals** or **!CZ** and either XP, Charms, or Gamble. Example, **!CZ** Xp 3, which would give me 30k xp to my current Combat Style. 

*Maxed players cannot use Zeals for XP or Charms, they can only use Zeals on Gambling.*


Here is what you get from using zeals in the different choices:

1 Zeal = 10k combat XP.
1 Zeal =  5 of each charms
2 Zeals = 1 Gamble, which contains 4 random items, exactly like how !Buy Items is.

*If you gamble with more than 2 zeals, you will be presented with a summary exactly like how !Clue All is.*





_____________
*Commands associated with Soul Wars*

**!Red &amp; !Blue** - These commands join a team, provided there's room available.

**!Jelly** - This command attacks jellies collecting fragments, based on your slayer level, and immediately turns them in, lowering the opposing team's Avatar slayer level requirement.

**!Bury** - This command boosts your team's Avatar slayer level requirement up a few levels.

**!Avatar** - This command attacks the opposing team's Avatar, provided you have the slayer level required to attack it.

**!SW** - This command details the current status of the current Soul Wars game, such as deaths, avatar hp, players, etc.

**!SWStats** - This commands details various Soul War stats, such as zeals, games played, won, lost and tied.

**!SWTeam** - This command lists all the players on your team by default, or can be used to look at the other team's members. As usual, * denotes the player currently has a cooldown. *Players can opt out from being listed on these lists.*

**!SWPrivate** - This command makes players unable to see your name on the !SWTeam list.

**!SWAuto** - This the command is for lazy people. This is a toggle; typing it will turn it on or off. While it's turned on, typing !SW will join a team, if you're not on one, and then it will do a command that your account can do.

**!ConvertZeals** - This command allows you to convert your Zeals into XP, Charms, if you're not maxed. If you're maxed you can only use Zeals on Gambling, which costs 2 zeals and gives you 4 random items.

,dbzccg,"So like many people I'm very excited about the game I played many years ago coming back. There are some things I really do not want to see tho,  maybe I'm alone in this

* Promos. God I hate promos, only some people have access to some op unreleased cards was so infuriating. I believe already we have a Goku mp available from Comic Con. If promos were simply alternate pictures or different foil I wouldn't mind and it'd be great for collectors and players alike. The complete card pool should be available to people who buy the starters and boosters. 

* Every style does everything. I like the idea that black is disruption, red anger, Namekian regeneration, ect. However at the end of the Z game every style could do everything. Every style could raise/lower anger,  remove non combats/allies, win by Dragon Ball. If you want to be able to do everything don't declare a tokiwaza

* Shitty foil patterns. This one I admit is nitpicking but I loved the pattern in the Android saga. Some of the foils in other sets; Saiyan, World Games,  ect really shit the bed in terms of quality. They bend super easy or peel,  get it together. 

* No more Guldo-like characters. So there you are and you just bought in heavily in Saiyan saga and nail and Guldo come out. For the most part the old personalities are useless. Who are Guldo, SWK, Tapkar, that they make them so much stronger than the main characters. Random characters who appear in flashbacks or an episode or two.  

* My biggest gripe, little to no playtesting. So no saw how black Tapkar literally made people quit the game?  Why everyone at Worlds would use Android 18?  Why red rush zwk was so stupid. 

* And finally,  no more stop alls/a million combat enders. There's more than one way to win but the fact that running against a 50 card (that's actually 41 cards because 1-5 Trunks, mastery, victorious drill,  sensei, you're invited) db deck it's basically impossible. 

All in all I hope they learn from their past mistakes and look forward to collecting and playing the new and improved version of the game. I'm on a cell so forgive my formatting, will fix when I get home at some point

,TruePokemon,"Pokemon's gameplay tends to get a lot of flak from experienced players for being outdated, horribly unbalanced or luck based. Maybe it's just a “jaded vet” thing, but I'll admit that I've often felt that way myself and have sometimes posted about it here. Once in a while I have to ask myself- “if the gameplay is so frustrating, why do I even bother playing it?” I think that's a good question to ask, especially since we're expected to continually buy sequels every other year just to keep up with the series.

Spending some time playing through some other RPGs like Etrian Odyssey and SMT IV recently has given me some perspective on what the battle mechanics and design in Pokemon does well, not just as a “Nintendo game” but compared to other modern RPGs.  Personally I don't really care all that much about completing the Pokedex or breeding some superpowered team, but there are a lot of other grossly underappreciated facets I've found that make the game more than just a glorified number crunching simulator. These five traits in particular are something I think GameFreak is ahead of the curve on, and part of why I'll be buying one of the Hoenn remakes when they come out later this year. 

**1. Clear move descriptions**  
*Games this could teach*: Star Ocean, Mario and Luigi: Dream Team

A description like “Deals heavy Fire damage” is absolutely useless for a player trying to determine if Move A is more damaging than Move B and worth giving up a moveslot for, yet this is the most info we’re ever going to get in the vast majority of JRPGs. Pokemon gives us a clear base attack, tells us straight up what stat affects the move, labels what element it is, and lists any possible side effects. Even someone who’s never played a Pokemon game before can look at a move like Earthquake and figure out that it’s probably a good idea to replace Mud Slap for it. Also, a flat 50% increase for every stage of any stat boost means that it's easy to keep track of how much any stat boosting move will actually increase your damage and decode whether or not they'll be useful in battles. It's very difficult to figure out this kind of information in many other games.

**2. Well integrated customization/respeccing**  
*Games this could teach*: Dragon Age, Fallout

I remember vividly having to reset my character/game in the original Fallout at least three times before I figured out the particular set of skills and traits I needed to invest in to make an effective heavy weapons based character, and practically every other RPG of era was just as punishing. Most modern RPGs do away with this crap (or at least include some sort of endgame respect option), but Pokemon makes “respecs” an integral part of progression. Collecting TMs throughout the game is an awesome way to encourage players to experiment with their builds without having to feel punished if they screw up. NPCs/minigames also exist to help make respeccing EVs and recovering egg moves feel quick and interactive without it becoming trivial.

**3. Balanced, consistent turn order system**  
*Games this could teach*: Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, Shin Megami Tensei IV 

The Pokemon games have balance problems, but they do a good job with the Speed stat- a mechanic many other RPGs botch up horribly. Pokemon stat design in general tends to boil down to “speed, bulk, offense- pick any two at most”. This means that high speed almost always comes at a cost, and the higher you go, the greater this cost becomes. The balance between these factors adds a great deal to the complexity of teambuilding in a competitive environment. The consistency of the Speed stat is also great for the single player experience, because it gives the player a very clear sense of whether or not their Pokemon are strong enough to take on trainers in the next area or if they have to train some more. If they're outspeeding everyone they come up against that's almost always a sign they're good to go. 

**4. Ability to grow your team any way you want**  
*Games this could teach*: Etrian Odyssey IV, Fire Emblem Awakening

I played through the entirety of Pokemon Fire Red with nothing but my Squirtle (keeping a few HM slaves on hand), and later played through Pokemon Pearl while keeping an entire team of six evenly balanced in levels. The whole reason this is even possible is because Pokemon's type advantage system is strict enough to prevent players from breaking the game simply by power-leveling one Pokemon, while versatile enough to still allow this to be a possibility. There's a hidden level of genius behind the Gym Leader system at work here- every starter Pokemon in every game will inevitably hit a Gym which is loaded with Pokemon which they have a type disadvantage against, almost explicitly encouraging you to go out and catch more Pokemon! Not to mention, the EXP Share in Gen VI makes it easier than ever to avoid the trap of your weaker Pokemon never getting XP because they don't participate in battles. Of course, clever players can get around this by loading up a single Pokemon with coverage moves and playing carefully around teams its weak against, but that's what I like about the system- if you're willing to put the effort in you can focus on leveling up any combination or amount of Pokemon you want to play with.

**5. What you see is what you get**  
*Games that could learn from this*: Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy VIII

Oh yes, this is the big one. You know how in almost every other RPG ever, when you recruit a enemy character to your team, their stats mysteriously take a nosedive? Or they lose whatever amazing ability made them a threat in the first place, all in the name of “player balance”? Not here, kiddo. You too can be Dragontrainer McBadass if you're willing to raise a Dratini all the way to lv 55, so you can sweep people just likehow you got smacked around by Lance in the Elite Four. Or you can be whoever else you want, because every single Pokemon the NPCs use are exactly the same as the ones you can obtain and use in game. There's an incredible feeling of accomplishment you get finally managing to catch or raise a Pokemon that gave you an enormous amount of grief or did something cool and unusual when you battled it earlier in a playthrough. Its what keeps me interested in finishing the Pokedex and continuing to raise my Pokemon after beating the game.

I'd be interested to hear what parts of the battle system/gameplay in particular (not just general qualities you like about the games) make Pokemon worth playing for you.

Copy/paste from there:

""First off, let me say Im new here and dont know much, but am willing to learn :D

Now, I started playing this game yesterday and am liking it, despite losing on a regular basis thanks to my starter deck(s)

From the few boosters I bought in game for silver I didnt get any really good cards, so am thinking about spending around 20$ on the game on some Structure decks the game offers. Now, the big question is, which one(s).

Is it better to buy on Steam the some kinda action thingy where I get 2 different decks or is it better to buy gold ingame and buy 2 of the same decks and make one good (better) deck? Can you please say your opinions on all decks that are being offered now (think 7 or so) and give me some advices?

Another thing, the chest thingy bound to account worth 200g, is it worth it, what do you get in there, how many cards and are they usually good?

What's my impression? So far, it's an unbalanced p2w. There's gems, and after a while you are kindly FORCED into buying them. 

Seriously, Peter? I respect immensely your work, and Black&amp;White is my favorite game of all times. I remember your interview of almost a year ago, and what I see now is not ""Invest to play"". It's a p2w, where you have to wait Hours to click through a few things: collect faith, check how many hours is there for grain to be collected, sculpt some land, maybe combine a few more house to the settlements. 

At the moment of harvest there are some feasts. Building houses, expanding. And then back to the routine. 

And it would be ok, if not for the annoying boosters teasing you to buy more faith/grain/stickers. And I could understand even that, if there was value in my money spent, if it REMAINED. My 5 euros became 50 gems, which IMMEDIATELY went into some boosters and a fountain (at least that one, thank you! Btw, it would be nice to move it away from my fields or be able to turn it off). In 5 blesses minutes. There's no ""invest"" into this, it's a wait vs. money = paywall over everything.  

And now, the only really alternative way to pass your time - the voyages - are miles away for me. I have completed the first two, and the third one is... In two weeks! Is this a joke? Maybe a bug or n.y.i.? I sincerely hope so. There's no even an option to buy the new voyage (which I despise greately), let alone to give it immediately upon completion. 

This is my biggest concern. Now that voyages are two weeks away, I'm left with only two options to find stickers. The first one is to find the chests. Yes, I've noticed a couple has respawned in these two days, but the rate is way too slow. Or you can explore new territories but... Frankly, my village is still not ready for it. The other option is buying boosters. 2 bronze age boosters cost you 4.50, way too much in my opinion for what you get (expendable resource of relative value). 

I disagree with this model, allow me to object. I understand, monetizing is important, but this way are will not be honest with your values. It has Dungeon keeper mobile written all over it, and I do remember you disagreed with that one. 

I have been destructive enough in this review. Allow me to propose a couple alternative models of monetising to better illustrate my idea. 

Model 1. Subscription for premium mode. 
You say Godus is a hobby, and can be invested into as such. 
As a casual gamer, I want a free game to spend my time with, and to show to my friends. I would accept all features currently in game, and a valid way to earn gems (for example, like it is currently on pc, or in mines, though higher chest spawn, etc). 
As I invest more and more time in game, I would like fields to be more productive, and faith to be gained faster. I would elect to enter ""inspiration"" mode, where all the waiting time is halved: buildings are built faster, faith is accumulated quicker, grain grows quicker (I have yet to get to miners so no examples there). I can buy 1 day or more of this premium subscription, starting from 0.89 local currency. 

Model 2: hydride
As in model 1, I start casual, and invest into the game. This time around, I can still buy gems when I decide to invest into the game, but much fewer things are available for sale: certain items which give me permanent benefit (like the fountain) or subscription days. 
Bundle packs are also available: I buy some gems, maybe a special item and premium days. 
This model is implemented in: World of tanks Blitz

Model 3: permanent unlocks. 
This is actually the model I believe the most difficult, as it does have the lowest margin of profit. You need to develop a big feature which makes the game much more enjoyable but which is not actually required for casual play. Like, double faith gain forever. Or a content patch. Or some permanent items which you can earn in-game but it takes longer. Contrary to the first two models, it would require a major design revamp. 
Similar models are implemented in: Plague, inc. (yes, I know it's one person company), Hearthstone. 

I think I said what I wanted! Thanks anyway for this wonderful game, I believe it's perfect on mobile. Looking forward for future updates, hopefully my feedback was helpful.

,diablo3,"Okay, so I've noticed that there are a number of achievements in Diablo that all pretty much just say here's a shiny sticker and things to go on your banner, but what if those achievements actually did something for once? My idea is that achievements could give you passive boosts, now I'm not talking about giving them like 10% attack speed increase, but more like 0.5% attack speed increase, or small life steal, and things that as you collect more and more in that achievement teir so they can stack and grow larger. It would make getting achievements more of an active thing in game, instead of stumbling across them randomly or not realizing you just finished it, rewarding you with more than banner decals and would also make Diablo the first game to do something very different. They could also do it like paragon levels and make them over your entire account to help with the specific monster hunting and random events with more than one toon. I can't be the only person who thought this though? I mean cool I killed a monster, got a shiny star ((Achievement)) for my work, and have the small possibility of a usable item popping out, but there is no real benefit to actively collecting the achievements. I feel that if it's going to be apart of the game, I've gone to the trouble of collecting it, it should do something, and not patronize me with aesthetics. I'm sure this idea could get around and be seen by better or like minded people who could tweak this idea so it would be viable.",,False,,0,,So..I have an idea..like a million other people do...((Achievement Hunting)),,,,,,0.0,,,False,t3_2d1hqk,False,,,,,1.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},,,1,,,,self,False,,,,,,True,,1407557363.0,,,,,,self.diablo3,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,t5_2qjhk,,,,,2d1hqk,,,IronTitan821,,2,,,,,,,/r/diablo3/comments/2d1hqk/soi_have_an_idealike_a_million_other_people/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/diablo3/comments/2d1hqk/soi_have_an_idealike_a_million_other_people/,,1407553763.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441228468.0,,,
,SMITEGODCONCEPTS,"Hello! I'm sorry that I haven't been putting out concepts, I got a bit busy with life and have had a hard time getting the gods I've been working on to make sense. Anyway here is my entry for this month's contest; Mnemosyne, Titan daughter of Gaea and embodiment of Memory itself.

Here is a [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/SMITEGODCONCEPTS/wiki/artists/defiantmars) to my other concepts, if you're interested :)

[](#box)~~**Smite God Concept**~~

**Name:** Mnemosyne

**Title:** Titaness of Memory

**Type:** Ranged, Magical

**Role:** Mage

**Pros:** High Sustain Damage

**Cons:** Low Defense, Low Crowd Control

[](#box)~~**Lore**~~

Memory, the ability to recall thoughts and feelings. Mnemosyne is the personification of Memory itself. Born of the Earth and Sky, Mnemosyne embodies the ability of gods and mortals alike, to Remember. Recalling how her brothers slew their father, Mnemosyne wisely chose to remain out of the Titanomachy and later, even had children with Zeus, resulting in the Muses.

While she chose to remain neutral in the Titan War, Mnemosyne has chosen to enter the battleground of the gods. She remembers everything about her fellow gods. She knows what they have done and what they are capable of. They have forgotten what their purpose is in this world. Mnemosyne will make them remember their roles, even if she has to drill it into them.

[](#box)~~**Appearance**~~

Mnemosyne appears an queenly beautiful woman with brunette hair. She wears a green dress gilded with Grekk patterns, she also wears a very small yet elegant amount of bronze and leather armor. Her dress trials on the ground so you can't see her legs. And while it looks like she's touching the ground, so glides across it so smoothly its almost as if she's floating. (ethereal ""shifting"" audio is played, as opposed to footsteps.) Around her is a ring of Greek letters that constantly shift around. As she attacks, these letters coalesce into bolts and fly forward (similar to New Wa). As she moves some of the letters trail off from her and fade away. She gains wispy orbs of light around her as she gains stacks of her passive. When her ""Fleet"" is active, the cloud will scatter into fast moving orbits around her. When her ""Deja Vu"" is active the bolts formed are considerably larger.

[](#box)~~**[Passive] Collected Memories:** As Mnemosyne lands basic attacks she gains stacks of “Memories”. For each stack, Mnemosyne deals 10 additional magic damage to a maximum of 5 times. These stacks will last hese stacks will decay 1 stack per second. These stacks last for 6s and can be refreshed by landing another basic attack.~~

* **Ability:** Debuff
* **Bonus Magical Damage:** 10 per stack [Maximum 60]
* **Maximum Number of Stacks:** 6 
* **Duration:** 4s

[](#box)~~**[1] Fleet:** Mnemosyne teleports a short distance, gaining an attack speed boost upon reappearing.~~

* **Ability:** Buff
* **Damage:** Magical
* **Attack Speed Buff:** 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 / 60%
* **Attack Speed Buff Duration:** 3.0 / 3.5 / 4.0 / 4.5 / 5.0s
* **Cost:** 70 / 75 / 80 / 85 / 90
* **Cooldown:** 15s
* **Range:** 40 

[](#box)~~**[2] Imprint:**  Mnemosyne unleashes a torrent of memories in a cone in front of her. Enemies are overwhelmed by the memories, significantly slowing them. This ability will also grant her stacks of “Memories” based on Rank of Imprint and refreshing their duration.~~

* **Ability:** Cone
* **Damage:** Magical
* **Damage:** 80 / 135 / 190 / 245 / 300 (+60% Magical power)
* **Slow:** 30%
* **""Memories"" Stacks Gained:** 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5
* **Cost:** 70 / 75 / 80 / 85 / 90
* **Cooldown:** 12s
* **Range:** 40

[](#box)~~**[3] Blank:** Mnemosyne temporarily removes the memories of her enemies within a target area silencing them for 1s + 0.25s per stack of ""Memories"" Mnemosyne has, the stacks are consumed.~~

* **Ability:** Ground Target
* **Silence Duration:** 1s + 0.25s per ""Memories""
* **Cost:** 85 / 80 / 75 / 70 / 75
* **Cooldown:** 18 / 17 / 16 / 15 / 14
* **Range:** 55
* **Radius:** 7.5 / 10 / 12.5 / 15 / 17.5

[](#box)~~**[Ultimate] Deja Vu:** Mnemosyne’s basic attacks strike twice. The second strike can proc on hit effects. The second proc of damage can contribute to the stacks of “Memories”.~~

* **Ability:** Buff
* **Duration:** 4 / 5 / 6 / 7 / 8s
* **Cost:** 100 
* **Cooldown:** 105s


[](#box)~~**Comments**~~

This concept is a total redesign of my previous Mnemosyne, who was a mage. This time I've designed her as if she was a true Magical Hunter. Really she's an AA Mage labeled *hunter* in attempts to get people to run her in the duo lane with a support. I had a very hard time designing her to encompass both ""repetition"" and ""memory"" into a Hunter's kit but hopefully I've created something a bit unique. She is a AD carry, so she's designed to be a late game monster.

* **Collected Memories:** *So the first hurdle I had to overcome with a magically scaling god is the +20% Magical power to basic attacks that pales in comparison to the physically scaling gods +100% Physical power in addition to Crit. In order to make Mnemosyne a viable replacement for an Neith, Artemis, etc. I needed to give her some way of compensating for that damage gap. This adds +10 magical damage every time you hit an enemy allowing you to stack up damage. These stacks can be gained and consumed by her 2 and 3 granting a few tactical options and adding a bit of complexity. The damage done by this passive effect can heal Mnemosyne with the effects of Magical Lifesteal items.*

* **Fleet:** *Memory is fleeting so I tried to turn that into an ability. I gave Mnemosyne a short blink for re-positioning and escape, but I also put a attack speed steroid on it to you have to choose to either use it to engage or retreat, much like Cupid's Flutter. Unlike Cupid, she actually has a decent wave clear ability.*

* **Imprint:** *This is Mnemosyne's wave clear ability. Its a cone so she has to get in a bit closer to clear the wave, but she does have an escape. It also has a powerful slow on it since she lacks hard lock-down potential by herself. It will also add stacks of her passive allowing her to quickly start dealing out damage.*

* **Blank:** *I felt that Mnemosyne needed to have a stronger 'memory' theme and a bit more utility so I gave her a 1s silence. This can be increased to a maximum of 2.25s, but requires you to sacrifice her passive stacks to do so. To help make this ability a bit more appealing, the radius of the ability grows with rank while the cost and cooldown decrease.*

* **Deja Vu:** *This is what makes Mnemosyne's basic attacks truly dangerous. It doubles her basic attack out put allowing her to proc multiple instances of her passive, on hit effects like Telkhine's Ring and Demonic Grip, (sadly not Polynomicon) AS WELL as on ability effects like Spear of the Magus and Soul Reaver. It will allow her to shred towers like Old Wa but she'll actually need another god or a minion wave to tank the tower.*

I hope that I've managed to create something interesting and viable. Again I have been having a hard time fleshing out these concepts, but expect more soon. I don't think she's balanced yet so feel free to comment; any and all feedback is welcome.

 **Description**: 

The Summa Crossroads Minecraft server is built on a very simple but very effective core idea - that awesome gameplay should be the focus of development and maintenance. In pursuit of that, over the last 3 years I've gone through multiple maps, updates, and plugin sets, always trying to find that delicate balance of fun, challenge, and drive. We've come a long way from a simple hMod setup to a fully featured Bukkit suite including plugins tailored to our requests by authors who share our passion and ideals. This server has been a lot of things for a lot of people, but it's always been a good time.

Today we feature a vast **16,000 by 16,000** map sprawling from edge to edge with beautiful custom biomes, hand-painted and lovingly crafted to bring the sense of adventure and vast scale that you may recall from your first days of Minecraft. Some residents have built towns and gathered the resources to construct their own waypoints that you can unlock the ability to fast-travel to by venturing there yourself. Much of the landscape is yet unexplored, and each week new adventures are introduced. Many players have developed towns together, and there are 6 player-built towns that already built and activated their waypoints!

For those who enjoy a good challenge, the overworld is bustling with deep caves and the monsters that come out at night will be no allies. PvP Arenas let you challenge your friends and humiliate your foes - paying you out for putting up a good fight. The Underdome lets you demonstrate your gladiatorial might against wave after wave of things that go bump in the night, with spoils to those who entertain. Vast parkour challenges, one of which has only been completed by one player in the history of the server, will spare you no mercy. Unrelenting instanced temples will push you to your limits, giving you fame and fortune if you show the world that you are a true hero. Accumulate enough might and you can unlock ancient secrets, letting you use magic spells to control the world around you.

We think it's important to foster a strong community, and our player ranks are thus primarily tied to forum posts. The numbers may seem a bit high at first to those who have not had previous experience with forums, but when you jump in and get involved you will be surprised at how quickly it starts to add up. It's not just the ranks, either - you get gold for posting on the forums that can be used for forum-related activities and items, or transferred to the server at a 1:1 ratio. With your gold you can open a shop that lets you buy items from and sell to other players at prices of your choosing, or find many other ways to spend it.

Many players have commented that Minecraft sometimes feels as though it lacks purpose. We are actively developing a central quest line in addition to many side quests and activities to keep you busy, entertained, and enthralled. If you have a knack for bringing stories to life and realizing grand schemes, we may be interested in your input! Scattered around various areas of the server are also a host of NPCs that do anything from help you train your skills to guarding temples and sending you on journeys.

Often times it's the little things that make the biggest difference, and we have a plethora of precisely tuned pieces that keep the cogs turning. Little tweaks to the basics of Minecraft and bigger underlying systems designed to reward you for playing the game your way. We want players to have fun and enjoy themselves in a world that feels ready for conquest and adventure.

At the end of a long day, though, there's definitely a need to have some fun. Whether you put down bets on grass growing or sheep sumo, enjoy a raunchy night out at the strip club, or knock 'em dead at the Eagle Eye shooting range, you can settle down after a hard day's work and share some stories over a pint of Mudder's Milk with your pals - or make some new ones! Just don't have too much or you might have trouble making it home.

It is worth noting that we are, by and large, a mature server. This doesn't mean that we include 7 dirty words in every sentence, but it does mean that we tend not to restrain ourselves and generally expect users to have a bit of intuition regarding basic elements such as getting food, making shelter, surviving on your own, etc. We are a survival server, after all - the fun is in surviving!

**Since our last post:**

*[Upcoming Loot Table Changes](http://summaxr.com/Forum/topic/9987-loot-table-suggestions/)*

We have plans to rework the mob loot system, working with a developer to influence some design decisions behind a rewrite of an incredibly powerful plugin. This will allow us to introduce new scaling content and challenges across everything we offer, and everything that's to come. The game will challenge you at your level, and offer you more opportunities to succeed as you become worthy.

This past week, we worked with the developer to simplify some of the more complex actions and calculations. This plugin is coming along rather nicely and will be a very dynamic resource for both adjusting existing gameplay options and implementing new ones going forward!

*[Water Temple Coming Soon](https://scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/t31.0-8/10505203_505046809595614_3897413387035161069_o.jpg)*

The Water Temple is now almost completely finished. By the time 1.8 comes out we'll be ready for playtesting and then it'll see player release! Will you be ready?

*Summa Seconds Recording*

We'll be filming Summa Seconds (again - the more clips the better!) for our community event next Friday. [Join us](https://www.facebook.com/SummaCrossroads) and you might be featured in our video header!

*Introductory Quest Rework*

This week we added more quests to the Quest Master and changed his script to be a little bit more clear and useful. More quests are in the works!

I've changed the interactions for players first joining the server to hit them with a bit less text on join, and add some tooltips to make their lives a little easier. There will be further improvements to this to more reliably acquaint users with custom server features, and let them get an edge on jumping out into the wild if they think that would be useful.

Of course, you can always go Leeroy Jenkins, jump in a boat, and go punch some trees.

*mcMMO Skill Trainers*

An herbalism trainer has been added (for Pages and above - though you could put gold into leveling this skill, you wouldn't have access to use it until you rank up). The scripts for all trainers have been improved and they are now verified to be working properly.

*mcMMO EXP Boost*

We passed the tip threshold for this month to activate 1.1x mcMMO EXP for all users through the end of the month. Thanks to MsBleufox and Yiggdrasile! Further tips will unlock further benefits for the whole server.

*Underdome Gold Boost*

The rewards for the underdome have been buffed slightly to encourage individual play, but group cooperation will allow the greatest return for all users. The more you work together, the happier you'll be!

*Horses coming in 1.8*

I've been particular about enabling horses both because they're buggy and I didn't want players to worry about accidental deaths (or otherwise), and because they represent a significant gameplay change without opportunity to balance. In 1.8 we will be enabling general horse availability, with upgrades available for users who complete the Water Temple.

**Features:**

* High biome density and diversity, with custom biomes.

,depression,"What exacerbates (makes worse, or even triggers) your depression? I'm looking to hear some of the funnier things that have done it. Perhaps in the moment it was devastating, but in hindsight, a little silly. For example, one morning I realized I didn't have any clean spoons and burst into hysterical tears. When I'm not feeling so low, it always makes me smile, like, well, things can't be that bad, at least I have a clean spoon left. Maybe we can have a laugh about these things and lift our collective spirits a bit? ^^I ^^could ^^really ^^use ^^that.

And, what comforts (soothes, lifts, or lessens) your depression? For me, it's when one of my cats sneezes or a TV show (even a campy sitcom) has a plot that wraps up cleanly by the end of the episode. Any other time, these would probably get only passing notice from me, but they are dorky mood boosts when I'm having a rough time. Again, tell me the dumbest, strangest, most bizarre things that actually made you feel even a little bit better. ^^Looking ^^for ^^ideas, ^^really.",,False,,0,,Triggers and comforts?,,,,,,0.0,,,False,t3_2d0xil,False,,,,,5.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},,,5,,,,self,False,,,,,,True,,1407542841.0,,,,,,self.depression,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,t5_2qqqf,,,,,2d0xil,,,FlanneryOClowder,,21,,,,,,,/r/depression/comments/2d0xil/triggers_and_comforts/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2d0xil/triggers_and_comforts/,,1407539241.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441228731.0,,,

###Fun Facts


* Worley has been dominant in three starts since the All-Star break. Since the Midsummer Classic, Worley has an 0.86 ERA -- a number heavily boosted by a shutout he tossed against the Giants on July 28.


* Neil Walker (back tightness) was not in the Bucs' starting lineup for the fourth time in five games Thursday. Manager Clint Hurdle said before the game that the second baseman might take some swings in the batting cage.



* On this day in 1922, the Pirates establish a major league record by collecting 46 hits in a doubleheader sweep of the Phillies at Shibe Park. In their 7-3 win in the opener, Pittsburgh bangs out 19 hits, and the team adds another 29 safeties in their 19-8 rout in the nightcap. 

* Dan Jennings, hit in in the head by a line drive off of Jordy Mercer's bat last night has been evaluated. After the game, the team announced that a CT scan on Jennings was negative. He was diagnosed with a concussion and was kept in a hospital overnight for observation.

Hi, my name is Rob. Recently I quit playing Magic the Gathering.

Brief History:


I'm 35 years old and I started playing Magic sometime back in 2009. (M10) My best friend and I were working in a metal factory for almost 4 years when one day they organized everyone working there and laid off all 85 of us. It was pretty shocking to say the least. The next day my best friend and I were off to the unemployment office. After about three or four months of both of us not finding employment I was chatting with my friend over a game of Call of Duty. We discussed the two of us taking up a hobby due to sheer boredom of sitting around with no jobs. He then told me about the Magic the Gathering Arcade game that came out on XBox Live. He convinced me to buy it and we played it a bit and discovered we enjoyed it enough to consider playing the real cardboard version. It's funny, because of my exposure to it in 1994 (I made fun of kids in high school for spending $300 on Black Lotuses) I was skeptical about spending what little unemployment cash I had. My buddy convinced me that he would be cool with buying me cards. He had quite the savings apparently. He lived at home with his parents. I had rent.
So off to the local card/comic shop we went. He plopped down about $600 on cards. I walked out with a starter deck, a bunch of land and about 10 boosters. We assembled like 3 decks each and I slaughtered him badly. So badly he went on a shopping spree to buy whatever powerful cards he could find to try and beat me. We were both in Noob mode no doubt. But, I somehow grasped that early game was more important than bombs. He was all about buying expensive bombs with absolutely no plan to execute them. We were AWFUL at MtG.


What Happened:


Fast forward about 3 years. My friend and I have DCI numbers, about 150 Standard tournaments, 50 legacy tournaments and about 5 or 6 large Pre-releaseses under each of our belts. We never really did well... the random 1st place scattered here and there... but nothing to get excited about. However we met a new friend that took Magic seriously and had aspirations for professional play and really liked Legacy. For the sake of ease I'm gonna call him Brian. Brian was considerably younger than my best friend and I... something like 22. He had very expensive Legacy decks but was pretty passionate about standard play. Hanging out with Brian definitely improved our gameplay. We started getting in the top 4 between the 3 of us pretty regularly.
Fast forward another year or so and the three of us started playing at Game Days, Grand Prixs and PTQs. We had a little contest between the 3 of us to see who could collect the most Top 8 and Game Day Champion mats. I never managed a PTQ victory or even doing higher than top 100 at a Grand Prix... But dammit I collected those Game Day mats like a boss.


So now I am going to talk about where it really all went downhill. I really started to notice how much money I was spending on Magic. I was always a smart card trader. I knew my card values, had phone apps to make sure I was never getting boned and all that good stuff but no one is perfect. The one thing that I was really weak about was new releases. $35 for a pre-release. $100 a Box, a $40 a fat pack, a couple of poor trades and a couple singles purchases with a new set usually put me back about $300 -$400. God forbid a commander set or vault would come out. This had me really reconsidering how I played Magic. So, like anyone looking to save money I headed to Google and started the search.


Ultimately I decided on a Magic Playgroup. We found a store in town that would allow you to get store credit instead of packs for winnings. (Something that store later regretted) We got one gift card and payed entry. $4 entry was $12 bucks for the three of us. We started sharing cards for decks keeping very specific records of who owned what. When any of us won packs, we put them all on one gift card at $4 a pack. So if one of us got 1st place and one other got in the top 4 we were adding more to the gift card every FNM and then using the store credit for entry. This was pretty innocent at first, until we noticed our efforts were far outweighing our initial cost. That gift card got to like $500 in credit. The light bulb went off and we went into ""Abuse mode""
This started paying for pre-release entries, boxes of new cards... whatever we wanted that could be divided evenly. As long as we kept performing, we never truly ""PAID"" to play Magic. It seemed like a perfect situation. However, greed and poor math got a hold of us real quick. We decided the best thing we could do is add one more person to the group. So we sought out someone that was a regular high performer that didn't really seem affiliated with any play group. We decided on a guy who I will call Greg.
Brian and Greg hit it off real quick. They were about the same age and they both knew each other from high school. Both loved Pokemon, beer and death metal... At least that is what I thought. Turns out Greg really didn't like any of those things to begin with. He just played up his enjoyment of them to try and get on Brian's good side. He was, for all intents and purposes ... a giant poser. It was on a comedic level. He would go and get a new 3DS to get Pokemon Y and show it to Brian. Brian would be like ""I only like the original 151"". Greg would pout and try to suck up to him and convince him the new series was good or something awkward as hell. Greg would start talking about all the beer he has tried because you know... his ""parents owned a micro-brewery when he was a child and his parents are so cool they let him try all of them as tween"" or some weird false nonsense. When it came to death metal... Brian saw right through him. That didn't stop ole' Greg though. He started listening to everything and anything Brian said was good. Like some kind of lost puppy. Brian officially had a Mini-Me. And the sick part; Brian loved it. Greg even shaved his head like Brian to be more metal.
My best friend and I joked about it constantly. We always started our jokes with ""I remember my first etc. etc. !"", ""Remember when we were in high school 20 YEARS ago and we etc. etc.?!"" Then we would insert fake laughs and get all giggly about it.


It wouldn't have been so bad if it didn't start effecting our gameplay. During playtesting we would get into small debates about new rules, judge level questions and pretty much typical playstyle debates (Control v Aggro v Combo) like we always did for 2 years. But, that was before Greg. When Brian would say any opinion now, and we disagreed with him, Greg was right there to sit on Brian's nuts. Not just agree with him either, he would get incredibly loud and obnoxious. To the point I started getting noise complaints from my apartment complex. You would think this would be due to arguing. No such logic my friend. No, the loud noise was the goat crying, the word ""SYTHER!"" and whatever new meme joke Greg and Brian discovered between them. It got really out of hand. Any time we would try to have a civil conversation Greg would blurt out ""SYTHER!"" just as the cartoon character did as loud as he could. Whenever he told a joke he thought was funny, he wouldn't laugh, he would do goat cries, you know, like the ones that were all the rage on Youtube. It was then I realized I hated nerds.
I sat Brian down and told him that Greg was a toxic element in the friendship between the three of us. Not only was he incredibly obnoxious at all times, I pulled out his DCI records and showed him that the entire time he had been playing with us he contributed ONE third place win. We were PAYING for the guy to play Magic. The worst part is that on playtest nights to impress Brian, he started only purchasing legacy cards for Commander. When we needed a 4th Thoughtseize for a deck, Greg was nowhere to be found. But, if you wanted to talk about what a great deal Greg got on an Underground Sea on Ebay, Greg was all chatty and SYTHER! This posed a problem... cuz you know it was a standard tournament playgroup and he owned very little standard legal cards. He was annoying, a poor player, he contributed nothing to the card pool, he was getting me kicked out of my apartment and lastly... I just hated the guy. It was time for him to go. Brian's response should have made me optimistic because he said (Verbatim) ""I consider you two my friends. Greg is just kind of the new guy. If you told me right now to choose between you two and Greg, I would tell Greg to F- Off today.""
In my heart I knew it was a lie and I was right. Brian NEEDED his Mini-Me. NEEDED. I blame our age difference on this. While I can enjoy a good beer and a game of playtesting, my old 35 year old ass is like ... I gotta go to work in the morning. SHUT UP GUYS!
This is when I started getting upset with Magic in general. I officially hated nerds. In the past, I would ignore them. Just endure them for a few hours then go home. We had them all too.


John: The insanely fat guy with bad hygiene and a food collection in his beard. He broke multiple chairs purposely to piss people off.


Tim: The cheater. The judges gave him warnings at every event. When players would point out his cheating he would go full defensive mode. LOUD defensive mode.


Tom: Mister ""I have a Black Lotus in my safe along with a misprinted Blue Tsunami and power 9."" Meanwhile he begs for his friends to buy him a McDouble and lives with his parents.


Jenny: The pretty/ugly girl. You know... every single nerd is ridiculous around her. She's a 3/10 anywhere but in a comic shop? Yeah her. While I didn't hate her... her CLOUD of nerd admirers made me want to MURDER AND DESTROY.


Mark: The creepy guy that comes to FNM in Tuxedos, Motorcycle helmet and racoon tails... WTF man. WTF.


Sound like your typical FNM? Yeah, Well... I wanted them all DEAD. Greg was the final straw on the camel's back because I let this clown into my home.
So one day I just quit. I told my best friend after Journey to Nix that I'm out. Cool thing, He said, ""Me too Bro"" and we haven't looked back. The last thing I bought was a Fat Pack of Journey to Nix, and my entry to it's pre-release with my fourth remaining on my gift card. I tried not to burn my bridge. I promised myself I would go solo after M15. You know, take a break, little hiatus. But as time has gone on I have found myself with way more money than I am used to having. My stress levels are down, I got a promotion at my job. I was dating during all of this... but Friday nights were always strangely unavailable with me... which is just STUPID if you really think about it. I started dating a nice girl. Who I showed magic on one date. She thought it was ""a cute little game"". My favorite part is that I bought a Xbox One and a New PC with my extra money in the last 3 months. (i7, 16GB memory, NVIDIA GTX 770, SSD) THEN my best friend... who his job is shafting him... I bought HIM and Xbox One to play Titanfall with. It's nice not having all the old acquaintances we play magic with bugging us on 360... it's so weird. Magic players can't afford new consoles???



Thanks for reading my long winded essay. I know you didn't have to waste ten minutes of your life. Hope I didn't bore you to tears.

,kansascity,"I've shared this idea here on two other occasions, and it even earned me some reddit gold. I'm extremely engaged in the streetcar debate, but despite my incredibly direct approach to this topic, I value feedback; especially from this group who seems more or less in favor of streetcar, or at the very least, public transit investments.

Here is my alternative plan to the nine miles of streetcar that we just rejected, and let me also point out that most of this can be done for much less than $515M we were seeking, plus, I would only attempt city wide funding solutions because I am absolutely disgusted by TDDs.

1) Close Main Street to all vehicle traffic and make it a pedestrian path/parkway with dedicated rail. This is going to piss drivers off and it would have worked much better if the streetcar had been put on Walnut from City Market to Union Station, but we can't undo the mistakes that were already made by the amateurs who planned this without citywide feedback. The only way to make this rail investment worth it is to get cars out of the way. There are numerous parking garages on Main st that would have to be worked around; Walnut might still be an option for this, but it's a huge missed opportunity for dedicated lane rail. I envision ""traffic theater"" seating in front of City Center Square at 11th st.

2) Hire a consultant like Jarrett Walker  to come in, analyze KCATA, see if he can figure out a way to reconnect people to jobs and entertainment within their communities as opposed to the current system which more or less requires a transfer downtown to get anywhere.

Everything after this would be subject to change after J.W.'s analysis.

3) Build a true BRT route on the east lanes of Paseo Blvd. Using the existing infrastructure, this should not cost much more than the proposed Prospect MAX; around $50M. Additionally, create buffered bike lanes on the west side of Paseo. This would connect Cliff Drive bike trail to the Trolley Track Trail with safe bicycle lanes and dedicated express bus transit. It would defy the Troost boundary, restore one of the most beautiful Boulevards in our city, and potentially receive national attention for 9 miles of automobile free parks through the center of our city. It could be utilized for pedestrians, bicycles, dog parks, playgrounds, fountains, etc, and it would hopefully boost development at 18th &amp; Vine, the castle that is being restored, the old Disney Laugh-O-Gram studio, etc. Plenty of space for ""traffic Theatre"" seating here as well.

 *Maybe* leave the far west lane(s) open for cars to accommodate the residents on Paseo if no other options are viable. Most automobile traffic should be diverted to Hwy 71 or Troost.

4) Consider upgrading every proposed streetcar line to a MAX bus. This includes 12th St, 18th St, SW Blvd, etc. Also consider 63rd St and either 85th St or Bannister. (I say 85th because that's the South end of Paseo Blvd.)

5) Create a mobile app that goes beyond Google Maps. It could track buses with GPS so you know if they're running late. It could hail a cab, lyft, or uber if you missed your bus, or need a ride to the closest bus stop. But additionally, it could function as a social media tool like FourSquare and Reddit, allowing you to check in, leave notes or photos for people, public or only viewable by others in your network, up vote and down vote, etc. You could collect points for checking in at different locations and earn rewards like free fare or coupons for businesses that sponsored it, etc. We could open this up to tech companies as a contest and it would be virtually free.

6) Design between eight and twelve transit depots that incorporate interesting architecture or sculptural design. I dont just mean an artistic bus shelter, but an actual piece of art; maybe interactive like swings that light up or piano keys in the ground. Make the actual stop THE destination. People will ride the bus just to visit the various structures for recreation. Hopefully it will familiarize them with the bus network and convince them to map out their work commutes, etc. It's extra money, but it will generate buzz, make our transit network unique and innovative, plus, 1% for art, y'all. (Grant qualifier??)

7) If all of this is done successfully and at a reasonable cost, figure out how to do it in the Northland. Obviously some of the stuff would be expensive and might have to find public art grants or innovative tech solutions, etc. But the basic bus network could work for a fraction of the cost of rail and be just as/more successful.

Bike and pedestrian is at the heart of this entire idea because it's within the scope of reality. I'm not opposed to rail, but if we plan a holistic network like this, we will create the density that we need to make rail an easily attainable no brainer and I think we'll be much happier with the results if we can just contain our excitement over rail.

I have ideas for funding but I'm not going to share them at this time because I don't want them to be attempted for another mixed traffic rail project by the sociopaths currently running things.",,False,,0,,Alternative Transit Proposal,,,,,,0.0,,,False,t3_2cy49u,False,,,,,0.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},,,0,,,,self,False,,,,,,True,,1407471547.0,,,,,,self.kansascity,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,Northeast,,,,,,t5_2qngc,,,,,2cy49u,,,elbr,,23,,,,,,,/r/kansascity/comments/2cy49u/alternative_transit_proposal/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/kansascity/comments/2cy49u/alternative_transit_proposal/,,1407467947.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441230043.0,,,

Hello everyone,

I enjoy collecting cards (especially finishing the card drops so I can {unlikely} qualify for booster pack drops), however, I have slowly realized and accepted that my infinite backlog will never be dented at this rate.

,Unity2D,"I've wanted to develop games for quite some years, and at the start of this year I finally got my sh*t toghether and started learning C#.

Three months, one Unity project, and a shit ton of effort later, I released Light Rush on Android and IOS.

The game goes like this:

You're a car in a highway and you gradually lose speed; if it gets to zero, it's game over. In order to gain speed, you have to collect green boosts that spawn on the highway. There's other cars which you have to avoid crashing into in order not to lose. You can shoot to destroy said cars, but shooting causes you to lose speed, so choose wisely. See how far you can travel!

Tilt the phone to steer and touch on the highway to shoot. Good Luck!

I am 24, from St. Albans, Vermont. I have a full-time job and my own car...i'm close to getting out of my family's home...24 is overdue for being out on my own!

I fall asleep at a computer for 4-8 hours a night...some like to call my position a ""data entry operator""...but i'm that much closer to paying off all my life bs! :D
That means you can assume I function mostly on a 3rd shift schedule, and that I was going to school for a period of my life!

 I went to Johnson State College (yes I am a smoker, both of cigarettes and pot, to clear that up) with a major in Business Management. I want to establish a good financial footing before I finish school...I also would like to research which programs i'm capable of doing that revolve around accounting and using computers.
I am a gamer...currently working on trophies on Sonic Generations for PS3. I collect MTG cards (two 2015 booster boxes coming to me soon! :$) .I have two tattoos reflective of two different games (Mario and Tekken), with more than enough classic and newer gaming electronics and knowledge about trivia than you'd know what to do with! :P


I have a somewhat sophisticated thought process, am generally level-headed...I've dealt with an ass-ton of drama, and 420 typically keeps me and my relationships calm and enjoyable :)

On the subject of another person, I don't have an extensive dating history (enough sex to know what i'm doing, curious and learning about a BDSM lifestyle...still wondering if it's a fit for me)


There's so much more I could indulge in about myself, but it's easier to be specific with people who are interested in talking, don't be shy if you're in a surrounding state either!  I havent had any recent pics taken of me with my super long curly hair...but I can take whatever at the request, I prefer those comfortable with themselves...at least enough to show me who they are! :)

,fatpeoplestories,"Hi everyone! I'm Absolut, here to tell you the grand story of how my friend went on a diet, changed his life, and all around just became a great person that everyone loved and wanted to have sex with.

Just kidding, but you knew that already. 

A little bit of backstory, if you'd like to indulge (in some chocolate cake). SmellyHam has been in my friend group for a few years and is the most disgusting person ever riddled with fat logic. He's about 5'10 and pushing 275, but he is EXTREME MAN OF FITNESS because he like sports or something. He also rarely showers with soap, has had his gums forcibly scraped from his mouth cause of da gingaviiitus multiple times, and wears the same clothes every day, so you can guess where he got his name. 

Other important people:
Me (Absolut): Asshole, instigator, and your lovely narrator for this tale
The Running Ginger: Health nut, runs marathons, witty dude, roommate of SmellyHam
BeefBro: SmellyHam and Ginger's roommate. Eats entire cows and benches them too, not very bright

It was a beautiful day in Generic Midwestern State (no frostbite warning, woohoo!) so my friends and I decided to go swimming and get some pizza. SmellyHam hangs around with us often, and today was no exception. Except, this time, SmellyHam didn't want to get pizza, he said he was on a diet. Sweet, we figured, he always complains about his weight and how girls don't find him attractive, so dieting and exercising could be the confidence boost he needs. We were going to get pizza anyway, because pizza.

But that, my friends, was not kosher for our dear friend SmellyHam. No, since he was on a diet, we could not order pizza because it was too tempting for his massive gut and black hole of a mouth. Fine, whatever, we'd go to Soup, Bread, and Salad place, even if it was more expensive and lacked pizza. 

Having satisfied the great beast, we ordered our assorted meals and sat down eagerly awaiting our food. SmellyHam ordered first, but he mysteriously got his food last until we realized what he had ordered.

In his possession, he had:

One Chicken Panini (800 calories)
A Cup of Potato soup (200 calories)
Some Chicken and Avocado Salad (600 calories)
One lonely cupcake (500 calories)
AND THE GRAND TOTAL COMES TO...
2100 CALORIES FOR ONE MEAL! WHAT A CHAMP!!! HAVE YOUR LARD-COVERED STAR, SMELLYHAM!

Gazing upon SmellyHam's massive plate of carbs, carbs, and more carbs (but the avocado's healthy teehee~), we were in shock, awe, and sheer confusion. How could someone eat all of that? The Running Ginger asks SmellyHam if he's still on his diet from two hours ago, and the beast replies...

""OF COURSH I AM, RUNNING GINGER, I AM SOOOOOooOOOoo GOD DAMN HUNGRY I HAVEN'T EATEN ALL DAY!!! (not true, he had two orders of deep-fried french toast sticks at work that day) DO YOU WANT ME TO STARVE? WE CAN'T ALL BE SKINNY FREAKS LIKE YOU!""

Ginger shrugs off the ham's rude-ass comments, and goes back to eating his meal, until we notice a sound coming from SmellyHam's direction.

Could it be two sausages violently flailing about in a pool of ranch dressing?

Not even close.


Well, what about two horny teenagers going at it without any concern for THE CHILDREN?

You're getting closer.

Is it...? No...

It was SmellyHam, ""chewing"" his food, if you could even call it that. First of all, the due chewed with his mouth wide open, exposing his salad with an ENTIRE CUP OF GOD DAMN RANCH DRESSING on it. The sweet Diabeetus milk glistened every poor piece of lettuce. He may have frosted each piece individually with ranch when we weren't looking. 

You think that having food in his gaping maw would satisfy him, but oh no, he wanted more. He'd be one of two chews in before another forkful frantically approached his mouth. Each bite made his cheeks puff out farther and farther until he looked like a hamster collecting food in his cheeks, just not cute. At all. And every bite was accompanied by a distinct moan that assaulted the eardrums of every restaurant-goer that just wanted to eat in peace.

Finally, BeefBro pipes up, ""Uh, SmellyHam, I put your meal into my calorie counter, and it's like, uh, 2000 calories. That's uh, like, a lot.""

""NO IT ISH NOT 2000 CALORIESH I EAT HURR SO MUCH AT HOME AND THIS MEAL IS ONLY 800 CALORIES NOT EVEN GOD YOU ARE SO FUCKING DUMB I HAVEN'T EATEN ANYTHING ALL DAY AND MY BODY IZ GUNNA GO INTA STARVASHIN MODE IF AY DON'T EAT SUMETIN!"" 

He was still shoveling food into his mouth at this point, mind you. With every bite the hate grew and consumed him like a little puff pastry.

""YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU GUISE? I'M NOT DRIVING YOU HOME CAUSE YOU'RE DICKS. YOU CAN WALK. THAT'LL SHOW YOU!""

It's about 4-5 miles to their apartment from food place. We all like walking, and there's a Sleven on the way there, which means froooozen beetus juice will flow later. 

So we got up and left. 

And all was good with the world, until we got back to the apartment...

**TL;DR:** Friend eats day's worth of calories in one meal, gets mad when we call him out, makes us walk home.

,WildStar,"I visit the subreddit and forums daily and the amount of vitriol towards this game is astounding. If you are truly having that hard of a time finding a reason to have fun in this game then walking away is probably in your best interest. At some point it’s healthy to acknowledge and accept that something just isn’t your cup of tea. The game has plenty of issues. There are bugs. It’s not balanced. It never will be. It’s not fair. It’s not forgiving. It has high expectations. But damn if it doesn’t give you plenty of reasons to reach down and give those bootstraps a good tug, get back up, and do it again. 

I sat and thought about this question for a few weeks; “Although I agree with much of the feedback and critiques offered up here, why do I still find myself having nothing but good feelings towards Wildstar? Why is it the first thing I want to do when I get home from work? And why is it the last thing I want to do before going to bed?”

The answer is actually pretty simple … it’s the people I spend my time with.

Find a guild that fits *you*. Not the guild that’s progressing the fastest or the one that’s the largest or the one that has the l337 g4nk3rz (unless these are the things you find appealing). Find a guild that truly makes you feel like you’re not just another level 50, but a part of something greater. A guild that will take a few steps back in attunement to help you finish up those silver adventures or grind that rep or simply offer you personal advice while you progress. Not unlike the game itself, this takes effort. But it’s out there. And once you find it, your experiences will change a great deal. The game breaking bugs become a small road bump. Getting demolished in PvP is something to laugh about. Wiping on a boss for 3 hours becomes a collective set of personal challenges. Class imbalances become a [few] sessions of theory-crafting and problem solving. The people you play with will have the single largest impact on the way you experience and achieve in this game. It’s an incredible momentum builder.

Not only does this work from a ‘Hey I have people to play with now!’ … but it encourages so much more. Even if I find myself alone late at night in the guild, I take that opportunity to craft a couple dozen boosts for our dungeon runs the following night. I find someone to make us some food boosts. I mail a few leftover trade goods to one of our crafters to craft a BiS for one of our new level 50’s. I do a little research into what I could be working towards on an alt. Or I take the time to toss a quick guide onto the forums. Most of us know already know more about this game than we give ourselves credit for. And the best part, I have many more members in the guild that do the exact same. It’s been a collaborative effort the past couple of months and it’s been fun, rewarding, and exciting … it’s already been a great adventure.

TL;DR Find a guild that’s tailored to your expectations. Wildstar becomes less of a personal journey and more about the whole of the greater good. The lens at which you look at the game will change significantly and I have no doubt you’ll find the fun in it once again.",,False,,0,,Make Wildstar less of a personal journey,,,,,,0.0,,,False,t3_2ctcsu,False,,,,,40.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},,,40,,,,self,False,stalker-settler,,,,,True,,1407357053.0,,,,,,self.WildStar,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,GM Victorious Failures | Entity NA,,,,,,t5_2sqwc,,,,,2ctcsu,,,n4gol,,24,,,,,,,/r/WildStar/comments/2ctcsu/make_wildstar_less_of_a_personal_journey/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/2ctcsu/make_wildstar_less_of_a_personal_journey/,,1407353453.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441232327.0,,,

,2007scape,"Saw the post about reviving dead content and thought I would say that I have been making a list of things that could probably revive some things. However, obviously, it is hard to to balance these types of changes and implementing all these at once would create chaos (albeit it would kind of fun). I also have 'reviving' dead content patches for some of the other skills/minigames (although not as many) but I thought I would start out with combat since it's the most interesting and controversial ;) 

I apologize about the formatting, I'm unfamiliar with it.

**Fake RS Patch Notes:**

Combat:  

***Melee:***  
* Although there are a variety of weapons used in the style (compared to range and magic), some of the more unused weapons have been buffed  
***Longswords***  
* Have 5% more attack bonus (stab,slash,crush)  
* Dragon Long  
      -Special now raises attack level (temporarily) by 8 levels (75% cost of spec attack bar)  
***Maces***  
* 10% more attack and strength bonus  
* now give 2x more prayer bonus (dragon mace gives +10 prayer bonus rather than +5)  
* Dragon Mace  
* Possible change in that it drains prayer, maximum 5 pray? (drains 50% spec?)  
* Probably not though, not rare enough for such a powerful function (look @ SGS)  
***Two-handed swords***  
* 15% more attack bonus (still lower than Godswords)  
* Dragon 2h sword  
* Special attack cost reduced to 50% (from 60%)  
***Warhammer***  
* Now 2h (to be the 2h sword equivalent to battleaxe)  
* Has +30% crush attack  
* Has +10% strength bonus increase  
***Battleaxe***
* 10% more attack bonus (stab, slash, crush)  
* 10% strength bonus increase  
* Dragon Battleaxe  
* Special now increases strength level by 25% from 20% (There is still decrease in other stats [10%])  
* Still costs 100% of the spec attack bar  
  
***Daggers, Scimitars, Halberd, Spear, Hasta, Abyssal Whip***  
-No changes  
-spear could use changes but unsure what to change
-Halberds still have a niche role so unsure of whether to change  
  
  
***Range:***  
* Focus was based around buffing current range options that are not used commonly  
* More options when ranging   
***Bows:***  
* Although shortbows are still used commonly, there is not much usage of longbows  
* All longbows now have a 10% range attack increase and a 10% range damage increase  
* Magic bows now require level 55 range to wield (and range attack bonus slightly increased)  
    -this is due to the buffs to special attack  
    -the shortbow special attack now only costs 50% special attack bar (from 55%)  
      -Reminder: the special attack does slightly more damage but less accurate (like dragon dagger spec)  
    -longbow special attack also does 10% more damage (previously only accuracy boost)  
       -this damage increase is on top of the overall longbow damage increase  
* Seercull special attack also decreases defence level by amount of damage dealt as well  
***Crossbows:***  
* As crossbows are still popular and effective items, not changes have been implemented  
* Remember that the enchanted bolts are the 'special' attack  
***Darts:***  
* All darts have been upgraded to inflict poison  
* poison from darts do double damage (e.g. 8 instead of 4 for p++)  
***Throwing Axes:***  
* Now bounce off enemies in a multicombat zone (similarly to rune throwing axe's special)  
* Cannot bounce off same target twice in a row (but able to if there was another target in between)  
* Max bounces based on metal  
* bronze/iron: 1  
* steel/black: 2  
* mithril/adamant: 3  
* rune: 	   4  
* Special attack: 7  
* Rune throwing axe training still weaker than normal chinchompas (is that okay?) 
  
***Magic:***
* Unsure of changes, currently strong in multi-combat but super weak in single-combat  
* Possibly a more damage single-oriented spellbook?  
* Spell cast is 1~2 ticks faster for spells in this spellbook?  
* Spells that make your next hit more accurate?  
* Will be hard to balance  
  
***Prayer:***  
* Piety equivalent for Range/Magic?  
* Might have to first look at balance after updated weapons first  
***Ectofuntus buff*** (adding more use for ecto-tokens)  
* Ecto-tokens can be used to upgrade the bone grinder (after ghosts ahoy quest)  
    -upgraded bone grinders can have more bones in the loader at a time  
    -upgraded bone grinders only need to wind 1x and empty bin 1x (although have to put in bones 2x+ times)  
    -even when fully upgraded, gilded altars will still be slightly faster (but ectofuntus is 'cheaper')  
* Grinder can be upgraded three times (up to 4 bones in loader)  
    -Can speak to the disciples (with ghostpeak amulet) to upgrade the grinder  
* Basic Grinder    (default)  
      -Can only hold one bone in loader  
* Decent Grinder   (Costs 1000 Ecto-Tokens)  
      -Can hold two bones in loader  
* Great Grinder    (Costs 4000 Ecto-Tokens)  
      -Can hold three bones in loader  
* Ultimate Grinder (Costs 10000 Ecto-Tokens)  
      -Can hold four bones in loader  
* Possible another thing you can buy with ecto-tokens? (Probably not broken but ppl hate rs3 items so yea)  
    -Mini bone-grinder (Costs 750 Ecto-Tokens)  
      -similar to the bonecrusher in rs3  
      -however, will 'break' after 2000 bones have been 'grinded'  
      -tradeable/untradeable?   
* There is now another agility shortcut under the ectofuntus and both agility shortcuts now go both ways  
    -NOTE: Gilded altars is still slightly faster to level with (and easier), ecto is just cheaper  
    -agility level required: 63  
* Ghost Disciples can now hold up to 6500 ecto-tokens before you have to collect them (from only 60)  
    -this equates to worshipping the ectofuntus 1300 times  
  
  
***Barrows:***  
-Some of the set bonuses are significantly better when compared to others, buffing other set bonuses  
* Torag's Set  
  -Has a 20% chance of hitting twice with hammers  
* Karil's Set  
  -Has a 20% chance of ignoring enemy's range defense each shot  
* Ahrim's Set  
  -Has a 20% chance of lowering attack speed of next attack by 2 ticks  
* Dharok's, Guthan's, Verac's Set  
  -No changes  
  
  
Tell me what's broken! Tell me what's not! If it needs to be changed, say **HOW** it can be changed. It's very easy to find things wrong with the game but it's much harder to change it and balance it.

,nosleep,"				
				
Why hello, friend! My name is Tyson.  I’m assuming that the reason that you are here is for the story that I have to tell, and might I say, I will tell it well! My childhood was a particularly intriguing one when I begin to think back upon all those years gone by. It would be interesting to know where I came from and how I started out from my childhood into what I have become as an adult. In fact when I think about it more and more I don’t know exactly why I ended up this way, as in my eyes it was a perfect childhood! But I digress. Allow me to begin, starting with the earliest memory that I have to offer you. 

My first memory would be that of my boy hood in the summer of 1995. When I was only 12 years old my mother, my brother, and I had recently moved in to a new home apartment. Which, now that I think about it, looked more like one of those haunted houses you see in old horror movies. However, this story is not of that genre, my friend. So do not delude yourself into thinking that it will, as it is not. My mother worked a full time job at a local college and my brother and me would usually be baby-sat by one of our neighbors when she was off at work. We used to hate this particular woman, whom we called Miss. Hickory, due to her old age and her strict demeanor – like a stereotypical librarian who would shush any person who was trying to speak in the library. She would always sit on her back porch in a rocking chair and stare out towards our house, due to the fact that we lived across the street from her. This served the duel purpose of also allowing her to watch for anyone getting near her vegetable garden, especially my brother and I – every time me and my brother would be playing outside, she would scowl at us for getting too close to her vegetable garden. She was damn convincing, because every time we got near it she would yell and scream at us not to or “else,” and, almost immediately, we would turn tail and run back home. I’ll tell ya when you're five years old and you hear those words you really begin to think what she will do to you. I mean me and my brother would constantly try to come up with what she might do to use if we ever got near her garden, but despite this, we did heed her warning and did stay away from it. 
	
Despite that woman’s constant nagging at my brother and I, we began to explore more and more of her house and progressively got braver and braver with each visit. Especially since all we did at her house was either read or just take naps in her living room. Her house wasn’t very large and by my guess I would say it would have been at least a two story with around five to six rooms in it. The living room was full of decorative cuckoo clocks, some bird nests, some old furniture that included a stretch sofa that began from the center of the room to the left most-window...Oh, and speaking of windows in the room, she had two large windows in the living room which one was behind the couch, and the other one was seated to the right of the couch which… oh – darn I forgot what this particular window gave view of. My apologies, please, allow me to continue. The room contained a medium-size TV that was at the center of the room, which, despite having a TV, this woman would not allow us to watch in her house., this was only one of the many reasons why I felt hatred towards her. However, both my brother and I had the curiosity of just what this particular woman held in the remainder of her little abode, so we began to come to the decision that we were going to investigate just what our dear old neighbor had in those 5 remaining rooms. 
	
I think that it was after the third day of being baby sat by Ms. Hickory that we began our little escapade. My mother had just woken us up from our bed and we were getting dressed when my brother began to ask,  “What exactly do you think she has in her house?” I paused for a moment since I was still trying to wake at this point and after slipping on my Batman t-shirt I looked over to my brother and shrugged 

“I don’t maybe her witches’ broom stick or maybe even a cauldron?” I jokingly retorted.

 We had always thought of Ms. Hickory as a witch since she was a very old woman and tended to look a little wicked in her rocking chair glowering at the rest of the denizens of our little neighborhood. 

The morning went on with the daily routine with me heading to the kitchen to get some breakfast. My brother and I quietly ate our Coco-Puffs and my mom quietly busied herself with getting ready to go to work. Suddenly, she stopped amidst her routine and looked at us with a worried look.

 “Are you two okay? You usually aren’t this quiet in the morning.”

 I didn’t want to worry my mother so I simply looked up at her, and smiled. “Yeah we’re fine, mama, I guess we are still waking up.” I laughed a little bit at the thought but I felt a bad taste in my mouth, as I usually do when I lie even to this day, and kindly reassured my mother that everything was okay. She stared at us for a few minutes and cracked a smile and patted our heads 

“I’d say you guys need more caffeine than I do!” she said jokingly. As she walked out of the kitchen I began to eat more of my cereal. 

The last thing I wanted to do, at this point, was worry my mother because at this point in her life she should not have to worry about her children since she had so much to worry about already such as the bills or family issues. Furthermore, she already worried about us having to being baby sat by Ms. Hickory because of the way we would try to dissuade her from having Ms. Hickory babysit us, but as we began to complain my mother began to deal with more bills and stress from her workplace. So you can understand why I had to lie to my mother because if I were to tell her about my troubles then it would result in piling more stress on my mother, and she was already at her limit. 

After breakfast my brother and I began to head out the door with my mother close behind us as we opened the door to our we saw one of the two cats we had standing at the front door waiting to be allowed inside. “Hey Patches!” I exclaimed as began petting her calico fur, and in response she began rubbing against my leg covering my blue jeans in some fur. After my petting, she dashed into the house as my mother began to close the door. I always loved those cats they always helped me through some hard times such as when Ms. Hickory upset me when I had done nothing wrong when I was only near her garden. Or what the other children had said to me at school such as nerd, freak, and many other names. 

We walked across the street to her house whose front entrance was a single door in the middle of one huge window to the right of the door and a large porch with a hand rail that went around the house all the way to the back. There was also a large overhang over the porch in order to give the ones underneath it a proper oasis from the blaring sun. In front of the house laid an iron gate that separated the sidewalk from her outside garden. Also, yes that is where the damn thing was and I’m sorry for not mentioning it beforehand but I just remembered its location, okay, memory isn’t so easy when you have to remember when you were five years old. My mother followed us closely as if she was making sure we would actually knock on the door and go inside the house because, excluding the fact that my brother and I were extremely young, she knew that we’d probably just play at the neighborhood playground all day and ditch being baby sat by that witch, and I mean almost anything was better than that torture.  

We walked up to the door with each step echoing through the wood and as we stepped on to the porch my heart literally felt inside my throat. My mother knocked at the white door and waited for a response. The curtain in the large window swished and I saw an old woman looking at us in that brief instance, but they then swished back to their original stillness. Then, almost a few seconds after the door swung open revealing a wrinkly old woman who was dressed in a worn out long sleeve shirt and jeans. Her hair looked like a gray perm on top of her wrinkly head, and her eyes, which glowered at my brother and I at a split second and then snapped up to my mother. 

“Hello Ms. Hickory,” my mother said in a welcoming tone “I am just here to drop off the boys for the day.” The old woman simply gave a slight nod, and opened the door.

“Alright, come along boys. We have a lot of chores to do today and we musn’t dilly dally.” Ms. Hickory retorted to us. I looked up to my mom and hugged her and she hugged me back. 

“Don’t worry, sweetie, I’ll be back at around 5.” She whispered as she crouched down to hug me.

 I simply nodded and began to walk inside Ms. Hickory’s house. This was going to be a long day I just knew it. The door then closed behind me, and thus the day where we would find out just what kind of person Ms. Hickory was had begun. 

I was standing in a medium hallway that led to the living room, and in this hallway were the occasional pictures and various cuckoo clocks. Leading upstairs was a long staircase with a railing to the right of the hallway. So I had to move to left of it to continue to the living room. I entered the room begrudgingly and sat down on the left of my brother on the couch and waited for Ms. Hickory to come back down from her room, which is where she made our daily chore list. Which could take about five or ten minutes depending on the day. During that time, my brother and I discussed how we would sneak a peak at the rooms that she kept us away from. Our plan was simple; while we came in and out of the house we would detour and open a slight crack in the door, and try to see what she had in each room. Then, shut the door when we spent at least a few seconds looking inside it. I would explore the first three doors in the hallway that were connected to the living room. My brother, since he was scared of going upstairs, would explore the door located underneath the staircase. 

“Alright,” I said to my brother “Remember, only open the door a little bit but not too much. You only need to see what the room is like in the crack.” I instructed to my little brother.

 He was about the same age that I was but he was still a year younger than me. So I still had to act like the more responsible one out of the two of us. 

Ms. Hickory returned with the chore list and assigned me to clean the kitchen, which was located right behind the living room and wash the dishes as I cleaned. My brother was assigned to do laundry and not knowing where the room was Ms. Hickory directed him to the door underneath the staircase and opened the door revealing a staircase that twisted around to the darkness below. 

“I will bring the clothes to you in baskets,” she said “Just take the detergent beside the washing machine, which is in the cabinet above the dryer”
 
She began to walk down the stairs with my brother in tow, and as I began to follow them she stopped me and said. 

“Tyson, you have a kitchen to clean. So get to it.” 

Knowing that she would probably yell at me I walked over to the kitchen and opened the door, which was located a few feet from the couch. The kitchen was not much to look at. Its flooring was a white tiled floor that looked like it had been recently cleaned. In the center of the room was a medium sized coffee table that had several wooden chairs. To the right of the coffee table was the countertop that stretched from the back of the room, where in the top right hand corner of the room was a door that led to the backyard. To the wall that was beside me, there were two windows in the room, one to the left of me that viewed our house and the street that separated the two houses. The other was located above the stove, which lay in the near center of the elongated counter, which viewed the backyard. In all honesty it was pretty much a boring little room, but I do remember being particularly disgusted of the coffee table because that was where Ms. Hickory cut her vegetables. Which already smelled horrible and their taste was widely varied from a weird sour tangy taste to a sort of sweet taste within each of the vegetable. It was really weird on how I would play a sort of guessing game at lunch. Other than that little nit bit of contempt that I had against the room, I was rather content with it. 

While I cleaned the dishes I began to think about what my brother was experiencing in that supposed laundry room, and what he was taking in from that room and or what exactly was in that room. Despite this thought I finished my work and after putting away the dishes I walked over to the kitchen door and peeked out to see if Ms. Hickory was anywhere in sight. 

Seeing that she wasn’t I quietly tip toed over to the hallway and began to make my way to the door that was right across from the staircase. I quickly looked back at the opened door to the so-called “Laundry Room” and saw that Ms. Hickory had still not returned from the room. With this in mind I slowly began to open the door until there was a crack in the doorway. Once I opened the door just enough to allow me to see in inside I peered in to the room. It was very hard to see due to the fact that that the light of the room had not been turned on, but what I could see was some sort of pile of sorts but I couldn’t see what it was and there were a variety of bags, which I quickly identified due to the silhouettes of circular dark bags that were revealed by a small window with the blinds shielded most of the sun’s rays out. All except for those few rays that aided me in revealing the very silhouettes that I saw before me. Then, as I began to try and reach for the light switch I heard the echoing of footsteps coming up the staircase of the laundry room. I quickly closed the door and managed to quickly, but quietly, stride over to the living room and pretend to be exiting the kitchen. 

I saw that my brother was struggling to try and lift the huge load of clothes that seemed could be more of weights rather than a stack of clothing. Ms. Hickory looked at me and said, 

“I have to take out the garbage but I’ll be right back to check on you before I go.” 

She then looked toward my brother and then uttered another command directed towards him this time. 

“Gavin, please go set down the clothes on the couch, and wait for me to get back.” 

With that she walked away and after the sound of a nearby door closing my brother and I set the clothes down on to the couch, and once we had set everything down he began to detail the room that he went in to. 

Apparently the room floor was concrete and the walls were red brick laden with plaster linking each individual brick to one another. The room itself contained a variety of boxes and assortments of different antiques that my brother could not recall since the room was very dark. Furthermore, the only sources of illumination were a single flickering light bulb that dangled from a thread and a medium sized window. Which viewed only the grass of the front yard and some of the street. From that window’s streamline of sunlight, it revealed the white washing machine or as my brother put it a “Washer Machiney,” and a white dryer. It seemed pretty much the same as the kitchen, meaning that it was a pretty ordinary if not cliché type of room that an elderly person would have; now that I think about it. 

“ Was there anything, else?” I asked him. He shook his head and said “Nothin’ big brother.” He said reassuringly. 

I simply sighed and nodded my head, and after a few minutes Ms. Hickory returned with a garbage bag in hand. Which looked like 

“Tyson,” she said “You and Gavin help vacuum the living room while I throw away some trash ”

I looked at the bag for a second and recognized it almost instantly as she raised it above her hip. It was the same sort of bag that resemble the same shape, and size of the bags that I saw in that room that I peeked into just a few moments ago! ‘Yes!’ I thought to myself in triumph that I might discover what exactly was in those bags. Perhaps from that discovery I might be able to discover what exactly she was hiding. But, I would have wait because if I began digging through the garbage bin in the middle of the day she might discover what I was up to so I would wait until the end of the day. After she walked away, I told my brother about my plan. He reluctantly agreed, after I had told him that all we were going to do was sneak out of our bed room window, sneak around to the back of neighborhood dump. Which is where she dumps most of her garbage and it was conveniently, just at the end of the street. Which would take only a few minutes to walk, or in our case, sneak over to. With our plan set we continued on with our chores and day as usual, and I began to think about what she had in that garbage bag. The other idea was to sneak another peek at the room that the bag originally was in. However, knowing that she would be back at any second. Also, adding the fact that I was extremely nervous at this point I just could not take the risk of entering that room with that over my head. 

At lunch time Ms. Hickory fixed us some vegetable stew with some fried squash that might add tasted quite good for once, and, for once, I was relieved not to play the sour or sweet guessing game with the meal she had made for me and my brother. I wonder what she done differently to this batch of vegetables that she hadn’t done before? Maybe she finally learned how to cook the vegetables just right, and not leave the cooking just to chance. However, I didn’t have the guts to ask her though. I didn’t want to make her despise me even more from my rude comments on her cooking. However, in order to lighten the mood in the room I began to chat with Ms. Hickory. 

“Ms. Hickory,” I began after swallowing a mouthful of soup. “Why do you collect so many cuckoo clocks?” I asked. 

“Well,” she began “My father collected them when I was young girl and I guess I like the way they remind me of him.” 

She began to tell us about how she grew up and what she went through as a child. I listened intently at what she had to say but my brother was only paying attention to his soup either out of apathy for the old woman. Or, he just didn’t want to listen to an elder ramble on about their life in the past. Either way, I began to see that this old woman wasn’t just some crazy old lady, but just a lonely old woman who had endured the torment of time. During the time that we used for lunch, which was from 12:00 to 1:30, she told me tales of her youth. One of my favorites was the tale that she told me of when she married a charming young man who swooned her off her feet when she was only seventeen. Also, she told me that they had married one another right after her high school graduation. She would go on and on about how much she loved her husband and how much he loved her. 

“His name was Jonathan,” she said dreamily “he was a wonderful man who would make me feel so warm on the inside, as love does to a young girl’s heart. He used to wake up every morning, make me breakfast, and tell me how I reminded him of the sparkling morning sun. I just wish…that I could still feel that sort of love as before.” 

I looked up to Ms. Hickory and she looked as though she was on the edge of tears so , being as young as I was,  I asked. 

“Do you miss him?” 

She didn’t even look back at me but simply nodded then got up from the coffee table and placed her plate in to the sink and began washing it. While washing the dishes she asked me. 

“Tyson, have you ever felt what love feels like?” 

The question itself baffled me a little and I was taken back by what she had said. I looked down at my soup and began to think of when was the last time that I had felt love. I then remembered that I had loved my cat, Patches. She would always comfort me whenever I got home. She would rub up against me and I would pick her up and hug her. That sort of “love” felt so warm to me. 

“I love my cat, Patches!” I chirped happily. “I love her because she always helped me get through my worst days at school.” 

I saw her face change a little bit, but only just a little bit. I began to feel a little unsettled. Why exactly had she asked me that question? As I sat there in the chair I began to think about what love, besides the feelings I had felt for my mom and my most beloved cat, really felt like. 

Luckily, I heard the clock chime and I thanked God that it was 1:30. Because, at this point I felt that I had offended and hurt Ms. Hickory from my insensitive retort.  I quickly went back to my daily chores, which was, at this point, to help my brother fold up the clothes in the living room. ‘Maybe we had it all wrong about Ms. Hickory,’ I thought to myself as I began folding clothes ‘However, we still have three more rooms to go since we can’t go into the one with the garbage bags.’ My brother and I concluded that while one of us was going to the bathroom, which was upstairs to the left, which was conveniently placed to the left of her main bedroom. So the plan was while I was going up to the bathroom I would peak in to the bedroom to see what secrets it potentially held. 

After I had folded the last of the clothes I looked over to my brother and he simply nodded, and I walked in to the kitchen once more where Ms. Hickory appeared to finish up washing the dishes and heard me come in through the door. I told her that I needed to use the restroom, and asked for her permission and she simply nodded and said. 

“Be sure to clean up after yourself.” 

I simply retorted a thank you and strode over to the staircase and as I began climbing the stairs, and admittedly, I was beginning to become nervous as I neared the door. The hallway that led to both rooms was of medium length that allowed for only for a dozen steps at least with the bathroom only a few steps away from the master bedroom, which was a straight shot from the staircase. 

I was at the door, and looking behind me I made sure that no one was around and slowly twisted the old doorknob. The door protested with a slight squeak as I began to open it. The room was nothing special. It just contained mostly old furniture. With a huge wardrobe at the leftmost end of the room, and the bed that was queen sized with an assortment of pillows. The covers were dyed a faded crimson with what looked like an oversized doily to add a certain touch of antique décor. There were two huge windows adjacent to the bed that were clothed by white opaque curtains that blocked out the majority of sunlight, but still illuminated the room perfectly and added a sense of calming. 

I walked in to the room a little bit where I was to the left of the bed, and simply began to rethink everything that I had ever said or thought about Ms. Hickory. ‘Maybe we were wrong.’ I thought to myself ‘Maybe, Ms. Hickory is just an old woman who is just lonely.’ Suddenly, as I began to make my way out of the room I heard footsteps and in a panic I ran over to the wardrobe and hid inside. But allowed a crack in between the doors to see what was happening. I saw Ms. Hickory in the doorway, and while I could barely see her out of the little crack I saw that she approached the wardrobe and my heart began to beat faster and faster. However, she turned and knelt down beside the bed. I then saw that she pulled out a black chest from underneath her bed. After opening it, I saw what appeared to be a full set of black tinted bottles. However, what drew my attention was the piece of paper that she pulled out of her pocket. Then, gradually checked off what appeared to be names on a list after pointing to each bottle as if it matched the name. After going through the list the old woman quickly took the case out from out under the bed, and quickly hurried out of the room. However, she stopped out in front of the bathroom and knocked on the door. 

“Tyson?” she asked “ Are you okay? You’ve been in the bathroom for a little while.” 

She then motioned to the doorknob and just as I thought that she would find out that I was not in the room I heard my brother’s voice echo throughout the house. 
“Ms. Hickory!!!!!” he exclaimed, “I forgot where do you get the paper towels? I accidently spilled some water!”

 She withdrew her hand from the doorknob and uttered a quick curse. She quickly went away from the room and I heard the dull echoing of each step that she took down the stairs. Knowing that I was safe I quickly exited the room with the utmost quickness, and went in to the bathroom. I breathed a sigh of relief and leaned against the wood of the door. After that experience, and due to the fact that I had explored the last room in her house, I decided that I had enough adventuring for one day. However, I couldn’t help but think about what exactly what that list was and what exactly was in those bottles. ‘Maybe our plan to look threw the garbage will have the answers I want.’  I had a feeling that those bags could possibly be linked to those bottles. 

I had told my brother about the events upstairs and he began to become increasingly nervous about the plan to go dumpster diving to find the answers we, more me than my brother at this point, wanted. However, he still wanted to discover what lied in the garbage. He said that if anyone comes near the two of us at any point we were to run straight back home, and I reluctantly agreed to his terms. After the clock turned five, my brother and I began to get ready for our mother to pick us up from this torment. My mother entered the abode and thanked Ms. Hickory for taking care of us in which the old woman returned the thank you with:

“It was my pleasure. Oh by the way I want you to take some of the left overs that we had from lunch. I already have enough of it to feed a family at thanksgiving.” 


My mother simply chuckled at her retort and kindly accepted the box of leftovers, which contained the stew from our earlier lunch. As we left the house I began to plot out our little night escapade. However, at this point I had already my doubts and concerns about what this little adventure might bring about in the end. However, I didn’t worry too much about the end result, rather the answers that we will receive from what was in those bags. 

After we entered our house, with one of our two cats, Patches, scampering out of the house. We each took our own shower and redressed ourselves in comfortable clothing. My outfit was in the form of a blue jacket, due to the fact that it was going to be cold tonight, and jeans. My brother wore a long sleeve shirt and some of the hand me down blackish baggy pants. My brother and I agreed that once we had dinner we would sneak out our room window at 12 at night. Because, our mother falls asleep around 11, but just to make sure we wanted to wait until we knew for sure that she was asleep. Especially, due to the fact that her room was just down the hall from our own bedroom. With this in mind, we had to make sure she wouldn’t be awakened by out late night antics. 

As we sat at the dinner table, my brother and me simply eyed the pot that our mom was cooking our supper in, and boy did it smell divine! The only thing on our mind, at that point, was food. My mother simply kept stirring the pot, and as she was doing so she asked us how our day went. Gavin told her about how Ms. Hickory was very angry that he had spilled some of the water in the kitchen but, as he said, it was because he didn’t “see” the coffee table. Of course, both my mother and I thought it was hilarious so we both laughed at Gavin’s supposed excuse for being a klutz.  

Once dinner was served, which were the leftovers that Ms. Hickory gave us earlier in the evening.  While we ate the soup, I began asking my mother how her day was and such. She told me that her day was very good, but I could tell that one of her sexist co-workers had said something to her. The way that I saw it was due to the fact that she was slouching, and her eyes looked gloomy with her mascara hastily reapplied to cover up the black streaks around her eyes. So, being the happy one out of the three of us, I told her how Gavin had pronounced washing machine. I got her laugh and smile a little bit, which made me feel better that I can still cheer her up. 


My alarm went off, beside my bed and I hit the snooze button to stop it from continuing its repetitive tone. The time had finally come to find out what exactly those bags held. I, still dressed in what I put on when I got back from Ms. Hickory’s house, woke up Gavin and quickly opened the window. Due to the reason our house was only one story the window only showed our backyard, and the fence that separated our house from the run down factory right across from us. We each got out of the window, bringing our flashlights with us. We then closed the window just enough so there was a crack in the seal so that we could fit our fingers under it in order to get back in the house. With everything set, we nodded in agreement and headed down the street to the neighborhood dumpster. 

The dump was nothing special it was just a large blue container that had two black flap-doors, which served as its opening. The entire container was surrounded by a concrete wall, which helped to keep garbage from flying out. As we neared it, the perfume of garbage intoxicated the air and made Gavin nearly gag. But we had a mission to accomplish so he quickly covered his nose with his shirt and nodded. The top of the container was too tall for either of us to reach so Gavin, who was more athletic out of the two of us, gave me a boost. I grabbed the filthy rim of the container opening. It felt disgusting as if all of the most putrid and unholy elements of nastiness into a single object. I pulled myself into the garbage container, but I lost my grip as I tried to climb over to the other side. Landing on my back on top of a literal pool of filth. I nearly gaged at the smell, and the sheer feeling of the garbage liquid seeping into my jacket felt even more repugnant. I got up and dusted myself off and after pulling out my flashlight I began to dig through the cesspool.

“Tyson,” my brother called out to me suddenly “someone’s coming!” he exclaimed through his whisper. 

Knowing that I couldn’t possibly get out of the container I had only one option. Hide in the garbage, and hope that they don’t discover me. I piled at least two trash bags on top of myself, but I didn’t cover my eyes so that I could see outside. The person turned out to be Ms. Hickory. She peered into the garbage container, and appeared to be oblivious of my presence. ‘What’s she doing here?” I thought. It honestly didn’t make any sense why she was here since she had already thrown away whatever was in that bag. ‘Why did she come back?’ I thought as her head disappeared for a quick instance. She then brought up and set a black case onto the rim of the container. I knew that case…it was the one that contained those bottles. I saw the old woman whip out a piece of paper from her shirt and crumpled it up and threw it into the container and, conveniently, landed near where I was hiding.  After she had thrown the piece of paper in, she then began to take out one bottle that had something written on it. But, it was too dark out to see what exactly it was. She then took off the top of the bottle and dumped out with what looked like a black liquid. The liquid splattered on to my face, and I thanked god that I had covered my mouth with a bit of my jacket. However, the liquid stung my eyes and began to blacken out my vision from the pure intensity of it. She then dropped the bottle down in to the container, which I could hear the shattering of glass near my hiding spot. I still could not see but I then felt something hit me in the stomach. It felt like something slightly heavy but slightly flexible. I then heard Ms. Hickory say. 

“Thank you for all the love that you had to give.” 

I then heard her walk away until all I could hear were the buzzing of the street lamps. I then quickly began to get up out of the garbage and began rubbing my eyes to get rid of the stinging sensation that the liquid had given me. As I got up I then fell over whatever was previously on my stomach. Falling on top of it I began to see slightly, and my god I wished that I hadn’t. There…right in front of me…was a skinned cat. It’s muscles all pinkish-gray, and its eyes were locked on me in what looked like a horrified stare. With panic overwhelming me I kicked the body away and slid to the back of the container. That’s when something stabbed me in the back. I reached back and pulled out whatever was stabbing me, and it was a piece of the bottle. However, now that I could see I could finally make out what the letters bottle. They were L-O-V-E. I threw the piece as soon as I read it because as I looked up I saw that the corpse, that was now upside down, revealed a gaping hole in its chest where its heart would be. That liquid…was blood from that cat. Now that I thought about it I had seen Ms. Hickory add some of this into the soup that she had made days before. I began to scream. But, all that could be heard was a sickening gargling sounds as I tried to scream out to the world at what I had just experienced. But the blood that seeped in to my mouth forbade me from doing so. That cat, in my sudden realization, was my cat, Patches. The reason I knew because as I screamed I tasted the blood…and it was not a bad taste…for the love I had given her.

,firefall,"I'm level 16 on my highest Battleframe, but if I could go back in time to level 1, these are the things I'd tell myself:

*  Your Scan Hammer and Thumper are not consumables!  You can use them repeatedly, unless you actually lose the thumper in combat.

*  You won't get a ""mount"" until level 25.

*  There are automated dropships that tour from major hub to major hub.  You can ""use"" one of these while they're on the ground to climb aboard, and fly a fixed path around the zone.  MUCH faster than any other early-level option.

*  Early level crafting only helps you at early levels.  It doesn't appear to lay the ground work to later crafting, so only has a reward to you if it's immediately useful.  Don't ""grind"" crafting.

*  Find an area with 100% iron?  Thump all day!  Between the huge zergs and fixed xp bonus per finish, Thumping is great xp grinding!

*  If you're assault, use Afterburner to extend your Glider flight time by boosting yourself straight upwards while in transit.

*  The grenade-launcher secondary makes for an amazing backup AoE weapon.

*  Assault is by far the easiest starting class.

*  You get Advanced Battleframes by leveling one to 40.  If you hate leveling Battleframes, get out now, because that's a lot of what this game is.

*  At level 10, you can start picking ""Perks"".  The initial selection is limited, but unless specified otherwise, Perks you unlock while leveling battleframes remain available on other battleframes in the future!  Grinding new frames to 40 is how you diversify your perk options.

*  Craft Health Packs and Ammo Packs.

*  THERE IS AN AUTORUN KEYBIND.  It will save your sanity.

*  Your starting Thumper can only mine Iron and Dirt.  Ignore those fancy green deposits at first, you can't use them.

*  Be careful about freefalling.  You can survive a drop from any height on spurts of gas if you just hold down jump the whole drop, but if you freefall 70% of the way and then burn your entire jump jets dry, you still probably won't slow down enough to survive the landing.

*  Item Power is a collective value that increases your DPS, and is found on every mod and item of equipment you can equip.  Shove ANY mods in your weapons/gear if nothing appropriate is available, it'll all boost your dps just by being there.

*  I bought 40 Red Beans and posted them on the marketplace for 100 credits each, in stacks of 10, which is the minimum possible price.  They haven't sold in 80 hours.  Market appears to be ludicrously saturated with Red Beans.


THINGS I STILL WANT TO KNOW: (Thanks to /u/0rinx and /u/tangman for these answers)

*  How do I tell if a random world event/Ares Mission/Crashed Thumper is being done already, or if it's up for grabs?

You can't, beyond what the map shows.

*  How is XP shared if I show up and help random strangers with their own world events?

Little to none for personal thumpers, and a varying amount based on contribution for world events.

*  What do I do with all these research points?

Not much.

*  Is there any other ways to get advanced battleframes faster?

Buy with real currency, get lucky with Gold Tokens at the slots, convert daily Crystite into Credits and buy on the Market.

*  How do they get the caramel inside the caramilk bar?

WHAT ARE YOURS?!

/u/0rinx

*  The fastest possible way to level up is doing the ares missions that spawn on your map, if you are working on lvling up you should have a job board mission active but if you see a ares mission on your mini pap stop what you are doing and do that instead (you can get some insane xp rates when you reach lvl 32 with missions that give 100k for 5 mis of work).  ^(^^The ^^practical ^^use ^^of ^^thumping ^^is ^^not ^^to ^^get ^^the ^^ore ^^under ^^ground ^^but ^^to ^^farm ^^the ^^mobs ^^it ^^spawns ^^for ^^drops, ^^you ^^will ^^get ^^items ^^so ^^much ^^faster ^^from ^^the ^^drops ^^then ^^you ^^will ^^be ^^able ^^to ^^craft ^^them.)

/u/moozaad

*  Use the Bronze tokens you get for completing early game quests at the slot machines in town.  They can give various quality-of-life items and crystite.

/u/Kashima gets their own mini section.

*  Chipping in some tips / typical questions:

*  If you're in a squad with a friend, but cannot see him, use /joinleader. This lets you join his instance.

*  If you have a bug, like missions objectives not loading or market/interface-related, use /rui (reloadui). This solves lots of ""small"" bugs without relogging.

*  If you're stuck, use /stuck. This will make you suicide, after a short time.
There are several addons for this game, which will make the game much more accessible. The two most important addons, imho: Boing! (changing server/instances) and Calldown Hotkeys (binding hotkeys for different items on the 5th hotbar slot)

*  To install addons you can either use the tools Curse, Melder or manually by just putting the mod-folder into ""My Documents\Firefall\Addons"" (for steam at least).

*  You can use unlocks (like cosmetics and recipes) and other items, by putting them on the hotbar.
In a group, you need to use a Squad thumper, so every group member gets each a 100% share on the gain. 

*  Using a personal thumper in a group, means to divide the reward into small shares.
Random people who kills your thumping mobs gets a resource share (for high participation) that is extra generated. You're not losing your own gain to them.

*  To find the best thumping spot in your area, look for ""waves"" after using the scan hammer. Those waves flow towards the center of that particular resource vein. Follow it.
Resource veins move / are different for different server. So there is no permanent ideal pin-pointed spot.

*  If you cannot get your zone-chat working at all (not server load related), try switching to the next map (southwest, Sertao) and back. Weird solution, but it was the only thing that helped me after i had no functional zone-chat for two days.

*  You can check if your zone-chat is actually working, by switching to local with /l and back to zone with /z.

*  You can port to any SIN-Tower via map, but it cost 50-60 credits.

*  You can see your vouchers, when you mouse hover the credits display in your inventory. Vouchers are special ""credits"", gained from missions and can be used on voucher merchants (each town has their own one) to buy weapons and such.

*  You can abort missions back at a mission board.


/u/Scrumpers 

*  One of my favorite tips is to try to keep make sure to replace your Battleframe core every 5 levels or so. This effects health a lot more than it leads you to believe. I went almost 20 levels on my firecat before realizing I could have had almost 15k extra health!

/u/Brotherauron 

*  Add ons are supported by this game, get an app called boing so if your instance runs dry with missions, you can use boing to switch to another shard.

/u/Calleddin

*  You can actually tell if a world event/mission/thumper/LGV has people at it or not by the little white person showing up on the circle around the mission. That doesn't tell you whether you can get there in time to be a part of it, but it does let you know if someone is working on it already or not so if it's far away, probably not worth trekking to.

,leagueoflegends,"So I had an idea last night that I was afraid to post because I thought it could turn out to be really big. But I realized that I didn't have the experience to make it as amazing as I imagined it so I humbly turn this over to riot.

My idea is this: Have collectible trading cards for players and teams. There would be new editions each split to update player and team stats/picks etc. This way, if a player was playing out of his mind for a split, that card would be much more valuable (and possibly more rare if you want to do it that way). These cards would be digital most likely.

Each card could have

* Player's name and current team
* Player's top 3 champion picks
* Stats like KDA, GPM, Total kills/assists/deaths, whatever else you would like.
* A short description of the player's strengths and weaknesses during the split (for example: Large champion pool, insane mechanics, poor decision making, great team fight positioning etc
* An edition number stating the season/split this card is from.
* A chance to be foil.

Pros for Riot + Players:

* Players could get much more exposure and hype around them, which is always good for Riot.
* If Riot wanted to monetize this they could create a section of their site for selling booster packs ($4 - $5 for 7 cards or something)
* Encourage more fans to come to Riot sponsored events (if Riot were to give away booster pack codes there).

Possible Cons

* Players may be unfairly treated for their stats, which happens far too often anyways.

How it would function:

Riot would have a section of their site as a hub for these trading cards. You would log in to your league of legends account and you could see things like, inventory, start trade, list card, buy booster pack, etc. Initially riot could give all existing accounts 1 booster pack to encourage players to start collecting. As well as giving out codes for booster packs at LCS events. They would allow you to buy booster packs with RP (and hopefully a large amount of IP) as well. You could either trade these cards with other players, or list them on a marketplace where they could be bought for RP (This may be dicey, I would rather have a ""trade listing"" where you could list the cards you currently want to trade, then players could contact you and decide on a fair trade). 

Riot could also implement a system where players who were consistently well-mannered would receive a booster pack at the end of each month. This would make the honor system possibly used more often (obviously they would monitor it similar to before so no ""honor trading"" was happening). 

Let me know what you guys think, ideas for additional stats on cards, improvements to the system, more cons I'm missing, etc etc. Thanks!",,False,,0,,Riot I have an idea for you: Collectible Player Trading Cards,,,,,,0.0,,,False,t3_2cn23a,False,,,,,0.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},,,0,,,,self,False,team 01,,,,,True,,1407201148.0,,,,,,self.leagueoflegends,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,t5_2rfxx,,,,,2cn23a,,,IAmBrowse,,1,,,,,,,/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2cn23a/riot_i_have_an_idea_for_you_collectible_player/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2cn23a/riot_i_have_an_idea_for_you_collectible_player/,,1407197548.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441235265.0,,,

**Top 5 Players of the Year**
____

5) **BRIAN LITTLE** - CENTER - Undersized frame, big heart

Stat | Current Season | Previous Season | Career High
---------|----------|----------|----------
Points | 64 | 32 | 64 |
Goals | 23 | 7 | 31 |
Assists | 41 | 25 | 41
+/- | 8 | 8 | 11
PIM | 58 | 4 | 58
Games | 82 | 48 | 82

Little busted his ass and played a full season of quality hockey, ranking 15th in the league in scoring for centers.  He played many minutes of even strength action on the 1st line and found himself on the 1st powerplay and penalty kill units. He didn’t score during a stretch of 11 games under Noel but ended up finding his groove again under Maurice. He doesn’t win many faceoffs with his size but his percentage could jump up next season. Little is good for 20 minutes of spirited hockey a game and provides a much appreciated scoring punch to the Jets.

4) **DUSTIN BYFUGLIEN** - RIGHT WING - The X-Factor

Stat | Current Season | Previous Season | Career High
---------|----------|----------|----------
Points | 56 | 28 | 56 |
Goals | 20 | 8 | 20 |
Assists | 36 | 20 | 41
+/- | -20 | -1 | 7
PIM | 86 | 34 | 94
Games | 78 | 43 | 82

Big Buff started the season on the Jets 1st D pairing with Enstrom but was moved by Noel to RW in January to help find ways to win and Maurice decided to continue this development moving forward. Byfuglien logged heavy minutes on D so he saw his time on ice shrink as a forward playing on the 3rd line. He plays on the point for powerplay situations and racked up 26 points on the odd man advantage. He generated 256 shots, which ranks him 16th overall in the league. Big Buff is an immoveable object and has great puck possession down low. He has deceptively soft hands for a man of his size. When he’s given space to operate in 4 on 4  or extra man situations, he can be an absolute game changer.

3) **ANDREW LADD** - LEFT WING - That's my captain!

Stat | Current Season | Previous Season | Career High
---------|----------|----------|----------
Points | 54 | 46 | 59 |
Goals | 23 | 18 | 29 |
Assists | 31 | 28 | 34
+/- | 8 | 10 | 26
PIM | 57 | 22 | 67
Games | 78 | 48 | 82

Ladd would have played another 82 game campaign but decided to spend time with his family after the birth of his daughter in late March. Nobody can question Ladd’s heart. He’s a [gritty, 2-way LW]( http://www.rivercitysportsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Andrew-Ladd-1.jpg) and leads by example. Although his scoring pace dipped a bit from the lockout season, he’s still a very valuable piece to the Jets’ offense. Has also has a knack for scoring in the shootout. 

2) **JACOB TROUBA** - DEFENSEMAN - Only 20 years old?!

Trouba missed 17 games due to a [neck injury]( http://youtu.be/pyty0IavHXU) but he still managed to finish the season with some impressive stats for a rookie. Playing slongside an offensive blackhole in Stuart for most of the season, he was able to record 29 points. He logged minutes against quality competition and played about 25 minutes on a good night. He was 3rd in scoring among rookie defenders, placing him 52nd overall in the NHL for point production among D-men.  Trouba was asked to play the 2nd toughest zone starts for Jets and was deployed on the first penalty kill unit on a regular basis. He’s a solid skater with a physical edge and a nice shot but he has to work on his accuracy. If Trouba stays healthy for a full season and progresses properly, he will be a key contributor for the Jets next season. 

1) **BLAKE WHEELER** - RIGHT WING - Leading scorer!

Stat | Current Season | Previous Season | Career High
---------|----------|----------|----------
Points | 69 | 41 | 69 |
Goals | 28 | 19 | 28 |
Assists | 41 | 22 | 47
+/- | 4 | -3 | 36
PIM | 63 | 28 | 63
Games | 82 | 48 | 82

Wheeler reached career highs in scoring by leading the Jets in goals and tying Little for most assists. He has silly speed down the wing and can burn defenders while keeping control of the puck and trying to crash the net. Sometimes he’s hesitant to pull the trigger and might make an extra pass but sometimes his patience pays off.  Will need to work on playing a full season of consistent hockey (he didn’t score for 14 consecutive games last November under Noel’s coaching) but all signs are pointing towards Wheeler being an offensively gifted player with some room to grow. Also appears to be a durable forward and can play some shorthanded shifts.

**Why the Winnipeg Jets will win the cup in 2015**
____
Keeping in mind that GM Kevin Chevaldeyoff has yet to make a player for player trade, let’s skip fantasy blockbuster trades and assume that we’ll be starting the season with our current roster. Maybe we trade a player like Kane for a decent return, maybe we hold onto him moving forward. For now, let’s drop acid, look on the bright side and get down to business. 

Yes, the Winnipeg Jets need significant improvements across the board to secure a spot in the post-season but we’re dealing with a ton of untapped potential within this squad. For starters, Paul Maurice will be head coach for training camp and will look to build upon his team’s play from 2013-14. If the Jets are to bring the Cup to Winnipeg next year, Maurice will have to master his craft and keep his players on board for the longest season in franchise history. He will have to respond to his players, juggle lines according to injuries/matchups, ensure that his players continue to buy into his systems and bring out the best of his bench. 

Last years rookies are going to look to build upon their early successes and avoid sophomore slumps. Scheifele will have to return from his season ending injury to his MCL and play better than ever before. For the Jets to win it all, Scheifs will need to skate circles around top notch competition and play a solid 2-way game, maybe on the 1st line alongside Kane and Wheeler. Trouba would have to protect his neck and [stay on track](http://i.imgur.com/iscWBpT.jpg) to becoming a future franchise D-man. 

Evander cannot afford to get injured on this quest for the Cup. If he’s healthy, he’s good for 30+ goals in 82 games and will bring a physical game to the table. Championship Kane will be coming into training camp with a chip on his shoulder and will be motivated to prove his doubters wrong. Wheeler will have to solidify himself as a one of the best wingers in the league and round out what could be a very pesky 1st line with his extreme speed and scoring touch.

Ladd plays like a man possessed for 82 games of the regular season and leads the Jets to the playoffs with timely game winners and elite numbers in the shootout. Little keeps up his chemistry with captain Laddy and provides a boost to secondary scoring by lighting the lamp on a more consistent basis. Frolik continues to kill penalties at a high clip and sees some minutes on the 2nd line due to his versatility and skill. Big Buff shows up to training camp in shape and ready to rumble, mostly seeing 3rd line minutes as a forward and top pairing minutes on the powerplay as a D-man. In addition, Byfuglien would play like a superstar in 4-on-4 situations. Perrault gels immediately with the rest of the roster and fills Jokinen’s vacated 3C slot with ease by winning a majority of his faceoffs, taking less penalties and contributing points at a steady rate. 

The rest of the bottom 6 will have to push the envelope and find new inventive ways to help win games. Galiardi will have to continue his trend of drawing penalties at a high rate in order to put the Jets on the powerplay. Halishuk would be deployed to hustle for loose pucks. Peluso would have to fight for every minute of ice time. Thorburn’s nose would cause havoc in the crease. Slater would be leaned on heavily for defensive zone draws. O’Dell could be called up from the IceCaps as a center and use his takeaway skills to create opportunities. Tangradi would be told to plant himself in the slot and set screens on goalies in order to generate rebounds and scoring chances.

Enstrom would have to use his size to his advantage by playing positionally sound and raise his rep to that of a premier puck mover. Bogosian needs to play a full season and live up to his projected potential of a 3rd overall pick in 2008 and fat 7yr contract. Clitsome’s back needs to heal so he can step into the lineup sometimes to relieve a banged up teammate. Pardy would play like a bully on the bottom pairing by bashing his opposition in the corners and making them pay tax in the slot. Ellerby would likely find himself on that 3rd line, playing on edge and leaving opponents with little room to operate in the offensive zone.  Stuart plays stellar shutdown D and relieves pressure off the goalies by winning many battles and stifling offenses.

Pavelec plays ~60 games and proves to be the real deal against tough teams or he [shits the bed](http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/imported_assets/2137687/847225202.gif) while Hutchinson follows up his success in the AHL last season by impressing the coaching staff early on and sparking a battle for the starting gig in net. Both goalies elevate their games and they make for a formidable tandem in net during the regular season.

Once the playoffs roll around, this team will need to be firing on all cylinders in order to reach the finals and win the Stanley Cup. The Jets sneak into a 7th or 8th seed in the western conference and capture the hearts of those that love underdogs. The Jets internalize the passion of the fans and this fuels a hard fought deep run for the finals. Elsewhere, the Central division arms race backfires and blows up in the faces of GMs as their new acquisitions struggle to produce during the playoffs. Winnipeg wins their 1st playoff game at the MTS Center and the whiteout proves to be an intimidating atmosphere. The Jets suffer losses here and there but take them on the chin and work hard to regain momentum. Maurice opts to move forward with a definitive #1 starting goalie after the quarterfinals and Winnipeg keeps shocking the hockey world until they win it all. Ladd takes the Cup from Bettman and gives it to Hutchinson, your 2014-15 finals MVP. [Winnipig](http://i.imgur.com/sgolSKB.jpg) is released onto the ice and celebrates with the team. The Jets have won the Stanley Cup.

**Why the Winnipeg Jets won't win the Stanley Cup in 2015**
____

The Jets are simply outgunned in the western conference. Chevy goes into the regular season with mostly the same squad as last year and the losses start adding up fast once players collectively fail to live up to expectations. The Jets youth sputter out of the gate and are all plagued by injuries. Evander punches another helmet and requests a trade while Thorburn moves up to the 2nd line. Trouba kisses the boards once more at the MTS Centre and Chevy starts working the waiver wire for depth. Scheifele’s season ends early due to another knee on knee and the Jets start looking towards the IceCaps for help. With O’Dell already filling in for the often injured Slater, the Jets are forced to promote him to 3rd line duties in order to free up a spot for Cormier to serve on the 4th. First game with the big club, Cormier cheapshots someone and gets suspended indefinitely. As an act of desperation, the Jets front office takes Jaffray from the IceCaps and places him into the lineup for his leadership skills. The 4C position eventually gets plugged with Lowry, stunting his development. With Scheifele out, Perrault is promoted to the top 6 and plays poorly alongside an obese Big Buff and Thorburn. To shake things up, Big Buff is brought back to defense and Enstrom is converted to a winger. Big Buff’s +/- takes a nosedive while Enstrom shows lots of promise at his new position, until he’s reported out indefinitely with a broken collar bone caused by a routine hit in the corner. Maurice loses the locker room by January, causing Chevaldeyoff to ask Noel to serve as coach in the interim. Ladd strips himself of the captaincy and sarcastically awards it to Jaffray. Peluso throws once punch the entire season, shattering the bones in his fist on the ice. Galiardi plays like a fringe NHLer and finds himself as a healthy scratch by halfway through the season. Tangradi does nothing to earn himself a contract and plays 82 games as punishment. Halishuk’s poor play makes the Jet brass wonder why they signed him to another contract after letting him walk as an UFA. Frolik tries his hardest in order to impress other GMs around the league, reminding himself daily that he’s a champion. Noel reverts back to the days of Ladd-Little-Wheeler but there is no longer any lingering line chemistry. Stuart goes to battle for the entire season, seemingly unaware of his troubled teammates. Bogosian’s stats regress and his contract becomes one of the most bloated in the league. Pardy chews out Claude in practice and gets buried in the minors the next day. Clitsome’s back is nearly broken but Noel is forced to play him on the 2nd D pairing out of necessity for most of the season because none of Chevy's waiver wire pickups want to come to Winnipeg.  Ellerby gets into an argument during the intermission of a game in the locker room with assistant coach Charlie Huddy and both of them start duking it out at center ice in front of 15k horrified fans at the MTS Centre. Huddy wins the fight and Claude rewards him with a spot on the roster and some time on the powerplay. The Jets stand pat at the trade deadline or trade away assets in a fire sale. After the dust has settled, Pavelec stays healthy and starts 75 games because Hutchinson isn’t ready for the NHL. However, Pav’s stats indicate that he is once again the worst starting goalie in the league. The Central does indeed turn out to be stacked and the Jets finish dead last in their division for another season.

**Top 5 Players of the Year**
____

5) **BRIAN LITTLE** - CENTER - Undersized frame, big heart

Stat | Current Season | Previous Season | Career High
---------|----------|----------|----------
Points | 64 | 32 | 64 |
Goals | 23 | 7 | 31 |
Assists | 41 | 25 | 41
+/- | 8 | 8 | 11
PIM | 58 | 4 | 58
Games | 82 | 48 | 82

Little busted his ass and played a full season of quality hockey, ranking 15th in the league in scoring for centers.  He played many minutes of even strength action on the 1st line and found himself on the 1st powerplay and penalty kill units. He didn’t score during a stretch of 11 games under Noel but ended up finding his groove again under Maurice. He doesn’t win many faceoffs with his size but his percentage could jump up next season. Little is good for 20 minutes of spirited hockey a game and provides a much appreciated scoring punch to the Jets.

4) **DUSTIN BYFUGLIEN** - RIGHT WING - The X-Factor

Stat | Current Season | Previous Season | Career High
---------|----------|----------|----------
Points | 56 | 28 | 56 |
Goals | 20 | 8 | 20 |
Assists | 36 | 20 | 41
+/- | -20 | -1 | 7
PIM | 86 | 34 | 94
Games | 78 | 43 | 82

Big Buff started the season on the Jets 1st D pairing with Enstrom but was moved by Noel to RW in January to help find ways to win and Maurice decided to continue this development moving forward. Byfuglien logged heavy minutes on D so he saw his time on ice shrink as a forward playing on the 3rd line. He plays on the point for powerplay situations and racked up 26 points on the odd man advantage. He generated 256 shots, which ranks him 16th overall in the league. Big Buff is an immoveable object and has great puck possession down low. He has deceptively soft hands for a man of his size. When he’s given space to operate in 4 on 4  or extra man situations, he can be an absolute game changer.

3) **ANDREW LADD** - LEFT WING - That's my captain!

Stat | Current Season | Previous Season | Career High
---------|----------|----------|----------
Points | 54 | 46 | 59 |
Goals | 23 | 18 | 29 |
Assists | 31 | 28 | 34
+/- | 8 | 10 | 26
PIM | 57 | 22 | 67
Games | 78 | 48 | 82

Ladd would have played another 82 game campaign but decided to spend time with his family after the birth of his daughter in late March. Nobody can question Ladd’s heart. He’s a [gritty, 2-way LW]( http://www.rivercitysportsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Andrew-Ladd-1.jpg) and leads by example. Although his scoring pace dipped a bit from the lockout season, he’s still a very valuable piece to the Jets’ offense. Has also has a knack for scoring in the shootout. 

2) **JACOB TROUBA** - DEFENSEMAN - Only 20 years old?!

Trouba missed 17 games due to a [neck injury]( http://youtu.be/pyty0IavHXU) but he still managed to finish the season with some impressive stats for a rookie. Playing slongside an offensive blackhole in Stuart for most of the season, he was able to record 29 points. He logged minutes against quality competition and played about 25 minutes on a good night. He was 3rd in scoring among rookie defenders, placing him 52nd overall in the NHL for point production among D-men.  Trouba was asked to play the 2nd toughest zone starts for Jets and was deployed on the first penalty kill unit on a regular basis. He’s a solid skater with a physical edge and a nice shot but he has to work on his accuracy. If Trouba stays healthy for a full season and progresses properly, he will be a key contributor for the Jets next season. 

1) **BLAKE WHEELER** - RIGHT WING - Leading scorer!

Stat | Current Season | Previous Season | Career High
---------|----------|----------|----------
Points | 69 | 41 | 69 |
Goals | 28 | 19 | 28 |
Assists | 41 | 22 | 47
+/- | 4 | -3 | 36
PIM | 63 | 28 | 63
Games | 82 | 48 | 82

Wheeler reached career highs in scoring by leading the Jets in goals and tying Little for most assists. He has silly speed down the wing and can burn defenders while keeping control of the puck and trying to crash the net. Sometimes he’s hesitant to pull the trigger and might make an extra pass but sometimes his patience pays off.  Will need to work on playing a full season of consistent hockey (he didn’t score for 14 consecutive games last November under Noel’s coaching) but all signs are pointing towards Wheeler being an offensively gifted player with some room to grow. Also appears to be a durable forward and can play some shorthanded shifts.

**Why the Winnipeg Jets will win the cup in 2015**
____
Keeping in mind that GM Kevin Chevaldeyoff has yet to make a player for player trade, let’s skip fantasy blockbuster trades and assume that we’ll be starting the season with our current roster. Maybe we trade a player like Kane for a decent return, maybe we hold onto him moving forward. For now, let’s drop acid, look on the bright side and get down to business. 

Yes, the Winnipeg Jets need significant improvements across the board to secure a spot in the post-season but we’re dealing with a ton of untapped potential within this squad. For starters, Paul Maurice will be head coach for training camp and will look to build upon his team’s play from 2013-14. If the Jets are to bring the Cup to Winnipeg next year, Maurice will have to master his craft and keep his players on board for the longest season in franchise history. He will have to respond to his players, juggle lines according to injuries/matchups, ensure that his players continue to buy into his systems and bring out the best of his bench. 

Last years rookies are going to look to build upon their early successes and avoid sophomore slumps. Scheifele will have to return from his season ending injury to his MCL and play better than ever before. For the Jets to win it all, Scheifs will need to skate circles around top notch competition and play a solid 2-way game, maybe on the 1st line alongside Kane and Wheeler. Trouba would have to protect his neck and [stay on track](http://i.imgur.com/iscWBpT.jpg) to becoming a future franchise D-man. 

Evander cannot afford to get injured on this quest for the Cup. If he’s healthy, he’s good for 30+ goals in 82 games and will bring a physical game to the table. Championship Kane will be coming into training camp with a chip on his shoulder and will be motivated to prove his doubters wrong. Wheeler will have to solidify himself as a one of the best wingers in the league and round out what could be a very pesky 1st line with his extreme speed and scoring touch.

Ladd plays like a man possessed for 82 games of the regular season and leads the Jets to the playoffs with timely game winners and elite numbers in the shootout. Little keeps up his chemistry with captain Laddy and provides a boost to secondary scoring by lighting the lamp on a more consistent basis. Frolik continues to kill penalties at a high clip and sees some minutes on the 2nd line due to his versatility and skill. Big Buff shows up to training camp in shape and ready to rumble, mostly seeing 3rd line minutes as a forward and top pairing minutes on the powerplay as a D-man. In addition, Byfuglien would play like a superstar in 4-on-4 situations. Perrault gels immediately with the rest of the roster and fills Jokinen’s vacated 3C slot with ease by winning a majority of his faceoffs, taking less penalties and contributing points at a steady rate. 

The rest of the bottom 6 will have to push the envelope and find new inventive ways to help win games. Galiardi will have to continue his trend of drawing penalties at a high rate in order to put the Jets on the powerplay. Halishuk would be deployed to hustle for loose pucks. Peluso would have to fight for every minute of ice time. Thorburn’s nose would cause havoc in the crease. Slater would be leaned on heavily for defensive zone draws. O’Dell could be called up from the IceCaps as a center and use his takeaway skills to create opportunities. Tangradi would be told to plant himself in the slot and set screens on goalies in order to generate rebounds and scoring chances.

Enstrom would have to use his size to his advantage by playing positionally sound and raise his rep to that of a premier puck mover. Bogosian needs to play a full season and live up to his projected potential of a 3rd overall pick in 2008 and fat 7yr contract. Clitsome’s back needs to heal so he can step into the lineup sometimes to relieve a banged up teammate. Pardy would play like a bully on the bottom pairing by bashing his opposition in the corners and making them pay tax in the slot. Ellerby would likely find himself on that 3rd line, playing on edge and leaving opponents with little room to operate in the offensive zone.  Stuart plays stellar shutdown D and relieves pressure off the goalies by winning many battles and stifling offenses.

Pavelec plays ~60 games and proves to be the real deal against tough teams or he shits the bed while Hutchinson follows up his success in the AHL last season by impressing the coaching staff early on and sparking a battle for the starting gig in net. Both goalies elevate their games and they make for a formidable tandem in net during the regular season.

Once the playoffs roll around, this team will need to be firing on all cylinders in order to reach the finals and win the Stanley Cup. The Jets sneak into a 7th or 8th seed in the western conference and capture the hearts of those that love underdogs. The Jets internalize the passion of the fans and this fuels a hard fought deep run for the finals. Elsewhere, the Central division arms race backfires and blows up in the faces of GMs as their new acquisitions struggle to produce during the playoffs. Winnipeg wins their 1st playoff game at the MTS Center and the whiteout proves to be an intimidating atmosphere. The Jets suffer losses here and there but take them on the chin and work hard to regain momentum. Maurice opts to move forward with a definitive #1 starting goalie after the quarterfinals and Winnipeg keeps shocking the hockey world until they win it all. Ladd takes the Cup from Bettman and gives it to Hutchinson, your 2014-15 finals MVP. [Winnipig](http://i.imgur.com/sgolSKB.jpg) is released onto the ice and celebrates with the team. The Jets have won the Stanley Cup.

**Why the Winnipeg Jets won't win the Stanley Cup in 2015**
____

The Jets are simply outgunned in the western conference. Chevy goes into the regular season with mostly the same squad as last year and the losses start adding up fast once players collectively fail to live up to expectations. The Jets youth sputter out of the gate and are all plagued by injuries. Evander punches another helmet and requests a trade while Thorburn moves up to the 2nd line. Trouba kisses the boards once more at the MTS Centre and Chevy starts working the waiver wire for depth. Scheifele’s season ends early due to another knee on knee and the Jets start looking towards the IceCaps for help. With O’Dell already filling in for the often injured Slater, the Jets are forced to promote him to 3rd line duties in order to free up a spot for Cormier to serve on the 4th. First game with the big club, Cormier cheapshots someone and gets suspended indefinitely. As an act of desperation, the Jets front office takes Jaffray from the IceCaps and places him into the lineup for his leadership skills. The 4C position eventually gets plugged with Lowry, stunting his development. With Scheifele out, Perrault is promoted to the top 6 and plays poorly alongside an obese Big Buff and Thorburn. To shake things up, Big Buff is brought back to defense and Enstrom is converted to a winger. Big Buff’s +/- takes a nosedive while Enstrom shows lots of promise at his new position, until he’s reported out indefinitely with a broken collar bone caused by a routine hit in the corner. Maurice loses the locker room by January, causing Chevaldeyoff to ask Noel to serve as coach in the interim. Ladd strips himself of the captaincy and sarcastically awards it to Jaffray.

Peluso throws once punch the entire season, shattering the bones in his fist on the ice. Galiardi plays like a fringe NHLer and finds himself as a healthy scratch by halfway through the season. Tangradi does nothing to earn himself a contract and plays 82 games as punishment. Halishuk’s poor play makes the Jet brass wonder why they signed him to another contract after letting him walk as an UFA. Frolik tries his hardest in order to impress other GMs around the league, reminding himself daily that he’s a champion. Noel reverts back to the days of Ladd-Little-Wheeler but there is no longer any lingering line chemistry. Stuart goes to battle for the entire season, seemingly unaware of his troubled teammates. Bogosian’s stats regress and his contract becomes one of the most bloated in the league. Pardy chews out Claude in practice and gets buried in the minors the next day. Clitsome’s back is nearly broken but Noel is forced to play him on the 2nd D pairing out of necessity for most of the season because none of Chevy's waiver wire pickups want to come to Winnipeg.  Ellerby gets into an argument during the intermission of a game in the locker room with assistant coach Charlie Huddy and both of them start duking it out at center ice in front of 15k horrified fans at the MTS Centre. Huddy wins the fight and Claude rewards him with a spot on the roster and some time on the powerplay. The Jets stand pat at the trade deadline or trade away assets in a fire sale. After the dust has settled, Pavelec stays healthy and starts 75 games because Hutchinson isn’t ready for the NHL. However, Pav’s stats indicate that he is once again the worst starting goalie in the league. The Central does indeed turn out to be stacked and the Jets finish dead last in their division for another season.

,dungeondefenders,"After scouring online for some sort of ""DDE beginner's guide"", I could find very little in the way of some basic things about the game. Hopefully this helps some other people out.

- Crafting is upstairs in the tavern with mushroom looking guy. He's how you apply dyes and use/sell your blueprints

- The minimap displays dropped items: grey dot = worse than current gear, green dot = better than current gear,  yellow dot = consumable, orange dot = dyes and loot orbs.

- In the options menu under equipment, there's a category called 'Compare Preference'. You can set this to either 'Tower Stats' if you want the game to determine if gear is better based SOLELY off towers stats, or 'Hero Stats' if you want to game to determine if gear is better for DPS/Survival.

- If you're having a hard time finding green-dot items that've dropped, look for two green arrows pointing towards each other on the HUD. You should be able to see this through walls and enemies.

- Any item you don't pick up during a normal (non-surival) wave gets turned to gold when the next wave spawns. Nothing is auto-picked  up.

- There's only so many drops (items AND gold) that can be on the ground in a localized area at a time. If you don't actually run around and collect drops that you see on your minimap, they'll disappear eventually. It's recommended you try and find a ""safe-ish"" route to run to collect the gold that drops off enemies to leave more room for item drops.

- Before the first wave when mana is scarce from only chests, if someone on the team can build stronger towers than you, utilize the 'M' key to drop your mana for them to use.

- All pets have an active ability that's hotkeyed to 'X'. *Most* cost no mana and just have a short CD. [Thanks to /u/Apefather]

- Pets level up off XP earned from enemies, and not gold. [thanks to /u/Robert_Grave]

- All your consumable/trinket slots have individual cooldowns, so you can have the same ability/item in multiple slots, and can use each one independently (this is especially useful for Instant Tower Repair amulets)

- When you're ready for a wave to start, instead of waiting for the timer to countdown or hitting 'E' at an eternia crystal, you can hit the 'G' to ready yourself for the wave.

- If every piece of armor worn is of the same type (plate, chain, great hero, etc), you get a set bonus of % boost to all stats. [thanks to /u/TheMagnificentJoe]

- If using the Radial menu 'R', you can drag and drop skills into your action bar [thanks to /u/_tunix_]

- When leveling up, you can use shift+click to assign 5 points at a time, and ctrl+click to assign 100 points at a time. This is especially useful if you use a respec potion. [thanks to /u/Robert_Grave]

,ShotBow,"Here are some ideas of classes I've come up with. Enjoy!


* **SwordMage**.



The swordmage gets to hover in the air about 4 blocks up(for better vision) and can throw fireballs. spawns with 3 fireballs and one grenade. Every 10 levels he collects, he gets another 5 fireballs and a grenade. 


* **ShieldMage**.


The ShieldMage can throw up shields. Duh. Shields are small walls of glass panes which, while they *are* breakable, it halves your health to bust through. Nobody can walk through them, and arrows cannot break through either. the attacks of the SwordMage bounce back and hit HIM. (I also had the idea that maybe a certain potion, nightvision for example, could be used as a counter to this to walk through without harm. A good way to prevent abuse in small corridors.) Shields last 12 seconds, and there's a 30 second cooldown between uses. Two ShieldMages near each other cannot work together as a team to create perpetual shields because the cooldown applies to all nearby shieldmages as well, regardless of team. Shieldmages have the opportunity to make their shields last an extra 20 seconds if they wish, but they die instantly afterwards and for the rest of the game they have 2 less hearts. Can only be done once.



* **EnhancedMage**.


EnhancedMages can give boosts to other players. Speed, Strength, and a really good Jump Boost. This makes them good team players, but when they give a boost to someone else, the OPPOSITE happens to them. so for example, if they give a friend a strength boost, they get weakness. If they hand out Speed to a group of rushers, they take Slowness. Also they take damage if the people they boosted die.



I tried to keep these balanced, and I hope they're considered for use.

,nosleep,"				
				
Why hello, friend! My name is Tyson.  I’m assuming that the reason that you are here is for the story that I have to tell, and might I say, I will tell it well! My childhood was a particularly intriguing one when I begin to think back upon all those years gone by. It would be interesting to know where I came from and how I started out from my childhood into what I have become as an adult. In fact when I think about it more and more I don’t know exactly why I ended up this way, as in my eyes it was a perfect childhood! But I digress. Allow me to begin, starting with the earliest memory that I have to offer you. 

My first memory would be that of my boy hood in the summer of 1995. When I was only 5 years old my mother, my brother, and I had recently moved in to a new home apartment. Which, now that I think about it, looked more like one of those haunted houses you see in old horror movies. However, this story is not of that genre, my friend. So do not delude yourself into thinking that it will, as it is not. My mother worked a full time job at a local college and my brother and me would usually be baby-sat by one of our neighbors when she was off at work. We used to hate this particular woman, whom we called Miss. Hickory, due to her old age and her strict demeanor – like a stereotypical librarian who would shush any person who was trying to speak in the library. She would always sit on her back porch in a rocking chair and stare out towards our house, due to the fact that we lived across the street from her. This served the duel purpose of also allowing her to watch for anyone getting near her vegetable garden, especially my brother and I – every time me and my brother would be playing outside, she would scowl at us for getting too close to her vegetable garden. She was damn convincing, because every time we got near it she would yell and scream at us not to or “else,” and, almost immediately, we would turn tail and run back home. I’ll tell ya when you're five years old and you hear those words you really begin to think what she will do to you. I mean me and my brother would constantly try to come up with what she might do to use if we ever got near her garden, but despite this,  we did heed her warning and did stay away from it. 
	
Despite that woman’s constant nagging at my brother and I, we began to explore more and more of her house and progressively got braver and braver with each visit. Especially since all we did at her house was either read or just take naps in her living room. Her house wasn’t very large and by my guess I would say it would have been at least a two story with around five to six rooms in it, with the largest room being the living room. The living room was full of decorative cuckoo clocks, some bird nests, some old furniture that included a stretch sofa that began from the center of the room to the left most-window...oh, and speaking of windows in the room, she had two large windows in the living room which one was behind the couch and the other one was seated to the right of the couch which… oh – darn I forgot what this particular window gave view of. My apologies, please, allow me to continue. The room contained a medium-size TV that was at the center of the room, which, despite having a TV, this woman would not allow us to watch in her house., this was only one of the many reasons why I felt hatred towards her. However, both my brother and I had the curiosity of just what this particular woman held in the remainder of her little abode, so we began to come to the decision that we were going to investigate just what our dear old neighbor had in those 5 remaining rooms. 
	
I think that it was after the third day of being baby sat by Ms. Hickory that we began our little escapade. My mother had just woken us up from our bed and we were getting dressed when my brother began to ask,  “What exactly do you think she has in her house?” I paused for a moment since I was still trying to wake at this point and after slipping on my Batman t-shirt I looked over to my brother and shrugged “I don’t maybe her witches’ broom stick or maybe even a cauldron?” I jokingly retorted. We had always thought of Ms. Hickory as a witch since she was a very old woman and tended to look a little wicked in her rocking chair glowering at the rest of the denizens of our little neighborhood. 

The morning went on with the daily routine with me heading to the kitchen to get some breakfast. My brother and I quietly ate our Coco-Puffs and my mom quietly busied herself with getting ready to go to work. Suddenly, she stopped amidst her routine and looked at us with a worried look. “Are you two okay? You usually aren’t this quiet in the morning.” I didn’t want to worry my mother so I simply looked up at her, and smiled. “Yeah we’re fine, mama, I guess we are still waking up.” I laughed a little bit at the thought but I felt a bad taste in my mouth, as I usually do when I lie even to this day, and kindly reassured my mother that everything was okay. She stared at us for a few minutes and cracked a smile and patted our heads “I’d say you guys need more caffeine than I do!” she said jokingly. As she walked out of the kitchen I began to eat more of my cereal. 

The last thing I wanted to do, at this point, was worry my mother because at this point in her life she should not have to worry about her children since she had so much to worry about already such as the bills or family issues. Furthermore, she already worried about us having to being baby sat by Ms. Hickory because of the way we would try to dissuade her from having Ms. Hickory babysit us, but as we began to complain my mother began to deal with more bills and stress from her workplace. So you can understand why I had to lie to my mother because if I were to tell her about my troubles then it would result in piling more stress on my mother, and she was already at her limit. 

After breakfast my brother and I began to head out the door with my mother close behind us as we opened the door to our we saw one of the two cats we had standing at the front door waiting to be allowed inside. “Hey Patches!” I exclaimed as began petting her calico fur, and in response she began rubbing against my leg covering my blue jeans in some fur. After my petting, she dashed into the house as my mother began to close the door. I always loved those cats they always helped me through some hard times such as when Ms. Hickory upset me when I had done nothing wrong when I was only near her garden. Or what the other children had said to me at school such as nerd, freak, and many other names. 

We walked across the street to her house whose front entrance was a single door in the middle of one huge window to the right of the door and a large porch with a hand rail that went around the house all the way to the back. There was also a large overhang over the porch in order to give the ones underneath it a proper oasis from the blaring sun. In front of the house laid an iron gate that separated the sidewalk from her outside garden. Also, yes that is where the damn thing was and I’m sorry for not mentioning it beforehand but I just remembered its location, okay, memory isn’t so easy when you have to remember when you were five years old. My mother followed us closely as if she was making sure we would actually knock on the door and go inside the house because, excluding the fact that my brother and I were extremely young, she knew that we’d probably just play at the neighborhood playground all day and ditch being baby sat by that witch, and I mean almost anything was better than that torture.  

We walked up to the door with each step echoing through the wood and as we stepped on to the porch my heart literally felt inside my throat. My mother knocked at the white door and waited for a response. The curtain in the large window swished and I saw an old woman looking at us in that brief instance, but they then swished back to their original stillness. Then, almost a few seconds after the door swung open revealing a wrinkly old woman who was dressed in a worn out long sleeve shirt and jeans. Her hair looked like a gray perm on top of her wrinkly head, and her eyes, which glowered at my brother and I at a split second and then snapped up to my mother. “Hello Ms. Hickory,” my mother said in a welcoming tone “I am just here to drop off the boys for the day.” The old woman simply gave a slight nod, and opened the door “Alright, come along boys. We have a lot of chores to do today and we musn’t dilly dally.” Ms. Hickory retorted to us. I looked up to my mom and hugged her and she hugged me back. “Don’t worry, sweetie, I’ll be back at around 5.” She whispered as she crouched down to hug me. I simply nodded and began to walk inside Ms. Hickory’s house. This was going to be a long day I just knew it. The door then closed behind me, and thus the day where we would find out just what kind of person Ms. Hickory was had begun. 

I was standing in a medium hallway that led to the living room, and in this hallway were the occasional pictures and various cuckoo clocks. Leading upstairs was a long staircase with a railing to the right of the hallway so I had to move to left of it to continue to the living room. I entered the room begrudgingly and sat down on the left of my brother on the couch and waited for Ms. Hickory to come back down from her room, which is where she made our daily chore list. Which could take about five or ten minutes depending on the day, and in that time my brother and me discussed how we would sneak a peak at the rooms that she kept us away from. Our plan was simple while we came in and out of the house we would detour and open a slight crack in the door and try to see what she had in each room and then shut the door when we spent at least a few seconds looking inside it. I would explore the first three doors in the hallway that were connected to the living room. My brother, since he was scared of going upstairs, would explore the door located underneath the staircase. “Alright,” I said to my brother “Remember, only open the door a little bit but not too much. You only need to see what the room is like in the crack.” I instructed to my little brother. He was about the same age that I was but he was still half a year younger than me so I still had to act like the more responsible one out of the two of us. 

Ms. Hickory returned with the chore list and assigned me to clean the kitchen, which was located right behind the living room and wash the dishes as I cleaned. My brother was assigned to do laundry and not knowing where the room was Ms. Hickory directed him to the door underneath the staircase and opened the door revealing a staircase that twisted around to the darkness below. 

“I will bring the clothes to you in baskets,” she said “Just take the detergent beside the washing machine, which is in the cabinet above the dryer”
 
She began to walk down the stairs with my brother in tow, and as I began to follow them she stopped me and said. 

“Tyson, you have a kitchen to clean. So get to it.” 

Knowing that she would probably yell at me I walked over to the kitchen and opened the door, which was located a few feet from the couch. The kitchen was not much to look at. Its flooring was a white tiled floor that looked like it had been recently cleaned, in the center of the room was a medium sized coffee table that had several wooden chairs that looked like they were barely stable since some of them were leaning more than they should’ve, to the right of the coffee table was the countertop that stretched from the back of the room, where in the top right hand corner of the room was a door that led to the backyard, to the wall that was beside me, there were two windows in the room, one to the left of me that viewed our house and the street that separated the two houses, and the other was located above the stove which laid in the near center of the elongated counter which viewed the backyard. In all honesty it was pretty much a boring little room, but do remember being particularly disgusted of the coffee table because that was where Ms. Hickory cut her vegetables, which already smelled horrible and their taste was widely varied from a weird sour tangy taste to a sort of sweet taste within each of the vegetable. It was really weird on how I would play a sort of guessing game at lunch, when she would serve us lunch. Other than that little nit bit of contempt that I had against the room I was rather content with the room. 

While I cleaned the dishes I began to think about what my brother was experiencing in that supposed laundry room and what he was taking in from that room, and or what exactly was in that room. Despite this thought I finished my work and after putting away the dishes I walked over to the kitchen door and peeked out to see if Ms. Hickory was anywhere in sight. 

Seeing that she wasn’t I quietly tip toed over to the hallway and began to make my way to the door that was right across from the staircase. I quickly looked back at the opened door to the so-called “Laundry Room” and saw that Ms. Hickory had still not returned from the room. With this in mind I slowly began to open the door until there was a crack in the doorway, and once I had done so I peered in to the room. It was very hard to see due to the fact that that the light of the room had not been turned on, but what I could see was some sort of pile of sorts but I couldn’t see what it was and there were a variety of bags, which I quickly identified due to the silhouettes of circular dark bags that were revealed by a small window with the blinds shielded most of the sun’s rays out. All except for those few rays that aided me in revealing the very silhouettes that I saw before me. Then, as I began to try and reach for the light switch I heard the echoing of footsteps coming up the staircase of the laundry room with, what sounded like a second person close in tow.  I quickly closed the door and managed to quickly, but quietly strode over to the living room and pretended to be exiting the kitchen. 

I saw that my brother was struggling to try and lift the huge load of clothes that seemed could be more of weights rather than a stack of clothing. Ms. Hickory looked at me and said, 

“I have to take out the garbage but I’ll be right back to check on you before I go.” 

She then looked toward my brother and then uttered another command directed towards him this time. “Gavin, please go set down the clothes on the couch, and wait for me to get back.” With that she walked away and after the sound of a nearby door closing my brother and I set the clothes down on to the couch, and once we had set everything down he began to detail the room that he went in to. 

Apparently the room floor was concrete and the walls were red brick laden with plaster linking each individual brick to one another. The room itself contained a variety of boxes and assortments of different antiques that my brother could not recall since the room was very dark. Furthermore, the only sources of illumination were a single flickering light bulb that dangled from a thread and a medium sized window. Which viewed only the grass of the front yard and some of the street. From that window’s streamline of sunlight, it revealed the white washing machine or as my brother put it a “Washer Machiney,” and a white dryer. It seemed pretty much the same as the kitchen, meaning that it was a pretty ordinary if not cliché type of room that an elderly person would have; now that I think about it. 

“ Was there anything, else?” I asked him. He shook his head and said “Nothin’ big brother.” 

I simply sighed and nodded my head, and after a few minutes Ms. Hickory returned with a garbage bag in hand. Which looked like 

“Tyson,” she said “You and Gavin help vacuum the living room while I throw away some trash ”

I looked at the bag for a second and recognized it almost instantly as she raised it above her hip. It was the same sort of bag that resemble the same shape, and size of the bags that I saw in that room that I peeked into just a few moments ago! ‘Yes!’ I thought to myself in triumph that I might discover what exactly was in those bags. Perhaps from that discovery I might be able to discover what exactly she was hiding. But, I would have wait because if I began digging through the garbage bin in the middle of the day she might discover what I was up to so I would wait until the end of the day. After she walked away, I told my brother about my plan. He reluctantly agreed, after I had told him that all we were going to do was sneak out of our bed room window, sneak around to the back of neighborhood dump. Which is where she dumps most of her garbage and it was conveniently, just at the end of the street. Which would take only a few minutes to walk, or in our case, sneak over to. With our plan set we continued on with our chores and day as usual, and I began to think about what she had in that garbage bag. The other idea was to sneak another peek at the room that the bag originally was in. However, knowing that she would be back at any second. Also, adding the fact that I was extremely nervous at this point I just could not take the risk of entering that room with that over my head. 

At lunch time Ms. Hickory fixed us some vegetable stew with some fried squash that might add tasted quite good for once, and, for once, I was relieved not to play the sour or sweet guessing game with the meal she had made for me and my brother. I wonder what she done differently to this batch of vegetables that she hadn’t done before? Maybe she finally learned how to cook the vegetables just right, and not leave the cooking just to chance. However, I didn’t have the guts to ask her though. I didn’t want to make her despise me even more from my rude comments on her cooking. However, in order to lighten the mood in the room I began to chat with Ms. Hickory. 

“Ms. Hickory,” I began after swallowing a mouthful of soup. “Why do you collect so many cuckoo clocks?” I asked. 

“Well,” she began “My father collected them when I was young girl and I guess I like the way they remind me of when I was about your age, Tyson.” 

She began to tell us about how she grew up and what she went through as a child. I listened intently at what she had to say but my brother was only paying attention to his soup either out of apathy for the old woman, or rather he just didn’t want to listen to an elder ramble on about their life in the past. Either way, I began to see that this old woman wasn’t just some crazy old lady, but just a lonely old woman who had endured the torment of time. During the time that we used for lunch, which was from 12:00 to 1:30, she told me tales of her youth. One of my favorites was the tale that she told me of when she was married with a charming young man who swooned her off her feet when she was only seventeen and how they had married one another right after her high school graduation. She would go on and on about how her husband and how much she loved him. 

“His name was Jonathan,” she said dreamily “he was a wonderful man who would make me feel so warm on the inside, as love does to a young girl’s heart. He used to wake up every morning, make me breakfast, and tell me how I reminded him of the sparkling morning sun. I just wish…that I could still feel that sort of love as before.” 

I looked up to Ms. Hickory and she looked as though she was on the edge of tears so , being as young as I was,  I asked. 

“Do you miss him?” 

She didn’t even look back at me but simply nodded then got up from the coffee table and placed her plate in to the sink and began washing it. While washing the dishes she asked me. 

“Tyson, have you ever felt what love feels like?” 

The question itself baffled me a little and I was taken back by what she had said. I looked down at my soup and began to think of when was the last time that I had felt love. I then remembered that I had loved my cat, Patches. She would always comfort me whenever I got home. She would rub up against me and I would pick her up and hug her. That sort of “love” felt so warm to me. 

“I love my cat, Patches!” I chirped happily. “I love her because she always helped me get through my worstest days at school.” 

I saw her face change a little bit, but only just a little bit. I began to feel a little unsettled. Why exactly had she asked me that question? As I sat there in the chair I began to think about what love, besides the feelings I had felt for my mom and my most beloved cat, really felt like. 

Luckily, I heard the clock chime and I thanked God that it was 1:30 because at this point I felt that I had offended and hurt Ms. Hickory from my insensitive retort.  I quickly went back to my daily chores, which was, at this point, to help my brother fold up the clothes in the living room. ‘Maybe we had it all wrong about Ms. Hickory,’ I thought to myself as I began folding clothes ‘However, we still have three more rooms to go since we can’t go into the one with the garbage bags.’ My brother and I concluded that while one of us was going to the bathroom, which was upstairs to the left, which was conveniently placed to the left of her main bedroom. So the plan was while I was going up to the bathroom I would peak in to the bedroom to see what secrets it potentially held. 

After I had folded the last of the clothes I looked over to my brother and he simply nodded, and I walked in to the kitchen once more where Ms. Hickory appeared to finish up washing the dishes and heard me come in through the door. I told her that I needed to use the restroom, and asked for her permission and she simply nodded and said. 

“Be sure to clean up after yourself.” 

I simply retorted a thank you and strode over to the staircase and as I began climbing the stairs, and admittedly, I was beginning to become nervous as I neared the door. The hallway that led to both rooms was of medium length that allowed for only for a dozen steps at least with the bathroom only a few steps away from the master bedroom, which was a straight shot from the staircase. 

I was at the door, and looking behind me I made sure that no one was around and slowly twisted the old doorknob. The door protested with a slight squeak as I began to open it. The room was nothing special. It just contained mostly old furniture. With a huge wardrobe at the leftmost end of the room, and the bed that was queen sized with an assortment of pillows. The covers were dyed a faded crimson with what looked like an oversized doily to add a certain touch of antique décor. There were two huge windows adjacent to the bed that were clothed by white opaque curtains that blocked out the majority of sunlight, but still illuminated the room perfectly and added a sense of calming. 

I walked in to the room a little bit where I was to the left of the bed, and simply began to rethink everything that I had ever said or thought about Ms. Hickory. ‘Maybe we were wrong.’ I thought to myself ‘Maybe, Ms. Hickory is just an old woman who is just lonely.’ Suddenly, as I began to make my way out of the room I heard footsteps and in a panic I ran over to the wardrobe and hid inside. But allowed a crack in between the doors to see what was happening. I saw Ms. Hickory in the doorway, and while I could barely see her out of the little crack I saw that she approached the wardrobe and my heart began to beat faster and faster. However, she turned and knelt down beside the bed. I then saw that she pulled out a black chest from underneath her bed. After opening it, I saw what appeared to be a full set of black tinted bottles. However, what drew my attention was the piece of paper that she pulled out of her pocket. Then, gradually checked off what appeared to be names on a list after pointing to each bottle as if it matched the name. After going through the list the old woman quickly took the case out from out under the bed, and quickly hurried out of the room. However, she stopped out in front of the bathroom and knocked on the door. 

“Tyson?” she asked “ Are you okay? You’ve been in the bathroom for a little while.” 

She then motioned to the doorknob and just as I thought that she would find out that I was not in the room I heard my brother’s voice echo throughout the house. 
“Ms. Hickory!!!!!” he exclaimed, forgot where do you get the paper towels? I accidently spilled some water!” She withdrew her hand from the doorknob and uttered a quick curse. She quickly went away from the room and I heard the dull echoing of each step that she took down the stairs. Knowing that I was safe I quickly exited the room with the utmost quickness, and went in to the bathroom. I breathed a sigh of relief and leaned against the wood of the door. After that experience, and due to the fact that I had explored the last room in her house, I decided that I had enough adventuring for one day. However, I couldn’t help but think about what exactly what that list was and what exactly was in those bottles. ‘Maybe our plan to look threw the garbage will have the answers I want.’  I had a feeling that those bags could possibly be linked to those bottles. 

I had told my brother about the events upstairs and he began to become increasingly nervous about the plan to go dumpster diving to find the answers we, more me than my brother at this point, wanted. However, he still wanted to discover what lied in the garbage. He said that if anyone comes near the two of us at any point we were to run straight back home, and I reluctantly agreed to his terms. After the clock turned five, my brother and I began to get ready for our mother to pick us up from this torment. My mother entered the abode and thanked Ms. Hickory for taking care of us in which the old woman returned the thank you with:

“It was my pleasure. Oh by the way I want you to take some of the left overs that we had from lunch. I already have enough of it to feed a family at thanksgiving.” 


My mother simply chuckled at her retort and kindly accepted the box of leftovers, which contained the stew from our earlier lunch. As we left the house I began to plot out our little night escapade. However, at this point I had already my doubts and concerns about what this little adventure might bring about in the end. However, I didn’t worry too much about the end result, rather the answers that we will receive from what was in those bags. 

After we entered our house, with one of our two cats, Patches, scampering out of the house. We each took our own shower and redressed ourselves in comfortable clothing. My outfit was in the form of a blue jacket, due to the fact that it was going to be cold tonight, and jeans. My brother wore a long sleeve shirt and some of the hand me down blackish baggy pants. My brother and I agreed that once we had dinner we would sneak out our room window at 12 at night. Because, our mother falls asleep around 11, but just to make sure we wanted to wait until we knew for sure that she was asleep. Especially, due to the fact that her room was just down the hall from our own bedroom. 

As we sat at the dinner table, my brother and me simply eyed the pot that our mom was cooking our supper in, and boy did it smell divine! The only thing on our mind, at that point, was food. My mother simply kept stirring the pot, and as she was doing so she asked us how our day went. Gavin told her about how Ms. Hickory was very angry that he had spilled some of the water in the kitchen but, as he said, it was because he didn’t “see” the coffee table. Of course, both my mother and I thought it was hilarious so we both laughed at Gavin’s supposed excuse for being a klutz.  

Once dinner was served, which were the leftovers that Ms. Hickory gave us earlier in the evening.  While we ate the soup, I began asking my mother how her day was and such. She told me that her day was very good, but I could tell that one of her sexist co-workers had said something to her. The way that I saw it was due to the fact that she was slouching, and her eyes looked gloomy with her mascara hastily reapplied to cover up the black streaks around her eyes. So, being the happy one out of the three of us, I told her how Gavin had pronounced washing machine. I got her laugh and smile a little bit, which made me feel better that I can still cheer her up. 


My alarm went off, beside my bed and I hit the snooze button to stop it from continuing its repetitive tone. The time had finally come to find out what exactly those bags held. I, still dressed in what I put on when I got back from Ms. Hickory’s house, woke up Gavin and quickly opened the window. Due to the reason our house was only one story the window only showed our backyard, and the fence that separated our house from the run down factory right across from us. We each got out of the window, bringing our flashlights with us. We then closed the window just enough so there was a crack in the seal so that we could fit our fingers under it in order to get back in the house. With everything set, we nodded in agreement and headed down the street to the neighborhood dumpster. 

The dump was nothing special it was just a large blue container that had two black flap-doors, which served as its opening. The entire container was surrounded by a concrete wall, which helped to keep garbage from flying out. As we neared it, the perfume of garbage intoxicated the air and made Gavin nearly gag. But we had a mission to accomplish so he quickly covered his nose with his shirt and nodded. The top of the container was too tall for either of us to reach so Gavin, who was more athletic out of the two of us, gave me a boost. I grabbed the filthy rim of the container opening. It felt disgusting as if all of the most putrid and unholy elements of nastiness into a single object. I pulled myself into the garbage container, but I lost my grip as I tried to climb over to the other side. Landing on my back on top of a literal pool of filth and open trash bags. I nearly gaged at the smell, and the sheer feeling of the garbage liquid seeping into my jacket felt even more repugnant. I got up and dusted myself off and after pulling out my flashlight I began to dig through the cesspool.

“Tyson,” my brother called out to me suddenly “someone’s coming!” he exclaimed through his whisper. Knowing that I couldn’t possibly get out of the container I had only one option. Hide in the garbage, and hope that they don’t discover me. I piled at least two trash bags on top of myself, but I didn’t cover my eyes so that I could see outside. The person turned out to be Ms. Hickory. She peered into the garbage container, and appeared to be oblivious of my presence. ‘What’s she doing here?” I thought. It honestly didn’t make any sense why she was here since she had already thrown away whatever was in that bag. ‘Why did she come back?’ I thought as her head disappeared for a quick instance. She then brought up and set a black case onto the rim of the container. I knew that case…it was the one that contained those bottles. I saw the old woman whip out a piece of paper from her shirt and crumpled it up and threw it into the container and, conveniently, landed near where I was hiding.  After she had thrown the piece of paper in, she then began to take out one bottle that had something written on it. But, it was too dark out to see what exactly it was. She then took off the top of the bottle and dumped out with what looked like a black liquid. The liquid splattered on to my face, and I thanked god that I had covered my mouth with a bit of my jacket. However, the liquid stung my eyes and began to blacken out my vision from the pure intensity of it. She then dropped the bottle down in to the container, which I could hear the shattering of glass near my hiding spot. I still could not see but I then felt something hit me in the stomach. It felt like something slightly heavy but slightly flexible. I then heard Ms. Hickory say. 

“Thank you for all the love that you had to give.” 

I then heard her walk away until all I could hear were the buzzing of the street lamps. I then quickly began to get up out of the garbage and began rubbing my eyes to get rid of the stinging sensation that the liquid had given me. As I got up I then fell over whatever was previously on my stomach. Falling on top of it I began to see slightly, and my god I wished that I hadn’t. There…right in front of me…was a skinned cat. It’s muscles all pinkish-gray, and its eyes were locked on me in what looked like a horrified stare. With panic overwhelming me I kicked the body away and slid to the back of the container. That’s when something stabbed me in the back. I reached back and pulled out whatever was stabbing me, and it was a piece of the bottle. However, now that I could see I could finally make out what the letters bottle. They were L-O-V-E. I threw the piece as soon as I read it because as I looked up I saw that the corpse, that was now upside down, revealed a gaping hole in its chest where its heart would be. That liquid…was blood from that cat. Now that I thought about it I had seen Ms. Hickory add some of this into the soup that she had made today. I began to scream. But, all that could be heard was a sickening gargling sounds as I tried to scream out to the world at what I had just experienced. The reason being was that as I screamed the blood seeped down in to my mouth. That cat, in my sudden realization, was my cat, Patches. The reason I knew because as I screamed I tasted the blood…and it was not a bad taste…for the love I had given her.

,CautiousBB,"This is equipment, advice, etc. All the stuff I've bookmarked along the way. Geared towards breastfeeding/cloth diapering/going the cheap route in the US, specifically based on my experience in CO. 

Because I love to intimidate you, here's what I have collected in the entirely too long amount of time I've had to spend researching and reading about all this stuff.

**Things You Can't Live Without:**

**Right Away:**

* Car Seat and base - they won't let you leave the hospital without one and they will inspect the seat's installation and sometimes do a test to ensure baby can breath well enough in your car seat before letting you go home. Fire stations and police stations check these for free. If you get used, check for recalls, Graco just recalled every single seat they have out for the buckles. I recommend a convertable you can use until they need a booster seat. A good car seat recommendation/safety blog: http://csftl.org/recommended-seats/
* Stroller or Carrier/Wrap to carry baby to car. There will be a lot of stuff to juggle, you don't really want to juggle the baby. I recommend cheap stroller that folds up or an Ergo baby carrier (carriers that dangle baby by their crotch can cause hip problems- make sure carrier has under leg support). We also have a Moby for me to wear baby in at home to facilitate easy breastfeeding and skin to skin time.
* Going home outfit- winter coat, hats, mitts, socks, pants, onsie to go home in, we are having January/Feburary babies. Layers are your friend so they can go on and off.
* A couple of blankets. They will get spit up on and need rotation.
* Good quality muslin wraps. They're good for swaddling which is the only way to get some babies to sleep, breastfeeding covers if you care, keep sun off car seat or stroller, lighter blankets when baby is too warm, etc.
* Burp cloths. I suggest a large pack of Birdseye flat diapers, cheap, white, come in dozens. They absorb a lot, and can be used for many many things.
* Breast Pump. Your insurance should provide one of these in some capacity, but you have to call in advance and find out your insurance company's procedure. 
* Breastmilk storage (Target brand bags are supposed to be great)/bottles (look for breastfeeding compatible bottles to avoid nipple confusion). For use with the pump, so someone besides you can feed the baby.
* Sign up for some mailing lists and get some free formula to have on hand just in case, you do not want to go to the grocery at 2 AM with a screaming infant if you reach the breaking point with breastfeeding.
* Nursing pads (disposable or reusable). To keep you from needing to change your bra and shirt every time your baby (or any baby) cries. You need these even if not nursing.
* Lanolin/nipple balm. Because breastfeeding hurts until everything adjusts. This is absolutely not optional. (I hear good things about Earth Mama Angel Baby)
* Diapers. Plan on 13 diapers a day, you may need slightly more or less. Get newborn and size 1 diapers, you don't know how big the baby you're bringing home is. If you're not going cloth eventually, check out Amazon Mom, it has the best prices and auto delivery.
* Wipes. Or you can use flat cloth diapers or rags and wash them.
* Easiest is no cloth diapers until the cord has fallen off and healed, and probably not until baby hits 10 lbs. Most cloth diapers don't fit until then, and it doesn't make sense to invest in newborn sized cloth diapers you may not use, and definitely won't use more than a month.
* Olive oil, to keep meconium poos from sticking to the baby and everything else the first week or two. 
* Diaper ointment. If you're cloth diapering, get something that won't ruin your diapers (https://www.pinstripesandpolkadots.com/articles.asp?ID=260)
* Pack and Play. Works as a basinette and for lots down the road, and is portable. This could be moved out into the main space during the day as a safe place to put baby when you need to pee, shower, do a quick task, etc.
* Two sets of sheets for the Pack and Play, to rotate out for accidents.
* A waterproof pad for under the sheets for the pack and play/crib, if you want to keep these things and use them in the future.
* Thermometer, because if your baby gets a fever you need to keep it under a certain temp or go to the doc/urgent care.
* Baby tylenol (fever reducer) and baby gas drops (aka gripe water) (to stop screaming until they figure out how to fart.)
* Trash can for diapers, hamper for clothes etc. If cloth diapering, I recommend a sealed diaper bucket and wet bags to contain smell in between loads (the diaper genie is disposables only.)
* Plan on changing your kid's clothes 4 times a day unless you plan on letting them hang out naked. You probably don't want to do laundry more than every 2-3 days. Plan accordingly. Side button shirts, kimono wrap shirts, and things that don't go over baby's head are your friend. If cloth diapering, remember most baby pants won't work, you probably want leg warmers. Once Upon A Child and other children's thrift/consignment stores are amazing and there is literally zero need to buy new baby clothes.
* Don't forget socks and mitts, if your baby scratching their own eyes out (or yours) concerns you. 
* Get a couple of hats, babies aren't great at regulating their own temps.
* Baby monitor. This can be cheap, but you probably don't want to run into the nursery every five seconds if you like your sanity.
* Post partum stuff for mom- you're gonna need to take care of yourself. Lists for that below. Ask at your hospital tour if they'll provide things on the list for you to take home.

**Nice but not Absolutely Vital:**

* Sleep sacks/wraps. Babies can't sleep with crib bumpers, blankets, quilts, stuffed animals, etc until they can roll over and move on their own. SIDS. So, sleep sacks were born. They're like little zip on sleeping bags. You'll probably want 3-4 for accidents.
* A safe baby bathtub of some kind. Technically you could just take a bath with baby, if that's something you're comfortable with. Just keep in mind they can't support themselves for a while, wet babies are slippery as hell, drowning is bad. We got one that's just a prop for our full size tub. Most are overly complex, expensive, and stupid. Go cheap.
* Bouncer/Swing: Some people say they literally can't live without these, but I am skeptical. We have two bouncers because people. I'll have one upstairs and one downstairs. Likely good to have a safe place to put the kid in the kitchen and when you need to pee.
* Nightlights. Everywhere. So you don't cry at 2 AM. And so your baby doesn't cry at 2 AM.
* Changing pad/table: You can change your baby on the floor, but it might be nice to have a dedicated spot to do it.
* Bibs. If you have a drooler, you'll want these sooner than starting solids. 
* Breast shells or nipple soothers... again, your boobs are going to hurt, you may NEED these to get through the day.
* A couple of nursing bras and/or nursing tanks is probably advisable. They'll need washed a lot, you'll probably want a few of each. Target nursing tanks are the universal favorite, too bad they won't fit me.
* Nursing pillow: easier than trying to get pillows you already own to the right height and it's impossible to hold the baby at the right height for an hour at a time.
* Diaper bag, if you want to leave the house. You can probably use an old backpack or purse and an insulated lunch box for bottles, too.
* Snot sucker. I know it sounds rediculious, but everyone swears by these things when your baby has a cold.
* Baby nail clippers (it's very easy to cut baby skin accidentally with adult size clippers I guess, I may just use a nail file.)

**By 3-6 Months:**

* A crib and mattress, if you don't want to sleep with your child for all time. I recommend a convertable crib that goes to toddler bed and twin bed for long term. If you get one of these, BUY THE CONVERSION RAILS for the twin bed- they won't make them in five years when you get around to needing them.
* Sheets (enough to change out during the night)/waterproof pads for crib.
* Teethers/pacifiers.
* Probably some kind of toys and books for mental stimulation would be good.
* High chair. We're going with one that clips to the dinner table or a counter, so we can use it where convienent, it doesn't take up floor space, and we can take it with us to resturaunts. Plus, fabric seat is removable/washable.
* Plastic dishes/sippy cups for baby.
* Baby proofing gear... outlet covers, edge cushions. Start thinking about doors, baby gates (make sure they're rated for stairs if you're using them there) fridge/stove/toilet locks if you're that paranoid. Here's a good checklist: http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/enhanced/webdr01/2013/3/21/14/enhanced-buzz-28185-1363890346-10.jpg

**Silly, don't need:**

* Baby towels/washcloths. They don't need special towels or washcloths unless you really don't want spitup or poo on yours.
* Wipe warmers. They breed bacteria and the wipes are cold before they get to the baby.
* Special soaps/lotions... they are pretty much the same thing you use. Just watch for rashes in case of sensitive skin.
* Crib bedding sets: You can't use 80% of them. Seriously. Bumpers, quilts, blankets, all 100% not safe and just for decoration. Total rip off. That includes breathable bumpers.
* Baby movement/heartbeat monitors. They sell these now, with an alarm that goes off if your baby doesn't breath or move enough, but I hear they go off and scare people to death when everything's fine. A lot. I would skip this.

**Some Circumcision, Cord Related medical stuff:** (Please don't discuss this here on the forum, not sure if it's a banned topic or not, but I know it is at /r/babybumps.)

,pkmntcg,"I used to collect Pokemon when I was a younger kid during 2000-2001, 80% of my cards are made up of the original 150. Nostalgia, as well as my investment-oriented way of thinking set in. I want to purchase a English 1st Edition Base Set Booster pack as an investment, as well as collectable keepsake that will remind me of my childhood.

Main thing I was wondering is the going price of these currently. I have found them around $230-$250 range currently, although the condition wasn't stated of the pack. Also wondering what you see the price of these being in the future?

,whowouldwin,"Iowa Jack is the main character from Spelunky, a combination dungeon crawler and platformer.

If you know him, he's endgame material, carrying the Bomb Paste, the Kapala, the Jetpack, the Udjat Eye, the Spectacles, the Scepter, a Shotgun, and enough bombs and rope that he probably won't run out(if it turns out to matter, say 99 and 20, respectively).

If you don't know him:

Basic stats:
Strength: Can lift and throw golden idols as large as himself, and is unencumbered while carrying them, though he does need both hands to do so.

Speed: Slower than a speeding bullet, but not by much.

Durability: Weak enough to be killed by arrows to the chest. Can gain health from the affection of the damsels he rescues. Also see gear below.

Gear:
Whip: He uses a whip as his basic weapon, and hits hard enough with it to briefly stun neanderthals and kill smaller animals.

The Kapala: A skull goblet, which lets him gain health from the blood of others. It collects even in the middle of combat, but at a pretty bad return rate.

The Jetpack: Needs little explanation, it's a jetpack that lets him fly for short boosts.

Spectacles+Udjat Eye: Their effects combined let him see through walls and detect secret passages.

Scepter: A golden scepter that emits pulses of psychic energy that homes in on enemies and usually kill them. Cannot be aimed and can also hit friendlies, though not Jack himself.

Shotgun: A shotgun.

Bombs: He throws bombs which can one-hit most enemies he encounters, barring bosses. For these fights, he'll have the bomb paste, which makes them sticky.

Rope: He carries rope, which he can throw hard enough to kill small animals or stun larger enemies.

Anyway, the ladder:

,CompetitiveEDH,"RAMP TRAMP: A SHEOLDRED PRIMER

	This was my first ever EDH deck. Over the years it has evolved into a fast, powerful beast. The commander of the deck is Sheoldred, Whispering One, who provides the deck with two powerful card advantage effects and a win condition in one mana-hungry Praetor. I really enjoy this deck, and since I've spent so much time on it, my collection has warped to show a bias. Four of my five EDH decks have black in them, often playing cards cast off from this list. In other words, once you go black, you don't go back.
	The deck archetype this falls into is most nearly mono-black control, though like most EDH decks it has its fingers in multiple pies. These are its primary win conditions, which can be combined when necessary:
	- Sheoldred, through commander damage (late game)
	- Large creatures like Eldrazi and Blightsteel, through attrition or damage (any point)
	- Sorin Markov + damage (any point)
	- A massive Exsanguinate or Consume Spirit, or multiple smaller ones (any point)
	- Infinite mana combos with Rings of Brighthearth (any point)
	A critical mass of tutors make any of these win conditions much easier to accomplish, as you can grab whatever missing piece or answer that you need.
	My list has been tested numerous times. There are cards in here that have survived 20+ once-overs and in-depth deconstructions. It has served under at least five different mono-black commanders, the most prominent being Drana, Kalastria Bloodchief. This list even formed the basis for an Oona deck at one point, which I scrapped in favor of the mono-black list despite the additions of big Jace and other blue power. It just works best in this form. Overall, I would say it is 95% complete, and any additions at this point will be minor replacements or bling.

SPEAKING OF BLING:
Sheoldred is the set foil version.

Urborg, Necropotence, Sign in Blood, Consume Spirit, Exsanguinate, Caged Sun, Boseiju, Stinkweed Imp, Steel Hellkite, Xiahou Dun, Diabolic Tutor, Voltaic Key, Maze of Ith, All is Dust, and Vesuva are all FOIL.

Drana, Gilded Lotus, Shizo, Myojin, Kokusho, and Blightsteel are all JAPANESE.

Rune-Scarred Demon is CHINESE.

All Swamps are UNGLUED.

I have no MONEY left, please send more to middleclasswhitestudent@gmail.com


This deck definitely plays its commander, but it doesn't rely on it. Therefore, the list can be used universally, so here are some
COMMANDER ALTERNATIVES:
Drana, Kalastria Bloodchief
Actually my usual commander, but Sheoldred is going to have an extended testing period. Drana is still amazing for this deck. The massive amounts of mana constantly being generated fuel her draining ability to the very limits of its usage. She provides endless spot removal and evasive commander damage. Her slot in the current list, unique among former commanders of the deck, was definitely earned. Best tech for this version: Horobi, Death's Wail.

Maga, Traitor to Mortals
If an outsider with perfect knowledge of EDH commanders was to see my list with no knowledge of my actual commander, they would probably assume this guy. I don't like him because he's very boring.

Skithryx, the Blight Dragon
It's evasive, regenerates, and kills really fast. What more do you want? (Maybe not the collective disappointment of your peers.)

Visara the Dreadful
Fits the mono-black control gameplan very well. A great mid-game play to threaten opposing drops and control the board. 

Chainer, Dementia Master
Lots of creatures snuffing it via boardwipes, lots of mana to supply Chainer's dementia habit, and even some drain spells to keep the ship sailing.

Geth, Lord of the Vault
A lot like Chainer, but trades some explosive luck plays (like grabbing an early Eldrazi from the graveyard at instant speed) for more stability and versatility. Fun fact: Since I pulled a foil, this was actually the deck's first commander, back before I even had 100 of the same sleeves to use and just put the cards I had in 80 bad Ultra Pros. Geth's living a great life in the Mimeoplasm Retirement Home for the Criminally Insane last time I heard.

Kagemaro, First to Suffer
A pocket board-wipe can be an effective commander option, especially in creature-heavy metas.

Xiahou Dun, the One-Eyed
This shifts the deck's focus a bit in my opinion (for one thing, reanimation spells become a lot more consistent), but Xiahou Dun is incredibly versatile and full of odd interactions and combos (Corpse Dance + Xiahou = 5 mana repeatable black Regrowth, infinite mana + Xiahou + tutor = infinitely cast any card in your deck, and so on).

Spirit of the Night
Despite owning a Spirit of the Night, I am far too cowardly to put it in a deck. It's just so mediocre for a nine-mana creature. However, anyone using this as a commander gets major style points. I'd include some Voltron cards and more single-target removal compared to board-wipes.

Erebos, God of the Dead
This deck is pretty bad at getting devotion outside of a few cards, and playing Greed as your commander would be a mediocre option even if it didn't cost an additional mana to activate. Still, if all you play against is Oloro/Trostani/other random lifegain, this will completely rip them apart.

Kiku, Night's Flower
Man, I tried her for a bit when I was on a low-cost commander binge. Long story short: she blows.

Maralen of the Mornsong
Another short-lived personal addition. I could see running her if your deck was very combo-focused, but it's hard to visualize any metagame in which the other decks don't just use her symmetric ability to fetch answers for her (this is why Howling Mine is worse than Temple Bell in most EDH decks), which is what always happens because tutoring as your draw every turn is blatantly degenerate.


MATCHUPS:
	The only place I play EDH anymore is 35 minutes away, so I don't play with other people as much. However, in true lonely nerd fashion, I playtest my decks against each other and theorycraft often, so I have a working knowledge of a few matchups.

Iona, Shield of Emeria
Very few people play this as a commander, but it should be mentioned here because this is often the end for you unless you have an onboard answer. Iona against a mono-color deck is more or less a castration, since it removes probably 75% of your options and 90% of your spells. All is Dust, Karn Liberated, and your artifact board-wipes still kill her fine, but unless you manage to have those or things that can fetch those on board or in hand, you will probably lose under a wave of not being able to play anything. If you manage to kill it and their deck is in reanimation colors, you should probably prioritize Bojuka Bog. It's really that big of a deal, and as a mono-color deck in this format, this is the best set of answers you can have.

Avacyn, Angel of Hope
Avacyn is a very strong card, it is very hard to stop, and it is a very common card in the format. So, just for reference, this is my list of anti-Avacyn cards: Black Sun's Zenith, Toxic Deluge, Mutilate, All is Dust, Perilous Vault, Ashes to Ashes, Death Cloud, Karn Liberated. Sheoldred herself is also nice as a way of keeping Avacyn off the board. I'd honestly consider running more if there were some better options.

Karador, Ghost Chieftain
Karador has some resiliency against a lot of Sheoldred's tricks, since he can just repeatedly Spore Frog all combat damage (my own personal favorite Karador innovation) or rebuild quickly after a board-wipe. Try to tutor for Bojuka Bog and use it when you think it will have the most impact. The best win conditions in this matchup are Sorin and drain spells, which are very difficult to stop for Karador (unless he has Gaddock Teeg). Keep an eye out for his combos, as Reveillark + Karmic Guide + Saffi Eriksdotter is fairly easy to assemble in Karador and will win him the game. Try not to lose via attrition, as Karador has an advantage in that angle due to the commander cost system not affecting him as adversely. Karador also inherently resists discard (early in the game, it can even help him by reducing Karador's cost), so cards like Mind Twist can be a little underwhelming.

The Mimeoplasm
Another graveyard-focused deck, my build is a little less single-minded and focuses on stealing and copying various cards. If the Mimeoplasm can luck into some good reanimations it can win, so your task is to kill them as fast as possible. Otherwise, the only real problems are counterspells, which you have answers and workarounds for.

Maelstrom Wanderer (RIP)
Maelstrom Wanderer wants to kill Sheoldred as fast as possible, and Sheoldred wants to wipe the board repeatedly while setting up a win condition. It's usually in Sheoldred's favor but I could see a more tuned MW list snatching wins. MW can also luck into some great cascades and turn the game around, so never relax against it.

Krenko, Mob Boss
Krenko isn't a problem as long as Krenko and his mob stay as dead as you can make them. One turn of Krenko is one turn too many. As long as you remove him every time he hits the board, the deck is much weaker and easier to deal with. Krenko just makes the deck far too explosive.

Sliver Overlord
My Sliver list contains 36 Slivers (including all 4 Sliver lords), all 15 Theros gods, 40 lands, and 9 other permanents. It's very focused in its theme and construction and is probably the most complete of any list I have. However, it doesn't compete well against such a brutal and unforgiving deck. You win this one every time.

Mayael the Anima
Probably the deck I've played against most, Mayael is fine until she hits Avacyn, an Eldrazi, IONA, or any of the other massive creatures that can throw a wrench in your diabolical plans. My obsession with board-wipes as removal is likely due to having to deal with such large quantities of large creatures on a regular basis when first learning the format. When all your creatures look worse than the opponent's, sometimes you just don't play as many creatures and exploit the ensuing imbalance by blowing up the board.

Niv Mizzet, the Firemind
The only real combo deck that I play against with any degree of regularity, Niv is another deck that you only win against by playing well against. If you screw up and play blindly into Niv's counterspells, you will lose. Play smart, keep your kill spells for the Niv, drop your win conditions when you can, and there's no reason you should fall to the usual combo.

Rafiq of the Many
Like any deck that relies enough on the commander, you just has to murder it on reflex. Any long-term stays by Rafiq can spell doom for your commander damage total. The most dangerous weapons in Rafiq's arsenal are pro-black Swords, Greaves/Boots, and Darksteel Plate, all of which are artifacts and therefore very difficult to remove. This usually comes out in your favor but Rafiq can be very dangerous.


THE LIST:

CREATURES (14)
I don't run that many creatures in my Sheoldred list, since Karador is more of my graveyard-focused deck. Just a few that synergize particularly well.

Stinkweed Imp
This is my main man. I probably have 5 or 6 copies laying around, just acquired randomly because I felt like it was a good card to have more of. Stinkweed Imp is, like the other core cards of dredge, a masterpiece of its keyword ability. It blocks, it kills the creature it blocks; it dies, and it comes back with the draw, putting more fuel in any engine that uses the graveyard's fire. It's a fantastic rattlesnake to boot, since no one wants to attack the deathtouch guy and no one wants to kill the recursive creature.
A haiku:
Stinkweed Imp is great!
You learn to use it a lot.
Dredge for life, brothers.

Crypt Ghast
Thanks to my favorite EDH/Commander ruling of all time, Crypt Ghast is playable in mono-black despite the white symbol in its text box. Here, it does what it should do in all cases: accelerate mana. It also lets you pick up a few bonus life along the way due to extort's multiplayer applications.

Xiahou Dun, the One-Eyed
Infamous for years as a rare Portal: Three Kingdoms card, Xiahou is now a much prettier judge foil. As one of the only Regrowth effects available in mono-black, Xiahou provides redundancy to many spells by allowing a second cast.

Bloodgift Demon
Phyrexian Arena on legs, and quite good legs at that. I've won a game or two with his 5 aerial power. You can even hit your opponents with the ability if you really want to.

Drana, Kalastria Bloodchief
A former commander, Drana still backs up Sheoldred with powerful removal and damage, given enough spare mana. It's important to note that Drana was a huge bomb in ROE limited, which had an oft-played 8/8 for 8 at common. So... it's pretty much the same format.

Shadowborn Demon
“Target non-tribal creature” is always a broad category, so this is removal on legs against almost anything. This is also a synergy pick. Since there are few creatures in this deck, you will almost always need to sacrifice something with this demon. With Sheoldred on the board, suddenly that ability becomes an opportunity to abuse her recursion. Rune-Scarred Demon, Kokusho, and itself are the only real creatures that would benefit, but that's really all you need. There will definitely be an awkward moment when you really wish everything would stay on the board, but its upsides outweigh its downsides.

Kokusho, the Evening Star
Unbanned and proud, the great lifedrain dragon descends into the graveyard, absorbing the health of its enemies and giving that bounty to its master. It does this again and again and again and again, showering its miasmic spores into the night until all have become Kokusho'd.

Nirkana Revenant
The following passage is rhymed, descending numbers in each perfect line, if only to show that I will be taking a good deal of time.
Mama Crypt Ghast is quite the terror to all that claim hearts beating, feeding fast mana and spells and a synergy: shade-breathing. As a vampire ghast it's an undead conglomerate, you just take all the mana and bury them under it. This magnificent fuel powers all the deck's wonders, the wipes and the dudes and the flailings and the thunders.

Steel Hellkite
This is a situational Swiss Army knife card. It can provide a lot of solutions to many fringe problems, but it takes some care to be able to use its ability. Greaves and Whispersilk help a lot.

Rune-Scarred Demon
Demonic Tutor on scary legs! Not much else to say!

Myojin of Night's Reach
“Cards in hand?”
“Nine.” “Two.” “Five.”
“Myojin of Night's Reach. Cards in hand?”
*casual table flip*

Kozilek, Butcher of Truth
The easiest early gameplan for this deck is to rush Eldrazi, and for good reason. One attack with an Eldrazi is an enormous advantage (barring Sigarda, Host of Herons and an otherwise useless ROE rare that I'm not even going to bother looking up), and this is the kind of deck that can and will tutor up Lightning Greaves to make a such a powerful play a constant threat. Kozilek even draws you four cards to try and hit a tutor, isn't that nice of him?

Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre
Probably my favorite of the Eldrazi titans. Indestructible is invaluable in EDH, best shown by the dominance of Avacyn in any white deck. Additionally, Vindicate is a very powerful ability, covering some of mono-black's key flaws, enchantment and artifact removal being most notable. And oh, look! It also annihilates four permanents every time it attacks!
(For the record, I am hopeful that Emrakul becomes unbanned so that I can use and abuse the true trio of Eldrazi titans. It will also never happen.)

Blightsteel Colossus
The honorary Eldrazi, Blightsteel completes the triad of massive, answer-me-or-die creature-based win conditions in the deck. I used to run Phage the Untouchable in this slot, but Phage's small body, lack of any evasion, and fringe but horrifying drawback just didn't make the few kills and slightly diminished moans of pains worth it. Blightsteel is indestructible and effectively unstoppable, since its attacks will continuously wear down blockers until it finally gets that tenth poison counter, unless they're playing Melira, in which case you should probably fetch a different win condition. Notably, this is one of the deck's best answers (the other is Sorin) to any nuisances named Oloro or Trostani, since Erebos is kind of bad outside those few matchups.


INSTANTS (2)
Vampiric Tutor
One of the Big Three of prime mono-black tutors. For reference, Demonic is the other one and Imperial Seal is the one no one can afford (judge foil when?). Vampiric has minor drawbacks to make up for its decreased mana cost compared to Demonic, but it isn't fooling anyone. Any tutor costed this low is insane, and this one grabs everything.

Hero's Downfall
Sometimes you just need something to die. Guess what spell kills the most stuff for the least cost?


SORCERIES (19)
Mind Twist
Fun fact: the face on the tapped-out control player after you Mind Twist them for five is actually the exact same face that they would make if you suddenly slapped them without warning. This is because Mind Twist is banned in Legacy for a reason.

Black Sun's Zenith
Another member of the boardwipe suite, Black Sun's Zenith kills anything not protected by Melira. When was the last time you saw Melira at a table? Sorry, Melira players, but your combos are stupid and you should play a real deck. Might I suggest Sheoldred, Whispering One?

Consume Spirit
Usually worse than Exsanguinate, Consume Spirit is still worth running for its redundancy and utility. Sometimes you need to kill a creature.

Demonic Tutor
The gold standard of fetching is miraculously legal in this wondrous format. It's the simplest card in the world: find anything, only two mana. In a deck full of powerful one-ofs (read: any EDH deck), Demonic Tutor is a skeleton key to anything the deck can muster.

Exsanguinate
Exsanguinate cast with ten mana in a four player game will remove 1/5 of everyone else's life totals and give you 24 life. This deck can reach ten mana on turn four. Sadist tech play: Cast it for some really middling amount like X = 4 early on, then fetch YawgWill or Xiahou later on and do it again for the real damage.

Sign in Blood
I'm admittedly only running this over Night's Whisper because I have a foil. I have actually killed someone with it, but not (yet) in EDH. It's cheap, efficient card draw. Unlike cantrips, which are usually mediocre in multiplayer EDH, this gives you card advantage.

Ashes to Ashes
Joining Hero's Downfall as the only two pieces of single-target spell-based removal in the deck, Ashes to Ashes is often a welcome sight. The ability to two-for-one in such a versatile fashion (and with exile, which black doesn't get very often) is very much appreciated in the varied multiplayer of EDH. Its drawback is significant, but altogether manageable in a world of 40 life.

Beseech the Queen
Another great mono-black tutor, this is a three-mana Demonic copy most of the time. It can also act like a Diabolic Tutor and more when necessary. It can even be cast for 6 colorless, though sadly that doesn't get around Iona's restrictions.

Death Cloud
This has entered and left the deck multiple times. It's a sadistic way to win, but I end up loving every moment of it. The scope of this card makes it incredibly difficult to recover from. More conventional land-wipes like Armageddon still leave the rest of the game alone. Death Cloud attacks almost every resource in the game with a handy scaling level of threat, so if you really hate the world you can leave everyone just barely clinging to life. My favorite Death Clouds are the ones that give you an obvious advantage, like having Gilded Lotus and another mana rock out with no lands or creatures in play, since those are the ones that actually win you the game.

Toxic Deluge
Another great boardwipe, this again takes care of myriad threats including Avacyn and the like at a very mana-efficient cost. Again, life matters even less in this 40-life format, so go for broke.

Yawgmoth's Will
Play it again, Sam. There aren't any huge YawgWin combos in the deck, although Death Cloud is certainly an effective partner in crime. If you're having trouble realizing how good this card is, remember that a somewhat comparable card, Praetor's Counsel, costs eight mana. Another, Past in Flames, costs four but only for certain cards. This costs three. This card is good.

Damnation
The cream of the crop of black board-wipes. In true mono-black fashion, it was developed through wholesale intellectual theft of another card and looks even better than its predecessor. Wrath of God 2: Electric Boogaloo is cheap (in terms of mana cost... I'm lucky I got mine in a trade) and has no drawbacks. It's a great card for the color.

Diabolic Tutor
This deck's content is so good, even the most boring and simple of modern tutors is good.

Mutilate
This is another board-wipe that can kill indestructibles, gets around regeneration, and doesn't require any more mana than four.

Diabolic Revelation
Like all good X-spells, this tutor varies in efficiency. It's best in the mid-game, when early counterspells are exhausted and you could use a rebuild or a win condition before the endgame. Played for six mana, it's completely unremarkable, but it's still a tutor. Played for seven, it's definitely useful. Play it for eight and you can probably fetch Basalt Monolith, Rings of Brighthearth, and Exsanguinate and win the game on the spot. Might I remind you this deck can make ten mana turn four?

Promise of Power
Sign in Blood's stronger sibling, Promise of Power also has useful utility in its other, usually entwined ability. A flying, fat Demon is never a liability (although five cards should be prioritized).

All is Dust
Another fantastic board-wipe, this gets rid of problematic creatures, enchantments, and planeswalkers and leaves all of your ramp artifacts to use. 

Decree of Pain
This is a great reset tool. Since you don't run many creatures, this often doesn't even have a drawback for you. Besides, since every dead creature is a card, you can use this to cycle creatures you don't need. Playing this on a board often results in a reset (great for you) and 10+ cards (great for you).

In Garruk's Wake
This is the AK-47 of board-wipes: When you absolutely, positively have to kill every mofo in the room, accept no substitutes. Like all board-wipes, it's situational and better options often exist, but this excels in its own niche.


ARTIFACTS (21)
Mana Crypt
Yeah, I have a Mana Crypt. It's just as good as it sounds, but the 3 damage does get significant in longer games. Sol Ring or Grim Monolith are often better options if you need to find a cheap mana rock. This is still very nice to have.

Expedition Map
Fetches Cabal Coffers, Urborg, Maze of Ith, Eye of Ugin, Strip Mine, Reliquary Tower, Bojuka Bog, Boseiju, and any other land you need. Definitely worth a slot in this deck.

Mana Vault
Sol Ring on speed is often still just a Sol Ring.

Sensei's Divining Top
I picked this card up in a shoebox at a garage sale and it looked pretty cool so I bought it and some other cards for fifty cents. It helps smooth out my mana and keep an effectively larger hand.
That's a complete lie. This card is amazing and I've always known.

Sol Ring
The “sole ring” = the “one ring”? Coincidence??? Probably.

Voltaic Key
Untaps Mana Crypt, Mana Vault, Top, Sol Ring, both Monoliths, Coalition Relic, Worn Powerstone, Thran Dynamo, and Gilded Lotus for varying degrees of profit. In other words, it mostly acts like an add-on mana rock with a few additional options, like giving Blightsteel pseudo-vigilance.

Grim Monolith
If you play this card turn two and keep your mana curve, you will have six mana turn three with no other investment. It's like a reusable ritual in artifact form. There is a very good reason this card is still expensive despite its recent diminished usage in Legacy.

Lightning Greaves
This enables Sheoldred, the Eldrazi, Blightsteel, and the rest of the creatures in the deck to go from scary beatsticks to scary hasty shrouded beatsticks for zero mana. It's a very powerful card and is a staple in many decks for a reason.

Basalt Monolith
The drastically less expensive Monolith (in terms of money), Basalt actually has an additional application in one of the deck's infinite mana combos: this + Rings of Brighthearth is infinite colorless mana, which can be channeled through X-costs for horrible mischief.

Coalition Relic
This mana rock provides that essential boost when you need it and acts like a normal mana rock when you don't. It's a versatile engine.

Extraplanar Lens
Exiling Swamps since its introduction in the deck, Lens is the cheap-but-risky alternative to cards like Gauntlet of Power. It's also important to note that this has zero interaction with Urborg, as it alone of cards of its vein checks names instead of types.

Oblivion Stone
A powerful board-wipe with some options. Plays like putting a fate counter on a win condition then wiping the board are strong and there isn't too much drawback if they manage to interact with it. 

Rings of Brighthearth
If you like options, this has many of them. It can participate in two infinite mana combos, the aforementioned Basalt Monolith one and another interaction with Coffers and Deserted Temple. It can also copy planeswalker abilities. Many more interactions are possible, so here's a few:
* Xiahou Dun can get two cards from the graveyard.
* You can optionally spend two more mana to get another card from any Necropotence activation.
* Maze of Ith stops two creatures.
* With Top, you can copy its draw ability to draw a card and Top itself, forming a useful engine.

Whispersilk Cloak
Like Lightning Greaves, Whispersilk Cloak turns your scary creatures into much scarier creatures. Blightsteel + this is usually just going to win you the game.

Worn Powerstone
Another mana rock! This one has a drawback, but it's not so bad! Two mana is a lot from one permanent!

Nevinyrral's Disk
Larry Niven's Discworld (there's a genre blender) is a great option to threaten the board and either activate or bait answers. Its time delay can be a problem (Voltaic Key may come in handy as a suicide switch), but it's also a powerful statement that shows your dominance of the game.

Perilous Vault
The third artifact-based board-wipe in the deck, this one deals with nearly everything. It's the option that you grab when nothing else is going to work. In other words: Say goodbye to Avacyn, you dogs!

Thran Dynamo
And here's another mana rock! This makes three colorless mana and only costs four! Wow!

Gauntlet of Power
Accelerates your mana significantly and provides a boost to black creatures. This can cause some problems with its symmetrical benefit, but you have Caged Sun for those circumstances.

Gilded Lotus
Gilded Lotus is the mana rock that would be the slickest rock in the joint, but Mana Crypt is always hanging around and that gets him down a bit sometimes.

Caged Sun
When you need strong, noncreature mana ramp without a reliance on Coffers, Caged Sun is often the ideal option. The anthem effect is just icing on the cake.


ENCHANTMENT (4)
Necropotence
The best black enchantment ever made that isn't named Yawgmoth's Bargain, but that's banned. I have the From the Vault version, which looks fantastically vicious. Necropotence, especially with Reliquary Tower, just puts the rest of the table at a major disadvantage. It gives you the ability to turn any excess life into cards that will very likely end up causing more than 1 life of distress for your foes. It's just a brutally efficient card.

Phyrexian Arena
Sometimes, Necropotence is a bit too much. This is its little brother. It's still a powerful draw engine, giving you twice as much per turn as each opponent gets.

No Mercy
This is the king of rattlesnakes. It survives most of the board-wipes in the deck, giving you a commanding position after using one. This card itself is evidence of creature mortality, and unlike creatures, enchantments can potentially live for a long time in this format. 

Pestilence
A long-term, scalable effect that can take out swarms of small creatures with ease. It can also win in the late-game if you have more life than your opponent, since you can just play it and activate it as many times as you need.


PLANESWALKERS (4)
Liliana of the Dark Realms
This Liliana is a fairly mediocre planeswalker in most scenarios, but from my experience this deck is her ideal spot. Her ability to constantly feed Swamps to the player while threatening her final ability, which usually spells doom for any opponents, is a great asset. Her second ability isn't bad either, although it would probably see more play at -2.

Liliana Vess
Liliana OG is mostly played for her second ability, which on face value provides two tutors before needing loyalty counters. Her final ability is rare but powerful. Finally, Liliana's first ability has a very niche, non-intuitive usage. It's always usable as a way to increase her loyalty counters, but you can also target yourself to discard an Eldrazi and shuffle your graveyard back. If you have a tutor in hand, this can be a roundabout way to fetch cards from the graveyard. I've never used it, but it would definitely work as an option.

Sorin Markov
Possibly the most hated planeswalker in the format, and for good reason. Sorin's ability to instantly set anyone to near-death is hideously powerful. He's feasibly 30 damage or more for 6 mana. Additionally, he threatens a five-turn clock just by himself after using such an ability. This + an Eldrazi is a winning combination. His final ability is funny but doesn't have much competitive usage outside of them having a suicide option like Necropotence.

Karn Liberated
Incredibly versatile spot removal and a odd but powerful final ability make up for Karn's seemingly mediocre first ability. The fact that it adds four loyalty counters, more than any other planeswalker ability, helps. This is a planeswalker that can drop with ten loyalty and threaten a total reset in your favor within two turns.


LANDS (36)
Ancient Tomb
Fast and painful acceleration, the Mana Crypt of the land world.

Bojuka Bog
Graveyard hate that hardly takes up a slot.

Boseiju, Who Shelters All
If you play this deck, you probably like playing black a lot. Some people out there like playing blue, and don't like what you try to do when you play black. This is for them.

Cabal Coffers
Probably the most important land in the deck, this provides yet another ramp option in the usually safer shell of a land card. Combine with Urborg for maximum potential.

Deserted Temple
This is here to untap Coffers. Other lands sometimes need untapping, too. The infinite mana combo is this + a land that produces at least six mana (usually Coffers) + Rings of Brighthearth. Tap Coffers, untap with Temple, copy the untap with Rings targeting Temple, rinse and repeat. Any land that makes five mana is still infinite but makes no mana in profit.

Eye of Ugin
Reduces the cost of Eldrazi, fetches them, Steel Hellkite, and Blightsteel, and still taps for black with Urborg.

Maze of Ith
Gives Voltron decks fits and inconveniences most others, and still taps for black with Urborg.

Peat Bog
A land with a few drawbacks and a very nice incentive. This is a colored, slightly worse Ancient Tomb with different drawbacks.

Reliquary Tower
This deck can potentially draw itself to death. Reliquary Tower makes that a more pleasant experience. Less facetiously, this + Necropotence is the good stuff.

Shizo, Death's Storehouse
This can potentially give evasion to a win condition like Sheoldred or an Eldrazi. Notably, it complements Sheoldred particularly well: swampwalk works best against black players, fear works best against the rest.

Strip Mine
The anti-land, which kills all other land. Maze of Ith and opposing Coffers are great targets. I've tried Crucible in this deck for this, Peat Bog, and Death Cloud, but it doesn't work very well without fetches, which this deck hardly needs (yes, money is still a concern for this $800+ deck). Back to Strip Mine, it's also a fun card to just drop and threaten to stop their utility lands from deploying. Leave it untapped when you don't really need it and you can neuter their answer too. I have a nice original from Antiquities that I got in a trade at PAX East one year.

Swamp x22
Where would we be without Swamps? (Probably in Forests or Plains.)

Thespian's Stage
Copies Coffers and any other nice lands around.

Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth
An absolutely essential land, Urborg makes Coffers more powerful and adds utility to other nonbasics. Just as importantly, it makes Sheoldred unblockable against nonblack opponents.

Vesuva
Thespian's Stage, but trading repeatability for less startup time.


CARDS TO CONSIDER:
Nezumi Graverobber
Much better than Withered Wretch in my opinion. Definitely a shoo-in if your meta is heavy on graveyard decks.

,NBA2k,"I am not a quitter, by any means. I work hard towards my goals, and I am a determined person at heart.

But 2k14's Myteam, I'm sorry, but I think I am going to have to give in.

Let me explain: I have been playing this game since January when I got it for Christmas. I had played 2k13, and the only reason I wanted this one was so that I could play Myteam mode and put the games on Youtube.

Oh what little did I know.

This mode, when starting out, is seemingly entertaining. You get a nice little booster pack with some players and you try to make things work with the ones you have. Kind of like a survival situation, you make the most of what you've got. You try your best with your players and see where they excel and where they don't. And with those players, you work your way up through the seeds, getting progressively closer and closer to the next one. And for a while, this is fun.

But then, things start to change.

You've just gotten into the 4th seed, okay, so you had to play a few gold teams, so you lost a bit, you got here and that's all that counts. So who will be your next contender?

""Oh, an all gold super line-up? I can't do anything against that... I guess that's a loss...""

You search for another game, all of this putting a dent in your VC. Here's another one.

""More gold players? Well I'll try my best...""

You get blown out by 20. Not only that, the person you played against wasn't very friendly about his win either.

So now you're two losses into the 4th seed, and that 8-win cut off is looking a little far off, so what do you do? You can't make the cut against all these super teams, there has to be some changes made.

So now you VC farm, because the game doesn't seem to have any better options for making a decent amount of VC. Either that, or you can go out and by a Microsoft Points card, but that would be wasting your REAL money for a game.

Do you want to win THAT much?

So after many hours, you've got your new team. It's an all-gold line-up. If any team in the real NBA were to play these guys, they'd be unstoppable. Now you'll be able to blow through these seeds! Right?

Wrong. Now you've only just begun. The players don't play like they should. They're good, but they still commit the most ridiculous flaws. You get the win, but not without putting in a few teeth and some nails.

So after fighting your way to the third seed, you see that you have to win 8 games again. Many, many days are spent battling and fighting to get the cut off. You even revert back to 4th a couple times, and the third seed seems endless.

Finally, by dumb luck, by a few people quitting, you've gotten a lucky streak to land you in the 2nd seed.

The final seed before your glorious 1st seed, but wait. Hang on a second. 9 games you have to win? 9 games? You can only get 3 losses?

And that's where this scenario falls back to my reality. I am in the 2nd seed. I was doing so well, so, so well. I had three people quit, giving me an early streak with no losses. I won a legitimate game, and I lost a legitimate game. I also won one more game, but then lost two. I am now looking at a 5-3 record, no more losses or I have to start the WHOLE 2nd seed over again, and who knows if I can get lucky enough to win the necessary games to keep my spot in the 2nd seed.

I've been in the 2nd seed many times before, but I've never been able to win the 9 games necessary to move on. It just seems impossible, and let me tell you why.

The teams that I have had to play in the 2nd seed, they don't fuck around. They will exploit any flaw the game has to offer in order to snag a win off you. It's kill or be killed, and I've been beat up so many times in this game that I think I've just about reached my breaking point.

I've changed my line-up so many times, I've readjusted my playing style, and honestly, I thought I had something going today, but I just couldn't keep holding back these fucking cunts. I just couldn't. Now I am looking at a restart in one loss, and I just don't think I can go on if I lose. I don't even feel like playing my next game to see if I'll win or not, because knowing 2k14, I will get all the way to 8 wins, and lose my final game to allow me entrance to the 1st seed.

I've posted here so many times asking for help, and you guys have given it to me, but I don't think there's any helping this. There is no help against this. I've wasted so many hours on this game, I think I've got 400 something games totaled up on Myteam. That is absolutely ridiculous that I've played that many games and I still have not beaten this shitty mode. I've screamed so many times, I've broken two discs, a controller, and nearly batched my Xbox, all of that and I'm not even an aggressive gamer. I'm a very calm and collected gamer, but this game brings out the worst in people, I'm sure of it. I've given people so much rage and frustration when I've beaten them, I've received death threats in messages for winning, and I've gotten insulted by many many people through this game.

Now I'm not saying this isn't true for other games, because it certainly is, but this game honestly has the worst online community I've ever played with, period. Worse than 2k13, worse than DOTA 2, even worse than COD. It's astonishing.

I am sorry this is such a long text post, I know they don't usually do well for this subreddit, but I just needed to get this heard. My one hope for this thread is that it relates to someone else in this sub, someone else that knows exactly how I feel about this game, how they too have held on to it for much too long, clawing, biting, effortlessly trying to fight their way to the 1st seed, and always coming up short. I hope someone else knows exactly how badly I want to win, and say that I triumphed this game, but at the same time how much I just want to quit, how much I just want to smash it up into tiny pieces, and never, ever look at it's awful screens again.

Like I said at the beginning, I am a very determined person. I'm a fighter, I don't like to give up, but this game has worn me dry. I'm burned out. I can't take any more hits to the gut. I won't be buying NBA 2k15. If I don't make the 1st seed in my final four games, I won't be replaying the second seed. I'll be conceding defeat to this atrocity of a game. I've had enough. I don't like playing this game anymore, I don't get any joy out of it. It's become a complete fight with myself, others, and the programming behind it. You shouldn't have to sit down at a game and mentally prepare yourself. You shouldn't have to think about all your strategies, and maintain a level of assertiveness when playing a video game. You shouldn't have to scream wildly at a game, or get an emotional impulse out of it. You shouldn't. But this game makes you do all of that, and more.

Thank you for reading my post if you've gotten this far. If you are one of those people out there that are struggling to win, then good luck. I'm not going to tell you to quit now, maybe you can get there. But not me, man. I'm done. I've had my fill. I  appreciate all the help this subreddit has given to me, and I hope you guys continue to be an awesome sub for anyone else that needs help. Thank you, and goodbye.

,wixoss,"Greetings, fellow Goldfish!

After a cursory look around the sub I have realized that a particular [Umuru](http://wixoss-fanblog.doorblog.jp/archives/1006565543.html) has slipped detection.

---

As such, here she is:

[](/b) (Wielder of) The Key of Creation, Umuru=Noru

LRIG, Level 0, Limit 0, Grow 0

---

For every 1000 yen you spend on Wixoss products, you may win an Umuru=Noru!

Unfortunately, since almost no one in this sub is in Japan, no one is winning anything.

*Aww.*

Umuru=Noru also comes in a shiny Comiket '86 variant, handy for those who like to collect foil cards and make everything shiny, right down to the commons.

Going by the pattern and precedent set by our dear [Pinatadora](http://selector-wixoss.wikia.com/wiki/Eldora%C3%97Mark_I), Spread Selector will probably *not* have Umuru=Noru in it. If a starter deck for her appears, she will follow the Midoriko pattern, with her appearing in a booster before her starter is ready.

All this, amidst [rumours](http://wixooshanayosan.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-251.html) (although the post seems to have been deleted on twitter) of booster sets 4 and 5, kinda-sorta shows that Wixoss still has quite a bit of life in it, barring the recent announcements of upcoming [card restrictions](https://twitter.com/wx_tcg/status/494784820321333250).

That being said, I wonder how these promos work. While I highly doubt each of my Spread Selector boxes would come with an Umuru=Noru taped to it, here's to hoping at least one shows up somewhere.

,DarkTales,"				
				
Why hello, friend! My name is Tyson.  I’m assuming that the reason that you are here is for the story that I have to tell, and might I say, I will tell it well! My childhood was a particularly intriguing one when I begin to think back upon all those years gone by. It would be interesting to know where I came from and how I started out from my childhood into what I have become as an adult. In fact when I think about it more and more I don’t know exactly why I ended up this way, as in my eyes it was a perfect childhood! But I digress. Allow me to begin, starting with the earliest memory that I have to offer you. 

My first memory would be that of my boy hood in the summer of 1995. When I was only 12 years old my mother, my brother, and I had recently moved in to a new home apartment. Which, now that I think about it, looked more like one of those haunted houses you see in old horror movies. However, this story is not of that genre, my friend. So do not delude yourself into thinking that it will, as it is not. My mother worked a full time job at a local college and my brother and me would usually be baby-sat by one of our neighbors when she was off at work. We used to hate this particular woman, whom we called Miss. Hickory, due to her old age and her strict demeanor – like a stereotypical librarian who would shush any person who was trying to speak in the library. She would always sit on her back porch in a rocking chair and stare out towards our house, due to the fact that we lived across the street from her. This served the duel purpose of also allowing her to watch for anyone getting near her vegetable garden, especially my brother and I – every time me and my brother would be playing outside, she would scowl at us for getting too close to her vegetable garden. She was damn convincing, because every time we got near it she would yell and scream at us not to or “else,” and, almost immediately, we would turn tail and run back home. I’ll tell ya when you're twelve years old and you hear those words you really begin to think what she will do to you. I mean me and my brother would constantly try to come up with what she might do to use if we ever got near her garden, but despite this, we did heed her warning and did stay away from it. 
	
Despite that woman’s constant nagging at my brother and I, we began to explore more and more of her house and progressively got braver and braver with each visit. Especially since all we did at her house was either read or just take naps in her living room. Her house wasn’t very large and by my guess I would say it would have been at least a two story with around five to six rooms in it. The living room was full of decorative cuckoo clocks, some bird nests, some old furniture that included a stretch sofa that began from the center of the room to the left most-window...Oh, and speaking of windows in the room, she had two large windows in the living room which one was behind the couch, and the other one was seated to the right of the couch which… oh – darn I forgot what this particular window gave view of. My apologies, please, allow me to continue. The room contained a medium-size TV that was at the center of the room, which, despite having a TV, this woman would not allow us to watch in her house., this was only one of the many reasons why I felt hatred towards her. However, both my brother and I had the curiosity of just what this particular woman held in the remainder of her little abode, so we began to come to the decision that we were going to investigate just what our dear old neighbor had in those 5 remaining rooms. 
	
I think that it was after the third day of being baby sat by Ms. Hickory that we began our little escapade. My mother had just woken us up from our bed and we were getting dressed when my brother began to ask,  “What exactly do you think she has in her house?” I paused for a moment since I was still trying to wake at this point and after slipping on my Batman t-shirt I looked over to my brother and shrugged 

“I don’t maybe her witches’ broom stick or maybe even a cauldron?” I jokingly retorted.

 We had always thought of Ms. Hickory as a witch since she was a very old woman and tended to look a little wicked in her rocking chair glowering at the rest of the denizens of our little neighborhood. 

The morning went on with the daily routine with me heading to the kitchen to get some breakfast. My brother and I quietly ate our Coco-Puffs and my mom quietly busied herself with getting ready to go to work. Suddenly, she stopped amidst her routine and looked at us with a worried look.

 “Are you two okay? You usually aren’t this quiet in the morning.”

 I didn’t want to worry my mother so I simply looked up at her, and smiled. “Yeah we’re fine, mama, I guess we are still waking up.” I laughed a little bit at the thought but I felt a bad taste in my mouth, as I usually do when I lie even to this day, and kindly reassured my mother that everything was okay. She stared at us for a few minutes and cracked a smile and patted our heads 

“I’d say you guys need more caffeine than I do!” she said jokingly. As she walked out of the kitchen I began to eat more of my cereal. 

The last thing I wanted to do, at this point, was worry my mother because at this point in her life she should not have to worry about her children since she had so much to worry about already such as the bills or family issues. Furthermore, she already worried about us having to being baby sat by Ms. Hickory because of the way we would try to dissuade her from having Ms. Hickory babysit us, but as we began to complain my mother began to deal with more bills and stress from her workplace. So you can understand why I had to lie to my mother because if I were to tell her about my troubles then it would result in piling more stress on my mother, and she was already at her limit. 

After breakfast my brother and I began to head out the door with my mother close behind us as we opened the door to our we saw one of the two cats we had standing at the front door waiting to be allowed inside. “Hey Patches!” I exclaimed as began petting her calico fur, and in response she began rubbing against my leg covering my blue jeans in some fur. After my petting, she dashed into the house as my mother began to close the door. I always loved those cats they always helped me through some hard times such as when Ms. Hickory upset me when I had done nothing wrong when I was only near her garden. Or what the other children had said to me at school such as nerd, freak, and many other names. 

We walked across the street to her house whose front entrance was a single door in the middle of one huge window to the right of the door and a large porch with a hand rail that went around the house all the way to the back. There was also a large overhang over the porch in order to give the ones underneath it a proper oasis from the blaring sun. In front of the house laid an iron gate that separated the sidewalk from her outside garden. Also, yes that is where the damn thing was and I’m sorry for not mentioning it beforehand but I just remembered its location, okay, memory isn’t so easy when you have to remember when you were five years old. My mother followed us closely as if she was making sure we would actually knock on the door and go inside the house because, excluding the fact that my brother and I were extremely young, she knew that we’d probably just play at the neighborhood playground all day and ditch being baby sat by that witch, and I mean almost anything was better than that torture.  

We walked up to the door with each step echoing through the wood and as we stepped on to the porch my heart literally felt inside my throat. My mother knocked at the white door and waited for a response. The curtain in the large window swished and I saw an old woman looking at us in that brief instance, but they then swished back to their original stillness. Then, almost a few seconds after the door swung open revealing a wrinkly old woman who was dressed in a worn out long sleeve shirt and jeans. Her hair looked like a gray perm on top of her wrinkly head, and her eyes, which glowered at my brother and I at a split second, then snapped up to meet my mother's eyes. 

“Hello Ms. Hickory,” my mother said in a welcoming tone “I am just here to drop off the boys for the day.” The old woman simply gave a slight nod, and opened the door.

“Alright, come along boys. We have a lot of chores to do today and we musn’t dilly dally.” Ms. Hickory retorted to us. I looked up to my mom and hugged her and she hugged me back. 

“Don’t worry, sweetie, I’ll be back at around 5.” She whispered as she crouched down to hug me.

 I simply nodded and began to walk inside Ms. Hickory’s house. This was going to be a long day I just knew it. The door then closed behind me, and thus the day where we would find out just what kind of person Ms. Hickory was had begun. 

I was standing in a medium hallway that led to the living room, and in this hallway were the occasional pictures and various cuckoo clocks. Leading upstairs was a long staircase with a railing to the right of the hallway. So I had to move to left of it to continue to the living room. I entered the room begrudgingly and sat down on the left of my brother on the couch and waited for Ms. Hickory to come back down from her room, which is where she made our daily chore list. Which could take about five or ten minutes depending on the day. During that time, my brother and I discussed how we would sneak a peak at the rooms that she kept us away from. Our plan was simple; while we came in and out of the house we would detour and open a slight crack in the door, and try to see what she had in each room. Then, shut the door when we spent at least a few seconds looking inside it. I would explore the first three doors in the hallway that were connected to the living room. My brother, since he was scared of going upstairs, would explore the door located underneath the staircase. 

“Alright,” I said to my brother “Remember, only open the door a little bit but not too much. You only need to see what the room is like in the crack.” I instructed to my little brother.

 He was about the same age that I was but he was still a year younger than me. So I still had to act like the more responsible one out of the two of us. 

Ms. Hickory returned with the chore list and assigned me to clean the kitchen, which was located right behind the living room and wash the dishes as I cleaned. My brother was assigned to do laundry and not knowing where the room was Ms. Hickory directed him to the door underneath the staircase and opened the door revealing a staircase that twisted around to the darkness below. 

“I will bring the clothes to you in baskets,” she said “Just take the detergent beside the washing machine, which is in the cabinet above the dryer”
 
She began to walk down the stairs with my brother in tow, and as I began to follow them she stopped me and said. 

“Tyson, you have a kitchen to clean. So get to it.” 

Knowing that she would probably yell at me I walked over to the kitchen and opened the door, which was located a few feet from the couch. The kitchen was not much to look at. Its flooring was a white tiled floor that looked like it had been recently cleaned. In the center of the room was a medium sized coffee table that had several wooden chairs. To the right of the coffee table was the countertop that stretched from the back of the room, where in the top right hand corner of the room was a door that led to the backyard. To the wall that was beside me, there were two windows in the room, one to the left of me that viewed our house and the street that separated the two houses. The other was located above the stove, which lay in the near center of the elongated counter, which viewed the backyard. In all honesty it was pretty much a boring little room, but I do remember being particularly disgusted of the coffee table because that was where Ms. Hickory cut her vegetables. Which already smelled horrible and their taste was widely varied from a weird sour tangy taste to a sort of sweet taste within each of the vegetable. It was really weird on how I would play a sort of guessing game at lunch. Other than that little nit bit of contempt that I had against the room, I was rather content with it. 

While I cleaned the dishes I began to think about what my brother was experiencing in that supposed laundry room, and what he was taking in from that room and or what exactly was in that room. Despite this thought I finished my work and after putting away the dishes I walked over to the kitchen door and peeked out to see if Ms. Hickory was anywhere in sight. 

Seeing that she wasn’t I quietly tip toed over to the hallway and began to make my way to the door that was right across from the staircase. I quickly looked back at the opened door to the so-called “Laundry Room” and saw that Ms. Hickory had still not returned from the room. With this in mind I slowly began to open the door until there was a crack in the doorway. Once I opened the door just enough to allow me to see in inside I peered in to the room. It was very hard to see due to the fact that that the light of the room had not been turned on, but what I could see was some sort of pile of sorts but I couldn’t see what it was. But I did see that there were a variety of bags, which I quickly identified due to the silhouettes of circular dark shapes whose silhouettes were revealed slightly by a small window with the blinds shielding most of the sun’s rays out. All except for those few rays that aided me in revealing the very silhouettes that I saw before me. Then, as I began to try and reach for the light switch I heard the echoing of footsteps coming up the staircase of the laundry room. I quickly closed the door and managed to quickly, but quietly, stride over to the living room and pretend to be exiting the kitchen. 

I saw that my brother was struggling to try and lift the huge load of clothes that seemed could be the equivalent of lifting weights rather than a stack of clothing. Ms. Hickory looked at me and said, 

“I have to take out the garbage but I’ll be right back to check on you before I go.” 

She then looked toward my brother and then uttered another command directed towards him this time. 

“Gavin, please go set down the clothes on the couch, and wait for me to get back.” 

With that she walked away and after the sound of a nearby door closing my brother and I set the clothes down on to the couch, and once we had set everything down he began to detail the room that he went in to. 

Apparently the room floor was concrete and the walls were red brick laden with plaster linking each individual brick to one another. The room itself contained a variety of boxes and assortments of different antiques that my brother could not recall since the room was very dark. Furthermore, the only sources of illumination were a single flickering light bulb that dangled from a thread and a medium sized window. Which viewed only the grass of the front yard and some of the street. From that window’s streamline of sunlight, it revealed the white washing machine or as my brother put it a “Washer Machiney,” and a white dryer. It seemed pretty much the same as the kitchen, meaning that it was a pretty ordinary if not cliché type of room that an elderly person would have; now that I think about it. 

“ Was there anything, else?” I asked him. He shook his head and said “Nothin’ big brother.” He said reassuringly. 

I simply sighed and nodded my head, and after a few minutes Ms. Hickory returned with a garbage bag in hand. Which looked like.... 

“Tyson,” she said interrupting my thoughts “You and Gavin help vacuum the living room while I throw away some trash ”

I looked at the bag for a second and recognized it almost instantly as she raised it above her hip. It was the same sort of bag that resemble the same shape, and size of the bags that I saw in that room that I peeked into just a few moments ago! ‘Yes!’ I thought to myself in triumph that I might discover what exactly was in those bags. Perhaps from that discovery I might be able to discover what exactly she was hiding. But, I would have wait because if I began digging through the garbage bin in the middle of the day she might discover what I was up to so I would wait until the end of the day. After she walked away, I told my brother about my plan. He reluctantly agreed, after I had told him that all we were going to do was sneak out of our bed room window, sneak around to the back of neighborhood dump. Which is where she dumps most of her garbage and it was conveniently, just at the end of the street. Which would take only a few minutes to walk, or in our case, sneak over to. With our plan set we continued on with our chores and day as usual, and I began to think about what she had in that garbage bag. The other idea was to sneak another peek at the room that the bag originally was in. However, knowing that she would be back at any second. Also, adding the fact that I was extremely nervous at this point I just could not take the risk of entering that room with that over my head. 

At lunch time Ms. Hickory fixed us some vegetable stew with some fried squash that might I add tasted quite good for once, and, for once, I was relieved not to play the sour or sweet guessing game with the meal she had made for me and my brother. I wonder what she had done differently to this batch of vegetables that she hadn’t done before? Maybe she finally learned how to cook the vegetables just right, and not leave the cooking just to chance. However, I didn’t have the guts to ask her though. I didn’t want to make her despise me even more from my rude comments on her cooking. However, in order to lighten the mood in the room I began to chat with Ms. Hickory. 

“Ms. Hickory,” I began after swallowing a mouthful of soup. “Why do you collect so many cuckoo clocks?” I asked. 

“Well,” she began “My father collected them when I was young girl and I guess I like the way they remind me of him.” 

She began to tell us about how she grew up and what she went through as a child. I listened intently at what she had to say but my brother was only paying attention to his soup either out of apathy for the old woman. Or, he just didn’t want to listen to an elder ramble on about their life in the past. Either way, I began to see that this old woman wasn’t just some crazy old lady, but just a lonely old woman who had endured the torment of time. During the time that we used for lunch, which was from 12:00 to 1:30, she told me tales of her youth. One of my favorites was the tale that she told me of when she married a charming young man who swooned her off her feet when she was only seventeen. Also, she told me that they had married one another right after her high school graduation. She would go on and on about how much she loved her husband and how much he loved her. But, sadly, her husband had past away only a year ago and she looked as though she was trying to hold back some tears as she spoke about him. 

“His name was Jonathan,” she said dreamily “he was a wonderful man who would make me feel so warm on the inside, as love does to a young girl’s heart. He used to wake up every morning, make me breakfast, and tell me how I reminded him of the sparkling morning sun. I just wish…that I could still feel that sort of love as before.” 

I looked up to Ms. Hickory and she looked as though she was on the edge of tears so , being as young as I was,  I asked 

“Do you miss him?” 

She didn’t even look back at me but simply nodded then got up from the coffee table and placed her plate in to the sink and began washing it. While washing the dishes she asked me. 

“Tyson, have you ever felt what love feels like?” 

The question itself baffled me a little and I was taken back by what she had said. I looked down at my soup and began to think of when was the last time that I had felt love. I then remembered that I had loved my cat, Patches. She would always comfort me whenever I got home. She would rub up against me and I would pick her up and hug her. That sort of “love” felt so warm to me. 

“I love my cat, Patches!” I chirped happily. “I love her because she always helped me get through my worst days at school.” 

I saw her face change a little bit, but only just a little bit. I began to feel a little unsettled. Why exactly had she asked me that question? As I sat there in the chair I began to think about what love, besides the feelings I had felt for my mom and my most beloved cat, really felt like. 

Luckily, I heard the clock chime and I thanked God that it was 1:30. Because, at this point I felt that I had offended and hurt Ms. Hickory from my insensitive retort.  I quickly went back to my daily chores, which was, at this point, to help my brother fold up the clothes in the living room. ‘Maybe we had it all wrong about Ms. Hickory,’ I thought to myself as I began folding clothes ‘However, we still have three more rooms to go since we can’t go into the one with the garbage bags.’ My brother and I concluded that while one of us was going to the bathroom, which was upstairs to the left, which was conveniently placed to the left of her main bedroom. So the plan was while I was going up to the bathroom I would peak in to the bedroom to see what secrets it potentially held. 

After I had folded the last of the clothes I looked over to my brother and he simply nodded, and I walked in to the kitchen once more where Ms. Hickory appeared to finish up washing the dishes and heard me come in through the door. I told her that I needed to use the restroom, and asked for her permission and she simply nodded and said. 

“Be sure to clean up after yourself.” 

I simply retorted a thank you and strode over to the staircase and as I began climbing the stairs, and admittedly, I was beginning to become nervous as I neared the door. The hallway that led to both rooms was of medium length that allowed for only for a dozen steps at least with the bathroom only a few steps away from the master bedroom, which was a straight shot from the staircase. 

I was at the door, and looking behind me I made sure that no one was around and slowly twisted the old doorknob. The door protested with a slight squeak as I began to open it. The room was nothing special. It just contained mostly old furniture. With a huge wardrobe at the leftmost end of the room, and the bed that was queen sized with an assortment of pillows. The covers were dyed a faded crimson with what looked like an oversized doily to add a certain touch of antique décor. There were two huge windows adjacent to the bed that were clothed by white opaque curtains that blocked out the majority of sunlight, but still illuminated the room perfectly and added a sense of calming. 

I walked in to the room a little bit where I was to the left of the bed, and simply began to rethink everything that I had ever said or thought about Ms. Hickory. ‘Maybe we were wrong.’ I thought to myself ‘Maybe, Ms. Hickory is just an old woman who is just lonely.’ Suddenly, as I began to make my way out of the room I heard footsteps and in a panic I ran over to the wardrobe and hid inside. But allowed a crack in between the doors to see what was happening. I saw Ms. Hickory in the doorway, and while I could barely see her out of the little crack I saw that she approached the wardrobe and my heart began to beat faster and faster. However, she turned and knelt down beside the bed. I then saw that she pulled out a black chest from underneath her bed. After opening it, I saw what appeared to be a full set of black tinted bottles. However, what drew my attention was the piece of paper that she pulled out of her pocket. Then, gradually checked off what appeared to be names on a list after pointing to each bottle as if it matched the name. After going through the list the old woman quickly took the case out from out under the bed, and quickly hurried out of the room. However, she stopped out in front of the bathroom and knocked on the door. 

“Tyson?” she asked “ Are you okay? You’ve been in the bathroom for a little while.” 

She then motioned to the doorknob and just as I thought that she would find out that I was not in the room I heard my brother’s voice echo throughout the house. 

“Ms. Hickory!!!!!” he exclaimed, “I forgot where do you get the paper towels? I accidently spilled some water!”

 She withdrew her hand from the doorknob and uttered a quick curse. She quickly went away from the room and I heard the dull echoing of each step that she took down the stairs. Knowing that I was safe I quickly exited the room with the utmost quickness, and went in to the bathroom. I breathed a sigh of relief and leaned against the wood of the door. After that experience, and due to the fact that I had explored the last room in her house, I decided that I had enough adventuring for one day. However, I couldn’t help but think about what exactly what that list was and what exactly was in those bottles. ‘Maybe our plan to look threw the garbage will have the answers I want.’  I had a feeling that those bags could possibly be linked to those bottles. 

I had told my brother about the events upstairs and he began to become increasingly nervous about the plan to go dumpster diving to find the answers we, more me than my brother at this point, wanted. However, he did agree to go on this little night outing on one condition. He said that if anyone comes near the two of us at any point we were to run straight back home, and I reluctantly agreed to his terms. After the clock turned five, my brother and I began to get ready for our mother to pick us up from this torment. My mother entered the abode and thanked Ms. Hickory for taking care of us in which the old woman returned the thank you with:

“It was my pleasure. Oh by the way I want you to take some of the left overs that we had from lunch. I already have enough of it to feed a family at thanksgiving.” 


My mother simply chuckled at her retort and kindly accepted the box of leftovers, which contained the stew from our earlier lunch. As we left the house I began to plot out our little night escapade. However, at this point I had already my doubts and concerns about what this little adventure might bring about in the end. However, I didn’t worry too much about the end result, rather the answers that we will receive from what was in those bags. 

After we entered our house, with one of our two cats, Patches, scampering out of the house. We each took our own shower and redressed ourselves in comfortable clothing. My outfit was in the form of a blue jacket, due to the fact that it was going to be cold tonight, and jeans. My brother wore a long sleeve shirt and some of the hand me down blackish baggy pants. My brother and I agreed that once we had dinner we would sneak out our room window at 12 at night. Because, our mother falls asleep around 11, but just to make sure we wanted to wait until we knew for sure that she was asleep. Especially, due to the fact that her room was just down the hall from our own bedroom. With this in mind, we had to make sure she wouldn’t be awakened by out late night antics. 

As we sat at the dinner table, my brother and me simply eyed the pot that our mom was cooking our supper in, and boy did it smell divine! The only thing on our mind, at that point, was food. My mother simply kept stirring the pot, and as she was doing so she asked us how our day went. Gavin told her about how Ms. Hickory was very angry that he had spilled some of the water in the kitchen but, as he said, it was because he didn’t “see” the coffee table. Of course, both my mother and I thought it was hilarious so we both laughed at Gavin’s supposed excuse for being a klutz.  

Once dinner was served, which were the leftovers that Ms. Hickory gave us earlier in the evening.  While we ate the soup, I began asking my mother how her day was and such. She told me that her day was very good, but I could tell that one of her sexist co-workers had said something to her. The way that I saw it was due to the fact that she was slouching, and her eyes looked gloomy with her mascara hastily reapplied to cover up the black streaks around her eyes. So, being the happy one out of the three of us, I told her how Gavin had pronounced washing machine. I got her laugh and smile a little bit, which made me feel better that I can still cheer her up. 


My alarm went off, beside my bed and I hit the snooze button to stop it from continuing its repetitive tone. The time had finally come to find out what exactly those bags held. I, still dressed in what I put on when I got back from Ms. Hickory’s house, woke up Gavin and quickly opened the window. Due to the reason our house was only one story the window only showed our backyard, and the fence that separated our house from the run down factory right across from us. We each got out of the window, bringing our flashlights with us. We then closed the window just enough so there was a crack in the seal so that we could fit our fingers under it in order to get back in the house. With everything set, we nodded in agreement and headed down the street to the neighborhood dumpster. 

The dump was nothing special it was just a large blue container that had two black flap-doors, which served as its opening. The entire container was surrounded by a concrete wall, which helped to keep garbage from flying out. As we neared it, the perfume of garbage intoxicated the air and made Gavin nearly gag. But we had a mission to accomplish so he quickly covered his nose with his shirt and nodded. The top of the container was too tall for either of us to reach so Gavin, who was more athletic out of the two of us, gave me a boost. I grabbed the filthy rim of the container opening. It felt disgusting as if all of the most putrid and unholy elements of nastiness into a single object. I pulled myself into the garbage container, but I lost my grip as I tried to climb over to the other side. Landing on my back on top of a literal pool of filth. I nearly gaged at the smell, and the sheer feeling of the garbage liquid seeping into my jacket felt even more repugnant. I got up and dusted myself off and after pulling out my flashlight I began to dig through the cesspool.

“Tyson,” my brother called out to me suddenly “someone’s coming!” he exclaimed through his whisper. 

Knowing that I couldn’t possibly get out of the container I had only one option. Hide in the garbage, and hope that they don’t discover me. I piled at least two trash bags on top of myself, but I didn’t cover my eyes so that I could see outside. The person turned out to be Ms. Hickory. She peered into the garbage container, and appeared to be oblivious of my presence. ‘What’s she doing here?” I thought. It honestly didn’t make any sense why she was here since she had already thrown away whatever was in that bag. ‘Why did she come back?’ I thought as her head disappeared for a quick instance. She then brought up and set a black case onto the rim of the container. I knew that case…it was the one that contained those bottles. I saw the old woman whip out a piece of paper from her shirt and crumpled it up and threw it into the container and, conveniently, landed near where I was hiding.  After she had thrown the piece of paper in, she then began to take out one bottle that had something written on it. But, it was too dark out to see what exactly it was. She then took off the top of the bottle and dumped out with what looked like a black liquid. The liquid splattered on to my face, and I thanked god that I had covered my mouth with a bit of my jacket. However, the liquid stung my eyes and began to blacken out my vision from the pure intensity of it. She then dropped the bottle down in to the container, which I could hear the shattering of glass near my hiding spot. I still could not see but I then felt something hit me in the stomach. It felt like something slightly heavy but slightly flexible. I then heard Ms. Hickory say. 

“Thank you for all the love that you had to give.” 

I then heard her walk away until all I could hear were the buzzing of the street lamps. I then quickly began to get up out of the garbage and began rubbing my eyes to get rid of the stinging sensation that the liquid had given me. As I got up I then fell over whatever was previously on my stomach. Falling on top of it I began to see slightly, and my god I wished that I hadn’t. There…right in front of me…was a skinned cat. It’s muscles all pinkish-gray, and its eyes were locked on me in what looked like a horrified stare. With panic overwhelming me I kicked the body away and slid to the back of the container. That’s when something stabbed me in the back. I reached back and pulled out whatever was stabbing me, and it was a piece of the bottle. However, now that I could see I could finally make out what the letters bottle. They were L-O-V-E. I threw the piece as soon as I read it because as I looked up I saw that the corpse, that was now upside down, revealed a gaping hole in its chest where its heart would be. That liquid…was blood from that cat. Now that I thought about it I had seen Ms. Hickory add some of this into the soup that she had made days before. I began to scream. But, all that could be heard was a sickening gargling sounds as I tried to scream out to the world at what I had just experienced. But the blood that seeped in to my mouth forbade me from doing so. That cat, in my sudden realization, was my cat, Patches. The reason I knew because as I screamed I tasted the blood…and it was not a bad taste…for the love I had given her.

Hello everyone,

I enjoy collecting cards (especially finishing the card drops so I can {unlikely} qualify for booster pack drops), however, I have slowly realized and accepted that my infinite backlog will never be dented at this rate.

,Dublin,"Hey guys I recently created www.keepingitdl.com with the intention of promoting the town and surrounding areas. I personally believe Dún Laoghaire's online presence has left a lot to be desired.

I had great intentions of posting regularly on the site but college and work are taking so much time away from me. 

I'm a business student who loves Dún Laoghaire and hates to see what has happened in recent times and I really think a collective of people promoting all aspects online can be a great boost. I do not intend on running this site for profit.

So basically I'm looking to see if there's anyone out there who shares the same love and would like to bring some of their skills to help contribute to the website. I'd love if I could get a couple people interested in helping out and we as a team can build a strong website which will really show the best of Dún Laoghaire and hopefully help local business get an extra bit of revenue.

Hey guys! I've been collecting, breeding EMs onto, and IV breeding all of the obtainable Hidden Ability starters. And I'm going to be giving them all away to you guys in a couple of days!

My goal is to have eight boxes total (see, totally massive giveaway). The Hoenn starters (Mudkip, Torchic, and Treecko) will get their own boxes, as well as the Sinnoh starters (Piplup, Chimchar, and Turtwig). Thats 30 of each breed.

The Kanto and Kalos starters will all be sharing a box, so I will have 10 each of those 6. If it seems like there is a high demand for any of those, I will most likely do another giveaway in the future solely focusing on them :)

I plan on hosting this on Sunday, but depending on whether or not I get caught up in something and my breeding gets delayed, I may host it either on Monday or Tuesday. I will also be posting another Info post a couple of hours beforehand.

Any tips or requests? Please comment here, any advice is very appreciated! Also, feel free to ask for more information regarding the EMs or natures.

**Edit:** Might as well go ahead and put in the table with egg moves and natures for each

~~How the hell do you do tables again?~~



Pokemon | Number | Nature | Ability | Moves
---|---|----|----|----
Torchic | 30 | Adamant | Speed Boost | Agility, Crush Claw, Low Kick, Baton Pass
Mudkip | 30 | Adamant | Damp | Avalanche, Ancient Power, Mud Bomb, Ice Ball
Treecko | 30 | Adamant | Unburden | Pound, Leer, Leech Seed, Natural Gift
Chimchar | 30 | Jolly | Iron Fist | Fake Out, Thunder Punch, Fire Punch, Quick Gaurd
Piplup | 30 | Modest | Defiant | Pound, Hydro Pump, Icy Wind
Turtwig | 30 | Adamant | Shell Armor | Seed Bomb, Stockpile, Tackle
Charmander | 10 | Jolly | Solar Power | Crunch, Outrage, Dragon Rush, Dragon Rage
Squirtle | 10 | Modest | Rain Dish | Fake Out, Aura Sphere, Dragon Pulse, Water Spout

,pkmntcgtrades,"I only started collecting about a week or so ago, I think I've had 12 packs of Next Destinies, 4 Flash Fire and a couple of XY, so needless to say, I haven't put together a great amount of traid-bait 

However, I did pull a 5Ban Regigigas Full Art and picked up a 5Ban Charizard Ex Promo, which both really impressed me. 

So I've decided to focus on 5Ban's Full and Half art cards, and pretty much nothing else.

I've put together a checklist for 5Ban's Half Art EXes and Full Arts that I'm after

[Card Wants / Haves](http://imgur.com/a/yZloS)

I have a bunch of Reverse Holos and Rares from Next Destinies and a few from FlashFire and XY, as well as the usual commons and uncommons, I'll work on getting some images of them up for those interested in any.

Oh, my only other EX is the Shaymin EX 5/99 Half Art, which, while I like, I'd rather trade until I'm fully 5-Banned ;)

I'll get another set of images up for the 5Ban Full Arts that I'm after, but I'll keep buying packs with the hopes of pulling some, or getting some nice stuff to trade on here!

I'll probably pick up each of the tins that have these Promos attached to them (Yvetal, Xerneas, Delphox, Chesnaught and Greninja) over the next month or so, mainly for the Promo cards, but also for a crack at some of the boosters too!

If you have any of the checklist spare, please, let me know, I'm sure my own offerings will improve as time goes on!

Thanks for looking

[Edit] Here's not a great photo of some of the cards - all are Rev Holos apart from the bottom middle 2 which are Holo

,MECoOp,"PUGs got you down? Sometimes ME3 games go smoothly, with teamwork and rainbows and sunshine. Sometimes, though, the rainbows and sunshine are replaced by [possessed abominations exploding in your face](http://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/comments/2ajzw6/weekly_boasting_thread_104_fck_yeah_space_magic/civxsa1).  Cue /u/Meowmageddon nodding grimly.

I know this is a ""cooperative"" game hinged on ""objectives"" and ""deeps"" and things, but sometimes you just need to punish your squadmembers. Like that one dude using Explosive rounds. Or that Krogan spamming shockwave even though the enemies are on the other side of the map. Or that person randomly using missiles on 1234, forcing respawns right on top of you. Or those 3 Jugg-a-scrubs yelling at you for ""stealing their kills"" as they take turns gently massaging a husk. 

This build combines power, survival, and most importantly, the ability to troll your team, hard. No build I see in the BBLoB emphasizes lash this much, probably because most builds are focused on ""winning"" and ""teamwork."" Check your teamwork at the door. Will this build make the BBLoB? Probably not. But some batarians just want to watch the world burn.

__________________________

**Powers**

**Lash**: Lash is amazing. Sure, that Juggernaut doing 0.0005 damage/sec meleeing a banshee is really awesome. But you aren't here to kill Reapers. You're here for the teammate-murdering potential of lash. We spec for detonate, DoT, and shield piercing.

**Warp**: Mumble mumble debuff.

**Cluster grenade**: Grenades *don't* hurt teammates, right?

**Batarian Enforcer**: All power to the Lash engines.

**Fitness**: You want shields. More shields means surviving your own terrible deeds.

________________________________

**Weapons**

**Collector SMG**. Time collecting ammo is time spent not lashing.

**Acolyte**. The fastest kill is to acolyte a possessed abom then lash it. I mean, of course, killing that Volus who keeps shield boost-locking you. I know you're doing it on purpose you asthmatic bastard.

________________________________

**Bonuses**

Gear: **Geth scanner**-- be on the lookout for lashables. This is also useful when that Geth Trooper is in *""what? I can't hear you--I'm too busy holding down flamer all the time so that you can't see""* mode.

*edit*: Or use Armored Compartments. As pointed out in the comments, a very quick way to advance your cause is to missile abominations.

Weapon: **SMG Amp**-- or, you know, whatever. 

Ammo: **Warp rounds / Incendiary rounds**-- you can't lash scions, sadly.

Armor: **Cyclonics**. Survive to troll another day.

________________________________

**""Playstyle""**

If you need to kill things, just warp them and shoot them in the face until they die. But really you're playing this build because you are frustrated and hate your scrubby PUGs with a passion. My friend, what you need is more lash. Lash is pull on steroids. The direction of the fling is in the direction that the lash 'ball' hits the enemy. Hit the enemy from directly above, and it'll fling upward, etc. Unfortunately this means that straight-on lashing an enemy will drag it to your feet. This is great for shotgun users or if you have smash, but it's less great if you hate your teammates with a passion.

The goal of a good lashing is to move the reticle as far away from the center of the enemy as possible while maintaining a target-lock. If done properly, the lash will curve out before homing in. I try to aim for the upper left/right corners or, if the level has a ceiling, straight up. Because the 'pull' effect has acceleration, lashing with a long 'line' can generate hilarious speeds.

Let's imagine a scenario with your *true enemy*: straight ahead of you is that TGI **dry-humping an ammo box** instead of doing objectives. There's a juicy possessed abomination about 15 feet to the left, running at you. Target the abom, lash while 'aiming' at the TGI. You'll fling the abom right at his feet--bwaahhhhhhhh ""I'm down."" Don't forget to take ammo before reviving him (or not).

With the shield penetrating option, lash will pick up shielded, unarmored enemies, like rocket troopers or phantoms, with reduced force: enough to ragdoll but not enough to fling. Against armored enemies, lash still applies great force, if not a pull-fling effect. This force can be enough to stagger enemies like pyros, if you need a getaway. Flinging enemies off maps or into weird nooks (like between railings on Rio/Dagger) is a kill. Also note that the second half of the lash animation, where your character 'tugs' on the lash line, can be cancelled with the fast Batarian light melee. 

Here's a sampling of the horrible things you can do with lash:

* Fling abominations at your teammates. The DoT will often kill them at their feet. If the teammate is against a wall or near a ceiling, the collision damage will often kill the abom nearby.
* Pick up phantoms, which will gracefully land in awkward places and immediately begin palm-lasering your team. I like putting phantoms on top of crates. They seem happy to just stand there and gun down confused PUGs.
* Rip away those Guardian's shields and watch them lay waste to your squad. Did you know that Asari are allergic to bullets? True fact.
* Fling hunters into your squad--because Geth Hunters disregard the laws of physics, they will begin shooting your teammates *while lying on the floor ragdolled* (according to my ex-friends).

Your trolling is only limited by your imagination. Happy hunting.

,Frugal,"My goal for ""investing in time"" is to break free of the loathsome 9-5 grind, giving myself time to pursue hypothetically profitable hobbies and other sources of independent income.  I want time to improve my independently marketable skills, boost personal stats across the board, and enjoy life.  I'm tired of being a cog.

First off, the choice and reasons to do this are mine and whether it is wise or not is not really what I would like to discuss.  I realize there are better long-term plans, but I feel this route will make for the best synergy of my disciplined, hard-working, frugal side and my lazy, creative, hippy side.  I moved to Hawaii with $500 in the bank when I was 19.  In the 11 years since then I have learned how to live comfortably on a tight budget.  I have utmost confidence that I can make this work, but I thought I would share with Reddit to see what people thought and to seek advice.

""Operation Bread Eater"" is to begin with at least $20000 in savings.  Monthly allocation: $1500.

Upkeep:

* Rent: $600

* Food: $300

* Phone: $50 

* Internet: $17 (after split with roommates)

* Insurance: $20 (250cc supermoto)

* Gas: $20 (probably less since I will not be commuting)
                   
Total: $1007

Buffer/Working Expense: $493 monthly

Reserve: $2000 + whatever else I can save by start date.

.

I plan to launch on March 1st of 2015.  This timeline is actually set out of respect to my current job - I don't want to leave too quickly after the Christmas bonus.  I will actually hit the $20,000 goal a bit before Christmas, and the bonus will be, well, a bonus to the tune of a few thousand towards my safety net.  I am currently putting away $650 per ~$1300 biweekly paycheck, which means my current expenses are already less than my proposed frugality lockdown budget.  

So I can coast for a year with no problems, great, but to simply exist and play video games is not enough.  Unfortunately I have three other expensive hobbies:  Offroad riding will have to suspended, as the consequences of breaking my only vehicle/body are too grave.  Hopefully I will be content with the aquariums I already have established, so upkeep there should be minimal (fish food is factored into the human food budget).  My stock includes a few abundantly breeding species, which may help pay for itself.

That leaves prop and set construction for cosplay/movies/etc.  This could well be a pipe dream, but I have been inspired by people like [Bill Doran](http://props.punishedpixels.com/), who quit his 9-5 to make props for a living.  My one major shortcoming is that I don't have the on-stage personality that he does, but cosplay is exploding and I have the skills to make and sell props.  The question is, would I profit enough to live on?  Making things is not cheap and I will have to work hard to find customers, so probably not right away - that's why I have a year to establish myself.  I also have a few tentacles in the local [IATSE](http://iatse665.org/) and will be free to be on the referral list for when production needs additional prop/set builders (I have multiple student project commissions under my belt and also did a little bit of work on Jurassic World).  

Prop making is one of my ideal sources of income, but it is not the only source.  I won't list all of the leads I have, but the idea is to collect a diversity of open-schedule, occasionally recurring jobs.  Even if it isn't work I would normally do, the fact that I wouldn't have to report in every morning for 8 hours makes it tolerable.  I am not vehemently opposed to working part-time, but it would have to be a fun job that I wouldn't mind walking out of at any time if I have a conflicting Destiny raid or something.  If all else fails, I know dozens of electrical/general contracting business owners who would hire me if able.

One major gap in my plan right now is health insurance.  I have always relied on my employer for this.  Although my health is good and I rarely use my insurance, I am well aware that this could all come apart from one little injury or sickness.  Step one would be to get as much squared away as possible before I quit, but I don't know what this entails beyond basic checkups.  Vaccinations?  Stockpiling medicine?  Advice here is greatly appreciated.

Other notes:  

* I am fortunate in that dating and a healthy diet are non-issues - I have a low-maintenance chef for a girlfriend who loves to cook for me.  Meals provided by her are not factored into my budget, but I intend to keep those free meals in balance with when we occasionally eat out.  

* Discipline will be key - responsible time allocation, strict budget adherence, and being proactive will be vital to success.  My hope is that having all of my time to myself lets me get more done, rather than the opposite.

* It all seems wonderful now, but if I hit a wall, how can I stay motivated?

* I don't have a plan for after March 2016, but I suppose it will come down to A) Mission failed - revert to workin' for the man, or B) Mission accomplished - continue on as long as possible.

* If the operation is deemed a failure by March 2016, I guess I will go back to conventional earning for a while - this doesn't really worry me, as I have been in this situation by choice three times previously and always managed to make forward progress.

* Beyond tracking expenses, is this worth documenting and sharing?  I.e., do you guys care to see updates?

Thank you for taking the time to read this.  Please rip as many holes in my plan as you can so that I may adjust accordingly.

,Tremorgames,"**TremorGames Tips and Trick**

**Here's the link. Check it out if you're interested.**

* **[TremorGames Clicky!!](http://www.tremorgames.com/?ref=726243)**

**Note: I will place links at the very bottom and (Optional)recommended software for your protection.**

So, a few things for people who might be interested.

* It's not a giveaway. You do have to try to earn coins, and if you want the higher priced titles you will have to put into some time. Just interested in a small indie game? You can probably get it in minutes. However as you need more and more coins you complete all the easy offers and start to have to do some of the harder ones.

* Coins don't always credit correctly. Don't go into it expecting everything to work right. There are issues. There are a few ways to help your odds and I'll go into those, but there will be times you don't get the coins you deserve so be prepared for that. Just keep going towards your goal and you'll get there.

* Be careful which sites you get directed to to complete offers. Tremor Games itself is 100% safe, however the sites they link to may not always be. I'll go over some measures for this below, but just know it's not a great plan to go in there and start clicking on things.

* I found it best to set a goal. Find a something you like in their selection you want and then work towards it. For me, I wanted games and trading cards. It took only 2 days to get over $100 worth of items and I still have about 10,000+ coins that I'm saving up. 

**Keeping your computer safe.**

So you don't want to just randomly click around on the site on any old web browser. There ARE links that will lead you to downloads that contain malware and dodgy websites. The problem is many of those links are some of the easiest offers.

First thing to do is to create a safe browsing environment. There's two ways of doing this, either using a Virtual Machine setup or Sandboxie. 

* 1. Using a Virtual Machine is my preferred method, because you can set everything up how you want it save the state of the machine and then easily reset to that state. To do this you'll need a few things.

* Virtual Machine. Download Link **[VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org)**
* OS installation files. Either a DVD, .iso, or whatever. **[Windows 7 recommended](http://kickass.to/windows-7-sp1-ultimate-32-bit-t9069552.html)**
* Ability to install a OS, set up the web browser you want to use, and otherwise get the new OS ready to use.

After doing those things you want to set up the OS to the most optimum environment for using the site. A few things that I'll go into more detail with below will be an easy system to take screenshots. Having that already set up in the VM will save you time when you reset the state. Reseting the state will quickly become neccesary when you start doing downloads, but I'll talk about that more below.

* 2. Sandboxie is also good. Here is the download link **[Sandboxie](http://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?AllVersions)** . It creates it's own virtual environment that it uses on the fly and that makes it much easier to use. No complicated installation of an OS or anything like that. Simply install Sandboxie and you're ready to click ""Run Sandboxed Browser"" by right clicking on your browser icon which will then create a virtual enviroment, you can tell which windows are part of that enviroment because they will have a yellow border when highlighted. If a window doesn't have this you did something wrong and are running it live on your computer, which you don't want. Sandboxie is also very easy to reset by simply clicking the icon in the notification tray and selecting to delete all the files in the Sandbox.

About Clearing Cookies: It's important to do this regularly. Especially with Download and Survey offers. There are Cookies some sites can leave that will conflict with offers. There are Cookies sites can leave that can redirect your gains to other sites for their own profit. There are sites that will leave the same cookie as another site and if it has the older time stamp won't credit correctly. There's a ton of reasons and I'm sure I'm missing some or incorrect about some I've stated but I will say I gained way more credit when I started clearing my cookies more often. Set up a button or quick way to do this to be more efficient. 

One other thing, which is completely not mandatory but I recommend. Create a Facebook and e-mail just for use with Tremor Games. Many offers require a valid e-mail address or activity on Facebook for you to get the reward. I don't want spam in my regular e-mail box and don't prefer to have sites posting random comments on my Facebook page to annoy my friends and make me look like a trash bag. Once again this is optional, but highly recommended.

**Which offers to complete?**

Okay. Once on the TremorGames offers page you'll notice a few things. First at the top the offers are broken down into vendors. These are the people who pay Tremor Games for the things you're doing that allows them to offer you games. There's quite a few to choose from. I won't go into which ones I think are better and which ones worse, because from my reading there are people out there who had the exact opposite preferences from me. Try them all and if you feel you're having better luck with one than another stick with it! 

Instead I'll focus on types of offers and which ones I prefer. Below I'll go over a few in more depth about how to get the best out of them. Here I'll just list them from the ones I think are most reliable and likely to reward coins to least.

1. Tasks - Get coins for completing simple tasks.
2. Videos - Get coins for watching a video.
3. Downloads - Get coins for downloading and installing certain software.
4. Surveys - Offers that reward you for taking surveys or submitting other information.
5. Paid/Premium Offers - Basically an offer that rewards you coins for buying something. There are times when you must outright buy something other times when you must sign up for a trial that will charge you if not canceled.
6. Miscelaneous - I'm sure there are others that don't fit in the above categories, but that should cover 99% of them. I'll also throw playing games in here.

**1.Tasks**

There is one vendor that offers tasks as opposed to the standard offers from the other vendors. When you click on this vendor you will see a list of tasks that they currently have and the reward for completing them. They vary greatly in their payout and time investment. I found the best one to the task that's commonly offered to write questions about a keyword. It's pretty easy you're given the guidelines then words and asked to write questions about them. So your words might be ""Timex Watches"" and you can write a simple question like ""Where are some places you can buy Timex Watches?"" It's super easy and as long as you follow the guidelines you'll be eligible for a bonus payout once the question is reviewed! 

The tasks are a good steady way to earn coins. They always pay out and aren't terribly hard.

Also be aware that you should flow the guidelines and try to submit quality work. Whatever you entered is reviewed and not only will you lose your chance at bonus coins it's actually possible for you to receive less tasks offers from them if your accuracy is low enough. 

**2.Videos**

These are the most basic activities you can do and almost always reward coins. You simply click on a video and watch it. Sometimes you're also required to ""Like"" the service on Facebook or allow it to post about how you liked the video, which is why I recommended the throw away Facebook account. 

The downside to videos is that there aren't a ton of them and they don't offer a large number of coins per view. I mainly viewed them as minor boosts or a quick way to make up a small number of coins to reach a goal. I'd usually do them all every time I visited a site. It's usually possible to view multiple videos at one time as long as they're from the same vendor which should speed things up quite a bit.

**3.Downloads***

Yikes! Here's where you'll really need that computer protection. These will guarantee fuck you up if you don't have any. Just be warned. You download software(usually full of malware) and install it. Once again you'll want to clear cookies before doing this for sure. These are some of the sketchiest offers and once again don't expect to receive credit every time. Same thing applies about vendors, you'll notice some installers look the same. Pay attention to which ones work for you and which ones don't. Stick to the ones that do. Always screenshot the completed installation box along with the icon on your desktop or start menu. You'll need to reset the Sandbox or VM after just a few of these because performance will become poor. 

I found Downloads only worth doing if you were willing to sit there and run through a bunch of them. They don't take much time and have a good coin reward, but the percentage of them rewarding was pretty low. This can really be helped by submitting the screenshots, which we'll go over below. However it's still not a great chance any one offer will reward so be prepared to do a bunch!

**4.Surveys**

Okay, here's where things start getting sketchy. Surveys are hit or miss on whether or not they reward you, and some can be VERY long. After you get going you'll start to notice some of the surveys look similar to each other. That's because they're offered by the same companies. Pay attention to which ones reward and which ones don't and if you open a survey and it looks similar to ones you've had problems with getting coins then just close it and look for more.

A few things that can really help increase your chance of getting your coins: Clear cookies every time before starting survey! Either reset your VM to the clean state or set up a quick click on your browser to do this! Make sure you follow it to the end. Take screenshots of the last page or confirmation e-mail! Make sure you're at the very end, many times there is a small ""next"" or ""continue"" button that can be hard to see. Always search them out. 

Even following all this it's not a great chance you'll get credit for a survey, so be prepared to do a few. Aim for ones that have a high payout so if it works it'll make up for the time you may have spent on other ones. Avoid anything 300 coins or less. Avoid surveys you can are going to be excessively long.

Also, like for Premium Offers, be aware of what information you're submitting. Don't submit anything you don't want in the public or that can be abused.

**5.Paid (Premium) Offers**

I definitely find these to be the most likely to reward coins. They are also very easy to complete. However, there are a few drawbacks with them that you should pay attention to.

The obvious is that some cost money. I avoided those. Most of the services are not very good and aren't something you'd really want to buy. Also you're probably on the site to get stuff for free, so why spend money? I stayed far, far away from these.

The second is that you have to be aware who you're giving your personal information to. Never heard of the service? Avoid it like the plague. Sound too good to be true? Probably is. Research any place you're going to give your information too. If you see lots of negative reviews or reviews mentioning it's a scam AVOID IT.

So what does that leave? Look for TRIAL offers from large businesses. Redbox Instant, Netflix, Huluu, Blockbuster, Fedex, UPS, whatever. These are all trusted companies. Make sure you are really on one of their sites before submitting anything, don't fall for third party sites. Read the terms of the trial. How long you have to cancel it. What you get. How long you have to keep it active for to be eligible for the coin reward. These companies are willing to PAY for these referrals because people sign up for the rewards and fail to cancel them in the allotted time. Don't be one of these people. We're here to get stuff for free. Also note that this requires a valid credit card to complete these offers, something not everyone has. However if done correctly these offers can easily offer 1,000-5,000 coins for free, just for remembering to cancel a subscription!

**6.Misc**

Everything else is pretty much a crap. Basically if it sounds easy enough give it a shot, but don't be disappointed if you get nothing. 

About the actual Tremor Flash Games. Whether or not they're fun is up for debate, however you won't get many coins for playing them. Unless you REALLY like the games I wouldn't recommend this as a method for gaining coins... OR if you live in a country where you have few offers available. After considering this I've added a NEW section below for info on games.

**Appeals**

Every vendor has a method to appeal when you don't get your coins. This is why you take screen shots of every completion screen from a survey and every install from a game. I had VERY good luck using their appeals when it came to the Download installation! Make sure your screenshot has the box that pops up when Installation is complete and the icon on your desktop or start menu and there's a good chance you'll get your coins. I used a program to easily capture screenshots, but simply having paint open and hitting PrntScrn and pasting it into paint works fine too. Just be sure to name your screenshots so you know which ones go with which offers.

,indiegameswap,"Hello everyone,

I enjoy collecting cards (especially finishing the card drops so I can {unlikely} qualify for booster pack drops), however, I have slowly realized and accepted that my infinite backlog will never be dented at this rate. As a result, I have decided to add a few games I intended to play onto my trading list. 

Comment, PM, or add me on Steam if interested @ [DJSF](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041543513/)

,eu4,"Hey! It might be something that has been asked before, but I really can't find a simple answer, I watched and read like 5 trade guides but some thing are still unclear.

1. Is it worth to use a trader to boost outgoing trade from a node that only has 1 outgoing route?
2. How can I force a merchant to steer upstream? (Actually irrelevant, I moved my trade center to a better node, but I'm still curious)
3. A cute spreadsheet I found https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0At73KTzHGGdXdE9VRDYxbEVXV1NlOTdlRTI4QjU2dnc#gid=0 Says that I shouldn't be able to collect from a trade node where I don't have any provinces, however playing Korea I can collect money from Hangzhou even though I don't have a province there.

,MECoOp,"Disclaimer:  I have only ever played this build on Silver for fun, though with tweaks and the right gear, I believe it can be viable on Gold for the right people.

Ever since the Geth Trooper w/Flamer hit the scene, I've seen very little Vorcha love in the matches I've played.  So it's time to put your feral beast pants back on, and hop into the blood-drenched insanity of Mass Effect's regenerative-healing-factor'd vermin of the galaxy.

You're one pissed-off Vorcha.  Not only are you cursed with a shortened lifespan, likely reduced intelligence, prone to violent outbursts, and looked down upon by virtually every other denizen of the galaxy; the Reapers are now here to personally ruin your day.  It isn't enough to just kill them and send them packing....no....you need to send a message.  The Husks and Cannibals and Abominations must learn to fear you....at least, that's what your puny, ignorant, Vorcha mind is thinking.  Time to go medieval on their asses, and what better way than literally collecting their heads?

[Kalence](http://kalence.drupalgardens.com/me3-builder#27!3A46373!!..Q5!0.8E9G)

This is a melee build.  You run.  You decapitate.  You run some more.  Decapitate some more.  Vorcha heavy melee is a fast lunge with dual omni-blades that removes the target's head.  (fear not Abominations, as they don't explode if decapitated)  It does quite a bit of damage, on par with the Cabal, Shadow, and Slayer, but can be chained together very easily.  Mix in an infinite light-melee combo every once in a while to add insult to injury, or to wail away on a boss.  At maximum Bloodlust, even a single light melee is enough to send some mooks flying on Silver difficulty.  The breakdown:

**BLOODLUST**: Melee/Weapon/Melee |  Even without health regeneration ranks, Bloodlust will still heal you, though not as fast.  As such, having maximum Bloodlust stacks is critical for the success of this build, so the little bit of regen that you do get is maximized.  Not only will you more likely survive when you jump into the morass, but you will kill things faster as well.  Even without health bonuses, you can stand there and laugh while a Marauder empties his clip into you, while you take your time removing his Reaper intestines.  For Gold, I'd recommend swapping the final Melee box for Health Regen.

**FLAMER**: Skip it.  Geth Trooper does it better in most circumstances, unless you're trying to combo explosions by yourself.  Or use the Vorcha Sentinel.

**CARNAGE**: Radius/Incapacitate/Armor | This is your crowd-control ability.  Dragoon lunging at you or an ally?  Need to stun a few mooks so all of them aren't shooting you at once when you jump into the thick of things?  This is why I picked weapon damage over power damage in Bloodlust, because the +15% bonus with three stacks wouldn't make much of a difference since Carnage's damage is somewhat low to begin with.  I do use it, however, to offset DPS or set off explosions when fighting bosses that I don't normally want to be in melee range with.

**VORCHA RESILIENCE**: Capacity/Headshots/Weapon | Capacity is to help the cooldown on Carnage.  Otherwise, weapon damage all the way.  Unlike the Krogan, Bloodlust stacks build on any type of kill, not just melee kills.  So even though this is a melee build, don't be afraid to shoot things when you need to.

**FITNESS**: Melee/Melee/Fitness | The last rank in Fitness is to give you enough of a health boost to eat a Ravager or Scion blast if you need to.  Otherwise, you'll go down in one hit before your regeneration has a chance to do its business.

**WEAPONS**: I take the Wraith with High Velocity Barrel and Omni-Blade.  A proven workhorse, and kills things nicely.  The Wraith also deals enough damage so you can contribute to boss kills that you don't want to melee, such as Praetorians and Brutes.

**EQUIPMENT**: I usually bring Incendiary Ammo to combo off of with Carnage.  Melee damage boosts are a good idea, so you can deal as much damage as possible even without full Bloodlust stacks.  The armor bonus slot is a little weirder since you don't rely on your shields, and you're not doing much power damage.  I pick Adrenaline Boost most of the time since Vorchas run a little slower.  For the Gear slot, I currently have Juggernaut Shield V in there because I don't have anything better for melee damage in my manifest at the moment.

So that's it.  Very fun, high-risk, high-reward play style.  My main motivation for submitting this was because there are no melee-centric Vorcha builds in the BBLoB, despite the Vorcha melee being very powerful.  The squishyness of the class and lack of fast-boss-killing skills probably makes this a little difficult to run with on Gold, though I bet someone could make it work pretty well with the Venom for additional crowd-control.  I have not yet unlocked that gun to try it out myself though.

,Eve,"tl;dr Es and Whizz hired Suddenly Spaceships to teach a lesson to a guy who had used their channel to steal customers. 

We (Suddenly Spaceships) thought we wanted to share this battlereport with you guys. It is in my opinion a great example of how deep EVE's gameplay really is and it is one of the things that makes me love the game.

Enjoy!



&gt; We were hired by the drug cartel of [Es and Whizz] (https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Es_and_Whizz_%28Player_corporation%29). Our target: Sleepless Guardians, Location: J101750 (C3-Low). Cost to client: 3 billion isk. Cost to SS: (losses) nil. Loot total: tba (approx 4bill isk, 50% to SS)

&gt; **Background**

&gt; The head of Sleepless Guardians' combat booster production has been caught using the Es and Whizz sales channel without permission. He got caught on one occasion via a tip off from an existing customer and on another by using entrapment with an alt who was sold some drugs. An Es and Whizz pilot also managed to track down their WH by arranging to “pick the drugs up at somewhere convenient”

&gt; Es and Whizz generally consider booster production a difficult business and tend to respect other independent producers as long as it is reciprocated. Every few years Es and Whizz has had to seek some form of retribution on organisations actively working against them and wished to do so with Sleepless Guardians.

&gt; **Primary Goal**

&gt; Sleepless Guardians' have 4 control towers in their WH, one of which is dedicated for booster production. Our primary goal is to destroy this tower, and/or negotiate with Sleepless Guardians to discontinue booster production. Es and Whizz would consider in future supplying them with drugs for resell as part of an agreement. No matter what, we are keen to get those drug labs on our killboard as a deterrent for others. The diplomatic option is there depending on how the initial op goes and likelyhood we can pull the whole thing off.

&gt; **Stretch/Secondary Goals**

&gt; If numbers are in our favour, and depending on how they react, we would like to remove all 4 towers along with a long term campaign to see their corp dissolved. This would be a mix of playing the meta-game, long term WH griefing, and strategic use of mercs for both further WH work but also some low-level empire war decs (e.g. marmite) to help increase the pressure and make logistics difficult. In the past we have committed to over 6 month efforts to meet a similar goal where we primarily ran the day to day and called in help from mercs and friends as needed.

&gt; **How it went down:**

&gt; The weeks prior to the invasion intel was collected, scouts were seeded, fits and fleet sorted. A day was set Monday 21st July 05:30. 

&gt; **Challenges:**

&gt; * Es and Whizz has members with limited / no WH siege experience.
&gt; * The time to hit the POS would limited the number of players we could bring for first siege.
&gt; * We anticipated that they would hire their own mercs so wormhole control would be of utmost importance.

&gt; *Monday 21st July:*
 
&gt; POS seiged with Suddenly providing 90% of the logi and a significant proportion of the dps. Mizhir needs to be commended for waking up super early to be involved. APT (Suddenly Trainee Au Tz Corp) also made their first formal op appearance. Tower was bubbled. All incoming wormholes bubbled and camped 24/24. The wormhole was decorated with named containers - and psychological and physical warfare began. Ingkala/Khanadore/Cypr3ss Deteis FCing the combined fleet.

&gt; A few small kills were had:

&gt; *Late Tuesday 22nd July/ Wednesday 32rd July*

&gt; The POS comes down to no resistance, ty to Demetri Slavic and Buhhdust Princess for Fcing:

,leagueoflegends,"This has probably been proposed before but what the hell.  If riot allowed a team to sacrifice a percent of their IP to a role they need (i.e support) this can create real incentives to actually play said role.

From what i understand every player on the same team earns the same IP not including boosts and win bonuses.  With my stupid idea a team captain can give an extra 16% (arbitrary number) IP bonus to a role they need but that would mean the four teamates would have to each sacrifice 4% of their normal IP.  For clarity:

Hypothetically, Lets say each player would have earned 100IP, so collectively the team would earn 500IP

but let's say the team was willing to give up 16% of their IP for a support so we have  4 players earning 96 IP while 1 is earning 116; yet the team would still  only earn 500IP

Also I think this idea can work well with the demand board they created, the demand board can show what roles are needed and the prices

,Tremorgames,"**[TremorGames](http://www.tremorgames.com/?ref=726243) Tips and Trick**

**Here's the link. Check it out if you're interested.**

* **[http://www.tremorgames.com/](http://www.tremorgames.com/?ref=726243)**

**Note: I will place links at the very bottom and (Optional)recommended software for your protection.**

So, a few things for people who might be interested.

* It's not a giveaway. You do have to try to earn coins, and if you want the higher priced titles you will have to put into some time. Just interested in a small indie game? You can probably get it in minutes. However as you need more and more coins you complete all the easy offers and start to have to do some of the harder ones.

* Coins don't always credit correctly. Don't go into it expecting everything to work right. There are issues. There are a few ways to help your odds and I'll go into those, but there will be times you don't get the coins you deserve so be prepared for that. Just keep going towards your goal and you'll get there.

* Be careful which sites you get directed to to complete offers. Tremor Games itself is 100% safe, however the sites they link to may not always be. I'll go over some measures for this below, but just know it's not a great plan to go in there and start clicking on things.

* I found it best to set a goal. Find a something you like in their selection you want and then work towards it. For me, I wanted games and trading cards. It took only 2 days to get over $100 worth of items and I still have about 10,000+ coins that I'm saving up. 

**Keeping your computer safe.**

So you don't want to just randomly click around on the site on any old web browser. There ARE links that will lead you to downloads that contain malware and dodgy websites. The problem is many of those links are some of the easiest offers.

First thing to do is to create a safe browsing environment. There's two ways of doing this, either using a Virtual Machine setup or Sandboxie. 

* 1. Using a Virtual Machine is my preferred method, because you can set everything up how you want it save the state of the machine and then easily reset to that state. To do this you'll need a few things.

* Virtual Machine. Download Link **[VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org)**
* OS installation files. Either a DVD, .iso, or whatever. **[Windows 7 recommended](http://kickass.to/windows-7-sp1-ultimate-32-bit-t9069552.html)**
* Ability to install a OS, set up the web browser you want to use, and otherwise get the new OS ready to use.

After doing those things you want to set up the OS to the most optimum environment for using the site. A few things that I'll go into more detail with below will be an easy system to take screenshots. Having that already set up in the VM will save you time when you reset the state. Reseting the state will quickly become neccesary when you start doing downloads, but I'll talk about that more below.

* 2. Sandboxie is also good. Here is the download link **[Sandboxie](http://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?AllVersions)** . It creates it's own virtual environment that it uses on the fly and that makes it much easier to use. No complicated installation of an OS or anything like that. Simply install Sandboxie and you're ready to click ""Run Sandboxed Browser"" by right clicking on your browser icon which will then create a virtual enviroment, you can tell which windows are part of that enviroment because they will have a yellow border when highlighted. If a window doesn't have this you did something wrong and are running it live on your computer, which you don't want. Sandboxie is also very easy to reset by simply clicking the icon in the notification tray and selecting to delete all the files in the Sandbox.

About Clearing Cookies: It's important to do this regularly. Especially with Download and Survey offers. There are Cookies some sites can leave that will conflict with offers. There are Cookies sites can leave that can redirect your gains to other sites for their own profit. There are sites that will leave the same cookie as another site and if it has the older time stamp won't credit correctly. There's a ton of reasons and I'm sure I'm missing some or incorrect about some I've stated but I will say I gained way more credit when I started clearing my cookies more often. Set up a button or quick way to do this to be more efficient. 

One other thing, which is completely not mandatory but I recommend. Create a Facebook and e-mail just for use with Tremor Games. Many offers require a valid e-mail address or activity on Facebook for you to get the reward. I don't want spam in my regular e-mail box and don't prefer to have sites posting random comments on my Facebook page to annoy my friends and make me look like a trash bag. Once again this is optional, but highly recommended.

**Which offers to complete?**

Okay. Once on the TremorGames offers page you'll notice a few things. First at the top the offers are broken down into vendors. These are the people who pay Tremor Games for the things you're doing that allows them to offer you games. There's quite a few to choose from. I won't go into which ones I think are better and which ones worse, because from my reading there are people out there who had the exact opposite preferences from me. Try them all and if you feel you're having better luck with one than another stick with it! 

Instead I'll focus on types of offers and which ones I prefer. Below I'll go over a few in more depth about how to get the best out of them. Here I'll just list them from the ones I think are most reliable and likely to reward coins to least.

1. Tasks - Get coins for completing simple tasks.
2. Videos - Get coins for watching a video.
3. Downloads - Get coins for downloading and installing certain software.
4. Surveys - Offers that reward you for taking surveys or submitting other information.
5. Paid/Premium Offers - Basically an offer that rewards you coins for buying something. There are times when you must outright buy something other times when you must sign up for a trial that will charge you if not canceled.
6. Miscelaneous - I'm sure there are others that don't fit in the above categories, but that should cover 99% of them. I'll also throw playing games in here.

**1.Tasks**

There is one vendor that offers tasks as opposed to the standard offers from the other vendors. When you click on this vendor you will see a list of tasks that they currently have and the reward for completing them. They vary greatly in their payout and time investment. I found the best one to the task that's commonly offered to write questions about a keyword. It's pretty easy you're given the guidelines then words and asked to write questions about them. So your words might be ""Timex Watches"" and you can write a simple question like ""Where are some places you can buy Timex Watches?"" It's super easy and as long as you follow the guidelines you'll be eligible for a bonus payout once the question is reviewed! 

The tasks are a good steady way to earn coins. They always pay out and aren't terribly hard.

Also be aware that you should flow the guidelines and try to submit quality work. Whatever you entered is reviewed and not only will you lose your chance at bonus coins it's actually possible for you to receive less tasks offers from them if your accuracy is low enough. 

**2.Videos**

These are the most basic activities you can do and almost always reward coins. You simply click on a video and watch it. Sometimes you're also required to ""Like"" the service on Facebook or allow it to post about how you liked the video, which is why I recommended the throw away Facebook account. 

The downside to videos is that there aren't a ton of them and they don't offer a large number of coins per view. I mainly viewed them as minor boosts or a quick way to make up a small number of coins to reach a goal. I'd usually do them all every time I visited a site. It's usually possible to view multiple videos at one time as long as they're from the same vendor which should speed things up quite a bit.

**3.Downloads***

Yikes! Here's where you'll really need that computer protection. These will guarantee fuck you up if you don't have any. Just be warned. You download software(usually full of malware) and install it. Once again you'll want to clear cookies before doing this for sure. These are some of the sketchiest offers and once again don't expect to receive credit every time. Same thing applies about vendors, you'll notice some installers look the same. Pay attention to which ones work for you and which ones don't. Stick to the ones that do. Always screenshot the completed installation box along with the icon on your desktop or start menu. You'll need to reset the Sandbox or VM after just a few of these because performance will become poor. 

I found Downloads only worth doing if you were willing to sit there and run through a bunch of them. They don't take much time and have a good coin reward, but the percentage of them rewarding was pretty low. This can really be helped by submitting the screenshots, which we'll go over below. However it's still not a great chance any one offer will reward so be prepared to do a bunch!

**4.Surveys**

Okay, here's where things start getting sketchy. Surveys are hit or miss on whether or not they reward you, and some can be VERY long. After you get going you'll start to notice some of the surveys look similar to each other. That's because they're offered by the same companies. Pay attention to which ones reward and which ones don't and if you open a survey and it looks similar to ones you've had problems with getting coins then just close it and look for more.

A few things that can really help increase your chance of getting your coins: Clear cookies every time before starting survey! Either reset your VM to the clean state or set up a quick click on your browser to do this! Make sure you follow it to the end. Take screenshots of the last page or confirmation e-mail! Make sure you're at the very end, many times there is a small ""next"" or ""continue"" button that can be hard to see. Always search them out. 

Even following all this it's not a great chance you'll get credit for a survey, so be prepared to do a few. Aim for ones that have a high payout so if it works it'll make up for the time you may have spent on other ones. Avoid anything 300 coins or less. Avoid surveys you can are going to be excessively long.

Also, like for Premium Offers, be aware of what information you're submitting. Don't submit anything you don't want in the public or that can be abused.

**5.Paid (Premium) Offers**

I definitely find these to be the most likely to reward coins. They are also very easy to complete. However, there are a few drawbacks with them that you should pay attention to.

The obvious is that some cost money. I avoided those. Most of the services are not very good and aren't something you'd really want to buy. Also you're probably on the site to get stuff for free, so why spend money? I stayed far, far away from these.

The second is that you have to be aware who you're giving your personal information to. Never heard of the service? Avoid it like the plague. Sound too good to be true? Probably is. Research any place you're going to give your information too. If you see lots of negative reviews or reviews mentioning it's a scam AVOID IT.

So what does that leave? Look for TRIAL offers from large businesses. Redbox Instant, Netflix, Huluu, Blockbuster, Fedex, UPS, whatever. These are all trusted companies. Make sure you are really on one of their sites before submitting anything, don't fall for third party sites. Read the terms of the trial. How long you have to cancel it. What you get. How long you have to keep it active for to be eligible for the coin reward. These companies are willing to PAY for these referrals because people sign up for the rewards and fail to cancel them in the allotted time. Don't be one of these people. We're here to get stuff for free. Also note that this requires a valid credit card to complete these offers, something not everyone has. However if done correctly these offers can easily offer 1,000-5,000 coins for free, just for remembering to cancel a subscription!

**6.Misc**

Everything else is pretty much a crap. Basically if it sounds easy enough give it a shot, but don't be disappointed if you get nothing. 

About the actual Tremor Flash Games. Whether or not they're fun is up for debate, however you won't get many coins for playing them. Unless you REALLY like the games I wouldn't recommend this as a method for gaining coins... OR if you live in a country where you have few offers available. After considering this I've added a NEW section below for info on games.

**Appeals**

Every vendor has a method to appeal when you don't get your coins. This is why you take screen shots of every completion screen from a survey and every install from a game. I had VERY good luck using their appeals when it came to the Download installation! Make sure your screenshot has the box that pops up when Installation is complete and the icon on your desktop or start menu and there's a good chance you'll get your coins. I used a program to easily capture screenshots, but simply having paint open and hitting PrntScrn and pasting it into paint works fine too. Just be sure to name your screenshots so you know which ones go with which offers.

,indiegameswap,"Hello everyone,

I enjoy collecting cards (especially finishing the card drops so I can {unlikely} qualify for booster pack drops), however, I have slowly realized and accepted that my infinite backlog will never be dented at this rate. As a result, I have decided to add a few games I intended to play onto my trading list.

&gt;##**PS! Working PROGRESS!! Lots of information are placeholders atm.**  

So I tried playing with a NA team a while back and it was really fun, but it didn't really work with the timezone I have because I'm from Europe. So I stopped playing competative DG completely!  
  
But lately I've seen alot more posts about EU teams looking for players or vice versa, so I thought why not try boost that spark with a megathread? We can try collect as much information as possible and post it here for the ""upcoming"" EU scene.  
  
Ohhh and EU servers is getting closer and closer to release! Even more hype there for the EU scene!

  
#**Information:**
+ Active teams/rosters
+ Recruitement
+ Players looking for teams (can be done in comment - users manage their own post)  
Could post it in the OP
+ Prefered scrim times for each team
+ ""Future tournament section''?  
  
**I know this might be a long shot, but I just wan't to try get something started, it won't hurt!**

,Ohio,"**Completely Legalize Marijuana Consumption and Sales**

* Colorado has reaped many millions in taxes from cultivation, production, and the sale of Marijuana. 

* Look very carefully how many major metropolitan cities are within 200 miles of Ohio. 

* Look how many major coast to coast highways run through our state.    

* Look who is a top 5 agriculture producer and number one in nursery's of the world, we have a lot of potential. 

* It would create tourism, reignite farming, and generally boost our tax base and tax dollars to work with. 

* Would be looking at 60+ million in collected taxes in the first year. Much higher the 2nd and 3r years. 

**Legalize Online Poker For State Residents**

* Must have Ohio Divers License, Proof of Residency for at least 6 months, and proof of residency. 

* Have the companies that were banned by the Feds run 3-4 Separate companies so there is fair competition. 

* Charge 5% of each pot, you can gain upwards of 100$ million in one year. 

**Change the Law About Smoking In Bars**  

* ~~If the sales are more than 60% alcohol vs food, people are there to get fucked up and smoking outside in the winter time sucks. At least allow the restaurant/bar to choose. Let people go to which ones they like best. And ventilation should matter in this.~~ 

* ~~This would allow outlying counties to allow pot bars that also serve alcohol, and be allowed to smoke cigs and cigars. There should be places for that and our border towns took a huge hit when we outlawed smoking in bars and night clubs. Make this place fun to come to. This is where the action will be, locally.~~ 


**Now what we do with that tax money is very important**

* Build up our infrastructure- We have many roads and bridges in disrepair and well under code, that has to be fixed first. If you want growth as a state we must fix that first. Build fiber networks or get people like Google to come and build them.  

* Free Basic health Care- Minor things, like the FLU, sprains, basic birth control, and most non-surgical procedures. Sore throats and even things like Bronchitis can be evaluated by a nurse rather than having to waste a doctors time. Dentistry is important and maybe some should go to that as well. 

* A Free Safe Program where if you buy a safe of a certain quality you can get most of it back on your taxes. This would deter theft as things are being secured and many guns would be much harder to get to in the heat of the moment or during away from home burglaries. It would also stimulate a mostly American dominated safe market. I stole this idea from the Swiss. 

*  Expand the State Online Education Courses. Especially for kids that are sick and home schooled. I think the internet is a medium that can get the best teachers to the most students, the most effectively. 

* Create a NSA blocking program that citizens of this State can use to encrypt our online information with the same protections of the USPS. In this day and age, e-mail should be considered to be like actual mail. It should be protected under the 4th Amendment. 


Go ahead and tell me how crazy I am, but I think this is better than what anyone else is talking about. I talk about problems and solutions. If you think you got something better, please help me along here. 

* Edited for spelling and grammar. I may have to edit it again.

,audiophile,"So, I just wanted to rant a bit about Micca and how happy I am with the company, and how basically getting a nice speaker setup totally changed my outlook on audio &amp; appreciation of music. It's a bit long, but if you're considering buying these, then maybe this will help you decide.

Almost a year ago I finally got a turntable, as I'd been wanting one for ages... I have a Pyle Pro that I got on Amazon for like 70 bucks, while retail was like 150... it had good reviews and it was cheap so I went for it- was not disappointed, and it still works great. But listening to records on shitty old Sanyo speakers from an old boombox/stereo system started to suck fairly quickly.

I came across this subreddit looking for speakers that I should get... I read through some posts and found the /r/audiophile recommendation of the Micca/Muse combo. I figured 150 bucks wasn't bad to get an amp and a set of speakers, but what I didn't know was that they would be so good! I just assumed the speakers would be *alright*, and something to have so I can listen to my turntable until I could get better ones. But damn, was I pleasantly surprised! They sound awesome, and I couldn't believe they were of such quality for only 80 bucks. I initially didn't know much about the technical aspects of audio- I've always loved music, but never really had any sort of hi-fi setup. My dad used to have a pretty sweet hi-fi system and we would always listen to vinyl on it, and this is where the desire for a turntable began. But, now that I have good speakers and have been working with them, I've gained a new appreciation for audio &amp; systems in general. Now I totally love all the technical aspects of sound and sound systems.

About a month ago I got the center speaker that Micca came out with recently.. and THIS was definitely one of the best purchases I've made in a long time. Now, with the bookshelf speakers and the center speaker, music sounds absolutely amazing! I have a huge 10"" Velodyne subwoofer that I got off craigslist for cheap, but it's huge and I can't use it at home because it's just too damn loud. I needed something smaller that could produce some bass but wasn't too overwhelming.. I'd been looking for subwoofers, but decided that the Micca center speaker would be a good addition and would round out the sound for my meager setup. I was expecting the center speaker to just give me more dynamics and round the sound out. But upon setting it up, I realized that, once again, Micca had surpassed my expectations. The center speaker is absolutely awesome, and I'm really satisfied with it! It was only 70 bucks on Amazon, so it didn't break the bank. But damn, the trio of Micca speakers really sound great! 

I listen to a lot of drum and bass (among other things), and enjoy collecting 12"" singles... one of my favorite things about vinyl is its prevalence in electronic music culture (not the new mainstream EDM shit). I absolutely love how crisp the sound is on the Micca setup. The center speaker puts out some very clear sounding bass, and provides an excellent warmth and boost to the overall sound of the setup. I honestly would recommend the center speaker to anyone who has the Micca bookshelf speakers, because it just ""completes"" the setup. The addition of the center speaker made a huge improvement over the quality of sound. The bass sounds very clear, packs a punch, and is deep &amp; warm... for electronic music, that's important. The drums come through very punchy and the lows are just so clean. The mids and highs are well rounded, and everything sounds very crisp. Hearing songs I've heard multiple times before on these speakers made me feel like I was hearing them again for the first time. Music sounds fresh to me, and I've gained a deeper, truer appreciation for music now that I can hear all the details and nuances of the songs I'm listening to. I never realized how important it was to have GOOD sound and how amazing music can really sound. This applies for not just electronic music, as I have classic rock, hardcore, and death metal albums as well, and they all sound phenomenal. The warmth of vinyl is presented in a true, clear manner through the Micca's, and every time I listen to my records on them I fall in love more and more with vinyl.

I just felt like sharing my thoughts on the Micca's- prior to owning them, I was just listening to music on headphones- I have good headphones, but having good speakers is a whole different ballpark. The Micca setup is just killer, and the center speaker is a must-buy in my opinion if you already own the bookshelf speakers. 

I have to thank r/audiophile, because without this subreddit, I would probably have spent too much money on speakers that I don't even love. I'm just so happy with Micca and I plan on keeping these for a long time- at first, they were going to be speakers that I would use until I could afford better ones, but with the quality of these, I don't think that is necessary! What I do wonder, though, is why I've (and probably many others, until they come to this subreddit) never heard of Micca before, and why they aren't more popular. I also wonder how the speakers can be so cheap, but sound so damn good. I know they're not top of the line or the highest quality, but they sound awesome to my ears- they sound like they should cost 200 or 300 dollars! Is Micca just a small, independent company? I'm curious as to how they became the recommended ""budget"" speakers on this subreddit, and how these hidden gems came to the attention of the audiophiles here.

Once again sorry about the length, but just figured I would discuss &amp; give praise where praise is due :)",,False,,0,,Thoughts and praise on Micca speakers... just a long rant of satisfaction!,,,,,,0.0,,,False,t3_2c3mqp,False,,,,,8.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},,,8,,,,self,1406684754,,,,,,True,,1406687757.0,,,,,,self.audiophile,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,t5_2qmiy,,,,,2c3mqp,,,chasingshadows,,17,,,,,,,/r/audiophile/comments/2c3mqp/thoughts_and_praise_on_micca_speakers_just_a_long/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/2c3mqp/thoughts_and_praise_on_micca_speakers_just_a_long/,,1406684157.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441244486.0,,,
,HFY,"Heres a link to 'Cry Havoc 3'
http://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/2c1cor/cry_havoc_3/

"".....Now continuing on.Our own combat prowess is considered the best amongst the council members. That is until now ""

The Vorus Herd master Vinco gestured grandly to the hologram of terra in front of his brigade of novice herd members and the supposed high herd members in the front seats, positions of great honor as is the right of their position in the herd hierarchy. 

 ""I want to be very honest with you. we the, supposed, best in all of this spiral arm in the martial practice of war have lost this accolade!""

Cries of 'shame' and 'heresy' were thrown at him like stones from all present ,even the lowly heard novices.

 Incredulous at their inability to listen HM Vinco belows his display bladders which protrude down his spine. Such a garish display of Vorus masculine power in front of such prominent herd members silenced the auditorium instantly. 

""we need to face realities. We are losing to the heretical human race in a conflict we started through our own arrogant oversight and we cannot, i repeat cannot afford to lose.""

He had their undivided attention now and needed to capitalize on it for full effect.

""These Humans ,as they call themselves, are an abomination of evolution as they consume the flesh of other sentient beings to power their own bodies. Whilst we may see this as abhorrent they do not understand our primary reason for making war upon them.""

Incredulous shouting follows HM Vinco's claim.

""Impossible, how can a sentient race of sound mind and body murder and consume the flesh of another sentient and believe it to be right? is the whole race mad?"" screamed the Herd Leader of Health in a frightened bleat.

""We simply do not know most gracious leader...not enough research was undertaken into their culture to ascertain their reasoning before a preemptive  show of force was used to destroy their largest colony and inadvertently start the war...""

He straightens up.

""We have, however attained a vast volume of data on their military and biology. This was gained through the deaths of thousands of our fellow herd members. If the herd leaders will permit i shall proceed with the briefing to my novices to better equip them to combat this abomination?"" 

HM Vinco makes an over the top placating gesture to the assembled herd leaders.

""You may.... proceed"" Herd leader health growled in response to the HM's upstart manner.

"" As you wish most merciful herd leader. Ok Novices listen up this is your enemy!""

The hologram suddenly flashes and an image of an adult male human is rendered at full size and color for the auditorium to gawp at.

""standing around 2 meters tall this short bipedal primate is your foe. Do not let its soft pink appearance fool you. Its twice as strong bollock naked than you are in full rig and twice as mean. It has also managed to obtain a fifth of the glorious holy Vorus empire by force in five years""

A collective gasp escaped the crowd. Even,the HM is pleased to see, the senior herd leaders. If he can get the danger through to them maybe he can save lives and maybe, just maybe the empire from total anarchy.

""We think this amazing strength comes from the hellhole of a planet they evolved on which has a standard gravity 3 times stronger than most alliance planets. This along with the ultra violent and poisonous/ venomous flora and fauna is a recipe for one mean son of a bitch where evolution is concerned. They are however incredibly slow due to bipedal movement much like other primates. we can easily outrun them on the battlefield giving us an advantage in unit placement and maneuverability where CQB is concerned.""

A look of hope comes across the novices snouts. it was dashed with the HM's next statement.

""Do not let this give you a false sense of security. Our combat data shows that during a tactical..no ill be straight with you, during a full withdrawal with no cover you may out pace them but you will never out run them as the human is a 'pursuit predator' meaning they never get tired and will never stop hunting until you and your herd mates are dead. Let me repeat that dead. There have been no recorded captures of our troops by human forces...only executions after our herd mates simply collapsed of exhaustion pleading for their lives.""

The audience seemed visibly shaken. Time for a moral boost the HM thought.

""Despite physical advantages brought upon by divergent evolution we do however still hold a significant advantage in the vacuum theater. To date we have not lost a single ship of the imperial navy in engagements with human craft. Our current lists show 20,000 human vessels damaged, destroyed or lost to zero Vorus losses. Ordinance and sheer armoured bulk have taken the day so far.Our lowliest sanctuary class can blow their heaviest 'dreadnought' to dust.""

Cries of joy spread around the auditorium with nodds of approval from the senior herd leaders. HM Vinco waits for it to die down. Waits for the million credit question.

 It takes form in the raised forelimb of a first cycle novice.
""Yes you what is your question?"" the hm asks the trembling novice. 

""well great herd master...why are we not winning if our fleets are so victorious"" he whispers.

""that, my herdsmen, is the question i wanted to hear!"" HM Vinco cries.

HM Vinco acknowledges the novice before continuing.

"" Our top shepherd class stealth ships have indicated massive increases in human ship building industry both planet and space side. At current levels the human navy needs a 100 to 10 advantage to even damage one ship, We produce ten ships a cycle....at current observed production rates the humans will reach a ten thousand ship per cycle output in three of their solar years.""

The herd leader of industry shoots to his feet ""That is impossible! we have the grandest ship yards in the known galaxy! i refuse to listen to this insult any longer. you simply seek to mock you betters you upstart!""

Containing his rage between his thumb and forefingers being tightly pressed to bridge of his nasal cavity the HM responds coolly ""believe what you wish great one...these are the facts...i still haven't told you how we are losing so much ground to the heretics.""

As the herd leader of industry storms out HM Vinco continues unfazed.

"" We previously thought that the humans were using small craft to breach atmosphere then somehow remotely destroy any craft in orbit. Due to the zero survivors coming from these worlds our top military strategists theorized this must be how they are slipping by our defenses. Thankfully the humans have made one major fuck up...the let a ship escape""

The novices lean in in anticipation.

""The video feed from the ship 'protector' which survived two such engagements has gathered video evidence to enable us to understand the pure lunacy that the human emotion of revenge can drive sentients to. ""

He looks at the floor taking a somber tone.

""Please remember that all crew were found dead as battle damage had breached the radiation sinc of the ship. They paid with their lives for this information which might just save yours.""

The display screen on the far wall sparks into life filling the dark auditorium with the brilliance of space. It was displaying what looked like a generic meteor shower over a garden planet.

""Here we see the humans primary mode of transport to the battle site""

""Primary mode of transport leader? there's nothing their on scanners, infrared..no radiation. is it far in the distance?"" one novice asks confused.

""No its right infront of you...screen enhance quadrant a1-10...focus....there!""

The HM has zoomed on the meteor shower. The students are unimpressed.

""Its still just nothing leader"" a bored novice announces with a nervous giggle.

""Its not nothing novice be patient...there did you see that!!""

Suddenly the Meteor explodes. Not disintegrates through friction but outright explodes. Every initiate knows Meteors do not just explode before even touching the atmosphere. A gasp as the viewer zooms on a number of small craft now jettisoning from the exposed interior of the meteor.

""That's it novices. The humans have been bolting together asteroids, filling the centers with orbit to planet landers and falling onto our installations.""

The disbelief is tangible. some even outright deny its plausibility, forgetting their station for a moment. 

 ""They have been releasing these on the edge of our systems packed with hundreds of thousands of vicious vengeful killing machines and using a slingshot off the nearest planetary bodies to crash into our inhabited worlds. Just before atmospheric entry explosive bolts fire within the asteroids creating debris which their guided landers fall with and our sensors pick up as space debris....""

The novices are in awe.

""its insanely brilliant"" 

the HM states with a pitiful sigh.

""its also insanely effective as they ave been turning our own MAC emplacements against our own fleets without having to engage a single ship with one of their own and we thought they were uploading a super virus into the mainframe to initiate a reactor overload.""

He sheds a single solitary tear.

""we were wrong...we are losing and i hope you appreciate the sacrifice made by those on the 'protector'. I know i do...my wife and kids were on it.""

,RedditForceClan,"We have a lot of people just coming up to TH9 or will be soon, so I thought it would be helpful to have a topic on some key things (IMO) to do when you are waiting for your TH9 upgrade to finish, and when you get to TH9.  

I’ve told a few people in chat what I did and in what order, etc., so I thought it would be good to post it here.



TH9 upgrading:

- Fill your storages (gold/elix)

- Fill your DE storage as much as possible (my goal was 62,500 so that I could immediately get Archer Queen to 2).

- Fill your collectors (begin roughly 2 days before the upgrade finishes)…You just have to remember to not collect each time you log on, which is a hard habit to break
- Keep building up loot in your clan castle, there is some nice additional storage there that will come in handy

- Make a plan (a spreadsheet in my case) so that all of your builders will be freed up around the time TH9 upgrade is complete…There is a lot to do.

When the upgrade is complete (I have 5 builders, so this may need to be tweaked a little for those with less)

- Both Xbows (other than establishing the new defenses at a low level just to fill your new base, this and the CC were the main gold purchases ASAP)

- Archer tower, tesla, wizard tower, air defense, walls (my stance was just to get these on the map and upgrade them later or if I was short on the loot for bigger upgrades)

- Spell Factory (4 spells is VERY useful, especially in wars and pushing to Masters, if you are going to do that).
- Laboratory (can’t research without this built…I gemmed the rest of this build as soon as I had enough elixir built back up for lvl 6 balloons).  
- Clan Castle (a very important structure both on defense and offense…do it.)
- Camps x4 (220 capacity is very nice..I staggered these and started one every couple days)
- Archer Queen to level 5 (The ability is a lifesaver if you are barching for 50%...Drop her, activate ability, get out of there and still have her available for the next raid)
- Dark Elixir drills to 6 (4,800 DE per day once you get both to 6…I’m almost there myself, and it is a process, but it will pay off, make it a priority). 
- Witches (I’m finding witches to be very powerful troops when used correctly…Not a top priority, but one to keep in mind ASAP if you are interested in leveling fools)


Troop upgrade priority (in no particular order):

- Balloons to 6 (big boost, great for wars/farming/pushing)
- Archers to 6 (if you are a barcher, make your life easier)
- Giants to 6 (these guys are tanks)
- Barbarians to 6 (again, barching gets easier)

Also don't forget your golems, pekkas, and witches for wars :)



Like I said, this is what I did, and I wouldn’t change a thing.  Yeah, my new defensive structures are pretty low level right now, but that is now becoming my focus and I’ll be where I want to be on defense pretty fast.  


I kind of threw this together pretty fast, so if I missed anything or if you have anything to add please add below.  This is the way I did it and found to be the most useful use of resources/builders, but there is no right way.

,Arenan,"###**Nevermind the grammar for now - Working PROGRESS!! Lots of information is placeholders atm.**  

So I tried playing with a NA team a while back and it was really fun, but it didn't really work with the timezone I have because I'm from Europe. So I stopped playing competative DG completely!  
  
But lately I've seen alot more posts about EU teams looking for players or vice versa, so I thought why not try boost that spark with a megathread? We can try collect as much information as possible and post it here for the ""upcoming"" EU scene.  
#**Information:**
+ Active teams/rosters
+ Recruitement
+ Players looking for teams (can be done in comment - users manage their own post)
+ Prefered scrim times for each team
+ ""Future tournament section''?  
  
**I know this might be a long shot, but I just wan't to try get something started, it won't hurt!**

Before you go and say this is the wrong sub-reddit - I am not asking about mapping questions, i am asking about CS:GO maps in general. The user database here is larger, thus i can get more feedback on my projects. This IS related to CS:GO.
----

Hello! I'm a relatively new map maker. You might remember me from my crappy little teasers such as.. de_russka port, de_oasis, de_nuke remake and so on back and forth.
I come down to be very nit-picky and specific when it comes to how players accept new maps and how maps accept new players, and i find it important for the experience to be enjoyable. Here's a few questions to all of you dear CS:GO pros/players/noobs.

1. When players talk about ""new"" maps, they wan't to see something ""new"". If so, could you point out specifically what new mechanics/dynamics would you like to see in maps besides boost spots, mid control ETC? Maybe buttons to turn off lights? Anything.

2. Do you find new maps less attractive gameplay wise than the old 1.6/Source maps? Do you think the map should stand a test of time to become acceptable?

3. What feature do you think makes the new CS:GO maps different from 1.6/Source maps gameplay wise?

4. What does CS:GO maps lack gameplay wise in comparison to 1.6/Source?

5. Do you think that mid makes the map more acceptable to new players, or not?

6. What do you think would make a new maps different from each other more?

I will be very thankful for any feedback, i do not necessarily need the answers to ALL of these questions, but i would like some/any feedback to collect data and make new maps more enjoyable. Thank you!

Nothing like taking advantage of the 5x +egg event and Monday x1.5 A fresh three sets of +36 monsters ready to be fed. In case you're wondering about my box space, I threw 30 stones just so I can be sure I can hold all the fire EXP fodder I was going to collect. Lots of fusing was done, feeding every to the Fire Pengdras, even other Fire Pengdras. Turning that ~3k EXP into 9k a pop is a pretty sweet deal. Then we get to the evolved Pengdras that I hoarded up until now. I lost track of how many Fire Pendras I fed, but I accumulated at least ~1.5m worth of EXP from them alone. Now we get to the good part.


http://imgur.com/Mw7jMY2


Doing the math, I have here a fantastic 3.825m EXP just waiting to be devoured. I can essentially level cap any single one of my fire monsters right here and now. I could even wait until later in case I roll another Ronia or nab myself a Belial.


Everything below is just why I find Blazing Wings to be so great for farming instead of Door of Light and Shadow. 


tl;dr is Blazing Wings during 5x Mondays kills 4 birds with one stone: Tons of fire EXP, still reasonable +eggs, gold efficient feeding, and painlessly fast/easy. You can ignore everything below if you don't feel like reading the ramblings of a person who farmed for ~6-8 hours in total today.


**EXP Efficiency**


Onto some thoughts about this Blazing Wings since this is my 2nd time I super grinded here. I believe that while Blazing Wings has a worse average +egg rate than Forbidden Tower 4, the sheer fire EXP there is not to be underestimated, especially when you're willing to use stones the whole day. All you really need is to hoard a good 20-30 Dragon Plants so you're always ready to evolve any Fire Pendras the moment you get Ruby Dragons. I'm also too lazy to go to Challenge Mode every time I want to run the place, and have to sort through all the light and dark fodder that'll quickly get expensive to feed to my monsters.


Doing some math here. Fire Pengdras only cost ~300-500 coins to max out since they drop as level 1 so they only need 10 coins per monster fed to it. It takes 5 Chimeras, or 4 Fire Goblins, or 3 other Fire Pengdras. They are prime targets for feeding all the fire fodder since they are so cheap to feed, and roughly triple the payoff since as I mentioned earlier. Feeding 5 max Fire Pengdras to monsters nets you 45k EXP for ~10k-30k gold, far better deal than the EXP fodder from Door of Light and Shadow.  It gets even more efficient if you nab some Ruby Dragons so it turns 9k fodder EXP into 45k fodder EXP as Ruby Pengdras. Feeding 225k EXP for ~10k-30k coins? Yes please! 


Blazing Wings monsters pretty much synergize with each other really well. Fire Pengdras can be fed the non +egg Chimera/Goblin fodder to pay off good fire EXP, and Ruby Dragons help evolve the Fire Pengdras to pay off even better. The only outside resource you'll need are Dragon Plants, and those are super easy to obtain in bulk.


Door of Light and Shadow don't have Pengdras to feed all the excess fodder, so you're more likely better off selling or massively feeding fodder to each other. That can feel pretty EXP inefficient since the costs literally triple to ~300 gold per monster fed to it (900-1500 coins for 3-5 monsters respectively), and doesn't payoff as well as leveling a Pengdra. You'll also encounter Dub-lits that'll do nothing for you at the immediate moment except to be sold or fed as well, unless you somehow have loads of monsters to evolve. You can encounter Metal Dragons, but I wouldn't hold my breath on them dropping or appearing often enough. Getting only ~3k-4k EXP per monster really sucks in comparison.


As much as I'd like to figure out the actual math for exact efficiency, it's way too late at night to try, nor do I feel like doing it.


**Gold**


Gold is pretty great. Even discounting all the gold I spent capping Pengdras and feeding all those Pengdras to my level 30-50+ fire monsters, I still made ~2m gold today. I'd guess if I ran Door of Light and Shadow nonstop instead and feed light/dark EXP to my light/dark monsters, I'd probably have earned ~1/2 of that or even less. All that extra gold used in feeding level 3 Door of Light and Shadow fodder would've added up.



**Ease to run**


Don't forget how blazingly fast (buh dum tsh) it is to run the place for little effort. I ran at least a level 85 Uevo Echidna (rough minimum level to oneshot everything with her Leader Skill. I also dragged along 4 Ogres, at least 2 Ice Samurai Ogres and all fully awakened with Skill Boosts. I match one set of orbs per floor, stall a turn at the boss to get Freeze Strike up, and press both Samurai Ogres to destroy the bosses. Takes ~a minute and a half to clear the place each time from entering the dungeon to exiting. Heck, it's SO easy you can enter the dungeon without a friend's leader because you'll still wipe the floor with Echidna and your ogres and can't die as long as you have a mere ~3.4k HP to take one turn of hits from the Phoenixes. Echidna is also very easy to obtain; same for the ogres.


Door of Light and Shadow takes me ~2-3 minutes to go from assembling the team each time, and have to stall a 3-4 turns to get everyone's actives up. Also at the end I gotta spend ~5 seconds to make at least 2 rows of Fire Orbs to oneshot the boss. When farming repeatedly the whole day, those couple extra minutes can really add up. You also need to get your own Ronia/Rodin, which not everyone can hopefully get.


It also requires more time and attention to do. Compare to Blazing Wings, where I can multitask and still rake in the eggs effortlessly. Watching Youtube videos while farming +eggs, gold, and fire EXP? A win-win in my book.


**Final words**


Anyways enough rambling. Once again, I find Blazing Wings amazing during 5x events not because of just the sheer speed clearing the place, but no matter what you do there, everything you get from there is a win-win as long as you have fire monsters to level. It also requires 0 REM only monsters to farm the place super fast.",,False,,0,,"After a day of lengthy stoning and grinding, the results.

“That shit‘ll get yer killed, Hunter.” 
The room was quiet, the air dusty and thick. A ceiling fan spun a slight breeze overhead, only serving to shunt the heat and smoke around. The metal walls were half rusted, bearing the scrapes and nicks of repeated use, while the fibre table creaked at the slightest provocation, and over it all hung the cloying stink of a smoke-stick. A mubaran, shining a sickly yellow sheen and hulking in his selected corner, stared at the incumbent smoker. 

“Bad for yer health like.” He flared his air-tube, sucking in the embers with a deep huff. 
The figure at the table blinked slowly in response, and continued rhythmically tapping the surface.                   
“I hear it rots ther lungs. Blocks it up all black and gooey.” 
The ground started shaking gently, sending the table rocking. The wooden groans were the only sound for a while, and the light fixture swung in time with its own squeaky tune. Eventually the rumbles died down into silence.       
“Yer die coughing up crap. Lungs come with it.” The mubaran imitated a choking noise, his air-tube flailing, eyes watching the drumming fingers. 


The door slid open, and a tall thranin beckoned Hunter to follow. He stood slowly, rising to the tips of his feet to stretch, cleared his throat once, and started towards the exit. The mubaran dropped his stumpy hand onto the Hunter’s shoulder as he passed, and squeezed.  
“Just thought yer should know.” 
Hunter turned his head and watched the yellow face leering at him. They stood for a moment like that, still and tense, before the mubaran’s air-tubed shrivelled and he stepped back from the shorter biped, paling.  
“Bit o’ friendly advice is all.” He muttered. Hunter continued on without looking back. 

. 

.


He followed the thranin quietly, shrugging to settle his long-rifle between his shoulder blades. The loose red rocks shifted beneath his boots as he walked, sending little rivers of dust down the hillside. He didn’t spare a glance to look out over the plains below. The view was static as always, a hazy canvas of earthy browns and reds, the occasional snake of green foliage woven in like a forgotten flick of paint. Instead he gazed at his guide’s thin back and settled into the walk.  
The Dvail Syndicate always kept their experimental weapons far away from the main base, and on Varin-Prime, that meant a long and hot walk through cracked canyons and dried out river beds. They trudged on in silence.


Eventually the canyons led up to a small circular plateau. The ground was unnaturally flat and marked with red lines, and a metal door had been embedded into the rock wall.  
“Some shipments can be large.” The thranin explained, noting his gaze. 
“Air drops before the storm floods.” Hunter’s voice was rough and low. “When the radars are down.” He received only a smirk in return, as the thranin banged on the door. It slid open immediately, and they ducked inside. 



“Welcome to Dvail facility six-three-three.” An electronic female voice proclaimed soothingly. “Please follow your guides. Any unaccompanied non-employees will be detained for later use.“   
They had entered a reception area with multiple corridors leading away. The decor was spartan, plain burnished metal walls and a large semi-circular white marble desk. A large painting had been hung behind the desk, showing a grey-scale depiction of a battlefield.  
Hunter strode after his guide who had headed down the leftmost passage, labelled ‘**WEAPONS TESTING’**, without hesitation. 

.

.


“What do you think?” Kap tilted his head in question.  
Hunter bounced the anti-material rifle in his hands, hefting it around.  
“It’s a little heavy for its size.” He replied.  
“Barrel has mag boosters. Energy-pack is located in the stock.”   
“Power issues?”  
The Dvail merchant shook his furred head, long nose twitching around.  
 “Only for spin, not propellant. Closest thing to actual railgun you can carry by hand. Only drawback is the ammo. Needs to be dual core. ”  
The thranin, who had eventually introduced himself as Kap, watched the exchange quietly.  
“How much was the S-4?” Hunter asked, eventually.  
“Fifty giga-krona.”    
Hunter grunted. “I’ll take the Tornado, plus ten boxes of ammo.” The merchant nodded, and scurried off into the inventory room. Hunter swung the rifle over his shoulder and slid it into place next to his current weapon.  
“Gonna sell the old Harringer?” Kap asked.  
“A collector on Sorin wants it.” Hunter replied.  
“Got something else you might be interested in.”  
“Oh?”  
“Escape pod crashed over in the ridges couple of days ago.”  
“I don’t do escort missions.”  
“That’s the thing. Passenger wasn’t any known species.”  
Hunter raised his eyebrow.  
“Want to take a look, Hunt?” 
He considered for a moment.  
“Alright.”  
“I’ll have Mikkn drop the ammo off at the front desk.” 

.

.



The wing of the facility they headed into, labelled **‘BIOLOGICAL TESTING’**, was heavily patrolled. Thick doors sealed off bulkheads, and Hunter could see gas vents in every room. Evidentially they didn’t like the idea of an escape.   
“She was heavily wounded when we found her. Bones fractured, internal bleeding, the works.” Kap said.  
“She?”   
“The doctors said she had the right reproductive organs for a mammalian species.”  
“Huh. Don’t see many of them.”  
“That’s not near one of the most interesting things though. Pound for pound, they reckon she is almost as strong as a Gunthan. Only comes in at one-fifty though.”   
“Height?” Hunter asked.  
“Five-six.”   
“Small and dense.”    
“Mhm. High gravity world. Here she is.” Kap gestured for Hunter to look through a viewing window. The floor of the room was a level below them, and as such he could see the creature in profile, strapped onto an operating table. She was bipedal, with smooth white skin. The only hair on her body was a shock of red falling from her head. Hunter grunted in surprise at her face, which was soft and round and had a pale pink marking around her mouth.  
“Two eyes.” Hunter said.
Kap nodded.   
“I thought you said she was heavily wounded?”   
“That’s the interesting thing. Doctors had to do invasive surgery to withdraw some metal.”   
“And she didn’t die of shock?”   
“Far from it. After it was removed she began healing, rapidly. Day later and it was like nothing had happened.”    
Kap was about to reply when the creature jerked and snapped her eyes open. Bright green and set forward in the face, they had the intelligent fierceness of a natural predator. She twisted to stare at them, eyes narrowed.  
“She isn’t sedated?”   
“She is.” Kap replied, frowning. Doctors rushed into the room, carrying hyperdermic needles and a gas mask. Before they could get close, the straps pinning her down frayed open, and she flung herself off the table. 

.

. 




Hunter, in his time collecting bounties had seen many predators, both sentient and not. Some could have simply crushed the small mammal. Many more would have certainly been able to pin her down and hold her. None, however, would have been able to *catch* her. She spun a dance between the white-robed doctors, weaving in and out, limbs snaking out to strike a joint or chin or eye and then just as quickly snapped away, leaving only air. Her vibrant red hair mesmerised and distracted like the tassel of a sword, leaving openings for those small limbs to leap into and break bones with solid crunches.  

In seconds, the room was still again. She crouched in the centre, her medical gown rising slowly with her breath.  
“Gods…” Kap whispered in shock.  
 “Shes so *quick*.” He shook himself and flipped an alarm cover up, before pressing down hard on the button, sirens immediately blaring. She once again turned to look at them, anger open on her face. Her arm flickered, and one of the doctor’s needles vibrated in the glass it had been thrown into, right in front of Kap’s face. He swallowed, and stepped back. 

“I think we have a problem.”

,DoSVita,"Hello, I'm new- I've only played since last week, but from what I've seen and experienced so far, DoS is the type of game you can play to either build super-strong monsters or collect and trade rares and super-rares (or both!). I'm still in the process of building my team, but for players that have passed that point: do you generally prioritize capping off/optimizing your teams, or look for Rs and SRs for the purpose of collecting/trading?

I also know there's a beginner's guide being written, but I was also wondering if it was alright to ask a few team-building and collection-based questions here?

1. Is it correct to assume that for the process of building a super-strong team, you should be using spirits found in your own region (due to the limit break)?

2. Is there any consensus on which sorts of spirits are best to utilize in battles? I'm currently using a mix of UCs and Rs, but in general I noticed that most spirits in a rarity tier seem to have somewhat similar stats. There are a few Cs that I'd love to try boosting for battle use, but I'm not sure if doing that will be pointless or not.

3. Are any stats considered more valuable than others? For now I'm trying to balance out my teams with a few high HP spirits and high SPD spirits, but I haven't played long enough to understand which stats the game tends to favor most.

4. Regarding limit breaks in particular, I'm assuming easy-to-find dupes can be merged guilt-free, but R and SR dupes are probably best for trading or breaking, right?

Hopefully I'll be able to build up my collection in the coming weeks- I find DoS particularly amazing to play before sleeping due to how passive battles can be.",,False,,0,,Do you generally aim to build a strong team or collect elusive spirits?,,,,,,0.0,,,False,t3_2bzkxm,False,,,,,4.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},,,4,,,,self,False,,,,,,True,,1406589962.0,,,,,,self.DoSVita,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,t5_31cl3,,,,,2bzkxm,,,Hwari,,31,,,,,,,/r/DoSVita/comments/2bzkxm/do_you_generally_aim_to_build_a_strong_team_or/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/DoSVita/comments/2bzkxm/do_you_generally_aim_to_build_a_strong_team_or/,,1406586362.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441246436.0,,,

,bravefrontier,"Hi guys, welcome to the latest New Unit Analysis! With the limited time nature of the Xenon and Estia - Prologue dungeon, I've decided to postpone Kikuri's analysis in favour of having a look at [Xenon &amp; Estia](/cg); affectionately dubbed Xestia.

We'll be looking at how Xestia compares to a few of their Light unit friends and also their role in the current metagame and whether they'll still be viable in the future.

Also pre-warning, please try to ignore the many grammatical fallacies I'm going to inevitably make, slipping in and out of pluralisation. Sorry!

Let's get started!

Disclaimer: As always, I try to keep these as objective as possible, but they're ultimately my opinion and yours may differ. Please read them with an open mind and a view to make your own decisions. :&gt;

***

[Xenon &amp; Estia vs. Sola, Lubradine, Atro, Sefia](/cg)

[Xenon &amp; Estia's Stats:](http://bravefrontierglobal.wikia.com/wiki/Xenon_%26_Estia)

Lord: HP 5546 ATK 1690 DEF 1400 REC 1200

LS: 30% boost to ATK and 5% boost to HP/REC of all Fire, Water, Earth and Thunder units

Hit count: 10 (drop check count 2/hit)

BB: 8 hit multiple target Light elemental damage and increases ATK/DEF of all allies by 35% for 2 turns (22BC to fill, ATK +35%, DEF +35%, damage modifier +130%)

* Xestia's an interesting unit! Firstly their stats are phenomenal for a 5* unit as you'll see in these comparisons, particularly for a free unit. Their HP is way above average for their evolution tier and their ATK isn't too shabby either, their DEF is probably around average, possibly slightly above for a 5* unit and their REC is their main shortcoming, not scaling particularly well with their HP stat. Very good for a 5* unit, but not particularly impressive in the grand scheme of things when you consider the fact that we're currently in an era where 6* units are the norm. Their LS is pretty interesting in that they're probably the only unit in the game to not benefit in any way from their own LS since they're a light unit, which unfortunately makes it automatically suboptimal if you use it. It's not a fantastic LS but it's a great, relatively non-restrictive choice for beginning/F2P players who lack someone better. Their hit count is very solid at 10, but the attack animation is slightly lacking, split into two halves making it difficult to spark optimally with. Lastly their BB fills quite quickly for a MT BB and is the only BB in the game to explicitly list the percentage boost of its buff, which is convenient for analysis purposes. Thanks Gumi. &lt;3

* First up, I thought it'd be valuable to compare them to another free light unit, [Sola](/cg). Compared to the eldest of the Sibyl Sisters, Xestia have better HP (+845), ATK (+375) but lose out in DEF (-85) and REC (-400). The minor DEF difference here is negligible when compared to the huge HP advantage Xestia have so it's fairly obvious that Xestia have the advantage in bulk, and their offensive advantage is pretty significant too. Unfortunately, the 400 REC that Sola has on Xestia is also pretty significant since 1.2k isn't the most stellar of REC stats (particularly paired with relatively high HP like Xestia sports), but it's definitely not enough to outscale the other considerable advantages Xestia have over Sola. Xestia's definitely the stronger unit statwise. Xestia also win in hit count and comparing their BBs, they charge comparatively quickly (24BC for Sola and 22BC for Xestia), but Sola hits 3 elements for weakness damage to Xestia's 1 while Xestia can raise the parties ATK and DEF by 35%. It's pretty clear that Xestia's buff is going to be superior in utility to Sola's BB in the absence of a unit that makes it redundant (though to be fair, there are a few of those around in Light), so all in all, this comparison goes to Xestia who are really quite an excellent free unit.

* Next up is [Lubradine](/cg). Compared to our majestic White Lion, Xestia have better HP (+250) and ATK (+75) but less DEF (-70) and REC (-565). As you can see, Xestia are actually pretty amazing, being pretty comparable to Lubradine of all unit. They hit slightly harder and have better overall bulk (250 HP probably outscales 70 DEF) but they lose out pretty badly in REC. All in all they probably come out roughly even, possibly slightly in Lubradine's favour since Lubradine's REC advantage is pretty significant and his other deficits are not as much but it's pretty impressive that Xestia come this close to beating him. Of course Lubradine has a 6* evolution lined up very soon so it's only very temporarily that they match him in stats but it's still a pretty nice feat for a free unit. They also win in hit count which is a point in their favour but comparing their BBs, it's Lubradine's much stronger buffs vs. the fact that Xestia have a MT attack attached to theirs. Overall I think Lubradine's stronger ATK/DEF buff and importantly his REC buff probably pull him ahead in overall usefulness and definitely so once his evolution arrives very soon and he gets his own MT SBB to go along with his fantastic buffs. I definitely would not be switching Lubradine out in favour of these two any time soon.

* Next is [Atro](/cg), the first 6* Light unit. Compared to the Holy Knight, Xestia have better HP (+510) and ATK (+85) but less DEF (-205) and REC (-405). Again, Xestia are pretty impressive for their evolution tier. According to Xerte's work on DEF mechanisms, it takes about 8-9 attacks (205 * 0.3 = 61.5 extra damage mitigation per attack) before Atro breaks even bulk-wise with his/her defence advantage vs. Xestia's HP advantage. So Xestia are superior in bulk for shorter fights, but longer ones probably swing in Atro's favour. Xestia also hit slightly harder, but it's not by a particularly significant margin. Unfortunately, again it's Xestia's mediocre REC stat that lets them down with Atro eclipsing them in this area thoroughly and it's for this reason that Atro probably wins the stat battle overall, though to Xestia's credit, they didn't make it easy for the knight. Xestia make up some ground with their lovely 10 hit combo and comparing their BBs vs. Atro's BB/SBB combination, they both provide pretty much identical buffs. Atro's are very slightly weaker but last an extra turn longer, however Xestia's buff is attached to their fast filling BB (22BC to fill) while Atro's is attached to his SBB (48BC to fill), meaning that they can upkeep their buffs much more readily than Atro can. If you're looking for someone to provide an ATK/DEF buff in a Light squad and you don't have a Lubradine, Xestia are actually really solid, probably at least on par with Atro unless you also want to use him as a leader. On a BB spam squad, you'll probably want to run Atro though since maintaining his SBB won't be much of an issue.

* Finally we have [Sefia](/cg) who is just here to roflstomp the couple into the ground. Compared to the woman of eight blades, Xestia have better.... nothing. Sorry, guys, unfortunately, Xestia lose to Sefia in every stat: HP (-455), ATK (-390), DEF (-380) and REC (-245). Basically they lose by huge margins in every criteria; Sefia making it very clear that although they may be good for a free, 5* unit, they're not going to come close to touching the power of a recently evolved unit. To make matters worse, Sefia even equals them in hit count but with a much better attack animation so they don't even win in that regard. Comparing their BBs, Sefia's all about big damage with the occasional paralysis thrown in while Xestia can support the party with their buffs. Unfortunately, the buffs they do provide are actually pretty weak in the long run and are quite readily available in stronger versions on other units (Lubradine, Lancia, Michele, Zelban, Elimo etc. etc.), perhaps not both at once, but it still hurts their viability that they're fairly easily made redundant. A good choice in the absence of any other ATK/DEF buffing unit, but definitely nowhere near touching the power of Sefia.

* Xenon and Estia are a good, free unit, their stats are actually REALLY good for a 5* unit, even compared to most rare summons, but they fall flat of pretty much all the 6* units available (except perhaps some of the starters) and are unlikely to receive a 6* evolution of their own (would be amazing if they did though), meaning they're a bit too late to be truly useful in most people's rosters. However if you're looking for a filler for mono-light, they're a great choice and they have some other uses that I'll discuss in the next section.

***

[Xenon and Estia: Indepth Look](/cg)

* Again, their stats are really good for their evolution tier. They almost match Lubradine for goodness' sake and he's got one of the highest stat totals in the game when he evolves. Granted, he's not at his peak performance yet in his current form, but it's still very impressive to match a pretty top tier 5* unit as a free unit.

* Again, their REC is their biggest let down. Their DEF is actually quite good, or at least average for a 5* unit but 1.2k REC is on the low side and the reason why they don't compare so well against a lot of other units. Still useable and I'm sure a lot of you will of course mention fixing it with a sphere, but it's definitely a low point for them.

* Their LS isn't ever going to be considered a top tier one, but it's great as a filler LS for a pseudo-rainbow squad in the absence of someone better. The 5% HP and REC bonus might not seem like much but it's a nice little bonus to make up for the fact that Xestia don't benefit from their own LS.

* 10 hits is great for a regular attack on any unit. Their attack animation keeps it from being truly amazing, but it's still pretty good. It's particularly good in Arena where sparking doesn't really matter anyway and the extra hits to generate some more BC is really appreciated.

* In fact, Xestia in general are a great unit for the Arena. Their BB fills fairly quickly (22BC), and this paired with their hit count make them probably the second best light unit in the game on Arena teams, behind Sefia.

* Outside of the Arena, their ATK/DEF buff is obviously useful but 35% isn't a particularly strong buff and as mentioned previously, ATK/DEF buffs are pretty common (though not in combination) meaning that it's a bit difficult to build a team with Xestia without running into some kind of redundancy. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's something to keep in mind.

* It's especially and unfortunately rampant in Light, the very element Xestia is a member of since Light has Lubradine who is/will be flat out better in pretty much every way and Atro who is probably a little bit better overall and can also doubles as a competent mono-light leader and no access to a healer (well, there's Tilith for a select few, and Themis down the track) meaning Elimo and Lancia will probably be common sights too.

* Still, if you do need an ATK/DEF buffing unit, Xestia is a pretty solid filler. Which is probably the best way to look at them overall. Solid filler that's technically free.

* In terms of future prospects, well they're already on pretty shaky ground even in current content so obviously things get worse for them in the future. Every single unit released from now on will blitz them in stats and most of them in utility as well. For a free unit, they're fine and their stats are solid enough that they're actually probably going to be pretty viable for quite a while but they definitely will not outperform most half-decent rare summons.

* Xestia are a great collectable, I really like their art (except for Estia's fingers) and they're pretty cute together. Functionally as a unit, I probably wouldn't elevate them beyond being great filler units to tide you over until you grab a more optimal summon but that doesn't mean they're bad. Great filler is still great.

***

[Typing Discussion](/cg)

* As always, the most important thing to note here is that if typing is the only thing holding you back from using a unit, you should definitely just go ahead and use them. Please don't discard units because their typing isn't 'optimal'.

* I think Lord is a good fit for these two. Their natural stat distribution is pretty nice, and Anima and Guardian have their drawbacks which you might prefer, but I'd probably want to avoid.

* Guardian's pretty good though, and depending on how you view these two, could be considered better than Lord. It drops their ATK to probably around the 1450ish range but shores up their DEF to probably around 1.6k which is pretty nice and if you're only running them for support purposes, then the ATK penalty isn't as important as their survivability.

* Tough call next, but I might give it to Oracle. Their REC is a tad low for Anima and their HP is great and can definitely take the hit (probably puts them around 5.2k still) while the extra REC is definitely of use to these two.

* Anima here, though I wouldn't protest if you suggested it was a bit higher up. Anima gives them over 6k natural HP which is pretty phenomenal for their evolution tier but unfortunately, the price to pay is a REC stat of 1050 which is pretty bad. It's not insurmountable (blah blah, spheres), but it's definitely not an ideal value to be sitting at.

* Finally Breaker which is actually still okay for them, it gives them very nice ATK power at 1860 but drops their DEF to a pretty frail 1.2k which isn't ideal.

***

That's it guys! Happy hunting for your Xestia, I still haven't gotten mine yet, so you're not alone if you haven't managed to snag one. ;~;

As always, I welcome your comments/criticims/encouragements. Please drop an upvote if you found this helpful, I'd really appreciate the support! &lt;3&lt;3

if you're wondering why i am doing this and the ideas behind this are, wellllll...

1. you won't know who you're playing against TRULY. you'll know which team and can see who is playing D or O, but you won't know which O you're defending against. it could be either one. 

2. we won't have to complain about one player getting all the caps because we won't know who it is. you can make a guess, but you won't really know unless someone spoils it and tells you from that team.

3. in regards to the ""any subs"", i want to see how well this works. there's always been a restriction on who gets to sub in and i think it's unfair. ""stacked"" teams do end up losing at times, so don't be too discouraged if you're playing up against one. just have fun tonight.

,Battlefield,"(In the following text, you will see the narrative switch from I to We quite a bit. I am presenting this as a pitch as if a company was wanting to add their own flair to the franchise.)

As much as I love the Battlefield series, it focuses to heavily on Nuclear disaster. I know there are some who agree with on this. We need a game that can fulfill a lot of storytelling. The single player story has been lacking for the last couple of entries in the franchise. I enjoyed them, but they were almost cookie cutter. 

I have an idea of a future BF title, just simply BFV(5), that will add more heart to the series than we have seen yet. Also, it will add an aspect many of us choose to ignore. The war in Africa, all it has been, what it is, and what it could be. I wont get into it in this paragraph, but its time to face a real terror, one that doesn't rely on nuclear bombs, but the fear and helplessness of families. 

Battlefield V

A lesser known war has waged longer than Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. This is a war in which no side really wins. Kids are snatched from their beds, given a gun and forced to fight. Diamonds are the hot export, and the world is tired of hearing about it, and wants something done. Any country would be crucified, moving into countries and fighting and killing child soldiers. Now, a force command has been created so that no one country has to use their face, and the world doesn't even know it exists.

Dense Jungle gameplay will be included, not only will you be fighting the enemy forces, but the forces of nature itself. Animal attacks can be a common thing.

Consequential Squad Gameplay means  that you must play as a squad, or face the consequences. Promotions are also gained through a new feature, squad points, which are redeemable at the end of the match for a boost in EXP, items, or battlepacks. It is behooving to play as a squad.

Tiered Combat System is term used to explain how a soldier can equip gadgets with other kits. No longer are you required to use what is in the desired kits.  Beware though, this means you can gain penalized for equipping items your kit is not specialized with, but on the flipside, you can be boosted for items your kit is specialized for.

The campaign is huge, and the more squads playing, the bigger it gets, as the mechanics add more waypoints, diverging paths and more targets. Four squads to a map will be critical for a 100% completion rating, earning you valuable squad points to use for redeeming goods.

Mission Based Multiplayer means during your Conquest, Rush, etc. matches, each side can be given a Mission to complete, boosting EXP substantially, and unlocking weapon drops on the maps. These missions can be given by a Commander.

A new mode of gameplay will be Deck 52, where as a squad, you work to complete missions that involve 52 most wanted war criminals. You will be given a static setup that, as you progress through the Deck, will get more and more customizable. Your Cards you earned here will be used to buy new weapons you can use in your missions. This mode is best played with close friends. Beware though, each failed mission will result a loss of Cards you have just earned. So spend them and unlock gear, gadgets and support entities, saving up could be a bad choice.

Choosing your soldier’s looks has been a wanted deal in Battlefield for a long time, male and female models, hair, skin color, and anything else distinguishing. Now you can, with a very basic concept that involves a high amount of choices in four categories: Hair, Gender, Race, Uniform. Your soldier will be your own, with none of these choices effecting your progression throughout the game experience.

Commander mode will be revamped. You will be judged. The Commanders have a special place on the battlefield, and it’s not in the fray with the ground troops. Playing on your tablet will gain you some of the same features as before, but will add totally new ones like a smokescreen drop that you can coordinate with you leaders so they make the appropriate changes. More vehicles will be at you control to drop for control of the battlefield, including air vehicles. Commander crates, which are different than supply crates called in by Squad Leaders, will act as a full kit exchange and customization point. 

Some small additions in the game is a new robust ammo pick up feature, that will allow you soldier to rummage through a downed players body for extra ammo you can use, depending the size of the round, or explosives. Example, a round from a SCAR-H will not fit into and M16 and vice versa. Of course, you still just exchange the whole kit. It will take time to collect the items separately, ammo being first, then explosives in the order of grenades, mines, claymores, C4.

Of course we haven’t forgotten Premium access and DLCs. We will feature a hardier system in which you the player will have chances to earn extra rewards. If you have saved up in game points, you may be able to use them to purchase a limited time “Freemium” or Flightlans to new maps and modes. Thus, you can avoid a big purchase. Every time the game is updated the information all DLC information released at that time will be included. 
	Freemium – The act of being Premium, with the option to queue, earn Premium Battlepacks, etc.
	Flightplans – You can purchase these with squad points so you can play across the world of BFV with full purchase off DLCs.
This way you never feel obligated to purchase anything in full, just to experience the game. 

These are just a few ideas on where the BF Franchise could go. Not everything can be included but, some of it definitely has a place in BF.

,indiegameswap,"Hello everyone,

I enjoy collecting cards (especially finishing the card drops so I can {unlikely} qualify for booster pack drops), however, I have slowly realized and accepted that my infinite backlog will never be dented at this rate.

,civ,"WARNING: GIANT WALL OF BLAH BLAH BLAH, D:

So I like to play Egypt, idk why, i love the wonder improvement.

Always, to start i focus on researching Pottery, idk, its awesome.
I always build a Monument when i make a new city, its just my thing.
After pottery, I go straight for calendar, this is for Stonehenge, and usually before Stonehenge I have the first policy to unlock tradition. More importantly I have a shrine. At this point I am cranking out stonehenge and if I have enough gold I attempt to buy a worker, otherwise save.

Now that Stonehenge is finished I focus on writing, for the Great Library. At this point I'd have gotten the Aristocracy social policy and have started working towards Liberty for the social policy Republic.

By now, id have started a religion and headed directly for the 15% wonder production boost, I'm not sure what its called, Protestantism all the way.

Now, i usually head out and get the policies Collective Rule, and Citizenship. Now, i focus on whatever is around me and head off on whatever road i need to go on (I like to play all around, so if in a pinch if I need to win with science, I can.)'

However, I haven't actually played a game with DLC any past the King difficulty and would love to continue, I doubt its doable with Egypt, any better ways I can WonderWhore?

With religion, i love to get the 1% production per follower until 15% its a godsend.",,False,,0,,"Im kind of new, let me tell you my strategy.",,,,,,0.0,,,False,t3_2bu7fz,False,,,,,1.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},,,1,,,,self,False,immortal-difficulty,,,,,True,,1406442234.0,,,,,,self.civ,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,Finally.,,,,,,t5_2rk3b,,,,,2bu7fz,,,Kyledabaws,,7,,,,,,,/r/civ/comments/2bu7fz/im_kind_of_new_let_me_tell_you_my_strategy/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/2bu7fz/im_kind_of_new_let_me_tell_you_my_strategy/,,1406438634.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441249006.0,,,
,Bravenewbies,"Good morning/night all ,

Sunday night/monday morning an enemy pos comes out of enforced @ 3:00 eve on Monday. That is around 10/11pm Sunday for you US peeps. 

The importance of killing this pos can't be expressed enough. For those that have come on our stain harassment fleet can tell you how much of a blast it is. 

A roam they are use to just docking up for a sec, but harassing the Shit out of them makes them make mistakes. 
killing this pos in stain will allow us to reach deeper into stain and boost with impunity. The funds collected from this moon will fund more towers used in stain for assigning fighters and staging posses. This will also hurt them in the wallet not allowing them the cash flow to fund the poses in Ge- to stage out of.  They rat in stain in complete solace while we in catch get harassed. It is time to pay them back.

We need every person available for this fleet. This is an important timer.  Sadly I will be at work, and will not be able to make it.

,personalfinance,"A couple of facts about me and my situation:

1. 22 year old
2. Income of ~65k
2. No kids or plans for kids until ~30
2. Credit Score of 714 (using a credit card for reimbursed business travel to help boost that)
2. No student loans or any debt whatsoever (very blessed with scholarships and family contributions)
3. Renting an appt currently (Cheap 1 bedroom)
4. Leasing a vehicle currently with intent to purchase the vehicle in 1 year (lease to own program)
5. With current budget setup I am maxing out both my roth and 401k and saving an additional 5k a year to go to emergency fund.
6. 10k in emergency fund  (with planned growth to 20k by the time I move (i.e. ~4 months))
7. Will be moving in 2 years time to a location where renting doesn't make as much sense than buying. (e.g. housing market is saturated but rental properties are scarce)

I will be receiving approximately 80K in post-tax money as incentive to move with my company in 2 years. This does not include them paying for movers, housing closing costs, home-buying trips etc. I will also be receiving a cost of living adjustment to my salary to compensate moving to the higher priced area. The package is very very very good and comprehensive.

Here are my initial thoughts on what to do with this money.

1. Outright purchase my current vehicle ( 12-14k to do)
2. Make a down-payment on a modest home in the area. (20-30k for a 100-150k home)
3. Set up a vacation fund that will pay out modest returns every year that I can use to pay towards a vacation every year between now and when I retire. (~ 38k to pay myself 2k*(1.02)^n for every nth year for the next 25 years assuming I can get a meager 4% return on my money)

Here where things get me thinking. 
I could skip the vacation fund and make a huge down payment onto the home, or even just buy a very modest home outright and just ""Collect the savings"" as my vacation fund. I am scared though of property value deteriorating in the future so it isnt quite a guarantee that tying up my money would make me any money in the future.

On the other hand I could make a normal down payment and have a much larger set of liquid assets to work with if I wanted to say go to college for my masters.

Im not sure if there is a good middle ground with what size downpayment to make. It may be a function of home price, reinvestment rate and mortgage rate and length of time I am planning to stay in the new area. Luckily my job security is very very good so if I want to stay a while I can. I havent quite figured out how to graph it out in excel yet (Definitely working on it though!)

Another thought was to go for a place that may not be the best for me personally but would make a great rental place in the future once I upgrade to the ""long term home""

,dragoncoins,"Coming back to you with a rundown of the hard area of the hard area! Again it's all money until the Hard area, and the skill soul that you get in hard is All Blitz.

Stage 1: Smoke Maiden and Hearthkeeper - Smoke Maiden nullifies leader skills and Hearthkeeper hides the stage.

Sage 2: Infernal Chef and Sparkler - Sparkler hides the stage in poison! Infernal Chef shakes the table.

Stage 3: Cerberus and Valkyrie - Cerberus boosts enemy and ally attack power. Valkyrie does a 'takeover' effect, but it doesn't work 100% of the time.

Stage 4: Flaricorn and Selkhet - Selkhet drops a poison bomb, Flaricorn didn't seem to do anything

Stage 5: Diamond King - He does a full heal at half health, but he only does it once, so it's not that scary.

-----

Sunday is focused on wood monsters rather than the fire from yesterday:

Stage 1: Outlaw Archer, Mandragora - Mandragora counts down to a full heal when she hits 50%, Outlaw Archer  decreases her countdown by one each time she attacks. 

Stage 2: Cockatrice, Catoblepas - Cockatrice drops a Plague Bomb at the start of the stage, Catoblepas a Sleep Bomb

Stage 3: Hildisvini, Genbu - Hildisvini erects an immovable coin tower. (This is SERIOUSLY annoying, prevent thsi at all costs) Genbu shrinks the coins you collect to tiny size. 

Stage 4: Genbu, Ajatar - Genbu probably shrinks coins but I didn't check / Ajatar drops a 50% health bomb at the start of the stage.

,pkmntcgcollections,"I used to dabble in the cards when I was young but lost interest when no one wanted to play the game with me, now I've found that I really miss the magic of these weird cardboard things and want to start collecting seriously now. I've ordered myself a new D-ring binder and 100 sheets of binder sleeves and plan on buying a Legendary Treasures Booster Box when I make enough money (There are NO jobs for kids just out of highschool in rural areas of Canada, and the job I do have I'm not even getting 8 hours a week). I also plan to see if I have any of my old cards, they were all early RS era, so they suck but may as well look anyway.

TL;DR I'm starting collecting again and bought a binder with sleeve pages but no cards yet because the nearest Walmart is an hour's drive and screw spending $30 on gas just to buy a couple boosters.Anything I should know? also, What's the debate on Top Loaders vs Sleeves vs Binder? If I get something nice should I just binder it and only put it in a top loader/sleeve if I'm going to sell it or should I keep those in top loaders/sleeves in a separate location?

* Increased knockdown recovery speed for all frames in PvP Dark Sector conflicts (and Conclaves).
* To address general survivability (for Conclaves as well):  
    Reduced incoming Health damage to 25% of current values.  
    Reduced incoming Shield damage to 50%  of current values.
* Added further UI support for Node selection and Conflict history for Dark Sectors.

* Fixed data not being reset when a player disconnects, resulting in wrong level, xp, etc. for players that might take their place.
* Fixed Blessing healing defense core and generator in Dark Sector conflicts.
* Fixed player health/shield/energy values. They should now scale up with your level instead of constant as if level 30.
* Changed the layout of the middle portion of Dark Sectors and moved the hack objectives to not be within sight of the defenders immediately after spawn.
* Added new sound and tactile feedback for Console context actions (Arming/Disarming).
* Changes to conflict logic: Clans can no longer play against their own rails (whether their Alliance or Clan).


 

UI Changes &amp; Fixes:

* Players can now initiate the ESC menu prior to selecting the Prologue.
* The navigation console will now move backwards when focusing on Planets so as to avoid potential clipping issues.
* We now only focus on the news element when we interact with it.
* We increased the legibility of the Drop Down Menu background to make it more legible.
* Added consistency in material outlines to the Genetic Foundry, Auras, and the Drop Down Menu.

You will now be notified via the bottom-right notification bumper when you are invited, and you can choose to Accept/Decline all invites through the Diagetic ESC menu. With this change, we also increased notification awareness and made it so that the squad panel should be visible and showing the particles with callout if you have an invite pending.

Warframe Colour Customization Changes:

* We have recently discovered our Warframe Colour Customization choices are not gamma corrected when applied.  We have rectified this issue, but you will see the difference in Steve’s Developer Workshop post [here](https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/topic/273383-upcoming-color-customization-fix-planned-for-hotfix-1409/?p=3155980#entry3155980).
* Login to receive a FREE desaturated colour picker - it’ll be available for you to get for the next 2 weeks just by logging in!

* Fixed an awkward floating animation that would occur when a bleeding out Kubrow was affected by 'Link Health'.
* Tweaked the range of 'Howl' to prevent enemies behind walls getting affected.
* Fixed Kubrow finishers dealing double damage. They will now do the same damage as their normal melee damage. The next step here is getting the Kubrow Damage values displaying in the UI, and we’ll get this up and running as soon as we can. Sorry for the disconnect.
* Fixed Kubrow size/appearance discrepancies on Client in sessions.
* Fixed 'Scavenge' causing permanent freezing when multiple Kubrow's tried to interact with the same locker. If there are multiple Kubrows in a mission, no more than one can target the same locker.
* Fixed typo in the ‘Howl’ Kubrow mod.

 

Changes:

* Further finessed matchmaking logic to ensure your past presences are cleared before hosting or advertising matchmaking sessions.

* Tweaked the 'Revive' sound.
* Corrected Tenno Default Colour Picker to use proper Gamma colour values.

 

Fixes:

* Fixed Arcane Helmets being untradable.
* Fixed a common game crash/hang that would occur when adjusting matchmaking settings, or simply ‘quitting’ the game.
* Fixed crash that would occur when attempting to leave a squad.
* Fixed crashes caused by low-level low-integrity Kubrows instantly entering bleedout.

,pkmntcgcollections,"I saw someone else talking about this the other day, and it backs up experience: Pokemon card tins appear (from my very limited, unstratified data) to have better odds of holding EXs then any random booster pack. Any regulars will know that I am new to this community and since starting up pokemon card collecting again last week I have opened 2 tins (got one next to me to be opened tomorrow though) and out of these 2 tins I have pulled 5 EX cards (Including the promos). Let me put this in perspective - The other day I bought 10 booster packs and got 0 EXs (I did get a secret rare pikachu that I am more than happy with but still). So whats the deal; are tins rigged in the favor of the buyer? Discuss:

KrakenDomes, on 20 Jan 2014 - 12:57 PM, said: Played with this group last night for the first time. And let me tell you, a very fun experience. Definitely join if your looking for a friendly group of players to play with. We looted a bit and eventually went to cherno to have some fun (help bambis / Kill bandits ). If your looking for a team that indulges itself In every aspect of DayzSA then this is the place fer you!!

*Pseudocide, on 21 Jan 2014 - 05:54 AM, said: Done a few operations with BP and I'm hooked. Beck so cray-cray. Sniper teams so cray-cray. Assault elements so cray-cray. Safe to say Beck's Privateers - best privateers. If you're looking for a DayZ community with good intentions, camaraderie as well as teamwork, hanging out, unwinding in the north, and just being up for a good time, this is where it's at. At times you're on maxed out 40 player servers rolling 20 deep inland. Most certainly a humbling sight to behold. Any small time rag tag bandit group would fear us from a distance. Little would they know we're being friendly and silly over TeamSpeak, pretty much just chitchatting away while gearing up, sharing meals, and having a blast. Then you have the suspenseful moments holding order during operations in large coastal towns; dropping some food and drink for traveling bambis and letting them know that we've got their back even when they cant see us. You say you're disappointed that there's no endgame material in alpha yet. Joining our survivor's ranks and giving you're post-apocalyptic character purpose IS the endgame. BP can provide for you. BP can protect you. BP can keep you alive.

TheRealAzrael, on 14 Jan 2014 - 11:12 PM, said: ...This group is AMAZING... Anyways.....Join us, play with us, you'll find it additive ;)

Dave of Rivia, on 31 Dec 2013 - 12:24 PM, said: I had a great time playing with you all, and I would definitely recommend these guy's if you're a friendly player or new to the game.

flipgaming, on 21 Jan 2014 - 3:36 PM, said: Ive done Half a dozen operations with BP now, and it is by far the most fun ive had in the standalone! The sheer numbers we have going into towns and capturing them is something you have to see for yourself. We help those in need and eliminate those who cause Chaos. If your looking for a solid group of players, with military tactics and a laid back environment Come check these guys out.

Beck's Privateers Code Of Conduct:
The Privateers are a Heroic Survivor Group that employs team tactics and military style operations to seize hostile towns in an attempt to allow new players to pass through and acquire the food, water, and supplies they need to survive. We are a non-KOS group.




1) Basic Rules and Regulations


Rules of Engagement
Our rules of engagement are to be upheld at all times, breaking them shall result in discipline based on the severity of the situation
 
Glitching
 Glitching and bug use are strictly forbidden. In no circumstance should anyone be caught using or endorsing any glitches/bugs. (AMENDED MARCH 24TH 2014)
 
Respect
Respecting each other and the chain of command should be of the utmost importance

If you do not agree with or take issue with these, privately take this to a superior and move it up the chain. If you cannot morally agree with these basic rules, perhaps this Clan isn't for you.


2) Rules of Engagement


Shout, Show, Shove, Shoot
 
This is the blanket escalation of force for Marines. The first step of a possible hostile is to shout at them, telling them stop, put their hands up and/or get on the ground. The next escalation is to show your rifle. I.e. raise it from the resting position to an aiming position. The shove step is if they are in your personal space bubble to get them to back off from you, but not applicable to our needs. The last step is to shoot once the target ignores all other steps. This method generally gives you a solid escalation of force that results in completely justified shootings.
 
Positive identification (PID) of Hostiles
 
This is one of the hardest ROE’s to use and can easily result in death. None-the-less it is an integral part of killing the right people. Everyone should seek positive identification that the target is a bandit or is willing to kill on sight before firing. A player running down the road is not positive identification to a hostile. What we should be looking for is bandit’s robbing other players; bandit’s killing other people; people shooting at the squad and malicious snipers. Part of PID is going to be communication and communicating with the enemy the other part is direct observation of the possible hostile. Obviously, once someone directly identifies someone as hostile, they are to be taken out immediately.
 
The Personal Bubble
 
I’m a big advocate for having a personal bubble when it comes to other players. Rifle range is pretty far, but the most dangerous is within melee range. This is because a naked Bambi with nothing to lose can easily knock out a geared player and take his stuff with just a click of the mouse. The action generally happens so fast that no reaction can be made by the friendly player. I suggest that everyone draw a personal bubble around them. I like 3 meters because it’s well out of melee range and gives me a few steps of the hostile player for reaction. Seconds matter in combat, and if you can buy more time, you’re more likely to live.
My suggested action for the personal bubble, is if you are in the process of Shout, Show, Shoot and the player violates your personal bubble in the middle of this action, you are cleared hot and can justifiably kill them.
 
The Castle Defense (drawing a line in the sand)

This pertains more to holding a building, but can also be applied to stand-offs out in the open. The idea is to draw a line somewhere that is easily recognizable and tell the opposing players that you will not harm them, unless they cross that line. This can be as easy as, “Don’t come up the stairs to the hospital and we won’t shoot you.” To as arbitrary as “Take one step closer to me and I will kill you.” This helps maintain control of a situation while simultaneously giving you a physical location as to where you are cleared hot to fire.
 
If you do not agree with or take issue with these, privately take this to a superior and move it up the chain. If you cannot morally agree with these 3 basic rules, perhaps this Clan isn't for you. 
 
 
3) Forum Rules and Regulations


No Flaming
This means no Racism, Sexism, or any ism for that matter. There will no tolerance for harassment, or abuse upon any member in this forum. Beck's Privateers consists of people of different ages, genders, sexual orientations and ethnicities which whom all should be respected. Any user who fails to comply with this rule WILL BE BANNED!

Spamming
Spamming is unacceptable. If you are caught spamming (which you will) you will receive warning points. If you fail to stop, you will be banned.
 
Likes and posts
a. Do not post multiple times and create threads in order to boost your post count. Post thoughtful information (can be cross reference with rules 2 &amp; 4)
b. This rule ties with point a. Everyone loves likes. It shows that people agree with what you said and approve. Don't go seeking for likes i.e. requesting people to like your posts. Users found doing this will receive warning points.
 
Discussion and arguments
Forums are a place of discussion but once in a while somebody may disagree with you. Do not be inconsiderate or rude. Keep the argument short. If you feel that there needs to be more to talk about, use Teamspeak. Exceptions are major conflicts that need to be archived for future reference.This rule is to keep peace and lower the intensity of certain situations. Warning points or a ban will be given upon analysis of situation if this rule has been broken.
 
Back Seat Moderating
There will be no back seat moderating in this forum. Essentially this rule means that if members note an issue which does not cohere to a rule on this forum, they will not take it into their own hands. If you notice a rule being broken, report it to a forum moderator or a commanding officer for the situation to be resolved. If you are playing back seat, you will be given a warning point.
 
Personal attacks
-This rule can be cross-referenced with rule number 6. Essentially this rule states that no personal attacks should be made against other members. Keep discussion polite and friendly. We are a 18+ group and should act like one.
 
General posting
This is heavily quoted in the DayZ forums. LOOK BEFORE YOU POST! Always read before you post about a question or anything for that matter. 1st offense will be deemed as accidental but repeated failure to comply with this rule, will result in warning points.

5) Disputes


Anything you think is not fair or not better aiding the clan should immediately brought to the attention of your superior. Posting a giant thread on the forums about how you don't think things are fair will not aid your cause. Tell your Cabin boy who tells bosn and so on and so forth. At the end of the day this is BECKS Privateers and Beck and the command staff always takes into consideration what WE feel is best fr the community at the given time. nobody is forcing anybody to be here or to play our style. We ask that you let us know how you feel on subjects and we will try to help fix them instead of inciting dissension in the ranks.

 
6) Clan Purchasing/Donation


We have had a few incidents in the past that were (thankfully) peacefully resolved in terms of clan servers etc. At this current time we are not looking to setup or fund any clan servers for DayZ StandAlone. Although you are free to purchase them on your own we ask that you do not advertise or collect for ""BP Servers"".
We currently have a donation system set to becks personal paypal, which is currently used for funding our TS and Website fee's. If you would like to donate feel free, but it will not buy you ranks or progress you any through the clan, it is merely a simple gesture we appreciate.
 

7) Undermining the Clan


Like most clans we have had our run ins with players purposefully undermining authority to incite dissension amongst the ranks. Although we value everyone's opinion and we do take suggestions into consideration, people causing a ruckus or purposely instigating fights and topics will no longer be tolerated. You can express your opinion as much as you'd like but once you cross the line of fighting and not accepting the rules there will be consequences. At the end of the day the command staff is trying to make this the best community possible with the best reputation, we can't cater to 300 members and each of their own personal beliefs for what is best, but we  will try to keep the majority and their opinion at the forefront.",,False,,0,,[SA] ☞Beck's Privateers☜ - We're Back!

#/r/ShittyAdviceAnimals

A community for **1 year** with **2782 (million)** shitty advisers


Like every redditor that isn't worryingly masochistic, I love the internet. We have our disagreements, sure, who doesn't? And sometimes we want different things; like when I want to work or study or sleep and the internet wants to play [destructo tank](http://armorgames.com/play/24/indestructotank). But we always compromise, we find a common ground and we work it out. However this once, I have to put my foot down: ""meme"" is not a synonym for ""advice animal"". A picture of a person, animal or sometimes anthropomorphised inanimate object overlaid with two lines of humorous text is not the definition of ""meme"". That is an *advice animal*. A meme is 

&gt;""an idea, behavior or style that spreads from person to person within a culture.""[2] A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols or practices, which can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals or other imitable phenomena. 
- *wikipedia*


It's basically the cultural equivalent of a gene, and both word and concept were pulled out of fat air by Richard Dawkins in his really very fantastic *The Selfish Gene* (1976). So all advice animals are not memes, and all memes are not advice animals. It would be like calling all motorbikes Yamahas. Also: meme rhymes with cream. 

Phew! Today's featured sub takes the common advice animal and turns it inside out. It's a deconstruction of the ideas that define our good guy gregs and foul bachelor frogs. Some are [inventive re-imaginings of popular charicters](http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3pdai5/), some are [disturbing dolan-style grotesques](http://imgur.com/dDRrd), some are [anti-jokes](http://i.qkme.me/3pe3f3.jpg) and some are satirical barbs directed at [advice animals which suck and should not exist](http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3pejjq/). /r/ShittyAdviceAnimals is possibly the best image board on reddit. It is almost entirely fresh original content and I have had from it actual, real-life lols (so rare!). It is at that great place where the old users are active and practiced and the new users are enthusiasts who want to help create something beautiful (and not just make the most noise in the noisiest room) so when you go there thread carefully and try not to disturb the fragile natural balance of this precious internet ecosystem. Dont ruin it with your mucky boots! 

Also, /r/ShittyAdviceAnimals is the second-most mature (after /r/ShittyAdvice) member of the [Shitty Network](http://www.reddit.com/r/shittyhub) - a loose collective of awesome parody subreddits; check it out. (full disclosure - I'm up to my ankles in shitty reddits, dont hold that against them)


Thanks to Hansafan and Daskoon for answering my stupid questions. And props to Lord_Bumberchute, xXSmokeBlunts420Xx, and RT1000 for the awesomely shitty advice animals I stole.

&gt;## How do you feel about regular advice animals, and memes in general?

&gt;&gt; **Hansafan** I have a rather ambivalent relationship with memes. Some are great, or start out great, but either degenerate into pointless drivel or simply outlive their funniness. For example, I've long since given up on f7u12, still subbed, but I don't browse it. So much garbage... At least in SAA you know what you get. :P

&gt;&gt; **daskoon** If the regular advice animals are the mother of this sub, then I'd have to say that the shitty advice sub is the asshole father that banged our mom and ran off for a pack of cigarettes and never came back. I got the idea because I loved shitty advice, and... advice animals kept getting shittier and shittier. I wanted a home for those of us who... either just didn't get it, or love giving shitty advice via animals.

&gt;## Who is your favourite advice animal?

&gt;&gt; **Hansafan** I like socially awkward penguin, 'cause I'm basically him. I'm a bit fond of philosophy raptor too

&gt;&gt; **daskoon** My favorite advice animal would have to be a shitty one, who isn't really used anymore, but I'd like to bring her back... Terribly Lit Terrible Nurse Pitbull {credit to my wif} mostly because she's a great nurse, that fucks up sometimes because she's new. The advice from her just flows like so much period blood on a heavy week.

&gt;## If you could erase one thing off the internet forever, what would it be?

&gt;&gt; **Hansafan** Huh. Tough one.

&gt;&gt; **Daskoon** If I could erase one this from the Internet forever, I would have to go with Child Porn. I know, I know, sounds like a cop out, but well, that shit's just not right on so many levels. Being a father of a little girl, I couldn't imagine my baby being abused that way. Oh, also DRM! Fucking Diablo 3 kicked me out of my single player game because I was AFK for like 10 minutes. bastards.

&gt;## Jesus has descended from the clouds and grants you the power to set the homepage of every internet user on the planet, what page or image do you choose? Is it an advice animal?

&gt;&gt; **Hansafan** Spacedicks

&gt;&gt; **daskoon** Jesus? The Lord doth work in mysterious ways... um... I dunno.. Hamsterdance.com because fuck you, that's why.

&gt;## Special bonus message from daskoon!

&gt;&gt; I know there was no 5th question, so I'm just going to take this opportunity to thank all my shitty, shitty, subscribers. I'd also like to thank the Shitty Network, for boosting my numbers and awareness of this shit. I always thought this was just a dumb and shitty idea, and now... I've been shown just how dumb and shitty it is.",,False,,0,,"May 26th, 2012: /r/ShittyAdviceAnimals: a meme is a wish your heart makes",,,,,,0.0,,,False,t3_2bmp8j,False,,,,,1.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},,,1,,,,self,False,,,,,,True,,1406238956.0,,,,,,self.SROTD_Archives,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,t5_32mjb,,,,,2bmp8j,,,SROTDroid,,1,,,,,,,/r/SROTD_Archives/comments/2bmp8j/may_26th_2012_rshittyadviceanimals_a_meme_is_a/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/SROTD_Archives/comments/2bmp8j/may_26th_2012_rshittyadviceanimals_a_meme_is_a/,,1406235356.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441252566.0,,,

,pkmntcgcollections,"I started collecting Pokemon cards in 1999 when the craze hit America. I continued up until 2003, then gradually lost interest and quit. In 2010 HeartGold SoulSilver came out and rekindled that desire. I bought a HGSS booster box and started collecting again, attempting to complete all the old sets I had started as a kid. For whatever reason, I noticed Pinsir 9/64 made me feel really nostalgic. I remembered the first time I got one in a trade with a friend in 1999. Back then I didn't think it was anything special, but that nostalgic feeling made it become my new favorite card, and my favorite Pokemon, and I decided I'd start a Pinsir 9/64 collection. 

My main goal was to get this card in every language it was printed in, both 1st edition and unlimited. I finally completed that goal after years of watching eBay, trading, and buying from foreign card sites. I also discovered an error that just happened to be unique to Pinsir 9/64; a scratch-like mark over the 1st edition symbol that somehow occurred during the printing process. This error has kept me searching for Pinsirs ever since, which is nice because my collection never has to be truly complete. So far I've obtained 6 of them, and know of 2 others belonging to collectors that I may be purchasing eventually. I'd also like to get a PSA 10 English 1st edition and unlimited, and already own a PSA 10 Japanese that isn't pictured.

Video Synopsis:

In this episode Coe returns from the short break he took caving and refocuses on the railway station and using the iron he collected from his caving trip to attempt to complete the Water Base track. He finally has enough iron with some rails left over and has connected the water base to the railway station. Coe then decides the next thing he needs to do is create a better way to get on and off the track inside the base and set up a booster for return travel. He sets this up in the tunnel towards the dungeon hut. He then thinks out a cool way of entering the base by building a glass tunnel from the surface down into the base. After having a close call with drowning he expands the width of the bridge the track goes on and lays down the glass for either side. He then removes the water inside and places down the rails. Once connected Coe realizes another little problem he wishes to fix, as it stands the track into the base isn't very safe and he would like to secure it up further, so he raises the glass up to make it a safe entrance into the base. Now all that is left is to test the connection so Coe rides the track back towards the station but upon arrival runs into a problem where he ends up in the PEZ dispenser, Coe then realizes he will need to fix that small error at some point. However in the meantime he wants to keep his focus on track no. 3. He renames the track at the station and chooses track 3 as the destination to try a return trip which is completed without issue. So now Coe has a fully functional track from the rail station to the water base and back, now just a few small improvements need to be made to finalize the rail station and it will be complete.

,AskHR,"I looked at the sidebar and I'm fairly sure this fits the rules. If I mismatched it though, I'm happy to repost elsewhere.

My girlfriend is a really, really good employee-- They've tried to put her on salary/promotion *many* times. She saves their ass almost daily. Comes in early when requested. She has the most available hours of anyone else in the restaurant next to the manager, who by contrast, always forgets little important things like paperwork and gives himself every weekend off.

In May, she was working between two branches to help a second branch get on its feet. At the second location they gave her a dollar raise to cover the cost of transit. Eventually, they pulled her back to her original branch, with a promise to give that dollar raise back at her first branch because, quote, ""you're worth it"". *We have this promise in text with a timestamp for 4/2/14*. This is exactly at the end of a pay cycle.

As of her next pay cycle, 4/17, she was still at her original rate. Now, 3.5 months later, we noticed that she is *still* at that rate and we are pissed. By now this amounts to probably $490 in back wages.

She already wants to quit but I want her to hold on until she has a new place to go. This, however, has steeled her resolve to leave as quickly as possible. 

Today, she had a talk with the manager that promised the raise; From what I've heard, his response was ""we'll see what we can do about back pay, and we'll get the raise processed ASAP"", with an added tone of ""you should feel lucky the owner agreed to *look into* back pay, and it's your fault for not noticing sooner"", which (true or not) has inflamed us further.

This upcoming week, she has a particularly heavy scheduled work week because damn near every *other* important/skilled employee is leaving for one reason or another. We see this as one of a few opportunities to get that back pay.

 - On one hand, the owner could come through on the back pay. That would be nice.

 - I'm not sure of our legal grounds concerning this back pay. Do we have the right to demand it, considering we have her manager's text?

 - If he refuses to pay (he's known for being cheap), and knowing she intends to quit once she has somewhere else to go, is it perhaps acceptable to hold her labor hostage until she's given said backpay?

 - If not, perhaps it is reasonable to demand a *higher* raise than the one initially offered? She won't get all the money back but that's at least some recompense.

 - If it comes to a legal situation, we don't want to bankrupt ourselves over $500 or less. Is there a low cost arena (like small claims court, or something) where we can demand backed wages and be paid? Would this text promise and the accompanying pay stubs be enough evidence to prove it?

As a final note. I am not personally mad at the manager. He is forgetful, and so I truly believe this was a mere oversight on his part. I knew that he would try to instate that raise immediately to apologize, and that the back pay is beyond his authority. Still, we would not intend to take an owner's refusal of recompense lightly if we felt we had some legal ground to demand it.

Thanks for any advice you can give, HR.

EDIT: Breaking news update. The owner has said he doesn't want to pay her. Big surprise. But she's asked me to name a fair amount and this might mean he's asked *her* what she wants. I told her I can't just give her the number but that we'll be demanding it based on the hours we can prove she worked in documentation, and to collect as much evidence (past schedules, etc) as she can at work as possible. I'm translating all of this stuff through texts.

EDIT2: From end of April (2 pay checks from the promised date, it should certainly have gone through by then) she allegedly worked enough to earn roughly $425. I've told her to confirm that and get it in writing. She's also told me that the owner wants to talk to her and the end of the shift. She's very, very nervous. She does not do well under this pressure. She wants me to be there, in about an hour to help her. I'm also nervous. If anyone catches this in time, I want to know what is fair to do.

**EDIT3**: So, here's what ended up happening, HR. We're very happy with the outcome. I'll treat it like any other post, not just an edit, for good storytelling.

I arrived at her workplace and waited for her shift to end. The manager greeted me like he normally does. He tries to be cordial, and is generally a good guy, despite getting us into this mess by forgetting to initiate the pay raise.

After a few minutes, she came out to me and gave me a few words. While we were talking, she realized I had something wrong. We weren't going to be negotiating with the owner. We'd be talking to the *manager*. I looked over at him as he worked. It made me a little easier, he was a bit of a softer target. Even so, I was prepared for a different animal and had to get up to date with everything. I asked her for her phone, so I could read the text she got that promised the raise. She gave it to me, and I started reading.

&gt;Girlfriend: Thanks for the raise, by the way. It really helps a lot.

&gt;Owner: No problem. Let's get this place prepared and ready.

My heart quickened. No, no, *no*. This was not what I thought it was going to be. What she thought was an in-writing promise for a raise was really a vague acknowledgement of an unspecified dollar value. Not only is a text shaky grounds as-is for a raise to that was *verbally* promised and defined as it is, but the terms of the raise were never specified in writing and the owner only barely acknowledged it in passing! He could deny the entire thing, stating ""I have no idea what she was talking about, we were busy and I breezed past it to get her to work"". This was bad, this was *bad*, and I was suddenly nervous.

I decided to open the bid and try to get the manager to just accept 80% of the wages. 80% was respectable with no proof, right? And I'd negotiate down to a minimum of 60% before escalating the changes. She couldn't afford to quit, not in a million years-- We needed that income, and she didn't have a satisfactory job offer to replace this one yet. We had planned for her to stay in the safe place until a good opportunity came and we weren't ready for this confrontation and I've never negotiated before and this was all happening too fast and--

I received a text from a co-worker of hers:

&gt;Friend: Help your girlfriend!

I looked over and in my distracted thoughts, I realized her manager had started negotiations without me! Much less, he had her physically backed into a corner (not threateningly, that was where she worked, but he was large enough to basically block her way. If he wanted to make a power play of it, he could have.

I put on my coolest face and walked up to them. He turned and smiled toward me with a friendly ""hey"". I replied in kind.

&gt;Me: Hey, what's going on?

&gt;Girlfriend: Uh, hey. You don't have to be here for this, I'll let you know when we're done.

&gt;Me: Are you sure?

&gt;Girlfriend: Yeah, I'm okay. I'll talk to you soon.

With that, ever nervously, I walked away. Desperate to communicate a baseline for her, I walked away in a direction such that her manager's view was blocked by a support beam. As I crossed that boundary I lifted a hand with four fingers, meant to signal ""*Ask for $400*"", and hope she got the message.

I returned to my thinking area and watched. His view of me was blocked but I was doing everything I could to know and hear what was happening. 

Unfortunately, I have terrible hearing and wasn't able to get any of it. I sat quietly, helplessly, as my girlfriend possibly let him take advantage of her... Scenarios went through my head about her crying on my shoulder on the way home. No, she's not like that. She'd be angry. Raging. She'd be wanting to quit and once again I'd have to talk her off the ledge and tell her to be patient and bide her time until a better offer came along. *Play it safe*.

Awareness returned to me as their negotiation broke. She quietly grabbed her things and met me as we headed out the door. When we got to my car, she told me the story from her perspective.

Earlier that day, as she arrived, her manager didn't have much to say. He had just realized his mistake in not processing the raise, and hadn't even contacted the owner yet about backed pay. So, like a normal day, they worked together. Things were probably tense between them a bit, I'm speculating.

Later in the day, he had talked to her. The owner had flat-out denied to pay anything back, and my girlfriend scoffed. A little while later, the manager came back-- the owner had upped his offer to a measly $100, and then $125. At this point, he asked her about negotiation after work and she texted me about it.

When negotiation time finally came, what I saw as a power play was in fact merely them working side-by-side and then him starting as she clocked out. She wasn't threatened by it, so even if he had meant it as such, the play had no power on her confidence. The following is a rough paraphrase from her rough recollection, but as accurate as I can get it.

&gt;Manager: So, the owner offered $100 and then $125...

&gt;Girlfriend: [rolls eyes] Yeah, no...

&gt;Manager: And I want to offer you $200.

&gt;Girlfriend: [narrowed, angry eyes] When I come to work here, I don't bullshit around. I'm not lazy, I skip breaks, I stay late and come early. I get it done. I deserve to be paid what I'm owed. When I left (previous employer), it took me less than a *week* to find a new job. And if I were to leave here, it would be a mere inconvenience to get another one.

Apparently, just after this is when I walked over and we had our little dialog. Having spouted such incredibly confident words, she felt okay in dismissing me, which must have made her look that much more fearsome (for I'm usually the one speaking for her in tense situations). Anyway, so I left.

&gt;Manager: You're right, you deserve this. And we *definitely* can't afford to lose you. I'm going to call the owner and tell him that we're paying you what you're owed, I'm going to get it in writing, and I'm going to make sure you see it on your next paycheck. Plus the raise is obviously in effect as of this morning when you clocked in. You know, I'm actually really glad and proud of you for denying the $200 offer. I had to make the offer so I could tell the owner that I made it, but it's a low-ball and I'm glad to see you're getting what is owed to you. We definitely can't afford to lose you here.

And they were right. The staff are a tad overworked as it is. If she, possibly the *most* heavily worked employee there, were to quit... Well, let's just say that her threat was not an empty one, and the manager knew it. And, were she to leave, most employees would quit from the pressure of picking up her workload alone, leaving the entire workplace run by just two people.

It was absolutely astounding and inspiring to hear her talk this way. She had never been so confident before. She knew exactly what her leverage was-- not even preparing for it. She didn't realize just how comfortable she was making these demands until they were in her face about it. And boy, was she happy to get it all. Frankly, had I stepped in, we'd have come off much worse simply because I knew we had no substance.

The manager assured us that all of what they discussed would be in writing. And it will, because she won't stick around long if they try and fuck around with her on it. I was so proud of her, and we celebrated that night in more ways than one. Since that moment she's become very visually more confident. I guess it was just the boost she needed to finally see herself as what I try to show her every day. But, that's for another story.

It's also worth noting after the fact that I like her manager as a person. Despite some inconsistencies and mistakes he makes, he is generally a good guy. I genuinely believed that it was a mistake on his part and not a deliberate act. And I was glad to hear of his soft-handed approach to the negotiation. Even if he had to pay it out of his own share of the store's profit, he knew what he had to do to make things right and cared more about keeping her than keeping the dollar. I respect him for this and as of yesterday we resumed good terms with them all. She even came in later to see if they needed more help. It's just the kind of worker she is.

And she's getting what she was owed.",,False,,0,,"My girlfriend was promised a raise, and we realized she never got it 3.5 months later.

,bravefrontier,"After just playing around with squads, I realized there aren't many types of teams you could make. Mono, BB spam, crits.

After looking at the splash art on the summons page, I thought why not make archetype units.  Similar to rainbow units, there could be a new leader skill that buff certain units.  For example, Sodis could give a buff to Guardian units, such as Farlon, and Lunaris. It also goes off the unit lore as well.  It gives another dimension to squad building. 

 It could be a bonus buff (as to not be useless without the rest of the set) as well, so that you don't have to spend tons of gems just to pull those archetypes. So Sodis would have the 15% reduction from dark as well as a 15% (?) buff to all Guardian units. Also gives new purpose to older units so power creep doesn't rule them out completely.  

Ruler units such as Falma, Sergio and Lidith could be given 70% atk boost to put them back on as viable units if they are all in the same squad.  
It gives a little more incentive to collect units as well as breathe life back into outdated units and the game itself.

,RotMG,"So, first off, let me give a little intro. I got good feedback from my first pervious dungeon idea called The Hall of The Guardians. (http://www.reddit.com/r/RotMG/comments/24gmzc/new_dungeon_idea_hall_of_the_guardians/) 

------------

So, after a little while later, a new idea came into my mind. It was a pretty simple idea, yet it still fit into the idea of realm. In my opinion, Mad Lab doesn't fit into the time realm was placed in. Again, this is only my opinion, because I do enjoy labs as anyone else does. But on to the important things. Crystal Mines are supposed to be maze-like such as a Davy Jones Locker. Find a key, advance forward, except in this case, it's a bit different. There are three crystals. A Fire Crystal, Water Crystal, and an Ice Crystal. These crystals are very similar to a regular crystal in realms, in fact, I took the same sprite from a regular crystal and recolored it a bit. I will get to them later. The point of the dungeon is to find each crystal and destroy it and each god within the crystal. Breaking a crystal releases a god, killing the god will make it drop a gem. The gem in Crystal Mines acts like a key in Davy Jones. Once all three gems are collected, a door will open for every player to go through to fight a secondary boss like in the Mad Lab. Here's my idea pretty much. Davy Jones + Mad Lab = Crystal Mines.

------------

To start off, lets get the portal and key out of the way.

Key - http://imgur.com/3RSbRc4

Portal - http://imgur.com/ZLfsb40

Key and Portal are very simple. The Key has gem on it, and the portal is a mountain with railroad track going into it.

Onto the dungeon itself!


------------

Throughout the dungeon, you'll encounter enemies that want to kill you. I mean, what were you expecting? A walk in the park? (Heh, that should be my next dungeon idea).

Stone Snail - http://imgur.com/nXmP52m

HP - 10,000 

Def - 20 (x2) (Armored in some phases)

Attack 1 - Shoots a 150 damage bullet

Attack 2 - Leaves a trail behind which causes a Petrified status effect for 5 seconds. (Refer to The Hall of The Guardians for more details on the effect)

------------


Gem Bombers - http://imgur.com/mYEKaHV (When killed, they will explode on the spot of death.)

HP - 2,000

Def - 10

Attack - None (When exploding, shots will do 200 damage)


------------

Rock Goo - http://imgur.com/P89cTVq

HP - 7500

Def - 15

Attack 1 - Shoot three bullets which do 100 damage and cause a 5 second blind

Attack 2 - leaves a trail which petrifies the user for 5 seconds.

------------


Great! That covers all of the enemies for the content of the dungeon. Except, I want to add one little thing.

Boulders - http://imgur.com/jT089eV

HP - 500

Def - 0

Attack - They roll from wall to wall. 250 Damage

 A boulder can come across the path randomly and do some serious damage, so you want to make sure you avoid them at all costs. 

Now! For the crystals, bosses, and loot!

------------

First off, all crystals are the exact same, but with different colors. 

Fire Crystal - http://imgur.com/CzAkFcu

Water Crystal - http://imgur.com/pX0LVnt

Ice Crystal - http://imgur.com/r0FNS59

------------

Crystals cannot heal themselves like the ordinary crystal. The reason they do not heal themselves is because the dungeon would not be soloable, and most people I know love to solo dungeons.

------------


Fire, Water, and Ice Crystal

HP - 50,000

Def - 20

Attack - Big white bullets blind and quiet for 10 seconds.

Shots - 16 (Like a regular crystal)

Once a boss is killed, it will drop a gem of the color it is which will open the doors to the secondary boss room.

Gems


Fire - http://imgur.com/NGepRAh

Water - http://imgur.com/lPiMgn8

Ice - http://imgur.com/2VD7hmD

------------

When you see the secondary boss door opened, you will have to make your way down a fairly long hall. Going down this hall will be a tad tedious. While trying to get the secondary boss, boulders will be coming down the path, you must break a boulder to keep pressing forward. The boulders do not stop coming at you until you reach a certain point in the hallway. You must step on a switch for the boulders to stop. (The switch will be out of the way of the boulders so you don't continuously get hit.)

------------

~Secondary Boss~


Crystalous - http://imgur.com/uqOsf0V

HP - 60,000

Def - 20

Attack - (Inherits all attacks of the first three bosses)

------------

Now, most of you probably realized the three unmentioned status effects. Frozen, Burning, and Soaked. I will explain each one.


All of them are very simple:

Burning: Is a bleed + Unstable + (slight) dex boost.

Soaked: Stops MP from regenerating.

Frozen: Keeps you from moving or attacking. It's basically stunned + paralyzed.



Now! For the loot!!

------------

Vulcan - Dexterity and Vitality Pots

UT Drop - Fire Crystal Bow - http://imgur.com/QoUAyxW

Shot of the Fire Crystal Bow - http://imgur.com/xzr5iMm

Range: 7

Damage: 600-700 (Avg: 650)

This magical bow was crafted from the fire of Vulcan, its flames still linger within the bow.

Rate of Fire: 33.33%

Effect: Lose 50 HP for every shot fired.

(Not effected by berserk boost.)


------------

Paria - Attack and Wisdom

UT Drop - Water Crystal Staff - http://imgur.com/NRexYa6

Shot of the Water Crystal Staff - http://imgur.com/0D7Zx0j

Range: 8.55

Damage: 70-80 (Avg: 75)

This magical staff was crafted by the crystal miners. It’s power increases when submerged in water.

When submerged in water, the power of the staff increases to 100-150.


------------

Delphlas - Speed and Defense

UT Drop - Ice Crystal Sword - http://imgur.com/1oF4y2j (Sprite Artwork by /u/fatkidsgowii84 ) 

Ice Crystal Sword Shot - http://imgur.com/GH3jUSV

Range: 2.5

Damage: 200 - 250 (Avg: 225)

This frosted blade is so cold that pierces its first target and kills its second target.

(In a nutshell, the sword pierces its first target only, if it hits a second target, it will not pierce.)

------------

Crystalous - Defense Potions - Loot Chest

Seal of Crystals - http://imgur.com/mbD0vpq

Effect: Heals user + party for 5 squares at 150 HP instantly; also adds damaging for 5 seconds.

MP Cost: 90

* Crafting material bag drop rates don't change. (This includes the drop rate of the bag and the content of the bag). (I averaged .935 crafting material bags per box).
* Raw crafting materials only come from champion or veteran containers (or champ bags). (I averaged 0.241 per container).

*****  
**What is the quality of the items that drop?** Using the intersection of the two scenarios, I extrapolated a 98% confidence interval of the mean quality drop rate assuming a player has 0% Magic Find. (See the section below for information regarding the chance for additional items to actually occur).

Guaranteed Roll - Mean Quality Drop Rate with 0% MF

Quality|Min|Max
:--|:--|:--                              
Ascended|0|0.003
Exotic|0|0.003
Rare|0.014|0.024
Masterwork|0.970|0.986

Other Rolls - Mean Quality Drop Rate with 0% MF

Quality|Min|Max
:--|:--|:--                              
Ascended|0|0
Exotic|0|0
Rare|0.003|0.011
Masterwork|0.012|0.034
Fine|0.008|0.014
Common|0.069|0.088
Junk|0.853|0.908

*****

**What about the chance to get those items?** You are guaranteed to get 1 roll (seen above as the guaranteed roll). I averaged 0.84 other equipment/junk item rolls per box. I averaged 0.333 Scrolls of Knowledge per basic box.

I didn't do a confidence interval because the data I collected has an unexpected interaction with Magic Find and the number of items that dropped. The number of Scrolls of Knowledge dropped by a rather sizable amount as my magic find increased. (Two sided t-test yields a 7.58% chance they have the same mean). I'd ignore this if it were alone, but I saw this same impact twice more. The probability of getting no additional items (beyond the guarantee) increased as my Magic Find increased. I saw this in the common boxes (6.28% two-sided t-test) and in the veteran/champion boxes (13.7% two-sided t-test). More testing needs to be done. However, the data I collected supports the hypothesis that as your magic find increases, the number of additional drops you receive decreases. 

Alternatively, since I opened the MF boosted boxes last, it's possible that the anti-farming mechanisms kicked in and caused the decrease in drops.

,SkincareAddiction,"Here's my biggest problem area:
http://imgur.com/rNspK8N
I hate them, and even when I used to try to physically express them when I was ignorant they stood strong.

I uses to suffer from pretty awful acne but now only get the occasional zit/pimple that seems to go away within a day or two. I used to pop them immediately. I didn't have acne anymore, so I began to worry/focus on my ""whiteheads"" on my chin, nose, &amp; t-zone. Squeezing with the force of a brute and using one of those 'blackhead tools' on my clogged stuffs. I felt satisfied going out with pores clean from my hard labors &amp; bruising, for the day they lasted -_- (red flag, duh). I also would lean on: 

Clarisil Oil-Free wash
Neutrogena Pore Refining Cleasner
Neutrogena Deep Clean daily wash 

Many times I would leave these 
products on overnight to rid myself of acne and an attempt to keep my pores clean &amp; maybe unclog them. Really though, I was just shooting in the dark until I took a chance in visiting this subreddit. My skin suffered flaking, tightness, redness, &amp; I looked like a tomato on prom night...a sexy, acne-free, flaking tomato. Anywho, been on this for a bit over a week, have no acne, but I'm pushing for the chin here.

AM: 
Stridex (red) Max Strength pads
Simple Ultra-light gel moisturizer
La Roche-Posay anthelios 60 ultra light sunscreen fluid 

PM: 
OCM with mineral oil
Cerave foaming cleanser
Olay regenerist night resurfacing elixir

I've ordered the 8% AHA toner from Silk Naturals and plan to order the St. Ives scrub-free Exfoliating pads as well, for good measure/variety. Not going to stack the AHA's on top another though, just collecting &amp; playing the field a bit. It's also worth noting these two AHA products combined in price are still cheaper than the Olay regenerist I've been using. 

I feel I'm lacking in my BHA's, but that my acne will be kept under control with just the Stridex in any case. Any recommendations? I picked this up: 
http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0067H6MC0?pc_redir=1405778565&amp;robot_redir=1
I don't know if I even want to use it, it's 1% SA and has some other ingredients that make it out to be 3-5x expensive as other neutrogena products in the same all-in-one category. I've picked up on the consensus that salicylic acid is not effective when used in a wash as it needs to sit on the face for a prolonged period to have effect, this calls for applying a layer and leaving it. (This is why I would leave these cleansers on my face beforehand, because it's what killed the acne. Is this *always* a bad thing to do?) 

I'm curious if anyone would recommend picking up the Alpha Hydrox wipes [in the 14%]? I like the Olay serum I'm using @ 8-10% and it doesn't seem to be doing any damage or tightness. It feels unnoticeable, although I put it on right before bed, I don't feel tightness or discomfort within the half hour--hour or so I'm awake with it. Have you found distinct benefits to different AHA's (glycolic, lactic) or is it really in the quality, concentration, and consistent use of a product [any AHA] for the moneymaker results?

OCM: there's a lot of threads in this, I'm likely going to implement other oils beyond mineral to better nourish my skin as well as clear my chin up and out. I like it, I like it a lot. I'm not concerned with acne as much as the pic'd chin, specific suggestions welcomed.

I plan to make my own vitamin C serum via a google searched recipe and inserting that into my (AM) regimen. Any suggestions for added ingredients for a skin enlivening boost in the serum?

Also plan to get a retinol script or something on the shelves.
When might it be a good time to start the PM sluglyf when the Olay is supposed to sit overnight/""replace your nightly moisturizer?

,EngineeringStudents,"I am working on the orientation team for my college's engineering department this year and courtesy of a very strong recruiting team, weird admissions policies at universities which usually would compete for the same students, a change of many schools to holistic admissions, and a boost in our ranking, we have a really high proportion of students who are chasing 4.0 at pretty much any cost (we held a ""pre-orientation"" day and it was pretty evident during the tour and the question time). 

Some quotes to give you an idea of what I mean: 

Future Student: 

""Is 70 hours of study a week sufficient to get an A in every class?""

""Can I get a textbook list to pre-read over the summer?""

""What percentages are required to be in the top 10% of the class?""

""When can we starting obtaining homework and and syllabi?""

Didn't have any of the usual questions about best places to eat, or what to pack regarding the weather (need rain shoes at my school and rainboots can quickly become your most valued possession) or what clubs are available, or what are the most valuable resources provided by the school, or anything. 

As part of the pre-orientation, we also held a scavenger hunt to familiarize them with the campus. Idea was to build teamwork and familiarize a few students with each other. Nothing was on the line and it was all meant to be good fun. What occurred was one of the most serious scavenger hunts possible for one team (keeners all clumped together). They huddled, split the map into quadrants, gave two quadrants (""avoiding errors"") to each person, completed the list, and nervously stood there while the sheets were ""graded"".  You could see the fear plainly on their faces! Trembling, lip biting ect For a fucking scavenger hunt! They also ended up winning, but there was no benefit to a win. They all collectively sighed and move their brains to their next worry. 

We have the actual orientation for students in the fall, so any advice for how to calm them down? I usually wouldn't care, but there are a lot of them this year and I want to avoid any unpleasant incidents (academic suicides) and also want to help fill the design teams and other clubs (they are undermanned as it is and losing 25% of the class to study shut in is not helpful).

,KeepWriting,"The village was on the edge of becoming a town. A few breeze block buildings were starting to replace the wooden shacks. Picturesque would be the local tourist office’s description (if such a thing existed,) poverty stricken would be more accurate. Oxen wandered the mud street. A motorised cart and bike had crashed, blood was smeared over the combined wreck. The driver of the bike had been beaten badly by the crowd. Who decided that he was responsible doesn't matter. He lay on the verge slowly bleeding out, two broken femurs, a ruptured spleen and liver, or something like that. The beating had been horrific. Most of the people in the bar had tried to outdo each other with sick jokes, and some had just kept playing cards. It’s that kind of bar. A lot of the customers had clearly enjoyed the street theatre, it sickened Jack but he never let it show.


This was their last night before shipping out. 30 convicts turned soldiers allowed a brief taste of freedom. Jack could see each member of his squad indulging in a range of carnal sins. Gambling, whoring, fighting and even ones that inventive minds had not yet found names for. Steady streams of men were taking in turns going upstairs with the bargirls. Jack was just focusing on getting as drunk as possible. He’d decided to break new records in this field after practising for years. Escape had been his first instinct, but the bastards planned this out perfectly, no chance. Once the ship took off there would be no chance. Smith had joined Jack in an epic attempt to out-drink the place. They were sitting at the bar and going from left to right along the shelves. The current concoction was bright yellow and sticky.


“Fuck this shit”


“You’re looking at this all wrong” Smith downed the vomit in a glass. “This is the best thing that has ever happened to us, freedom and the chance to fucking kill some Kawals man.”


“I just....” he left the thought unsaid


“I mean you volunteered right? You couldn't be naive enough to think they’d let you get out of it?”


Jack knew that Smith had a point. It was good to be out of the maximum security facility, while he had volunteered, it was under duress. The warden at the prison had made it very clear that anyone not volunteering would be viewed as unpatriotic, with all that entailed. In the end only half of the prisoners had been passed the physical and psychiatric evaluation. That half of the prisoners were deemed acceptable was what made Jack nervous. He had assumed he would be able to lie, cheat or just run away. No chance to get away during training, 14 days of accelerated VR immersion, time had been slowed to one eighth.  It looked like he could run away from here, on paper. He knew that realistically the roads would be manned by guards the sky was thick with drones. Most of these were probably unrelated but a few would be keeping an eye on them, a very good simulation of freedom. Besides they had started the alcohol before they even landed, a crate of vodka supplied on the transport. Jack tore up a beer mat, slowly ripping it into as many pieces as possible. He’d got away with so many things in his life, tested his luck again and again. He knew that it showed that the world had finally looked him over, like a taxman wondering why this person had got rebates despite never paying a cent. Despite it being fully predictable and understandable he still felt a little aggrieved. He’d never killed anyone per se.


---------------------


Praetor Valen stood on the foredeck and watched the destruction. Girders and metal plating peeled off the deviant’s ship and floated away. The battle was over and under normal circumstances he would have called off the attack, sent in his troops and tortured every last drop of information out of the survivors. Today he had received a report that the enemy ships had begun self destructing when boarded. Kindness was a virtue and he was surely showing it today. Smiting the devil worshipers mercifully, delivering them to judgement. Kinetic charges fired from rail guns smashed into the under hull of the crippled ship. The Praetors ship, The Fortress was the superior and combined with the surprise attack it had been no contest.


He smiled and looked around him, sad that he would not be able to convince the infidels of the error of their ways, but happy at this clear expression of Gods love. He loved watching the fear in their eyes and the slow realization that they had been wrong, hearing them renounce Satan and beg for forgiveness. But destroying them came close. The newly fitted beam weapon slowly sliced the battle cruiser in half.  The battle clock showed 27 minutes elapsed. Valen cut an imposing figure, Dark black combat armour with a blood red cross emblazoned on the front, a giant ruby in the centre. Campaign medals emblazoned his chest. Over all this he wore his ceremonial robes. At 6 foot he was shorter than most other monks on the ship, an unpleasant feeling. He had boosters in his boots, he worried that everyone knew. But now was a time of triumph, to put away these silly doubts.


“Magnify the main section.”


He watched as bodies floated into space, some struggled then stilled. The view idled for a few minutes then switched back to the forward section, large flashes tore across it. The main magazine must have caught. The battle was truly over now. A collective sigh of relief went through the crew. Valen stifled his anger, the victory had been inevitable. The lack of faith they showed was infuriating. He pressed the intercom connection.


“Congratulations. The battle is over now and we have to honour this glorious moment I ask you all to join me in a short silent prayer. Well done men”


The battle had been easy but the vanguard would see more violence as it continued its advance. Now was for celebration and thanks. The advance scything through Kawal space would bring death, he knew that every man on the ship would gladly martyr themselves if need be. On his holo-screen he brought up a rotating image of their destination, a brown planet largely covered in industrial complexes and giant shipyards. Destined for conversion.

,leagueoflegends,"Okay, so I'm not sure if anyone else is getting these messages from bots and random spammed friend requests from ""VisitLolAcademy"" or ""LolAcademydotcom"" and what not. But, isnt this against the rules? I mean, at first i thought it was just a coaching website which is y'know, what ever, I couldn't care less if rich kids want to pay $100 to be told to ""Hit the big minion for extra gold!"", but its a little worse than that. They are offering coaching AND boosting. I put in some fake details and they wanted to charge me almost $1500 to get me from G1, to D1. And its not just they help you or something, it actually says, they will go on your account. They write things like

""Our experts will play on your account and boost you as fast as humanly possible.""

""Our system also allows multiple boosters to play on your account so there is no idle time.""

""This is where you will give us the information we need to log in on your account and start your elo boost""

Its getting out of hand.. honestly... Bots and boosters in League, I know its been a thing for a while, but why aren't we doing anything about it? I know riot has their hands full, but a website like this is pretty bad to leave up and running, collecting peoples money. Don't get me wrong Riot is doing a great job, and i love them for it... anyway, I ranted on too long, now I have to do TL;DR's...

,summonerschool,"**LET ME TELL YOU SUPPORTS HOW TO CARRY**

any specific questions, message me or leave a comment and i will address. 

* **PICK GOOD CHAMPS**

Aphromoo's suport teir list: braum, thresh, nami, afk, feed. Personal note: morg is fuckin op. pick those champs. (would not recommend picking afk or feed. pretty underpowered this patch. still better than janna, though.)

* **PRACTICE**

be dedicated to your art. support is a unique playstyle. if mastered, you too can carry games vicariously through your allies. they are your weapons. pick from the list of good champs and spam the living shit out of them. 

learn basic math. know your build route, how much it will cost, how many consumables you will need, dont rush sightstone like a mad man thinking the gold efficiency will win you the game, count your tank waves. 

**Learn the ward game.** Learn how long your wards last, know not only how many wards you have, but how many they have. learn where they ward. Keep track of their ward count everytime they go into fog of war. They went river for a sec? did their ward count go down by one? then theres a ward in river. you dont pay attention to the creep wave like a carry does. 

practice your **mechanics,** practice ward tricks (if you know they have a sweep available, throw trinket ward, THEN longer duration ward, use their greed to their disadvantage: place a pink to let them kill it, use it to set up a snare or hook as they sit and kill it 300g&gt;100g), practice warding the tri brush over drag pit (its hard), practice your harass, give presence in lane. dont neglect your farm or gold generation, learn auto attack distances of your enemy. 

* **MINDSET**

As a support, **YOU ARE THE GAME MASTER.** You are the gamemaster, and the rest of your teammates are the players in your game. *You control the game's difficulty for the rest of them.* You play well: that means the rest of your team is playing league on easy. Nice. You play your heart out and set up kills fucking everywhere, you light that fucking map UP. You call the shots, you watch out for the bloodthirsty soldiers. YOU CONTROL THE FIGHTS. If a fight goes wrong, that is because you let it go wrong. Make the enemy suffer, and watch your team rake them in. You will go unnoticed and unpraised, for 90% of the shit you do. 

**STATS and ITEMS**

as a support: CDR and MOVESPEED. You are utility, so you need to be casting spells all the time, everywhere. HP is decent for taking a licking and staying in the fray casting yo shit. 

* **Morgana.**

pick this champ. Aphro's list is good, sure. But he is LCS. You are not. Morg can carry games. her utility, catch, black shield, and even her kill potential are some of the best all round for a support. I frequently end games as 2nd highest damage. AS SUPPORT MORG. Next highest is whoever I CHOOSE IT TO BE. If my adc sucks, roam mid when you can, get mid fed, get drag control, light the map up, do not engage when black shield is down, be smart. 

*Black shield* - cait traps, jinx snares, zyra snares, alistar stuns, trist bleeds, thresh everything, nami everything, cait-ashe-jinx slows (even though its phys dmg you can negate the slow and gtfo), ashe ult, ETC. AND THATS JUST IN LANE. **Black shield is OP.** USE IT. 

Your snare is godly. Get good at landing it by learning how to read your enemy. Dont watch your cs, watch THEIRS. something low? they will go in and auto the cs, you will auto THEM, they are on the fringe? SNARE. lane a snare? W for harass. 

*POOL OF MONEY* - Use this to generate decent money in lane. It's an instant, so its easy money. Usually procs all 3 frostfang charges in one W. dont put this in the middle of cs if you can avoid it, let your adc control the wave best as possible. dont spam this. you will oom much faster. 

*Ult* - use for burst dmg for kills in lane, easy to proc the stun if they are already snared. if they are engaging hard, use. if they are fleeing, use to slow and land a snare easier. low cd, easy to use, good results.

out of lane phase, **WARD YO SHIT.** This goes for any support, but double for champs with such good catch. get a sweep, throw sand in their eyes. 

**ROAM** like mad. I have movespeed quints cause Q is a kill on a 10 second cooldown. 

Build order is important. Armguard is good for lane, zhonya's is essential for teamfights, Liandry's is core for me. obviously sightstone and frostfang. 6th item depends, what i like to get in order of pref: deathcap, rylais, abyssal, or twin shadows. DC for all around kit boosting. Rylais for hp and synergy with liandry's, also better slows on ult and W is a slowing field now. Abyssal for niche games, and twin shadows if your catch is bad or vision game is lacking. Never do voidstaff on support morg. Locket is decent, but i dont get it for morgana. 

*SKILLS:* Morg is easy to skill. max Q first. Not only does it increase its damage, but also the snare duration. Very important. Max black shield second. More shield, more OP. Get one level in W at level 3 to start the gold generation. R when you can. 

*RUNES:* magicpen reds, armor yellows, magic resist per level blues (can use cdr if you want cdr early, and dont mind overcaping later), and movespeed quints. 

* **Thresh**

if you cant pick morg, pick thresh. Yes he may be hard, but you will learn.  his playmaking per game is a highlight reel waiting to happen. i get midair trist hooks and flays, I cancel jarvan combos, etc. 

*Hook* - His Q has a delay. Just takes practice to learn. Your first few games will be tough. Stick with it. Once you master it: lol gg to ez peace out twitch.tv/insertthreshplayerhere. I got people calling me god for snaring trist mid air. I DO THAT DAILY. Leona? LeNOna. Jarvan never looked more sad when i stepped on the rift. No slip and slide today J4. POOL'S CLOSED.

*Lantern* - lolnope.jpg in a spell. Take a bit of time to land, so predict when someone might need it, before they do. That sets up an instant lantern they can use. Use good lantern placement: try not to throw on 5 million cs and watch you ally try to cs instead of whoosh to safety. use to engage a jungler to a lane gank. Use for vision if checking brush or drag. Dont use to collect souls if there are enemy around. dont be over soul hungry. dont neglect them either, though. find a balance. 

*Flay* - lolnope2.jpg  GET BACK GET BACK I DONT KNOW YOU LIKE THAT. 

use for good peel. use backwards for engages. use in teamfights for control. typically, just use in the opposite direction they want to go. be wary, though, as if you are throwin peeps on yoself, get ready to take a lickin or two. you tough though. cause you know your items got your back. you aint a bitch. 

*BOX* - Fighting? RRRRRRRR

use in corridors, use on engages, retreats, objective control, just whenever really. 

You can throw the enemy into it too making them hit more than one part of the wall. 1:1 ratio on ap, and decent base damage. early and mid game, it can actually be use for decent burst on squishies in addition to the rest of your kit and 1st auto. nothing to boast about, but nothing to ignore. 

While learning Thresh, buy coin and stay on the fringe. Practice your Qs. coin gives a little mana regen and upgrades into movespeed activate that is decently useful. 

As you master the champ, start buying relic shield and targons. Now you have the job of learning how to last hit as thresh. Tough at first (broken record), but you will learn. Get 1st minion of 1st wave to have a charge back by tank minion wave. Prioritize: tanks&gt;melee&gt;range. However, dont sit around all day waiting to get the best creep, aka, never be at full charges, always have that ticker ticking. 

**ROAM BITCH** This is your playground. The others were not invited. Someone in *that* lane? THATS YO LANE NOW. 

*SKILLS:* get all spells by level 3. Max E while in lane for harass. AS SOON as you are out of lane, start maxing Q. I usually end up with 3-4 levels in flay by the time lane ends. Then midgame/teamfight/roaming begin, and my Q now gains priority for CDR. If their damage is considerable, put a couple points in W for that shield. Flay is for lane, Q for catch, W for defense. Obviously level R when available. 

*RUNES:* I run Attack damage reds, flat hp yellows, magic resist blues, 2 armor quints and one movespeed quint. 

* **BRAUM**

You are the manliest man there ever was. 

You Q has decent harass, a good slow, adds to your passive, and decent cooldown. Overall, very strong. 

Braum's W makes 300 pounds of muscle fly like its chasing bacon. AND IT IS. Move over mundo, Braum goes where he pleases. Not only does braum hop around like hes got Michael Jordan's new Nikes, but he gets a defensive bonus just cause he flexed his muscles. Use this to set up combos for the rest of your kit, flee or engage. Mobility is key for supports, and this is built in. awesome. Remember, you can cast on yourself for the defensive bonus if nothing is around to jump to. 

Your Shield is like a mobile windwall. aka: op broken shit in the form of moustache. Oh and it gives movespeed, which I mentioned is one of the two most important stats for a support. Heh. This is what defines Braum's muscles and his playstyle. You can block pretty much anything with this. Don't over do it though. Dont block just because you can. You still take damage, just much less. Remember: Avoiding damage&gt;reducing damage. If the damage is going to lane on either you or an ally, get infront of it and shield it away. Very good for denying enemy burst and then reengaging. 

The ult really needs a iconic sound effect to go with it. Something like Demacia, but only Braumstyle. Why? Because is so flashy, so big, and so game changing. AoE knock up with a slow field and screen fucking? Jump to a front minion and cast this shit to engage. Fleeing in a corridor? Cast in a line, they eat the whole thing. Use to zone, interrupt, create a path to funnel them in. Lanes are wide, cast diagonally to narrow it. Cast down the middle to split them. Cast horizontally to create a mock Karthus wall. 

Oh, and never forget Braum's passive. Just like Braums arms, it's very strong. Basically it forces the enemy to take an immediate break from Braum's rigorous workout schedule in the form of a stun. They just cant keep up. 

* **NAMI**

Fish are friends, not food. 

Nami is very strong in the right hands. She has catch, disengage, sustain, a little mobility, and decent harass in lane. Not very tanky, so use your kit well. 

Nami's E give targeted ally 3 autos of watery ownage. squirtle it up in this bitch. Gives movespeed thanks to Nami's passive. Casts instantly so use when fleeing, or engaging for easy proc of your passive. Slows enemies, which synergizes with your Bubble.

*Bubble:* This skill can put a mothafucka on tilt faster than Windows Pinball. Unlike Morgana Q and Thresh Q, this is not inhibited by minions or tanky enemies. This thing lands, that is guaranteed harass, and good setup for kills. This is your primary catch spell. To land it easier, use your E to slow them, then bubble em up. squirtle it up in this bitch. 

Your W heals and pokes. Good to spam, watch your mana. Gives movespeed thanks to passive. Good in lane, and extended teamfights. Watch your mana. Mana. Watch it. 

*NAMIS ULT.* Arch enemy of Yasuo's windwall, but then again, what fucking isnt. Very long range, good slow, brief knockup, null damage. Seeing as you are a squishy fish, use whenever you are getting engaged on. Again, this is more cc lets you land even more cc. 

*RUNES* Use the same as morgana's: magic pen reds, armor yellows, magic resist blues (cdr if you want early cdr and dont mind overcapping later), movespeed quints. 

Items: Your basic gold gen, boots, and SS take up three slots. Liandry's is the next best item for all ap supports. I always say Liandry's is a mediocre ap carry item, depending, but a fucking OP item for supports. This lets you go full support masteries and items, and still dish out damage. Nami especially because all her shit slows. DAMN. CAN YOU SAY SYNERGY. IM SO BUZZED ON BUZZWORDS. Last two items are non-core and fully situational. They have burst? Zhonyas banshees. They getting crushed? Deathcap twinshadows. Watch your CDR, always try to get 40%. Dont go under, dont go over. If you have to pick between the two. Go over. Wasting stats costs money, but if you need certain item utility, its worth the money.

Use for vision if checking brush or drag. Dont use to collect souls if there are enemy around. dont be over soul hungry. dont neglect them either, though. find a balance. 

*Flay* - lolnope2.jpg  GET BACK GET BACK I DONT KNOW YOU LIKE THAT. 

use for good peel. use backwards for engages. use in teamfights for control. typically, just use in the opposite direction they want to go. be wary, though, as if you are throwin peeps on yoself, get ready to take a lickin or two. you tough though. cause you know your items got your back. you aint a bitch. 

*BOX* - Fighting? RRRRRRRR

use in corridors, use on engages, retreats, objective control, just whenever really. 

You can throw the enemy into it too making them hit more than one part of the wall. 1:1 ratio on ap, and decent base damage. early and mid game, it can actually be use for decent burst on squishies in addition to the rest of your kit and 1st auto. nothing to boast about, but nothing to ignore. 

While learning Thresh, buy coin and stay on the fringe. Practice your Qs. coin gives a little mana regen and upgrades into movespeed activate that is decently useful. 

As you master the champ, start buying relic shield and targons. Now you have the job of learning how to last hit as thresh. Tough at first (broken record), but you will learn. Get 1st minion of 1st wave to have a charge back by tank minion wave. Prioritize: tanks&gt;melee&gt;range. However, dont sit around all day waiting to get the best creep, aka, never be at full charges, always have that ticker ticking. 

**ROAM BITCH** This is your playground. The others were not invited. Someone in *that* lane? THATS YO LANE NOW. 

*SKILLS:* get all spells by level 3. Max E while in lane for harass. AS SOON as you are out of lane, start maxing Q. I usually end up with 3-4 levels in flay by the time lane ends. Then midgame/teamfight/roaming begin, and my Q now gains priority for CDR. If their damage is considerable, put a couple points in W for that shield. Flay is for lane, Q for catch, W for defense. Obviously level R when available. 

*RUNES:* I run Attack damage reds, armor yellows, magic resist per level blues, 2 armor quints and one movespeed quint. 

* **BRAUM**

You are the manliest man there ever was. 

You Q has decent harass, a good slow, adds to your passive, and decent cooldown. Overall, very strong. 

Braum's W makes 300 pounds of muscle fly like its chasing bacon. AND IT IS. Move over mundo, Braum goes where he pleases. Not only does braum hop around like hes got Michael Jordan's new Nikes, but he gets a defensive bonus just cause he flexed his muscles. Use this to set up combos for the rest of your kit, flee or engage. Mobility is key for supports, and this is built in. awesome. Remember, you can cast on yourself for the defensive bonus if nothing is around to jump to. 

Your Shield is like a mobile windwall. aka: op broken shit in the form of moustache. Oh and it gives movespeed, which I mentioned is one of the two most important stats for a support. Heh. This is what defines Braum's muscles and his playstyle. You can block pretty much anything with this. Don't over do it though. Dont block just because you can. You still take damage, just much less. Remember: Avoiding damage&gt;reducing damage. If the damage is going to lane on either you or an ally, get infront of it and shield it away. Very good for denying enemy burst and then reengaging. 

The ult really needs a iconic sound effect to go with it. Something like Demacia, but only Braumstyle. Why? Because is so flashy, so big, and so game changing. AoE knock up with a slow field and screen fucking? Jump to a front minion and cast this shit to engage. Fleeing in a corridor? Cast in a line, they eat the whole thing. Use to zone, interrupt, create a path to funnel them in. Lanes are wide, cast diagonally to narrow it. Cast down the middle to split them. Cast horizontally to create a mock Karthus wall. 

Oh, and never forget Braum's passive. Just like Braums arms, it's very strong. Basically it forces the enemy to take an immediate break from Braum's rigorous workout schedule in the form of a stun. They just cant keep up. 

* **NAMI**

Fish are friends, not food. 

Nami is very strong in the right hands. She has catch, disengage, sustain, a little mobility, and decent harass in lane. Not very tanky, so use your kit well. 

Nami's E give targeted ally 3 autos of watery ownage. squirtle it up in this bitch. Gives movespeed thanks to Nami's passive. Casts instantly so use when fleeing, or engaging for easy proc of your passive. Slows enemies, which synergizes with your Bubble.

*Bubble:* This skill can put a mothafucka on tilt faster than Windows Pinball. Unlike Morgana Q and Thresh Q, this is not inhibited by minions or tanky enemies. This thing lands, that is guaranteed harass, and good setup for kills. This is your primary catch spell. To land it easier, use your E to slow them, then bubble em up. squirtle it up in this bitch. 

Your W heals and pokes. Good to spam, watch your mana. Gives movespeed thanks to passive. Good in lane, and extended teamfights. Watch your mana. Mana. Watch it. 

*NAMIS ULT.* Arch enemy of Yasuo's windwall, but then again, what fucking isnt. Very long range, good slow, brief knockup, null damage. Seeing as you are a squishy fish, use whenever you are getting engaged on. Again, this is more cc lets you land even more cc. 

*RUNES* Use the same as morgana's: magic pen reds, armor yellows, magic resist blues (cdr if you want early cdr and dont mind overcapping later), movespeed quints. 

Items: Your basic gold gen, boots, and SS take up three slots. Liandry's is the next best item for all ap supports. I always say Liandry's is a mediocre ap carry item, depending, but a fucking OP item for supports. This lets you go full support masteries and items, and still dish out damage. Nami especially because all her shit slows. DAMN. CAN YOU SAY SYNERGY. IM SO BUZZED ON BUZZWORDS. Last two items are non-core and fully situational. They have burst? Zhonyas banshees. They getting crushed? Deathcap twinshadows. Watch your CDR, always try to get 40%. Dont go under, dont go over. If you have to pick between the two. Go over. Wasting stats costs money, but if you need certain item utility, its worth the money.

,iphone,"I've wanted to develop games for quite some of years, and at the start of this year I finally put my sh*t together and started learning C#.

Three months, one Unity project, and a shit ton of effort later, I released Light Rush on IOS (and Android).

The game goes like this:

You're a car in a highway and you gradually lose speed; if it gets to zero, it's game over. In order to gain speed, you have to collect green boosts that spawn on the highway. There's other cars which you have to avoid crashing into in order not to lose. You can shoot to destroy said cars, but shooting causes you to lose speed, so choose wisely. See how far you can travel!

Tilt the phone to steer and touch on the highway to shoot. Good Luck!

,smashbros,"Sakurai hasn’t got it all wrong in terms of making veterans feel fresh: Donkey Kong’s moves seem to have a few more applications; Zelda, Shiek, and Charizard have new moves to compensate for the lack of a transform option; Pit has a few entirely-new moves altogether; and across the cast I’m sure there must be many more changes, at least in terms of statistics (knockback/speed/damage/etc.). However, in my opinion, the fact that several veterans have received few major changes in the past few games is pretty lazy.

Just look at Mario – the face of Nintendo. The number of games he’s been in during Smash’s lifetime has been pretty huge, yet he doesn’t offer a single move-based reference to Super Mario Galaxy, his reference to Super Mario Sunshine seems to be quite poorly-executed, he’s still using his cape for reflecting after all these years, and we don’t even have the Ice Flower as a custom move alternative to the Fire Flower. Why isn’t his Up+B replaced by the spin jump from Super Mario Galaxy? Why can’t F.L.U.D.D. have a different function in the air, where it instead uses the rocket nozzle and pushes enemies downwards and/or offers an additional recovery akin to Diddy Kong’s Rocket Barrels? Why can’t holding down the inputs when using his cape put him into a gliding state? Surely his down tilt could work as a Raccoon Mario tail swipe?

Then there’s Luigi – another iconic character. Where’s his reference to Luigi’s Mansion? Don’t say his final smash – that doesn’t really count when most serious players won’t use items. His Down+B, whilst useful, doesn’t really make great sense for the character – why not replace it with the Poltergust? It could offer great utility, possibly within the realm of Shiek’s new grenade-based move sucking people inwards, and/or Kirby’s ability to temporarily hold enemies in his mouth, and/or Villager’s ability to store a projectile for later use! Also, what’s the point of Green Missile?  That move doesn’t make sense for Luigi either, yet we have other power-ups just sitting at the side collecting dust; the Flying Squirrel suit could work, for example’s sake!

And Peach, who could forget her? Still pulling turnips, I see, despite not actually using that move in a home game since Super Mario Bros. 2. I’d also like to highlight that she still lacks an aerial Down+B move, much to my disappointment, especially when Donkey Kong – another classic character who had the same flaw – has recently received the ability to use his Down+B in the air. Furthermore, several of her moves are still without origin, like her side+B. Why not use the cat suit? She was actually playable in the game that it appeared in, and the suit offered quite a few attack options. Couldn’t you at least reference her obsession with baking cakes? Didn’t she even have a DS spin-off at one point where her emotions were used as a gameplay mechanic? Kinda stereotypical and/or sexist, I realise, but that’s not exactly a foreign concept when she dances for her final smash, emits love hearts as she attacks with her hips, and swings kitchen equipment at others. Peach being a playable character is already kinda a stretch given the fact that, most of the time, she’s restricted to spin-off titles or only appears as a plot device, but, if you’re gonna force it, and you have content to draw from, why are you still resorting to made-up attacks?

As for the Mario cast as a whole, why not give them a unique jump system like in the Mario games? By this I mean that jumps performed whilst turning around mid-run are a tall backflip, and that jumping as you land makes the new jump slightly higher (up to a certain limit). Sonic is known for his speed, and that was delivered quite nicely, but Mario’s iconic jumping-based gameplay hasn’t been given much obvious attention. Maybe it isn’t needed, but I’m just proposing something flashy and unique for the sake of making certain characters feel fresh again.

I've talked about Mario characters for a little while, but let’s look at the polar opposite – Sonic the Hedgehog! I’ve seen many complaints that a lot of his moveset is just him rolling into a ball, and, despite being a core function in his home games, I can’t help but agree that this is lazy design. His side+B could quite easily be replaced by his infamous boost attack from recent games. His down+B could instead function as the bounce bracelet in the air, and have similar properties to Greninja’s dair. Why is his dash attack another ball-based attack when he quite clearly has a sliding function in his own games?

Toon Link! Is he a clone? I can't decide! He does have a lot of unique twists about his character that does distance his playstyle from regular Link, but there’s no reason why he should simply have most of regular Link’s moveset, at least in terms of aesthetics. An on-demand push/pull effect could be achieved if his side+b was the Wind Waker – y’know, the item that literally appears in the name of one of Toon Link’s most famous games. And I’ve also seen many people propose his leaf glider as a new recovery – that’s a great idea! Why isn’t this being used?

I realise that Olimar comes from games where there really aren’t that many controls or attack options to draw from, but simply having a million variations of “throw pikmin” doesn’t really spice things up. Anybody remember the petrifying potion? A long stun worked for ZSS’ down smash, so why couldn’t this work for Olimar? And bomb rocks too – they could offer some nice risk/reward in that they could kill Pikmin, but also be a useful damaging too! Heck, you don’t even need to scrape the barrel in terms of giving him a bit more variety: make his Pikmin Throw angle-able; make it so that the longer you hold Pikmin Pluck, the further into its flower cycle the pikmin pulled is; and make his aerial neutral B give a small extra jump like in Project M (or anything that doesn’t make it completely useless)! Olimar was really powerful in SSBB, and may not even deserve any new functions, but, with his pikmin army reduced to three at one time, I think a few more tools might be necessary, especially if they can make additional reference to his home series in the process.

And, finally, even though I think the Pokémon fighters are all well-designed, I do wish the non-offensive moves of the Pokémon franchise were given some attention. Perhaps allocate them to the weaker attacks or taunts, but a temporary self-buff or temporary on-hit debuff could work quite well in my opinion. I like how Project M Ivysaur honoured the grass type well - what with health drain, charging Solar Beam, stunning others, and damage over time - and I'd be interested to see other categories of moves receive the same treatment in Smash 4.

---

After all this, I don’t want it to sound like I don’t appreciate the efforts that have been made with making the Smash series, or that I know what’s best for it. My move ideas? Tremendously unlikely to influence anything about the final game, and not necessarily well thought-out. I’m just tired of seeing the same characters come through into each game with little obvious consideration given to making them stand out from the interesting new characters. And it’s true that if something isn’t broken then don’t try to fix it, don’t get me wrong, but, outside of characters like Captain Falcon who don’t have much source material to borrow from, I don’t think there’s much of an excuse for certain characters to have the made-up movesets that they do. Not every character is immediately Smash-worthy, and some improvisation is needed along the way, but attacks that are a bit more true-to-home, or more-recent at the very least, could go a long way.

,WildStar,"**Step 1: So you are level 50. Now you need 150 elder gems to buy Genesis key.**

- You can buy this key from Elder gem vendors in Illium (Merchant Gigax) or Thayd (Merchant Viktosak)

**- But how do i get these Elder gems?**

- Elder gems have weekly cap and that weekly cap is 140. This cap resets every tuesday. You get these pretty much everywhere. See that experience bar down there in your screen? It tells you how much you have obtained elder points. When you reach 99% you have reached cap and that means 140 elder gems. You can see Elder gems inside your inventory. Doing dailies, quests, adventures and dungeons gives you these Elder points.
- Doing both daily zones (northrend wastes and crimson badlands) gives you about 35-40% of weekly cap. Doing one adventure gives you about 5-10%. Remember that all experience boosts affects this. This means guild flasks, perks, housing buff, authenticator buff. So you can pretty easily cap your elder point in one day. And for now you will be doing this every week. Remember to cap your Elder gems every week! It's really important because you can use these to buy gear, ability and AMP points or action sets

**- So i capped my elder gems. Now i need to wait till next week... What to do?**

- Start gearing yourself and learning more about your class elder game. I link here every classes guides  where you can get information
- (If you think there is better guides just tell me and i will edit this post)

- Now i dont say these are best guides out there. But i'm pretty sure these will help you to get started. Just start reading your class forums and you will learn lots of new things.

- There is also something else you can do to help yourself in next parts of attunement already. You will need to get Dominion/Exile reputation to beloved (32000) and you get this reputation by doing quest, dailies, adventures and dungeons. 

- There is event in Malgrave called Containment Facility R-12. You can complete this quest every day and it gives you 1500 exile/dominion reputation and malgrave research expedition reputation.

- This event is up every 4 hours. 03.00, 7.00, 11.00, 15.00, 19,00 23,00 (UTC/GMT+03:00) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkHyA-Y8YU4 this video explains pretty well what you have to do. 

**- Step 2: Killing elemental miniboss**

- So now we need to kill Elemental miniboss in Wilderun (3420, -4246)
- This is just random video i found. But this shows pretty good what you need to do https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M35de5blorE

**- Step 3: Getting beloved with your faction**

- Remember that reputation we talked before? Are you beloved? If you are move forward to next step. If not go get it to beloved! 

**- Step 4: Arkship heist puzzle**

- Arkship heist quest. Some puzzles. Just click your quest and it should show arrow where you need to go. Here is codes for those puzzles there if you are lazy. Avoid those little patrol robots btw. 

- Alpha: 4-3

- Beta: 1-4

- Delta: 4-1-3-4 and 4-1-3

- Kappa: 1-2

- (if you fail just leave zone and come back. It will reset panels)

**- Step 5: Getting silver from each veteran adventure**

- Here is really nice guide what explains what you need to do to get silver or gold from these: https://forums.wildstar-online.com/forums/index.php?/topic/72540-adventures-gold-medals/

**- Step 6: Let's travel to farside!**

- Now we go to farside (3588, -6088) and we have mechsuit! And yes i bring you again video what show what you need to do there: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjGeUSkrckQ

**- Step 7:  You need to get silver medal in each dungeon veteran mode.** 

- This means you have timelimit (different in each dungeon) and you also need to do every optional quest inside these dungeons. 
(warning videos coming again!)

**Stormtalon lair:** 30 minutes (guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXdJ0Wui1p4)

**Ruins of Kel'voreth:** 40 minutes (guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMeSNlGd1tE)

**Skullcano:** 45 minutes (guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4KvjGMxeo)

**Sanctuary of the Swordmaiden:** 75 minutes (guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7acBMuJRSk)

- Now these dungeons requires training. Watching these videos will only give you a hint whats coming. You are doing attunement for raiding here so i assume you are in raiding guild. Do these dungeons with your guild. Use VOIP and learn them together.
They might feel hard first and you will wipe, but thats the learning process. This will prepare you for raiding. When i did STL veteran first time it felt really freaking hard. Now it's really simple and easy. Just dont give up

**- Step 8: Now you need to kill snail in malgrave (163, 3660)**

- Take healer and couple dps with you. Tank is kinda optional. Interrupt it and take it down. Nothing really hard in there.

**- Step 9: Go to Auroria (-827, -1997) and complete quest.** 

- You will take elemental form and collect those things in air (dont go too high. Form will end--&gt; you will drop and die)

**- Step 10: You need to kill 12 DIFFERENT world bosses**

- Hellrose bowl event in malgrave. This gives you 3 bosses

- Critical containment R-12 event. There is 5 different bosses that can spawn. Do this event and hope for different bosses

- Scorchwing. Yep it counts. Easy kill!

Then there is lots of different bosses in different areas you can kill. Just stalk when they are up (you can see that event in map) or you can also join/make circle for world bosses. You will need about 5-10 people atleast for these. All bosses are kinda easy and simple. They do very little damage to you but you can try to avoid red telegraphs if you want.

- Metal Maw- Deradune: -5135, 460

- King Honeygrave- Auroria: -7681, -2239 (this boss is kinda bugged so you might wanna skip this)

- Kraggar the Earthbinder- Algoroc: 3515, -3316

- Hoarding Steamdragon- Ellevar: -2585, -4512

- Grendelus the guardian- Celestion: 2773, -1461

- Doomthorn the Ancient- Galeras: 6248, -2474

- Defensive Protocol unit- Farside: 3756, -5818 (this boss can bug out too)

- Zoetic- Wilderrun: 1079, -3604

**Step 11: Defeat the extra boss in Veteran Kel Voreth**

- Last part of this quest. Kill first boss then run just keep running forward. Kill couple packs there and left side you see panel. Click it and green stair will appear. Those will lead to boss. Kill boss and thats it. Now you are attuned!

Episode Title: Lots of Loot

Coe's Description:

Finally had time to get an episode out. :D Sorry for the delay. :(

Rules:

- Follow the subreddit rules

(More can be added if need be)

Video Synopsis:

Coe begins this video by explaining why its been a few days since his last episode having been busy with some real life work. However this hasn't dented progress completely as Coe has been working hard off camera in preparation to connect the water base to the station. He takes us on a tour of a new area established near the water base. While away Coe has established a new branch mine mainly for iron. But also he had an idea that it would also make sense to branch mine at diamond level and collect any diamonds as well for maximum benefit. He shows us the shaft complete with layer labeling which enables Coe to know the best layers to branch mine at. He then shows us the haul of loot he has collected from the mine so far, plenty of gold, redstone and iron along with a few extra diamonds. Though he has spent most of his diamonds on tools for the mine. He then takes us into the branch mine to show a few things, including a tricky cavern. During this Coe gets jumped by a sneaky creeper, but Coe manages to slay it and emerge victorious on this occasion. He also shows us a Zombie spawner he found and he thinks that perhaps in some way that this cave system is connected to the labyrinth at the dungeon hut as they are not all that far away. Once back at base Coe makes a set of golden armor and turns all of his recently smelted iron into rails and takes a trip along the bridge to start laying down the next set of tracks. Pretty quickly Coe finds himself short of tracks and proceeds to do a little more branch mining. He returns a little while later with another stack of iron which he also turns into tracks and also lays those. Once laid Coe believes that around a stack or just over will be enough to fully complete the job for the water base rail. However a few additional things may be required such as an extra booster to climb a small incline in the bridge. Definitely getting close to having the rail now connected.

,playmygame,"I've wanted to develop a game for quite some of years, and at the start of this year I finally put my sh*t toghether and started learning C#.

Three months, one Unity project, and a shit ton of effort later, I released Light Rush on Android (and IOS).

The game goes like this:

You're a car in a highway and you gradually lose speed; if it gets to zero, it's game over. In order to gain speed, you have to collect green boosts that spawn on the highway. There's other cars which you have to avoid crashing into in order not to lose. You can shoot to destroy said cars, but shooting causes you to lose speed, so choose wisely. See how far you can travel!

Tilt the phone to steer and touch on the highway to shoot. Good Luck!

**Content with Rich Lambert**
***

 * You will always be able to sync with your group leader’s instance. 
 * Journal and quest tracker to show common quests.
 * Confirmation for quest sharing (success or fail)

 * Video preview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbXmx8xAt6Q
* Dungeon Scaling

**Facial Animation with Jeese Mcintyre**
***
* Video of the new FaceFX in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8WEzt5ddgY
* Current NPC characters are like sock puppets in terms of facial animations. 
* The upgrade is powered by FaceFX. It is in a lot of games already.It takes audio and text of the dialogue and identify phonemics, the sound we make in speech and map them to mouth shapes. 
* Our artist and programmers work together to make believable mouth shapes. Our game has 120,000 lines of dialogue translated over 3 languages. The humanoid and beast races have very different facial structures. Our robust character creation also allow you to modify the facial structures. 

**Veteran System with Paul Sage**
***
* Player feedback: Players like to keep the same character and going into the various alliances. Players also like keep getting new items and we are working constantly on adding new items. 
* There is a split between players who find post 50 content too difficult and those who like the challenge.
* There is also the issue of infrequent reward – need a predictable reward path. We have a good progression system to level 50 but this isn’t there post 50. 
* Experience too different between 1-50 and post 50. Gaining Veteran points isn’t same as gaining experience points and can be confusing.
* We are going to get rid of veteran points, instead veteran ranks are gained by experience points. You will get a rested XP for not playing in a certain length of time. 
* Champion system – We are going to introduce a ton of passives. As you gain experience, you get champion points to spend on passives.
* Example passives (The Tower Constellation). You can keep putting points into them to increase their %.
 * Blade expert – increase the base damage any player can do with a blade. It does not increase any “extra” damage from damage type on blades.
 * Tenactiy – increase total stamina regen by a %
 * Shock Boost – increase damage done by shock and increase resistance to shock
 * Precise strikes – increase the percentage on the weapon critical derived stat. 
* Champion points are account wide and able to spent on all characters independently. 
* For more points you put into a path/constellation you gain unlocks. 
 * 10 pts: Impatience – A significant increase to success chance at forcing locks
 * 30 pts: Fortune Hunter – Gold found in Chests is Increased
 * 50 pts Deflection – Blocking now returns a % of the mitigated damage onto the attack
 * 100 pts Counterstrike – A successful block at lower than 10% health has a &amp; chance to prevent and return 100% of the damage back on the attack. 10 Minutes cooldown. 
* Video of the champion system: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3UI9-RGC1s

* New gear, no longer restricted by Veteran ranks. New items are come in with new content in “seasons”. They will be rare to acquire in the current season. The previous season items are easier to acquire and might be even be purchaseable directly. No one will fall behind the item chase but there will still be an item chase.  

**Justice System with Paul Sage**
***
* Justic System gameplay (stealing &amp; murder): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAFdcsmJlKE
* You can take items from crates etc as normal but instead now you are stealing items. Items will have value if they are stolen. To steal something, you need to be hidden. If a guard caught you stealing, you can pay a bounty but it remove all your stolen goods. 
* You can also murder NPCs. 
* If you cannot pay a bounty when caught by a guard, you can try to flee and guards will attack you.
* You can also be guards and hunt down players with bounty – active world PvP. 

**Spellcrafting with Nicke Konkle**
***

* You are going to be able to find and combine various spell effects in the game and create new abilities you can put on your hotbar. 
* It is a bound system that is not completely unbalancing the game. 
* Mage Guild discover new ancient doorways and found new ways to organize magic. 
* A lot of exploration in this system, you get a spell that summon a ball you have to chase to find the various ancient doorways located all over the world. 
* Inside the doorways you will find stone tablets. Some are whole, some are broken into pieces and scattered all over the world. 
 * http://i.imgur.com/SVErAI1.jpg
* Using an interactive UI, similar to lockpicking, you will be using charcoal and paper on the tablet to recreate the spell and collect it.Once you collected the spell, you throw them into a book of all the spells you have collected. 
 * http://i.imgur.com/UvUV3lq.jpg
 * http://i.imgur.com/bGDNQoK.jpg
* Once you collected the spells, you want to recreate the tablets you found in order to learn that spell. First thing you do is to collect the base effect of the spell using the method described above. You can then customize it by using different focus (morphs). 
 * http://i.imgur.com/O4lyEcu.jpg
 * Base, Ultimate, Enduring, Reduce Cost, Ritual, AoE. 
 * If you put the AoE focus on Lighting Bolt you will create a chain lightning spell. If you put the enduring focus on a flame antronach it will become a permanent pet. You can use the ultimate to make the spells into ultimates.
* The better stone you use for the tablets to create the spells, the more powerful and expensive the spell will be. Tablets can be traded with other players. Once the tablet is consumed, it will grant you the permanent ability. 
* In summary, you explore the world to collect base spells and then customize it with the six different focus and different stones for the tablets. 

**Combat Responsiveness with Jared Carr**
***

* Button responsiveness
 * We are improving the audio feedback for actions such as drinking potions and depleting magicka/stamina
 * We have fixed many bugs, such as Nightblade abilities randomly locking out and will continue to do so.
 * Better tools for QA to analyze unexpected behaviour with abilities and animation
* Animation Timing
 * We are improving the actual timing of impacts.
 * We are improving the velocuty and arcs of motion on weapon skins so that combat feels tighter.
 * We are making aesthetic improvements to combat poses and animation
* Particle effects
 * We have now allocated more of the overall PFX budget to combat abilities
 * We have added more robust PFX priority culling rules into the system (my abilities and the enemy abilities on me are the most important and should appear first)
 * We are exposing these culling rules as player options in the UI, including a total PFX memory cap slider and a rendering distance slider.
 * We are now pre-caching all combat telegraphs to make sure they are always in memory and therefore always play.
* Weapon swapping
 * We are now pre-caching all weapons in memory so weapon swapping is instant

**New armor and weapon sets**

* Female giant creature added

**Q&amp;A**
***

* Werewolves are in need of updates. Are there changes in places for werewolves? 
 * Nick: Yes, absolutely. There are two phases of changes. For starters, we are going to balance the ultimate – decrease cost, increase damage etc. In the second phase we are going to add in more active abilities. 
* Who is the old man that appeared in the spellcrafting presentation?
 * Nick: That is a special stone mason the mage guild has conscripted. There are some lore around it and you can get his costume.
* Barbershop?
 * Paul: We like to introduce a RP mechanic where players can earn these and give them to each other. It is coming, just a question of how and when.
* When you stealing, is the bounty timer based? 
 * Paul: If you incur a high bounty, you will remain Kill on sight until you pay the bounty.
* Why do some quests get broken from one patch to another
 * Rich: Tons of moving parts. When we fix a quest in one area, it won’t work everytime and under all conditions/load. 
* When are the new facial animations coming?
 * Jesse: Unknown at this point. The technology is there, it is a production issue due to all the dialogues. Probably months of additional work. We can’t commit to a time period at the moment. 
* Plan to adding dueling feature?
 * Paul: Dueling system sound simply but it is not very simple. There are a lot of things to consider. When the Justice system is place, maybe we can get it in place. 
* What are the future plans for the PvP system
 * Brain: Imperial City coming, more gear, figuring out how to continue to progress your character, more consumables to use. 
* When will we see minigames?
 * Matt: Horse racing, better fishing system. We will reserve it until we have more information.
* New crafting motifs?
 * Paul: Yes
* Plans for stamina builds to compare with magicka builds
 * Nick: Medium armor already have a stamina reduction. Some stamina weapon abilities will get damage boosted. Doing some balance between spell crit and weapon crit. For ultimates it will pick to see the higher of the weapon attack speed or spell attack speed.
* Plans for Roleplayers in the future?
 * Paul: Justice System, Guild traders. Ongoing effort overtime.
* Respec cost too high
 * Nick: For the first week of update 3, we will make respec extremely cheap (i.e. 100 gold). After that we will reduce the respec cost by 25%. We will also add in respec for just your morphs that is really cheap (100x cheaper than a full respec).
* PvPers have an advantage in PvE content? (i..e PvP passives)  What are you doing about it?
 * Nick: We don’t have any specific changes but we will look into it.
 * Paul: We don’t want this game to be one where if you are good in PvE, you can’t do PvP. 
* Plans to discourage Emperor trading?
 * Brian: Condense amount of campaigns from 10 to 5. We are increase the amount of AP need to become emperor (increased to 50k AP from 10k AP). Adding faster decay on siege weapons. Adding in 3 day lockout in home and guest campaign switching. 
* Are the spelltomes for spellcrafting consumable? Can you make stamina abilities?
 * Nick: yes they are consumable. We have other plans for stamina abilities but we have a spell you can use to gain stamina (magicka to stamina).

,marvelheroes,"Looks like Gaz is increasing the number of events per month, adding a new item to collect in order to obtain valuable loot, first it was uniques, then now it's some of the rarest artifacts in the game. 

I would be fine with that if these items to collect weren't affected by SiF, aka special item find. Looks like they are trying to sell as many boosts as possible with these events, and for sure some credit card warriors will buy them knowing they will have guaranteed increased drop rate and guaranteed rare artifacts/uniques at the end by purchasing the boxes. I haven't started farming these items myself but I am pretty confident the drop rate is very low if you farm with low SiF, in short not paying money for boosts.

Am I the only one unhappy with the direction the game is going?

,MLPCCG,"Hello All, 

I want to participate in the local Store Tournaments this weekend, however I have only been collecting the Starter/Theme Decks that have come out. I have all decks, with the exception of the Maud Pie/DJ Pon-3 two player starter kit. I am currently trying to build a deck that will do well competitively. I am planning on running Fluttershy as my Mane and do a Yellow &amp; either Orange or White deck. Also, I do not have any cards other than the ones than from the Starter Decks.

Here is my deck list so far.

I am afraid that I may not have enough good White Friends (that doesn't sound racist at all) to use in this deck. That's why I am considering Orange instead. 

What are your thoughts and opinions? I am also considering running a Blue/Purple deck with RN PR as my Mane.

,worldbuilding,"So, we've gone through how Iron Giants grow up and how they form relationships.

The result of the particularities mentioned in Iron Giants IX is that society is divided into 'circles'. A circle is a small-numbered group of Iron Giants that have come to know each other over the years, that have opened up to each other and that can share a level of intimacy and mutual understanding that allows for rapid exchange of intricate thoughts and detailed ideas. Conversations for an Iron Giant within the circle are rapid and colorful, while outside of the circle, it is difficult and slow. Communication isn't *impossible*, just less efficient.

**The smallest circles are 3 people, and the largest 10. Under three, the relationship implodes into a couple. Over 10, the amount of time the IGs spend away from each other grows until they cannot synchronize their memories and thought well enough to feel integrated into the group.**

A young Iron Giant usually fits into a circle from a young age. Usually, it is formed from childhood friends the IG grows up with. It is the third major factor in an IG's upbringing.

**Society can be considered as divided into circles of various size and status. In the poorest echelons, the circles are numerous, but pretty similar. There are no significant barriers when it comes to communicating with a circle of parallel status. Circles in this category are formed mostly around a single craft, combining the concept of guild, gang and neighborhood all in one. In the smallest fortresses, a circle is a place within the building. **

Circles with more wealth and social standing become more numerous and divided as their importance increases. Political groups are extremely divided and few in number, about 2 to 3 at most per community. A change in opinion or beliefs almost certainly means becoming stranded outside of the circle. 

**Moving up or down the social ladder is equally difficult. It generally requires years to qualify from 'acquaintance' to 'collaborator', and then from 'friend' to 'junior member'. In the same vein, a defector takes a very long time to accept their differences with the group, and existing members rarely 'let go' of old members.** 

It is not possible to barge your way into the higher classes as it is possible with us humans, where appearances can confound judgement.  Communicating within a circle is basically opening yourself up to a mental scanner.

**There are, however, other ways to become a wealthy and influential member of society. The easiest is to advance the entire circle. Generational drifts, that is, older individuals systematically occupying positions of power through their accumulated experience, rarely happens. Efforts have to be made in all cases. Another method is to collaborate with a professional circle. A professional circle is a group of IGs from a wide variety of social levels that come together to work. The thoughts shared are entirely 'professional', hence the name. Here, you contribute to the group under orders of the circle's master, unlike a regular group where decisions are shared and unanimous. On the plus side, you are paid for your efforts. For a regular group without a commercial focus, this is the only way to earn money. Members of the lowest level of society can also acquire a 'professional' status, which is usually much higher than they could ever achieve through the sole efforts of their own circle.**

'Professionals' are intermediary in importance and status to the governing circles and the social circles.

Governing circles are extremely diverse. While the share the common trait of being rare and extremely divided, there is a a variety of governments equal to the number of Iron Giant communities. 

**This is due to the particularities of Iron Giant societies. Direct communication between a ruler and any other group is impossible. A low-level birthing pool tender would simply ignore rulers of the ruling class, claiming to simply 'not understand'. This isn't a question of intelligence, but of thoughts. The way the governor's brain work is entirely different from that of other members of society, and Iron Giants reject those thoughts instinctively to shield themselves ( a reflex quickly acquired during childhood).**

The ruling parties need intermediaries. Information, orders and laws trickle slowly from top to bottom, passing from circle to circle as they are transformed into something the adjacent circles can understand. It is not *simplified*, but *adapted*. 

**The difficulty of making changes reinforces and excuses the leaders' conservatism and immobility. On top of that, changes to society are equally difficult to propagate from top to bottom as the other way around: there are no revolts, rising parties, propaganda and so on. Every transformation requires you to convince practically everyone; irremediable differences are usually settled by fusing the two ideologies over time. **

All governments, whether they pull their authority from the memories of ancestors stored in dead heads, or if they consult the people via referendum, are held in check not by results, but by popularity.

**The results of a reign are difficult to quantify when no-one wants to change anything, and a a raid could ruin everything at any moment. Popularity is not as frivolous as it sounds: it is a long, arduous process to speak to every circle and explain how you're helping the community and why you're the best ruler. If the ruling party didn't do this, their followers would desist and their communication with the lower classes disappears.**

International relationships are an entirely different story. You can never become familiar with another nation, you never have to explain your actions and 'bad behavior' is punished by having to live the way you usually do: holed up in a fortress.

**Most relationships are commercial. One fortress fins itself with an excess of production that it wishes to sell. It sends a courier to the nearest 'rich' community and offers its goods. The first trade is rather risky. The buyers send an armed force to the sellers (which is no different from a raiding party, hence the nervousness), collect the goods and haul it away in an armored caravan. This shifts the transport responsibility to the buyer, a touchy point considering how common raids and hold-ups are.
The following purchases are transported under the shared protection of both buyers and sellers, with a sort of insurance policy numbered in future production. **

Trade is inseparable from politics. Buyers are invariably communities with a nuclear fuel shortage. No-one ever 'invests' in nuclear fuel, since it is ALWAYS more profitable to save what you have. Those that start hoarding fuel just get invaded and robbed. Buyers are essentially trading away sovereignty to the seller, becoming their dependents in sort. Sellers always restrict their sales to the strict minimum, then start reducing the supply to boost prices and ask for more privileges.  

**Military politics get involved when trade is not enough to fulfill the demand for nuclear fuel. Trading parties frequently transform into invasions on the buyer's or seller's doorstep, and convoy routes can be sold out in a bid to acquire a new seller. Often, the nuclear fuel supply for an entire region dries up. The fortresses there group their war materials and warriors and send them out as a crushing force to the next neighborhood.**

Large scale invasions are doomed to fail.

**The energy demand for such 'active work' is always too much. In armies such as these, the energy spent/fuel recovered ratio becomes smaller as the size increases, and drops when armies of different nations are forces to work together.**

Like Japan in WWII, the nuclear fuel dries up and the armies can't go any further. The resources put into building suits of armor and weapons now lack when it comes to reconverting the warriors into workers. Many IGs die, warring governments collapse and the survivors find themselves with enough fuel to survive on.

**Of course, there are cases where the collapse doesn't go badly for everyone. For a nation that carefully planned the moment, that had the foresight of storing the fuel it acquires, that tricked the others into contributing less and taking more.... there is a possibility that it grows into an Empire.**

There are few Empires.

An Empire is a fortress on a much larger scale. Resources are pooled together, and the population reaches a critical point where the available talent and man-hours provides enough income to simply buy all the nuclear fuel the Empire could ever need. The trade routes run through hundreds of other communities, and like a tree, it siphons fuel and money to the center. Once a group reaches this critical mass, it doesn't get attacked or raided anymore. Every gram of fuel is exploited, allowing for scale efficiencies (too small, and a single raid can make everything collapse), and the central government is forced to use a universal thought pattern, allowing them to actually communicate with everyone else instead of waiting for everything to trickle down.

**They're like elephants. Too big to attack, and somehow still manage to eat enough every day.

So there you have it. Family, circles, society, governments and Empires.**

,Bravenewbies,"When I logged on to get my daily dose of eve madness today I didn't realize that I would be FC'ing my first roam. As usual I just jumped into my Scythe and joined Catch Defense. Once we had chased off or blue balled all the neuts in V3/GE and our FC had to leave, I acted on a whim and decided to take the first step from content consumer to content creator. Suffice to say that things went terribly, terribly wrong.

**A SPECIAL DELIVERY**

The first fleet was an actual fleet. As Catch Defense was about to take a break, I asked over comms whether anyone would be up for a low-sec frigate roam. Brave didn't disappoint and I got a fine set of lemmi... err, line members. I quickly puzzled out how to create a fleet with an advert (CCP you need to make this less intuitive, I only manage to have a mild panic attack in the process - menus aren't cryptic enough!).

We shot the breeze in station while we fitted our frigates and eventually we formed up at the staging POS. As I said the words ""Alright guys, approach and hold on the jump bridge"" it dawned on me that I hadn't fit a fucking prop mod on my dual armor rep'd Incursus. Well shit. I instructed the ~15 man fleet to hold on the jump bridge as I warped back to the station. The friendly neighborhood cloaky bomber chose that exact moment to deliver a care package of shiny bombs. Luckily my fleet mates aren't nearly as dim witted as I am and, with the exception of an unlucky griffin, managed to get to relative safety. Well done Echo, great start.

I fitted the damn prop mod and we reformed in ZXIC-7. Laughs were had while I profusely apologized to everyone for nearly welping the fleet before we even left V-3. (They know it's my first time FC'ing right? Better remind them). The original plan was to find a wormhole and use it to get to low-sec. This didn't work because apparently, someone had stolen all of them while leadership was sleeping and there wasn't a single one in site (get it?). So plan B then: we fly our way to low-sec.

**DID HE SAY JUMP?**

Even though I *KNEW* that I shouldn't say the J word unless I really meant it, I couldn't stop myself from giving orders like ""jump to the F4R gate"". By the time we got three jumps out we were all in a fit of giggles because of [this](http://i.imgur.com/ggExpyy.jpg). We even briefly considered renaming ourselves to the Brave Lemming Fleet. With this gold standard in leadership excellence you won't surprised to hear that we absolutely crushed the opposition and now all their base are belong to us. 

Well actually, we didn't even make it to low-sec.

**WELP, THAT WENT WELL**

The first signs we had of the enemy was in Litom and came in the form a bubbled to hell gate and some very flighty neutrals. I'm motioning for an intervention right now. If these guys want to get rid of their ISK they're welcome to donate to Echo Chamber. There is no sane reason for them to have a ton of bubbles on a gate. At least, not when I'm trying to take a fleet through! After failing to draw the enemy into a fight, I decided to move us over to the Utopia gate. We warped over and I waited for the inevitable lemming to scout for us. Turns out we had plenty of neutrals in system so hooray for content!

We jumped through and held on the gate while Neome, who had generously offered to scan for us, scouted the system in search of tasty targets. At this point I should probably mention the worm that had been sitting 200km off the gate watching us. I'm hazy on the details but at one stage I made a comment to the effect of ""if you can get point on that worm go for it"". Turns that wasn't a great idea as the fleet, including the FC, interrupted it to mean ""attack the worm one by one and don't work in any sort of coordinated fashion"". I think I was the third or fourth person to come down with [exploding hull syndrome](https://zkillboard.com/kill/40139445/). 

After playing with the worm for a bit, more explosions, and a failed attempt to refit on the fly in null-sec, there really didn't seem like much of a point in continuing the roam in it's current form. Those of us in pods self destructed or asked for pod express. Some of the bro's still alive met up at the sun for Thunder Dome 2014 (TM). Fthorian even managed to run the gauntlet back to V-3 in an unfit Thrasher. 

This gave us the brilliant idea for our next fleet.

**FIGHT CLUB**

After making it back to V-3 we decided that if we couldn't point the content, we'd make the content point us and simply shoot each other. After thanking everyone who had donated a ship to the Blood God so that I could learn how NOT to FC, I asked everyone who wanted to join Thunder Dome to stay in fleet. We lost half our numbers but had a healthy 8 or so contestants so the game was on. We also managed to collect 50 mil in prize money! 

After refitting we formed up in ZXIC-7 and held on the jump bridge. Our judge counted down and we warped ourselves to the Sun at 0km. The fight was pretty awesome as I finally managed to get some more frigate vs frigate action in. I was pretty happy with the way my dual armor rep'd Incursus performed even though I'd forgotten the prop mod again (I need to delete that stupid fit from my fittings). Ultimately my one Warrior II didn't have enough DPS and I didn't have enough speed to keep up with the Condors and the Slasher so when my cap boosters ran out, my beautiful frigate popped like bubble wrap to Fthorian's nasty light missile.

I did catch the rest of the fight from the comfort of my pod though and watched as Pathetic Laduko and Fthorian's battled to the last, with Fthorian finally managing to best his foe and claim all the ISK. There were all round congratulations and good fights in fleet with a juicy pay off to the victor. Blue Ice was forming a fleet though so we said our hurried good byes and dropped fleet in search of moar content.

**FINALLY, THE END**


All in all, I'm declaring this a great OP SUCCESS. We didn't archive our goal of making it into low-sec. Hell, we didn't even manage to get a non-blue killmail. We did however have an absolute boat load of fun being Brave.

I would like to sincerely thank all of you guys (and gal?) that fleeted up with me and made my first FC roam possible, [you guys rock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fWr6CBARMw). 

To all my lemmings, I say I forgive you and I &lt;3 you but please, just because someone says the J word does NOT mean it's ok to jump :D

An extra special thank you to Chitin Briks, Pathetic Laduko, Fthorian and Joan Andedare (did I miss someone?) for your donations to our competition pot!! It might have happened without you but your generosity definitely made it better. (Well technically Fthorian, you donated to yourself so you can go jump).

**Things I did right:**

* I stepped up and took the plunge
* I'm pretty sure that's the only thing I did right

**Things I did wrong:**

* Used the J word repeatedly when I didn't mean it
* I didn't do any planning for the roam
* I wasn't thinking strategically when we made contact with the enemy 
* I got myself exploded when it could easily have been prevented

**Lessons**

* If you want to roam low-sec: scan down a wormhole (preferably one that doesn't go through wormhole space) and plan the route *before* you create the fleet
* A ton of other things that I'm not going to list

**How To Improve**

* More Welp Fleets(TM) :D

,randomsuperpowers,"###~~Daughter DOOOOM~~ Alba

**Age:** 15

**Alignment:** Neutral 

In 1964, Raina de Vigo, princess of Galicia and daughter of Cataclysm, was nearly killed in a botched assassination attempt against her father by the British superhero Commander Mystic, Reginald White. Cataclysm responded in two ways. 

**A)** defeating Reginald in a fight to the death, that ended with the magician being burned alive before magically vacating his dying body, and 

**B)** preserving Raina's life through suspended animation.

After many years of attempting to synthasize genetic material collected from Reginald before his death, and combining it with his own technology, Cataclysm eventually succeeded in creating a clone of his daughter, augmented with both advanced nanotechnology and traces of magic. 

This new daughter, Alba, is almost a blank slate, possessing no memory of her origins and only  minimal  dormant programming short of an instinct to seek out those with power and learn their secrets.  

[**Hybrid Physiology**](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Hybrid_Physiology)

* [Clone Physiology](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Clone_Physiology)

* [Technorganic Physiology](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Technorganic_Physiology)

 * Alba  is a clone of Cataclysm's daughter, Raina de Vigo, and augmented with both advanced nanites bonded to her cells, as well as genetic material salvaged from Reginald's corpse before his original body was completely destroyed.  
 * She has an instinctual understanding to work with technology and resistance to technological and magical manipulations

[**Powered Structure**](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Powered_Structure)

* Alba is capable of calling out the nanites in her body to form a powerful outer shell, augmenting her abilities greatly, though at a cost of extreme pain and inability to maintain the form for very long before she has to deactivate the shell to recharge. 
* When active, Alba can create various weapons attached to her body, charged with traces of magical energy, as well as being able instinctively communicate with and have limited control over machines built by her father. 


[**Technomagic**](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Technomagic)

* Alba possesses very limited control over magical energies, combined with her technologically enhanced anatomy. The majority of her magical abilities is the to hide the presence of her nanites, making her seem normal (for a superhuman) to even the most gifted technological experts, and resist low-level magic. However, when she activates her outer shell, she is able to call forth small amounts of magic to boost her built-in technology.

,yugioh,"Hi there,

I used to collect Yugioh cards and play it a bit back in school (2002+) and then stopped around 2 years later and have only just started to watch booster box videos on youtube.

I'd like to start collecting them again, and eventually go to a locals (im in the UK) and start playing, trading etc

Would I be best off buying the latest booster box set, Primal Origin? or am I better off buying one of the boxes that give you the case, sleeves and 9 boosters to start with.

Thanks!",,False,,0,,"Best way to start collecting, tips and tricks?",,,,,,0.0,,,False,t3_2ayarz,False,,,,,5.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},,,5,,,,self,False,,,,,,True,,1405607710.0,,,,,,self.yugioh,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,t5_2rpe6,,,,,2ayarz,,,uberphoenix,,14,,,,,,,/r/yugioh/comments/2ayarz/best_way_to_start_collecting_tips_and_tricks/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/2ayarz/best_way_to_start_collecting_tips_and_tricks/,,1405604110.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441264140.0,,,
,dontstarve,"I would like to make a list of tips for veteran player with your help. Anything that is learned in a few hours/a week should not be on this list. I have around 200h with the game if you wanted to know that information.

Vanilla:

* 1) It takes roughly 15 days to uncover the whole map when starting a new game. To do this, you have to run during most nights too. (default settings)
* 2) Every enemy in the game can be kited, the number of hits between run and go varies from 4 to 1.
* 3) The 2 best character in the game are WX and Wolfgang. The 2 worst are Wes(worst) and Willow.
* 4) The hounds will not follow you if you warp through a wormhole. They will stay close to that wormhole tough. If they didn't all spawn, the rest will spawn at your arrival.
* 5) There will always be 2 touchstone per world though there is only 75% chance of a pig king to spawn per world.
* 6) Chester can become larger or become an ice box with nightmare fuels or blue gems in all his slots on a full moon.
* 7) One of the best defensive ally you can have close to your base is a Lureplant.
* 8) The fastest character in the game is WX with a walking cane and a Magiluminescence and while walking on a road and being struck by a lightning strike (25%+25%+50% + around 50% boost)
* 9) Putting firefly close to your Firepit can save your life when you don't see night coming. Putting firefly near your farm will ensure crop grow during the night too.
* 10) Blue mushroom can restore 100% of your character life, sanity and hunger by eating a mix of cook and uncooked.
* 11) You can hold the spacebar to catch a boomerang.
* 12) If you plant a tree in front of treeguard, he will stop getting aggro at you (15% if far 33% if close).
* 13) In the early days, don't prototype items unless already lost 15 sanity.
* 14) The fastest and easiest way to kill a Beefalo is plant a Tooth Trap below it and keep resetting it.
* 15) If you want Manure quickly, just drop a stack of Berries on the ground when making a Werepig.
* 16) Hits from an Ice Staff always stun enemies canceling their attack.
* 17) The easiest way to deal with MacTusk with most characters is to make him attack Pengulls, and then sneak up on him while he's distracted.
* 18) Morsel + 3 Ice = Meatballs.
* 19) If you pout enough hard turf under a Lureplant, so that the Eyeplants spawn far enough away from it, then not even a Red Hound will kill it.
* 20) If you want Rock Lobsters to stay in one place, then drop a mineral inside a small locked pen near them.
* 21) Meaty Leafs can be turned into Eggs.
* 22) If you keep keep hiding inside a Bush Hat during the Hounds warning they will not aggro you at spawn.
* 23) You can produce more Thulecite with a Construction Amulet and a Deconstruction Staff.
* 24) Don't go in a Splumonkey village with a Lantern.
* 25) Burn nearly destroyed Suits for half a day worth or light. Helmets instead should be given to Pigs.
* 26) Use Guano only to refertilize Farms and plants. For forced growth use Manure.
* 27) If you use Reeds frequently, make a path of Cobble Stone from one to the other to collect them quickly.
* 28) The type of Bird spawned depends on the turf. Blue and Red Birds will spawn more on Grassland Turf, while Crows will span more on Rocky, Savanna and artificial turfs.
* 29) The best way to farm Spiders is with Rock Lobsters. Bunnymen are preferred only because they don't grow into massive herds.
* 30) Night Lights are great for Caves and Ruins due to the big amount of Nightmare Fuel available.
* 31) The best way to deal with Splumonkeys is a friendly Clockwork Bishop.
* 32) The color of the gems in Ancient Statues changes with the Nightmare Cycle or when reloading the game.
* 33) Using both Thulecite Suit and Crown is a waste of Thulecite. Just keep one.
* 34) Send all your unwanted minerals to a Slurtle Mound so that Slurtles can make their Slime for you.
* 35) A lot of things that shouldn't work in theory, do so in practice.
* 46) Unequip item that lose durability over time before sleeping.
* 37) The cheapest really good equipement you can make early game is Football Helmet via Touchstone pig spikes(hammer) and Marble Suit via all the Maxwell building(pickaxe) giving you 1500 point of defence and 99% of damage absorbed.
* 38) Thulecite suit is the only +sanity item that doesn't lose durability while being worn. Use it for dapperness; remove it when fighting. 
* 39) The Siesta Lean-To restores the same health/sanity as a tent, but at a 25 hunger cost instead of 75.
* 40) Six rock lobsters can kill the Ancient Guardian
* 41) Monster meat is literally worth it's weight in gold; only use gold items once you have a bird cage + pig king combo.
* 42) For no fuss McTusk kills: freeze him with and Ice staff, tank and kill the two hounds, then kill him with a ham bat or dark sword, he will die before he can run away. 
* 43) Abigail can be used to fight mobs at night by building a campfire near them, and she's much stronger then. She can takes on 3-4 beefalo or a full nest of pengull before dying.


ROG:

* 1) Every enemy in the game can be kited, the number of hits between run and go varies from 4 to 1. The hardest enemy to kite in the game is the dragonfly (I think we can all agree with that)
* 2) Very early in the game, you can have access to the Oldbell. Use it on large amount of trees you planted earlier and collect around 80 woods and 40 pine cones in 30 sec.
* 3) It take 3 Ice Flingomatic to extinguish a fire of around 80 grass farm (or 80 anything really close).
* 4) Neither Depth Worms nor Moleworms can go past Walls.
* 5) Befriend a Catcoon in Winter - Walk near the shore. Choose one. Catcoon auto-attack pengull.
* 6) If you want to kite a giant , do so on a natural road.
* 7) Catcoons will always be free if you befriend them with a Twig.
* 8) Kite the Bearger. Tank the Moose. Icelock Deerclops. Blow up the Dragonfly.
* 9) Ice Flingomatics will freeze spawning Gobblers.
* 10) You can preserve Rabbit by releasing them inside a small pen.
* 11) Best fuel for Ice Flingomatics are Glommer Goop and Beefalo Wool.
* 12) Hunger wise you're better off sleeping through Summer days.
* 13) Snow Chester + 2 Thermal Stones = Screw Overheating.
* 14) Twigs and Grass grow underground even during Winter. (Not 100% sure about this).

,offmychest,"I had recently reconciled with a friend that I've had for about 4 years. I was going through a bad breakup and realized I shouldn't have cut him out of my life. So we started hanging out again.
Keep in mind, I'm almost 19, he's 27. 


He recently just acquired a ""lingerer."" My friend is actually pretty eccentric himself. He has an unusual profession and collects horror films. Whatever, I love him dearly. Well, the lingerer is someone that is sort of a transient. No one knows exactly where he lives or who his family is. He's far older than me, even 20+ years older than my friend. He doesn't work, and if he has children, they're not in his life. He has a pretty wild sense of humor. He's always saying outlandish shit. That's pretty much why my good friend lets him hang around. He's more often than not at my friend's parties, barging in at strange hours, and hanging out with us. 

At least he was. We'll call him Mike. 

Mike's almost always fooling around with his crap quality boost mobile/trac phone. One night, he decides to show two of my friends photos on his phone of cars, long after I had left. 

He accidentally swiped right too many times. 
There were multiple photos of me and up my skirt. No one knows how many or the nature of what other photos could have been like. My friend told him to delete the photos and get lost before he hits him in the mouth. My other friend backed him up. He ran off.

,buildapcforme,"* What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible. 

The intention for this computer is to run games of heavy caliber, as well as running 4k YouTube videos (Mostly just because). I have a love for gaming, but I have not delved into it too much as my previous (and current) pc's are, well, shit.

* What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes? 

Before r/s/t I'm willing $1.4K (I don't make too much as a lifeguard), but I'm sure I can spare an extra hundred or so for r/s/t.

* When do you plan on building/buying the PC? 

Using pcpartpicker.com (As 99% of you are aware) it monitors when/if there's a drop in sales for parts, but I think I will void that and just get all of my parts collectively during Black Friday Sales, unless there is a drop of maybe $200 in prices.

* What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? [Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc] 

&gt;CPU
&gt;Motherboard
&gt;Memory (RAM)
&gt;Storage (Hard Drive)
&gt;Video Card(s)
&gt;Power Supply
&gt;Case
&gt;OS
&gt;Keyboard

*Also, if I can snag in some cooling equipment in there that would be awesome. I would hate for any overheating.

* Which country [and state/province] will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location? 

I'm in Texas near Houston, roughly an hour and a half, but I can definitely make the drive there. Though, I would prefer to purchase online. I love getting brown boxes on my front door. However, I will spare that fun if it is more ideal to visit said Microcenter.

* If reusing any parts [including monitor[s]/keyboard/mouse/etc], what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.

I'm just reusing my mouse (Logitech M185) and I currently don't watch tv too often, so I am going to a Sceptre (Sceptre X322BV-HD 32""). I know these aren't top-notch equipment, but there easy things that I can upgrade later. Though, if you can squeeze it into the budget price ($1.4K) then, by all means, post it.


* Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU? 

I'm so novice that even after I finish this whole thing I won't fully understand what I just did, so I'm not going to deal with overclocking because I don't want to screw something up, and also with my budget I should get a computer of excellent performance, so there really isn't a need for what I plan on doing.

* Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? [ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc] 

I have a friend who's very helpful, DannyDarko17, and he has me to believe that an SSD (Even more specifically a Samsung 840 EVO 1TB 2.5"" Solid State Drive) is the way to go, and that with what I plan on doing to only get a 1TB or larger SSD. Also, for keyboards, obviously a mechanical keyboard, but those things are so customizable that I can play with that later.

* Do you have any specific case preferences [Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc], or a particular color theme preference for the components? 

The Case doesn't have to be beautiful. Hell, I don't even care if it has lights, windows, and any other aesthetic bullshit on it. As long as it does the job it'll work where it's going (Under my desk). For color I think black and Red is a very common color combination, for a good reason, and I may seem a bit unoriginal with my color choice, but I still say black and red, as red is a great color for darkness (reason they use it in submarines), so for practicality black and red, but I think black and blue, or black and green would be of interest. Just a personal preference.

* Do you already have a copy of Windows 7 or 8, or do you need a copy included with the build? 

I will need a copy of Windows 8.1. I like Windows 7, but Windows 8 and 8.1 are practically 7 with more to it, plus I plan on having it for years to come so why would I get what is the norm now versus what will be the norm in a year or two? Plus, if I were to get a touch screen monitor eventually it'll make the layout much more useful since it's intended for tablets anyways.

* Extra info if required:

I have very little grasp, so please tell me what the pros and cons are and tell me if some things aren't compatible with a different part, and I will just love to hear all the feedback. I might even boost my Budget if it's worth some of the parts.

Here is a rough draft of my pcpartpick'ed' computer.

,Cynicalbrit,"With the recent release of Warlords of Draenor beta, I wanted to take a moment to look back at why The Cynical Brit himself dropped off of the world of Azeroth - specifically at the reasons highlighted in the final episode of Azeroth Daily 24/05/11 - http://youtu.be/ndcysuEIqus

The main points as to why he left WoW at that time was in regards to nerfing the Tier 11 content for the release of Patch 4.2 as well as the feeling that the game was no longer intended for himself. Reasons as to why he has failed to return to Azeroth since Patch 4.3 or more to the point, since Mists of Pandaria and the upcoming changes to make landfall in Warlords of Draenor is still uncertain, as he has never really talked about WoW at all since this video three years ago.

Here are an example of many changes to the game that happened in a post-TB World of Warcraft that he had requested or things that would have invoked various opinions from him.

Better TBC/WotLk Questing Flow (Patch 4.3) - TotalBiscuit mentioned many times since Cataclsym release, that TBC and WotLK leveling content wasn't enjoyable and any effort to improve it would have been appreciated or even the option to skip it. Maybe not to the extreme of the Level 90 Character Boost to follow later.

Void Storage/Transmogrification (Patch 4.3) - Probably another feature recommended to be added by either TotalBiscuit or on one of The Mailbox segments of the show.

Raid Finder (Patch 4.3.2) - Specifically on the final episode of Azeroth daily, TotalBiscuit wanted an Easy/Normal/Hard Mode as a way of letting people experience the content rather than nerfing it to the ground. While future tiers still were nerfed, Ahead of the Curve Feats of Strengths have given more value to players who were able to do it at harder stages.

Account-wide Mounts/Achievements (Patch 5.0.3) - While I'm not entirely sure he mentioned any complaint with the original system, this would have been a much appreciated change. Account-wide Heirlooms being the next thing, though that sadly will not make it into the Warlords of Draenor release.

Daily quest cap removal (Patch 5.0.3) - Commented at least once by TotalBiscuit for not making a whole lot of sense to have in the first place.

More World PvP Engagement (Patch 5.1) - A requested change at some point, exact timing unknown.

Throne of Thunder (Patch 5.2) - A return to multiple-raid bosses per tier, which TotalBiscuit had disapproved of Firelands only have 7 bosses, claiming that it wasn't enough content for one tier. Throne of Thunder and Siege of Orgrimmar soon after gave plenty of bosses for the tier, which all would have been appreciated. The only possible displeasure is that much of the bosses are linear as opposed to Ulduar, which was far less linear in boss selection, though all of them did need to be finished.

Flexible Raid Difficulty (Patch 5.4) - A further extension of Totalbiscuit's desire for more difficulty modes. Particularly, this would have been a very welcomed change in my opinion if he had still be around, because it allowed bosses to scale to the number of players you possessed rather than having to have 10 or 25 people specifically. Unfortunately, this ran into problems of its own that will be corrected in Warlords of Draenor once Flex mode becomes the new ""Normal Mode"", a 10-25 player Normal Mode becomes the new ""Heroic"", and a 20-man fixed Heroic mode becomes the new ""Mythic"".

Timeless Isle (Patch 5.4) - Something that probably would not have been easily approved of, but somewhat necessary to get people back into the game more easily. It does undermine previous tiers of content, which TotalBiscuit did not appreciate on the notion of nerfs and probably would not approved of this either.


The Level 90 Character Boost for $60 USD/Free with Warlords - Good news on one hand for providing a means for people to get back into the game. Possibly considered a terrible idea by TotalBiscuit based on previous comments regarding micro-transactions in subscription based games and such.


Mass Character Model Upgrades (Warlords) - Another big feature requested by viewers and TotalBiscuit for the longest time since the start of Azeroth Daily.

Many other changes could be listed here, but these above are the most important that would have had invoked an opinion from the man himself whether they be things he might approve or things he'd criticize heavily into the ground. As such, this discussion here is for collecting thoughts and other changes to the game as to other reasons why TB no longer plays WoW and what might have changed since his departure for the better/worse.

Please note, this is NOT any request asking TotalBiscuit to come back to World of Warcraft, as he clearly seems to have no desire to. However, a discussion on objectively good or bad changes to the game, why he left, and maybe if he wished to chime in, what he thinks about the game's present/future would be appreciated instead.",,False,,0,,A Look Back at why TotalBiscuit quit WoW,,,,,one,0.0,,,False,t3_2awugw,False,,,,,7.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},Discussion,,7,,,,self,1405562605,,,,,,True,,1405562464.0,,,,,,self.Cynicalbrit,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,t5_2tqbt,,,,,2awugw,,,Thaumasurge,,40,,,,,,,/r/Cynicalbrit/comments/2awugw/a_look_back_at_why_totalbiscuit_quit_wow/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cynicalbrit/comments/2awugw/a_look_back_at_why_totalbiscuit_quit_wow/,,1405558864.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441264818.0,,,

,TheBluePill,"I know we're already covering the whole thread, but when I discovered this particular post I couldn't think anything but WHAT THE FUCK, how can this get upvoted on TRP.

[This guy outright admits staging an armed robbery and blames his girlfriend for it.](http://np.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2atei1/what_was_your_life_slap_on_your_face/ciynyrv)

&gt;When I was arrested for armed robbery. It probably sounds insane, but I did this because I was the ultimate beta.

I... just... wat.

&gt;My ex's friend got caught stealing his dying uncle's possessions for his Cocaine/Heroin habit and he had to get it all out of pawn in a day or get kicked to the street and the cops called. He got this call when we were driving back home from a long day of shooting up dope, and he came up with the plan to knock some places over and get the cash to get the shit out of pawn.

Please keep that part in mind for a moment.

&gt;My girlfriend agreed instantly, she always thought she was gangster as fuck even though she's a white girl from Utah. It came down upon me to make the real call, as I was the only one with a vehicle. I was the only one with firearms, because I was a drug dealer. I had been fighting with her over the past month (longer really... that was just the last bout) and I thought it would impress her. I didn't like this guy, so I wasn't going to give him any of the cash I had earned from selling shit that day, I had $600 in cash just on me, but fuck that. 

So, this guy is a drug dealer as well, and as he later admits, was dumb enough to get hooked on his own supply. I'm not telling this in the sense of ""lol, I'd be a much better drug dealer"" but in the sense of ""It's not really like he didn't pretend to be the biggest gangster in town as well.""

&gt;So, we hit a few places and at the last one there were cops with their guns drawn, and long story short I was charged with two counts of Attempted Aggravated Robbery and I kicked dope in jail and got to rehab. It was in rehab that I came to face the truth that my greatest weakness wasn't even Heroin, Cocaine, PCP, any of that shit. I ultimately became an addict because it integrated into her lifestyle. Sure, I had a problem, but I came within inches of dying for this girl, and now I am branded for the rest of my life because I wanted to get my dick sucked. 

The problem wasn't that he was a drug addict or that, as I told you to keep in mind a few lines before, he explicitly said that he did it for a friend of his, NO, IT WAS HIS GIRLFRIEND.

&gt;To say that this was a ""slap"" was an understatement. It rocked my world and completely shit right down my throat with the fact of just how broken my interaction and attitude towards women was. I live off of raising my value/SMV nowadays. I kicked life onto hard mode by becoming a felon, but in the end I'm glad. I don't know if I would have been led here if it wasn't for the path I took. I could still be a supplicating beta and emotionally pathetic, a mere shadow of what I could be.

You weren't a Beta, you were a stupid idiot who tried to play hard-boiled gangster. I can't imagine any behavior more stereotypically ""Alpha"" than that. You literally say that you think your path of life was a GOOD choice, you fuckwad.

---

And the comments:

&gt;Good stuff. Occasionally dropping the slightest hint at having been in jail before can boost your SMV if done correctly. There's nothing fucking cool about jail. But for some reason, girls like the ""edge."" 

wat.

&gt;I have a dismissed felony from having a fake ID in college. Best thing that ever happened to me. 

Seriously. You believe that you'll pull dem bitches because you tried buying booze with an fake ID. You really believe that you'll hear the collective sound of panties dropping when bringing that up on a party. And you believe that this is somehow equivalent to a drug dealer staging two armed robberies.

Seriously.

&gt;The American legal system gets a lot of shit from critics, but it actually worked in our favor. The jail/court/probation system is so fucking terrible that I'd never risk dealing with that shit again. 

Yeah, sure, and if it was about re-socialization instead of petty retribution, I'm sure that wouldn't have happened.

Oh wait.

&gt;i love reading stories like this. good for you man. reformed bad boy image, thats the kinda thing woman read about in romance novels. rock that image.

This guys really believe that damaged men will attract anything but damaged women.

,Planetside,"So I was reading through [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/2at3bt/54_better_ways_to_monetize_planetside_2/) recently and saw ""Player Bounties"" suggested. As a dedicated Infiltrator, this was an intriguing notion to me as I find myself hearing the phrase “High value target” quite often when reading threads regarding infiltrators and especially the contribution of sniping in this game and I wanted to think of a way that this could be implemented within the game in a way that would bring in a continuous stream of revenue (if only a small one) for SOE as well as adding some fun for us players.
  
Some questions I tried to take into consideration whilst coming up with this idea were:

- How much effort it would take to implement? (I know nothing about programming, so there are a lot of presumptions)

- Would this idea make more money in the long run than it would cost to implement and would it make enough in a short space of time to make it worth adding sooner rather than later?

- Does it actually add anything worth having to the game?
  
  
  **The Idea:** You purchase bounties with station cash in the form of an item much like the xp boosts you can currently purchase. They might even go into the same inventory as XP boosts to save having to add much to the UI, though as there would already need to be a new section added to the depot for buying the bounties this is something the devs would decide for themselves.
  
  For simplicity, let's just say bounties were bought in three stages (Bronze 50% Xp), Silver (100% Xp) and Gold (200% Xp).
Once purchased and added to your inventory, you could then ""activate"" the bounty by clicking it just like you would an XP boost, at which point it would prompt you to type in a players name (More UI). Once you'd done that and accepted, it would add the xp modifier of the bounty to the targeted player. Any enemy that then kills the player you added the bounty too would receive the xp bonus corresponding to that bounty. Bounties should be able to be added to players from any faction; so if you want revenge for being TK'd without getting weapon locked or to simply troll your friends, you could incentivise your enemies to kill them for you with a higher bounty.
  
  To distinguish who has a bounty on them and avoid unnecessary UI clutter, a bronze, silver or gold outline could be added to the doritos (Which would otherwise remain the same player-set faction colour). This would allow enemy players to much easier track and prioritize players to take down. It would also be important take xp stacking into consideration if this were added to the game as a player with a 200% xp boost killing a player with a 200% bounty could potentially bring in a massive amount of xp if the bonuses stacked. More so if vehicles were included in the bounty bonus. 
  
  So now we have incentives for players to kill those With bounties. What's going to give people an incentive to Buy bounties? More XP. 
  
  A little like your average deploy type kill bonuses received when a player spawning on your beacon or dropping from your galaxy kills an enemy; Each time a player kills a target you have set a bounty on, you receive a small amount of xp (which would vary depending on the level of bounty you placed on the player). If multiple players set a bounty on the same person, the reward for killing that player is set at the highest bounty, and the players that set the bounties still receive their small amount of xp as usual. Ribbons could also be added for things like killing bountied players, setting bounties on players and killing players that have your own bounty on them. For long time, higher level players that don't need the XP/Certs so much, titles and/or decals could be awarded for setting bounties and killing players with bounties on them.
  
  In theory, one could argue that someone with a lot of money could abuse this by simply putting bounties on everyone and just sitting around collecting XP for doing nothing, which is true; However even if someone were to do so, they'd still be giving back to the community as they'd still be generating income for SOE, but other players would also be benefiting from their laziness in the form of bonus XP for each of those kills.
  
  **TL;DR** – Bounties work like xp boosts in reverse. New UI for the depot, possibly the inventory &amp; the doritos would need to be added. More dev work on Titles/Ribbons and xp balancing would be needed. SOE could potentially receive another consistent stream of income. Players would have fun killing high profile targets as they'd be rewarded for it. Players would be rewarded for setting bounties on other players.

,Guildwars2,"After my recent WvW Staff Elementalist post people have been interested in the melee train. I have had both requests for Warrior and Guardian, but I feel doing them separately would be a waste; as such I've collected them into a single guide - due to their interdependency.

***Traits*** ^(Put here because they are over 10,000 characters in length)

There is a few trait distributions on both classes, I'll cover what I think is the most common for both.

**Guardian**

Trait Line | Adept | Master |Grandmaster
----------|-----|-----|-----|------|-----|-----------
Zeal |  |  |
Radiance |  |  | 
Valor | [Retributive Armor](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Retributive_Armor) | [Strength In Numbers](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Strength_in_Numbers)| [Altruistic Healing](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Altruistic_Healing)
Honor | [Superior Aria](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Aria) | [Two-Handed Mastery](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Two-Handed_Mastery) | [Pure Of Voice](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pure_of_Voice)
Virtues | [Master Of Consecrations](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Master_of_Consecrations)  |  | 

There are a few traits that get swapped out, and often you don't take a 00662 distribution;

* The 'most common' distribution is 01661, for [Justice Is Blind](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Justice_is_Blind).
* 00644 distributions also exist (or 00464) where you take [Indomitable Courage](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Indomitable_Courage). Personally I feel the stability gained from doing this is too small to be helpful in most fights (and the up-time is very low), but I respect some guilds like it run.

*Trait Explaination*

[Retributive Armor](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Retributive_Armor)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This trait is taken for the precision. A Guardian sits around 1800-1900 toughness, which means you gain about 7% critical chance from this trait. I view this as stronger than other traits that can be slotted here, as your gear needs to be more vitality focused than a Warrior (as you have the same base health as an Elementalist), meaning there is less space for precision.

[Strength In Numbers](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Strength_in_Numbers) | [Glacial Heart](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Glacial_Heart)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The typical melee group will have 2 Guardians in it. Only 1 of them needs to run this trait. This is a huge boost to the party and allows both Guardians and Warriors to run with less toughness than normal, as this boosts them over the threshold. It is a very strong passive trait (which is always up when you need it) which allows more offensive gear to be taken on your melee. If you are the 2nd Guardian in a group (meaning the first Guardian is running this) swap out for [Glacial Heart](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Glacial_Heart) (and run a Hammer). Glacial Heart is very strong because the chill procs whenever you deal damage with a Hammer equipped. That means if you drop a [Purging Flames](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Purging_Flames) while having Hammer out and they touch it they could be chilled. Although its cooldown is 30 seconds, I would argue getting 5 guys Chilled each push is a very strong thing to have. It is more valuable than [Hydromancy](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Sigil_of_Hydromancy), which is more often than not triggering on your regroups than on top of the enemy. Generally you want a Guardian with hammer with Glacial and the Guardian without on Strength In Numbers.

[Altruistic Healing](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Altruistic_Healing)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This is maybe my favorite trait on Guardian. If you run 6 deep in Honor and stack [Sigil Of Life](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Sigil_of_Life) this will heal you for 75 health per boon you apply. Lets just look at that for a second; Each shout applies 2 boons to 5 people (3 if they have a condition). This means you get 1125 health back (75x3x5) per shout used. This means your sustain just from normal play is very high. Then you look at your symbols, each pulse of a symbol gives 375 health (75x5), and with a 01661 build [Virtue of Justice](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Virtue_of_Justice) heals 1125 ({3 stacks of might}x5x75). This gives you some amazing sustain in fights, and allows you to endure the same amount of damage as a Warrior (basically acts as a [Healing Signet](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Healing_Signet)). I would say this trait is essential for any level of play (lower tier or higher tier) on a Guardian.

***

[Superior Aria](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Aria)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This is taken because you're running (at least) 2 shouts. Shorter cool-down on Stability is essential and without this trait you'll find you are a drag as people are expecting you to run this.

[Two-Handed Mastery](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Two-Handed_Mastery) | [Empowering Might](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Empowering_Might)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Check with your commander if he is running this trait. If he is/he is a Warrior take the trait, otherwise take [Empowering Might](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Empowering_Might). Two-Handed Mastery is a strong trait as both weapons will experience reduced cooldown. If your commander is running this (or they are a Warrior) you need this to keep up with their leaps and Empower regroups. If this trait is not taken by them (some commanders don't) Empowering Might is better due to the free might you can get off of it (which again is triggering Altruistic Healing).

[Pure Of Voice](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pure_of_Voice)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Pure of Voice stops you and your party getting caught. Using [""Hold The Line!""](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/%22Hold_the_Line!%22) will cleanse that immobilize holding your group in place, or get rid of the weakness negating your damage, remove that cripple holding you back; you get the idea. As well as this it gives you 5 extra Altruistic Healing procs on your shouts (5x1 boon applied). It is a great party support skill, and you're being selfless by taking it.

***

[Master Of Consecrations](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Master_of_Consecrations)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This is taken on a 00662 build (or another variant) and is expected by some guilds. This means your purging flames lasts longer, meaning the melee train has 'condition immunity' to the harmful conditions. [Melandru](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Rune_of_Melandru) [-25%], [Lemongrass Poultry Soup](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bowl_of_Lemongrass_Poultry_Soup) [-40%] and [Purging Flames](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Purging_Flames) [-33%] leaves you with a tiny 2% condition duration on Guardians, while Warriors get a stronger effect ([Lemongrass Poultry Soup](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bowl_of_Lemongrass_Poultry_Soup) [-40%], [Purging Flames](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Purging_Flames) [-33%] and [Dogged March](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dogged_March) [-33% on the 'nasty' conditions]) totaling -6% on the 'nasty' conditions. This condition 'invulnerability' means guild groups often blow 1 Purging Flames per party per push and then stand in it for longer meaning while they are dealing damage they can keep on tag. You can achieve the same effect without the trait, but as it lasts longer you can keep the damage up for longer without fear. The trait also lowers the cooldown on Purging Flames by 7 seconds, which allows for more condition cleanse in groups and is often run by guilds - to up burst, increase survivability and remove more conditions.

[Indomitable Courage](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Indomitable_Courage)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Personally I don't like this trait, I view the stability gained from it as too little. I've included it here in case people wonder why it is run. This isn't to be used like a normal stability (i.e popped as you push) you save this for in fight/as you pull off for a regroup. If a group is throwing AoDs at you as you pull of this trait is an effective counter to this. You have to weigh up Pure Of Voice and Altruistic Healing as well though, which I view to be stronger traits.

Again, there are some other builds for Warrior. The most common builds are 'Worker Warriors' a term coined by [RG] Red Guard and is now commonly used. These builds focus on using the Warrior as condition cleanse, as if they are 'working' for the group.

* 00464 is a build which I personally use/prefer. The alternative is 00563 (or 00662 taking [Spiked Armor](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spiked_Armor) / [Defy Pain](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Defy_Pain_\(warrior_trait\))). Personally I see Destruction Of The Empowered as stronger than both of these (its a better damage increase than [Armored Attack](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Armored_Attack)).

*Trait Explanation*

[Dogged March](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dogged_March)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This helps to keep the Warrior on commander at all times, and as mentioned above synergises very well with Guardian's [Purging Flames](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Purging_Flames) and [Lemongrass Poultry Soup](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bowl_of_Lemongrass_Poultry_Soup) [a combo used by a lot of guild groups]. Although it is possible to run without this trait, there is also little to replace it for a standard worker spec.

[Cleansing Ire](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Cleansing_Ire) | [Last Stand](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Last_Stand)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This is your personal condition cleanse, curing 3 every time you [Earthshaker](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Earthshaker) (Hammer Stun) or [Flurry](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Flurry). This also keeps your adrenaline full as you often take over 30 pieces of damage per push (enough to refill your bar). This trait allows Earthshaker to become a spamable skill, and makes Flurrying viable mid-push. Last Stand is viable, and I would run instead if you're more aggressive/like to guarantee the banner.

[Defy Pain](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Defy_Pain_\(warrior_trait\))

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This is a trait taken by some players. It allows them to become invulnerable when pressured at the cost of their weapon swap cooldown (which in turn lowers their blasts and healing) and damage (dropping [Destruction Of The Empowered](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Destruction_of_the_Empowered)). While being a 'nice' trait to have I feel it lowers the effectiveness of the Warrior. By taking this you can argue you stay up more, to which I say you should be dropping that low anyway. Your commander will keep you alive, if you're taking too much damage you're not sticking close enough; missing regroups; using your shouts ineffectively or there is going to be a group wipe.

[Spiked Armor](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spiked_Armor)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A trait popularized by [RG] Red Guard. Now-a-days this isn't as viable, you'll have retaliation when needed from Guardian's [""Stand Your Ground!""](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/%22Stand_Your_Ground!%22), and by taking this you're saying to me ""I don't trust my Guardians"".


***

[Lung Capacity](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Lung_Capacity)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Much like the Guardian's [Superior Aria](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Aria) this is both an essential trait to the build and one which is expected. You have 2 shouts on the bar and the purpose of the build is using them to support the group, by not taking this you disadvantage the whole party.

[Quick Breathing](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Quick_Breathing)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This adds more condition cleanse to the build, as well as reducing your blast finisher cooldown. [Charge](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Charge_\(warrior_skill\)) then has the ability to cure up to 4 conditions, and [Call To Arms](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Call_to_Arms) means you can blast faster (meaning more heals over time) and cure any poison on you at a regroup (which otherwise would drop your healing effectiveness). A very strong trait which, much like Lung Capacity, you disadvantage the group by not taking.

[Vigorous Shouts](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Vigorous_Shouts)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This is a strong trait giving about 3000 health to your party every 20 seconds (2 shouts every 20 seconds). This allows for some great sustain, and in clutch moments gives you the health to survive. When combined with [Virtue of Resolve](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Virtue_of_Resolve) you can spike out a 6300 heal on your group (1658+1658+3000), about ⅓ of your health for the whole group.

***

[Inspiring Shouts](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Inspiring_Shouts)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This allows along with Cleansing Ire keeps your adrenaline full as you fight. This keeps your [Adrenal Health](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Adrenal_Health) regeneration ticking after using a burst skill. It can be traded for [Thrill Of The Kill](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Thrill_of_the_Kill), but that is a very 'snowball' heavy trait (meaning if you're not winning its not going to do you much good.

[Destruction Of The Empowered](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Destruction_of_the_Empowered)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; One of the more broken Warrior traits. If you assume they have Stability, Vigor, Regeneration, Protection, Might, Swiftness and Retaliation then you will get a 21% damage boost, 24% with Fury. This is a massive damage boost (greater than [Armored Attack](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Armored_Attack)) which punishes the enemy for stacking boons. A must have trait in my opinion.

,randomsuperpowers,"**Cato**

**SINCE 2014**

He was doing research in one of his private bunkers at the time of the attack. He recognized the danger of the situation, and so set the bunker into lockdown. He had his little entourage all go into suspended animation, to be awoken automatically when the bunker opened, but before he got into his suspended animation pod, he saw on his video monitors of the outside world that Dominus had already been defeated. Then, out of what may have simply been apathy, he stayed in his bunker watching the world recover through security footage and news broadcasts until he ran out of cheap take-out food, which was about 6 years. He has finally decided to leave the bunker now that he is out of said take-out, awakening his entourage once more, and has returned to trying to learn as much as he can in this new world.

**APEARANCE**

Now 21, he looks fairly different. He has gotten taller, but not by much, being only 5'4”. other than that, he really just looks like a larger older version of how he used to look. He also has taken to making his cloths from an experimental almost bulletproof fabric.

**POWERS AND STATS**


[Panmnesia](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Panmnesia) : His primary power. Cato was born with a freakishly powerful memory, so much so that he remembers every single detail of every single moment of his life perfectly. He can use this power to learn at insanely accelerated rates and it also allows him to keep track of several things in his field of view simultaneously, allowing him to watch multiple screens at the same time or read an entire page of text by looking at it for a moment for example.

[Adoptive Muscle Memory](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Adoptive_Muscle_Memory) : Not only can he remember things he has seen perfectly, he is also capable of copying any physical actions and techniques that he observes to the same degree of skill as he saw it done. he has used this power to master martial arts, weapon usage, cooking, painting styles, surgery, and a host of other skills.

[Photographic Deduction](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Photographic_Deduction) : Not only can he see how individual things work, he sees how many of these things interact with each other. He can discover and understand connections between things very quickly, figuring out exactly how an object ricocheted (or *will* ricochet) by simply looking at the environment.

**Wulf**


**SINCE 2014**

Wulf has been collecting himself a small army of animals in a few of the remains of Europe, slowly claiming Finland as his pack's “hunting grounds”. He has been trying to remain largely unnoticed by the general public and keeps tabs on the metahumans through the use of animal spies stationed across the world. He does not intend to be overtly malicious to anyone, but would not mind killing anyone who got in the way of his hunt or killing to keep his pack fed, happy, and safe. He has become more adept at using his human form since he came to earth, and has learned how to use modern weaponry in his human form.

**APEARANCE**

His appearance is largely unchanged, with the exception that he has now taken to wearing a black military uniform in his human form. He also now carries around a custom-made pistol.

**POWERS AND STATS**

[Wolfwere physiology](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Wolfwere_Physiology) : In his mortal body, Wulf has the ability to change between the form of a human or a huge wolf, although when weakened, asleep, etc, he reverts naturally to wolf form rather than human form.

[Animal Manipulation](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Animal_Manipulation) : As a powerful member of the wild hunt, he has the ability to command any non-super predatory creatures. His powers have no affect on humans, non-predatory animals, and superbeings. While an animal is under his control, it will obey any command he gives it without question to the fullest of its ability, and he may speak to the animal both verbally and telepathically.

[Mythic Physiology](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Mythic_Physiology) : Even when trapped in a mortal body, he still retains a fraction of his power as a member of the wild hunt. This gives him supernatural physical abilities, drastically boosted senses of hearing, smell, and taste, and the ability to identify other spirits and mythical beings.

**ENTOURAGE**

~~His small pack has now grown into a veritable army that patrols a small area of one of the depopulated parts of Europe.~~

**THE PUPS**

For the past six years, in addition to raising his army Wulf has also been populating it with a select number of  cross-breeds between himself and mundane wolves, resulting in a select few troops with fractions of his powers. He also discovered that his offspring mature at unbelievable rates, about three times as fast as a normal wolf.

**FIRST GENERATION**

His pride and joy, these twelve (ten boys, two girls) half-breds are his direct children. They have almost the exact same powers as him, and are immune to his own mind-controlling powers, but are fiercely loyal to him. They are about the size of tigers in their wolf form, and can take human form just as Wulf can. In human form the normally bear some manner of weapon, although it is different for each one.

[Wolfwere physiology](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Wolfwere_Physiology)

[Animal Manipulation](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Animal_Manipulation):  Cannot override the commands of their father, and lose control of any animal after it travels too far from them.

**SECOND GENERATION**

The children of the first-generation descendants are not nearly as powerful as their grandfather, but are still far more powerful than any normal wolf. In their “human” forms they retain several animalistic traits, including fangs, ears, and a tail. They also have somewhat more beast-like minds, and can be somewhat less intelligent then their predecessors. They usually wield basic weapons in their human form.

[Wolfwere physiology](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Wolfwere_Physiology)

**THIRD GENERATION**

His third generation descendants would be barely remarkable, were it not for their lesser versions of his powers. They can transform into a vaguely humanoid form similar to that of a traditional werewolf rather than into a human, appearing as a human with full-body fur, fangs, ears, a snout and a tail. In their animal forms they are almost the same as an apex wolf. They also sometimes have almost completely bestial minds, although some have the minds of a (somewhat unintelligent) human. They usually wield basic weapons in their human form.

,SoulGuardians,"**EXCLUSIVE**: *This will be posted on Facebook tomorrow, but I wanted to give you guys an early heads up on Normal HOLO cards for those who haven't figured them out already*

Normal HOLO Cards are special Soul Arts cards that give a stat boost to the player simply from sitting in the inventory. Normal HOLO cards can be created by evolving Sealed Cards.

Normal Holo Cards may be obtained through the following process:

1. Acquire the EVO Material 1 card (from the chart at the link below) and raise it to MAX level. The chart linked below lists the locations to acquire these cards.

2. Collect the rest of the materials for the HOLO card ( this will range from one to four extra materials - see the chart linked below).

3. Evolve the Material 1 card in order to receive the corresponding Normal HOLO card.

For all information on which cards are needed for EVO and where to find them, please visit the wiki page here: http://soul-guardians.wikia.com/wiki/Normal_Holo_Cards",,False,,0,,Normal HOLO Cards and how to obtain them (charts included),,,,,,0.0,,,False,t3_2atah2,False,,,,,5.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},,,5,,,,self,False,zqlogo,,,,,True,,1405473697.0,,,,,,self.SoulGuardians,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,moderator,t5_320n8,,,,,2atah2,,,ZQShadd,,4,,,,,,,/r/SoulGuardians/comments/2atah2/normal_holo_cards_and_how_to_obtain_them_charts/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/SoulGuardians/comments/2atah2/normal_holo_cards_and_how_to_obtain_them_charts/,,1405470097.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441266478.0,,,
,Bravenewbies,"Hey all, I'm here to bring you another wall of text about my solo roaming shenanigans. I hope you don't mind, and hope some of you will enjoy the read!

So, after logging on, I was in a eager mood to do some solo roaming. Lately I've been trying lots of new ships, but tonight I was in the mood for my old trusty brawling Crusader. As usual, I undocked from V-3 and headed straight to GE to check for any -A- camps, and then to HED. Upon finding nothing in either system, I decided to work my way back towards HY to check there as well. Upon landing, I notice the Space Warriors guys are back to camping this gate now, so I decided to poke around a bit and see what would happen.

**Mild frustration**: guys, I get it, we all want to get rid of these gate camps, but the way you're doing it of just warping 20 people to the gate to try and catch them is *not* going to work. The best way to deal with these guys is small groups of inties where you wait for them to uncloak on someone, then you each engage different targets. This makes it so their Falcon can't jam you all, and one intercept will rip apart a bomber really fast when not jammed. This is a slow way of doing it, but it is much more effective than just throwing 20 people at them where they will just cloak up and wait for the group to leave, or just go to another gate.

Ok, back to the story. After watching them kill quite a few people, I decided to just skirt around 30km from the little ball, and wait for them to pop out for a kill. Each time they came out, I would go in and get some damage on one of the bombers before I got jammed, then I would simply back out and go next round. 

After doing this a few times, of doing this, I noticed they were starting to scatter a bit. And just as I noticed some of them warping off one by one, I decided to go in for the kill on one of the straggling bombers. To my surprise, however, their Rapier warped in uncloaked, and landed right next to me and I was able to get a lock+scram before he could recloak and warp away. 

KM isn't on zkill yet, so here's the ingame mail. http://puu.sh/ac2Dg/451a546498.jpg

After the Rapier went down, the rest of their group slowly trickled out of system, and the gate was finally safe again. 

After getting back in station and sitting around a bit, I heard word that there were 4 CO2 guys camping the GE gate in V3 (Crow, Comet, Enyo, Malediction). Now, I've been really trying to work on my ability to take on multiple targets by myself, so I decided this was a perfect opportunity for a dual rep Ishkur. 

I undock, head to the gate, and sure enough they aggress me. I made the mistake of going for the comet for too long before I realized that he was rail fit and was kiting me. Once I noticed that, I turned my attention to one of the Crows that had wandered too close, and I made short work of him. By this point, they're realizing that with heavy kinetic damage, they're never going to break the reps of my Ishkur, and they start scattering, but not before I'm able to land a scram on the Enyo (who is also dual rep) and brawl him down after some time. 

http://puu.sh/ac2U8/f4fa5aafe9.jpg
http://puu.sh/ac2VK/4d1db1e34a.jpg

After taunting them a bit in local, I realized they weren't going to come back, so I docked up and switched back to my Crusader with the intent of heading to provi. 

As I started getting a few jumps into provi, I found myself in a relatively busy system that seemed to have quite a few miners out and about. Not being interested in killing miners, I warped to the station to see if they had any defense. Sure enough, a Taranis undocked and engaged me. I was winning the fight, but unfortunately he was dual prop with a scram, so he was able to pull range and get away with about 20% structure. After I repaired up a bit, I noticed another Taranis, as well as a Dramiel sitting on the station. I decided to come in a little closer to try and pull one out, and sure enough the Dramiel took the bait. 

https://zkillboard.com/kill/40097012/ (**note** the A type repper, along with the low-end exile booster) it was a pretty standard brawling fight, and he tried to pull range at the end to warp off, but I was able to finish just as he got out of scram range. Unfortunately, the other two Taranis landed on grid again and were able to finish me off quickly as I was completely out of cap and couldn't get out of scram range. 

After dying, I decided I wanted to go back for revenge, so I took out the dual rep Ishkur again with the intent of heading back to the same system. Unfortunately, as fate would have it, I ran into a small provi gang in SV5, consisting of 3 Coercers, a couple Crows, Taranis, and I believe another 2 frigates. After sitting off of a safe watching them, I decided I would try to be manly and see if I could split them up and take on their gang. I managed to get the 3 Coercers and a Crow to aggress me on one side, so I then jumped through into HED and decided to see how many I could take down. Unfortunately, it was a really bad fight for me, as I had horrible module management(I burned out one of my reppers like a dumbass), and I only managed to get one Crow and one Taranis before the Coercers came back and finished me off quickly. 

After getting annoyed with myself, knowing I could have probably killed another one or two, or perhaps gotten away, had I not had such horrible micro management, I decided to sit in station a bit and cool down and recollect myself. After a few minutes of chatting it up, I decided to get another Ishkur and go for round two. However, as I undock, I notice there is a Kadeshi Garmur sitting around 120km off the station, clearly looking to pick a fight. I redock, and quickly jump into my trusty Crusader. 

**Small note for those of you interested in the Crusader**: this ship is probably the most intense interceptor there is in terms of the amount of micro management it requires. That being said, it is extremely rewarding as well. The fit I run gets 160 dps cold with Scorch, and 200 cold with Multi. Again, though, if you run all mods in this ship, you will cap yourself out in less than 30 seconds. 

So anyways, as I undock, I decide to warp to a bookmark that's relatively in the same direction as him, just to let him know that I'm interested in a fight. **Note, when you are looking to fight another ship, *always* check their speed. This can give you tons of information about their fit, and if they're running links, or have implants. **

Without moving, I take note that his maximum speed appears to be around 4.1kms cold. Knowing that my Crusader goes 4.4 cold, I decide to try and bait him. I turn on my MWD, and set my max speed to 3800. After flying around each other at around 70km, he warps off to an asteroid belt. I quickly follow, and warp in around 100km off of him. I again turn on my MWD, set max speed to 3800, and start moving towards him at a semi perpendicular angle. As I get to around 50km, I turn off my MWD and just slowly drift. As soon as I get to 45k, he hits his MWD and locks me up, and I decide it's now or never because I have to get on top of him before he gets a good angle. 

My plan worked, and he was completely caught off guard by my 6.4kms speed, and I was able to get a scram on him before he established a good orbit. Now, back to what I was saying earlier, once you catch someone in a Crusader, the hard part begins as you have to juggle your mods. Even though he was not scram fit, I knew I couldn't afford to keep my MWD going, so I turned it off, and then began pulsing my ancillary repper just enough to stay alive. 

**Tip, if you are in a Laser or Hybrid ship, and you are low on cap, ungroup your weapons and manually activate each one so you can better manage cap usage.**

I was able to manage things well, and I brought him down with 5 charges of my ancillary repper left. 

https://zkillboard.com/kill/40097277/ (note to any Garmur pilots, please plug your EM hole). 

Anyways, after that I got into a couple other fights, but nothing too noteworthy, and I decided to call it a night. 

I hope you all enjoyed this, I'll try to keep the wall of text to a shorter length next time, as I tend to ramble quite a bit.

,Planetside,"Here are some ideas I've had while playing the game that I think would help the game and some that would be good additions to the game, to increas it's immersion and playability.

Firstly I would like to see an update dedicated to movement mechanics and annimations within the game. Some things I would like to see in this update are things like better infantry movement annimations, And some mechanics that I think have been overlooked in the game and seen as ""Unessenctial"", things like this would include proning(laying down), ducking in and out of cover and leaning around corners and walls, I think these things will be a nice compliment to the game and make it feel a little more immersive. 

Secondly I would also like to see the ability to hang/sit on the side of vehicles like in the original Planetside, where you could have infantry sitting on the side of tanks and hanging off of the side of a Sunderer. Also to add to this mechanic, the appropriate annimations when embarking and disembarking on vertain vehicles. I understand that this would make tanks alot more dangerous because of the fact that there are infantry shooting from all angles, a simple but maybe a slightly annoying feature to fix this would if some infantry were hanging onto the side of a Sundy, then make it so that they cannot look down the sights are you're only allowed to hip fire, and also with slightly reduced ip fire accuracy. With a tank it would be a little different, where as if you have 4 guys sitting on a lighting you tend to see them not really hanging on. A better way to imagine this is one of the scenes in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, where you see the Gunship swoop down and you see the clones sitting on the deck of the gunship with their legs hanging over the side, here is a reference image just incase you didn't get what I ment http://imgur.com/JyPje6I. As of when I made this post I cannot think of any way to combat the OPness of 4 guys shooting off of a tank, so any suggestions would be appreciated. Also annimations for entering and exiting vehicles for the pilot and gunners.

Thirdly I would like to see all of the vehicles, and I mean all of them, have their own look depending on the faction that owns them, I understand that this may have been said here befor and I apolagise of this is yet another post. But what I mean is that all of the vehicles get a certain look and make them belong to a faction rather than just using one model, Because one thing that really annoys me is being in an ESF with rocketpods and shooting at a friendly tank because he's using the giraffe camo and the dorito hasen't shown up. With these special models you can make out the vehicle at a distance without needing a dorito. This doesn't just apply to ground vehicles it also applys to air vehicles.

This isn't so much an idea more of a suggestion. There needs to be more to taking a base rather than just capping points and moving on, there needs to be variety in each base. Some (Poor) ideas that I have had for different types of base caps, this is fairly similar to the current capping system but with Tech Plants, you have to get to a central computer (Basically A point) and you have to download data to a data chip, and then you have to take it back to a different facility and download the information to the computer. Anyone can collect this data but if the person dies with the data chip, they drop it and someone else has to come and pick it up, either the attacking team who has to take it back to a different facility or the defending team who has to get it back to the computer. But to stop the data chip from sitting there untill the end of time, it has a countdown befor it dissapears, I like to think of it as the nanites eat the chip. This would not only expand battle to multiple facilitys, but also slow down battles and make you have to think and coordinate more.

Another idea I had that would take battles away from facilitys and into more open terrain, If engineers could us there little magical disk thing to create structure on the battlefield, this would expand battles and take battle into open, as aposed to confind in facilities. Some things that I thought would be good structures would be something like Mini-Phalanx turrets, like the ones in big facilitys, but slightly less powerful. Also some of the barricades from AMP stations (http://imgur.com/P65BFqS) that could be built but maybe a little bit smaller, Just enough to crouch behind. And some other things like pillboxes and bunkers that could probably fit 2 or 3 people inside of them. Oviously all of these things would have a certain amount of health so i's not like they can't be moved, Also all of the turrets would have a countdown timer befor the despawn, like an unoccupied vehicle.

**Addition 1:** When players reach a certain battlerank, or get a special medal like Auraxium, Give them something more that Certs, maybe like a free decal or camo, maybe a free week long boost depending on the difficulty level of obtaining said Service Ribon or Medal, or maybe even a Helmet from the depot? I think this would be an excelent reward for playing well.

These are just some trivial stuff that I have thought of in the year and a half of playing Planetside. Alot of these designs and ideas are unrefined and I know that if any of these ideas were to be added then it would take alot of tinkering and balancing changes but in the long run I think these additions would greatly improve the game.

And if any SOE guys are viewing this post please have a think about some of these ideas here, even if you don't like them, it's nice to see you guys active. 

Any further ideas or developments of my ideas is most welcome, I am very excited to hear your guys ideas and criticisms aswell.

,pokemon,"As the title says, I spent my down time over the last three days trading off Pokemon on wondertrade. I did this mainly because I find wondertrade fun and I had just finished off a week breeding four shinnies you can read up on that [here](http://imgur.com/a/xzjah). In the process of breeding up shinnies, I gathered up over 1600 spared Pokemon, all of which were 5-6 IVs with perfect natures.

Skip to today, and [I have the collected pictures of the mass of Pokemon obtained in wondertrade](http://imgur.com/a/5PgGs). The first five boxes worth got moved to my PokeBank to make room for the rest on my game file. I accidentally forgot to take pictures of one of the last two two boxes because I had taken the pictures of the other boxes before that point.... doesn't really matter because the box was total crap. So add a mental box of crap to you mind when you see everything. 

After taking pictures of the Pokemon, I then [compiled images of everything worth knowing](http://imgur.com/a/O5B8H). Of these pictures, I have the Shines, Vivillon Patterns of the scatterbugs, and the most common Pokemon received.


After doing all of this, I would like to point some things out.

* Route 2/Santalune Forest Pokemon are not the most common thing you'll get.
* Everyone give Froakies, and its mildly annoying... See end of post.
* Non Kalos Pokemon pop up every now and then.
* Every now and then, I got a pokemon with an item, or a trade evolution pokemon, I quite enjoyed these, every if it was a common mon/item
* Of the 18 Starters, I got all but Chespin, Turtwig, Oshawott, and Tepig I now claim these to be the most unloved starters. I have gotten these in the past on wondertrade though.
* I got A LOT of Pokemile from this. Over 47,000 in fact. IT was enough to bet me over 170 rare candies on PGL.
* Shinnies were way more common then legendaries. In this case 600% more common. My complete wonder trade history is 9 shinnies to 3 legendaries. Still a 300% difference.
* I got a few special Pokemon, I got a Shauna Fennikin, 2 Diantha Ralts, and a Gift Lapras.
* Toughing out a dry spell is worth it. The shinnies are pretty evenly spaced.
* The 5 most common Pokemon were Eevee, Froakie, Charmander, Fletchling, and Ralts
* Of the five most common pokemon, I only got 3 evolved forms of them, a Flechender, Kirlia, and Charmeleon
* I got a lot of hidden abilities like Speed Boost Venipede and Guts Luxio
* The highest level I got was a 68 Dragonite.
* I got at least two fake pokemon, a lvl 50 Scizor and lvl 1 Shiny Absol



Conclusion:

 I really hate Froakie now. Do I want to talk about it. No. No! Fine. Fine. Rant Time. Fuck Froakie and Everyone who wondertrades them. Congratulations, you got yourself a competitive Froakie or a Shiny Froakie. Oh , you have 60 left over ones? DONT FUCKING WONDERTRADE THEM!!!! Everyone fucking has one already. Froakies are more common on wondertrade than anything on route 2/Santalune forest, and that's what everyone is sick of getting. Dont get me started about all the ones that are Torrent rather than Protein. You want to help people breed their own froakies by wondertrading them? Then don't give them the useless one. SO STAHP, or I will find you and exorcise you Winchester style.


That rant aside, this experiment was fun. Its nice to see the variety that can be foud one wondertrade and this really motivates me to do a wonderlocke. I love my new shinnies and Everything else I got.



If you have ANY questions feel free to ask them, I'll be certain to answer them.  Leave feed back as to what I should do to the Froakies. Should I Delete them? Keep them? Or transfer them to my Y game and restart the game so that they can live the agonizing death of being wiped from existence as one group.

,SonicTheHedgehog,"Super and dark forms are originally the natural states of Mobians. However having such power created much chaos and if it wasn’t the fights that killed them it was the over whelming power rushing through their bodies. Gems and metals of the planets have special properties that can absorb the extra energy.

Finally it was decided that the creatures of Mobius channel their energy into these materials to help manage the power. Metals could only handle a small amount of the energy, emeralds and gems could hold much more. However the gems and emeralds would shatter if to much energy was placed in them, while the rings would just simply accept no more flow.

In the end there were more rings that were powered to some extent, but only a small bunch of stones didn’t shatter. The chaos emeralds are some of the remaining stones and the master emerald was simply a rare large emerald to began with.

After the power was stored in these things, future born generations were born with less power but still held the gene to channel it. This is why Sonic and friends need the materials to boost their powers and how some of them can spontaneously go into dark form without them. Although in the current generation, the genes for holding this added power has lost it’s ability to keep it and thus the reason one has to collect more rings in order to stay super and such, the energy rushes out of them.

Over a long span of time, all the rings and emeralds will loose all their power and become common stones and metals once more. However because the extra energy that flows out of the Mobians using the extra power gets absorbed back into the planet and thus the plant and animal life, the circle will repeat itself and the creatures will become over powered again after consuming the powered food recurses.

,Bravenewbies,"So this will be a long one, get your popcorn.

**THE FORMUP**

The fleet formed EARLY for a change. We formed up at 05:45 eve time with pings and the fleet going up on the dot. Fleet swelled to approximately 120 by 06:00. At this point we started going through our fleet composition. Dictors were an issue as we had 0 out of our 120 man fleet and were able to get some people to switch (Train dictors). Additionally at the begining of the fleet we requested scimitars (Train Logi V &lt;3) to continue prepping for eagles (Train Cal Cruiser V) and we got 3! . All Wing Command (Train Lvl 5) spots were filled along with squad positions as we actually had a boosting command ship. Combat probes were sorted, we actually had 3, Anna being the primary as he is pr0 at it, myself being terrible at it, and Sinnister being better than me as our backup. Anchors were set, Pontin, Anna, and DevineRapier were our anchors in order. Chaddtsr stepped up as our Logi anchor. We rolled out at 06:15 completing our 30min formup. (Please note all plugs for training, we dont expect you to have all of them, but we want to hammer home the fact you should be identifying one and training one sooner than later)


**The Fight**

We proceeded from v-3 to ex6 where we took the jump bridge to 4-07. From there we made our way to the target system of 6BPS-T. We entered the system and set dictors on each gate. Additionally we placed scouts in surrounding systems. We then dispatched a fast tackle br0 on the recommendation of anna toward the -a- staging system. As the minutes ticked away we held on the gate. With a minute before the POS exited reinforce mode we warped to the tower, landing with 10 seconds left. We targeted and started attacking the pos after 10seconds. Now just so people understand, we were shooting a BRAVE pos. The small amarr pos needed to be replaced to a Large tower as the small was not sufficient enough to properly hold the moon it was on. The time however to repair, then unanchor the pos vs the cost of just shooting it, made it much easier to kill and replace, then to do the aforementioned. Once we hit structure on the POS our scout going to stain reported back, 4 -a- in staging system. Blue balls ahoy.... until our scout in the adjacent system on comms called out 60 hostiles bridging into Y-PNRL next door.


Calls were made. Align to Y-P, Switch ammo to faction Thorium. While we aligned a rapid discussion occurred in the command channel. The FC Team concluded that we would stay on field and continue to hit the POS as it was our priority. We continued to align towards Y-P. As we drifted out of range we reanchored. Intel told us that -a- had came in ishtars. As -a- entered system we finished killing the tower. The remaining mods were unanchored and the new tower was dropped. Moments later, -a- landed on the field. As -a- landed they were at long range 70km approximately, outside of our effective range. We immediately warped off and realigned back getting a warpin via probes. We landed about 20km off the hostiles and were able to get a few down, but they were able to burn out of range. We also discovered quickly in addition to the ishtars there was a group of Muninns. We played the warp in warp out game several times, unfortunately we were having limited success. The ishtars and Muninns were able to move out of our engagement range before we were able to apply a significant amount of damage to them. Conversely -a- could continue to apply damage to us. We started shooting the sentries to try to remove the incoming dps. We warped off again and came back landing right on there logi. We got a few more and almost got the boosting claymore before it broke tackle and warped away. We began taking losses and we turned to align out. As we went to warp the logi got bubbled and the fleet warped off leaving the logi behind. We turned around on land and warped directly to the logi, but the damage had been done. We had lost a significant portion of our logi including the anchor. We warped off again, warped back ontop of the hostiles and traded blows but was very clear we couldn't hold anyone down. We warped to station in order to dock up and take a 5min break while reinforcements were gathered. Meanwhile, Anna had been blow'd up. He had gone back to V-3 in order to rage form tackle with scrams to attempt to get us better tackle. 

Once reinforcements arrived we undocked, warped to a ping, and the warped ontop of the hostiles. We got a few, but again, -a- was able to pull range and our tackle was dying fast. With our depleted logi and our inability to hold down the hostiles in our range, we moved to shut down for the night, however lumpy informed us that the tower was still unstronted... FUCK... in order to do this, we warped the fleet back onto the field and presented ourselves as a juicy target. Que circus music... we did this 3-4 times warping in as a distraction while Lumpy in a covert hauler sneakily stronted the tower right under their collective noses.  We believed we had stronted the tower to a perceived 36 hours of stront. Once the tower was onlined a few minutes later, we were horrified to discovered this was not the case. The stront amount put into the pos was based on controlling sov in system, however WE DONT OWN SOV, we rushed back to the station to get more stront however we were too late, the shields went below 50% making it impossible to add more stront.... so instead of coming our USTZ Prime, its now coming our in Early EU.... SO THAT MEANS 

**Get ready for round 2 tomorrow morning! Fleet will Form Up immediately after downtime!**

Hindsight

So during this whole operation there were a number of things the FC team and myself individually would love to improve on going forward and some things we did really well.

Good

Formup - 30mins for a strat op is about as good as it gets.

Arriving before timer - Fashionably late isn't always a good thing

DPS/Logi Ratio - We had a good number of logi in fleet!

Bad

Target Calling - I had far too many long pauses and delays between commands.

Tactical Pings - We used pings too far away and it hurt our warpins.

Overall Strategy - We changed our tactics 2-3 times, and I believe it hurt us, we should have continued taking out drones to nullify ishtars

,pcgaming,"[Game Informer - Written Impressions](http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2014/07/11/our-battleborn-hands-on-impressions.aspx)

MOBAs are a weird thing for me. I really enjoyed last year's Dota 2 International (TI3), but I could never get into actually playing the game. The difficulty curve is so high, because not only is it a difficult and complex game, but the basic gameplay mechanics aren't something I'm used to at all. I never play RTS games. I have played and greatly enjoyed various ARPGs like Torchlight, but even though the view is the same the controls and gameplay are still quite different. Shooters on the other hand, I'm actually pretty good at.

I'll list some hopes and preferences I have for the concept:

1. A good PC port, as you can feel it most in first person games. BL2 is a fantastic port, so anywhere close and I'll be happy. 120Hz Support and FOV slider preferred.
2. Not necessarily a more casual Moba experience, but one that has less priority on item/stat/build knowledge, and more on just pure aiming skill and general movement/flanking tactics. I'd honestly prefer no items or mechanical customization at all, leaving it all down to using the skills of the character, rather than items/consumables/actives. I'd prefer every person playing character x to have the exact same stats, weapons, skills, etc, although cosmetic customization is fine. Yes there's less depth, but the whole reason most people don't get into mobas is because they have to spend hundreds of hours learning all the stats on top of the skill needed to actually execute all of it. I'd like this to be something I and many others can enjoy and be decently good at without quitting all other games for months.
2. I'd definitely prefer a simple 1 time purchase game, but I have a feeling this is going to be F2P. If that is the case, I'd prefer no currency/exp boosts. I'd say keep it entirely cosmetic, but considering it's first person, I'm not sure how well that would work. I really don't want another multiplayer treadmill of nonsense. All of the characters should be unlock at all times for everyone, and as I said I think characters should have a set gun or pair of guns, rather than allowing all characters to use all guns, meaning the only difference between characters is the few skills they have. If it is F2P and has unlockable guns, it would become the case that players who played for a long time (or bought boosts) simply have better items than you, and there's honestly no place for that in a MOBA, which is supposed to be purely a test of skill between players.
3. A variety of modes, and maybe exclude a simple team deathmatch entirely. I want new ideas and concepts. I see tons of potential modes for something like this, I don't want a generic Deathmatch+CTF+Domination set of modes. Of course there will be the moba-like mode with lanes and minions, but there are plenty of other unique ides to explore as well, maybe even something that's asymmetrical that swaps sides at the midpoint.

In an interview, one of the devs claimed that there's the per-game leveling, and ""player growth"" with ""things you'll collect, unlock, and experience over time"". As I explained in #2, I really hope this isn't stuff that has an effect on gameplay.

And yes I know they don't want to call it a MOBA, but they do have a MOBA-like mode, and team based gameplay with a wide variety of characters and different modes in various environments, sounds a hell of a lot like what I would think of if someone said ""FPS Multiplayer Online Battle Arena""...

They also mentioned a co-op campaign mode, which kind of pulls it back into the realm of something that would be paid rather than F2P. Bethesda has BattleCry which is confirmed to be F2P, and has zero mention of any kind of campaign experience.",,False,,0,,Battleborn - How do you feel about a an FPS MOBA?,,,,,,0.0,,,False,t3_2ahxdk,False,,,,,9.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},,,9,,,,self,False,IntelNvidia,,,,,True,,1405156242.0,,,,,,self.pcgaming,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,i7-3770K@4.8Ghz/32GB/GTX670SLI/120GB SSD/WIN7,,,,,,t5_2qhfg,,,,,2ahxdk,,,MangoTangoFox,,21,,,,,,,/r/pcgaming/comments/2ahxdk/battleborn_how_do_you_feel_about_a_an_fps_moba/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/2ahxdk/battleborn_how_do_you_feel_about_a_an_fps_moba/,,1405152642.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441271843.0,,,

Key points to know on the map:

* POWERUPSSS (There's tons of them!)
* Regrabs
* Boosts!
* Box strats!

*The starters are a combination of total minutes played, and captain's ideas on who will start, so don't get mad at your captain if you aren't on here*

[**PLAYOFF BRACKET**](http://i.imgur.com/LynJjrT.png)

Now let's get into the road to the Nuper Ball.

***

**Drift's Shitty Team**

***

* Week 1: Down ludifisk, DST fell to Juking Under the Influence 5-4 and 4-3 in close matches. Said Ballymandias after the match: ""Our main problem was power up control.""

* Week 2: Even with all four starters locked and loaded, DST could not find a win against the Whitecaps. 5-3 and 6-2 they failed to get their first win of the season. At 0-4, things aren't looking great.

* Week 3: Against one of the top teams in the blue division, DST puts up a fight, but can't come away with a win. An 8-7 loss was followed by an 8-8 tie against Trippin Balls, earning the first point of the season. However, at 0-5-1, DST needs to start winning.

* Week 4: Finally, a win, and in the most convincing of forms. DST stomps on the Liberty Caps 14-3 and 14-4. DST is now 2-5-1, with a chance to keep the winning going.

* Week 5: Forget about wins, these are blowouts now! Against the Capri Suns, DST stomps on them, 13-1, and 12-6. Ballymandias says: ""Hopefully, we can continue to roll with the momentum we've gathered in this little groove we've settled into."" They are 4-5-1.

* Week 6: Continuing their winning ways, beating the capybaras 7-2 and 10-4. Raven's comment about the game: ""I honestly think DST is one of the top 3 teams in NLTP right now (at least). I'm glad we're not in your division! :)"" DST is now 6-5-1.

* Week 7: All they do is win! DST sweeps a tough match against RR3D, sneaking by 4-3 and 4-2 in the matches. Ballymandias says: ""Definitely wouldn't want to play RR3D again in the near future, but thanks for the games, Rangers!"" They have not lost since Week 3.

* Week 8: They sweated a little bit, but DST sweeps, again. Against the Saunuklear Bombs, 6-5 and 4-2 wins leave the league dumbfounded at the magic of DST. Trendygrub comments: ""DST is on a fucking roll. I do not want to play them."" 

* Week 9: Finish up against the Unbelivaballs, DST refuses to lose, once again. They are the victors, by the scores of 5-1, and 10-5. Their last loss was in week 3. They are ready to win in the playoffs.

* Knockout Round: Ballymandias practices his blocking. DST waits.

* Quarterfinals: DST rolls in game one, 11-5, but JUI shocks them with their first loss since week 3 in game two, 5-3. DST responds, and beats JUI 5-0 to win the overtime period, and the whole match. They advance to play RR3D (See week 7).

* Semifinals: Going up against RR3D, DST wins game one 6-1, and game two 7-3. They advance to the nuper ball. All their hard work has payed off. The dream is real.

***

**Nevermores**

***

* Week 1: The Nevermores opened up against whose flag, winning their games by the scores of 9-2 and 8-3. They cruised to an easy 2-0 record.

* Week 2: A game one win of 4-2 on star put the Nevermores to 3-0, but their opponents, the Soviet Ballers rallied to win game two 6-2, leaving the Nevermores with their first loss of the season, and a 3-1 record.

* Week 3: Still a walk in the park for the Nevermores. 8-6 and 5-2 they took down 21 Juke Street. At this point of the season, the two teams are polar opposites. The Nevermores have 15 points, DST has 1.

* Week 4: The wins keep piling up for the Nevermores. They go up against the Ball Busters, winning 8-4 and 7-6 in some close matches. They stand at 7-1, and the league takes note.

* Week 5: The Nevermores start off with a game one win of 6-5, but fall in game two to Tag Reflex, 10-7. After the game, Raven said: ""Both of those games were excellent. Definitely two extremely talented teams. We'll see y'all in the playoffs!"" The Nevermores are 8-2.

* Week 6: After a loss in week 5, the Nevermores are involved in a sweep, but this time, it's not by them. They fall to the Incrediballs 9-1 and 5-4, dropping their record to 8-4. That's three losses in a row for the Nevermores.

* Week 7: A very hard match against the Make Ballives results in a 3-1 game one win, and a 1-1 game two tie. The Nevermores are back to winning, and are now 9-4-1, as opposed to DST's 8-5-1.

* Week 8: With the last two weeks being ever so important, the Nevermores go up against ODB and split, losing game one 6-5, but rallying to win the second 3-2. Their 10-5-1 record rivals the exact same one of DST.

* Week 9: Against the jukeboxers, the Nevermores stomp, winning 7-0 and 9-1. They clinch the #1 seed, and a playoff bye. The Nevermores have their sights on the playoffs as well.

* Knockout Round: Juicy Juke drinks some juice. The Nevermores wait.

* Quarterfinals: The Nevermores charge out to a masterful defensive performance in game one, winning 5-0. They actually let in caps in game two, and lose 5-4 to the Incrediballs. Just like DST, they shut out the opposition in OT, winning 4-0, and moving on.

* Semifinals: Going up against the Soviet Ballers, the Nevermores have a tough task. They lose the first game 6-1, usually a death sentence in the playoffs. However, they rally to win game two 3-1, and take the overtime period 1-0 to advance to the nuper ball. Their dream is becoming a reality as well.

**Commentary:** *It's finally here. The moment that the whole season comes down to. The Nuper Ball. From the blue division, we have the mighty shitty team of drift. Their start to the season wasn't the best, but they battled through it, and look where they are now. They have the stats, they have the reputation, and they have the blocks. On defense, Ballymandias and IrisihBlizard will do their best to keep the flag in base as much as they can, so the talented jukers of ludifisk and prizm can cap it time and time again. With so many powerups, look for ludifisk to fly around the map, collecting as many as he can. Out of the red division comes the Nevermores, the team built on free agency. 3 out their 4 projected starters were picked up from free agency. They are underhanded, their stats suggest they shouldn't be in the nuper ball, even. These guys have proved everyone wrong all season, and they'll look to do it again, on the biggest of stages. The TagPro world will be watching. Will you?*

* Week 3: Still a walk in the park for the Nevermores. 8-6 and 5-2 they took down 21 Juke Street. At this point of the season, the two teams are polar opposites. The Nevermores have 15 points, DST has 1.

* Week 4: The wins keep piling up for the Nevermores. They go up against the Ball Busters, winning 8-4 and 7-6 in some close matches. They stand at 7-1, and the league takes note.

* Week 5: The Nevermores start off with a game one win of 6-5, but fall in game two to Tag Reflex, 10-7. After the game, Raven said: ""Both of those games were excellent. Definitely two extremely talented teams. We'll see y'all in the playoffs!"" The Nevermores are 8-2.

* Week 6: After a loss in week 5, the Nevermores are involved in a sweep, but this time, it's not by them. They fall to the Incrediballs 9-1 and 5-4, dropping their record to 8-4. That's three losses in a row for the Nevermores.

* Week 7: A very hard match against the Make Ballives results in a 3-1 game one win, and a 1-1 game two tie. The Nevermores are back to winning, and are now 9-4-1, as opposed to DST's 8-5-1.

* Week 8: With the last two weeks being ever so important, the Nevermores go up against ODB and split, losing game one 6-5, but rallying to win the second 3-2. Their 10-5-1 record rivals the exact same one of DST.

* Week 9: Against the jukeboxers, the Nevermores stomp, winning 7-0 and 9-1. They clinch the #1 seed, and a playoff bye. The Nevermores have their sights on the playoffs as well.

* Knockout Round: Juicy Juke drinks some juice. The Nevermores wait.

* Quarterfinals: The Nevermores charge out to a masterful defensive performance in game one, winning 5-0. They actually let in caps in game two, and lose 5-4 to the Incrediballs. Just like DST, they shut out the opposition in OT, winning 4-0, and moving on.

* Semifinals: Going up against the Soviet Ballers, the Nevermores have a tough task. They lose the first game 6-1, usually a death sentence in the playoffs. However, they rally to win game two 3-1, and take the overtime period 1-0 to advance to the nuper ball. Their dream is becoming a reality as well.

On defense, Ballymandias and IrisihBlizard will do their best to keep the flag in base as much as they can, so the talented jukers of ludifisk and prizm can cap it time and time again. With so many powerups, look for ludifisk to fly around the map, collecting as many as he can. Out of the red division comes the Nevermores, the team built on free agency. 3 out their 4 projected starters were picked up from free agency. They are underhanded, their stats suggest they shouldn't be in the nuper ball, even. These guys have proved everyone wrong all season, and they'll look to do it again, on the biggest of stages.

We’ve all had that conversation, be it among our families or friends: “What are your plans after school?” For some of us, that question is really simple, we can answer with confidence and a smile; others struggle, what am I going to do after school? Should I further my education? If so, how should I do that? What if I wanna specialize, would trade school help? Maybe I should take a year off to figure myself out. What if college just isn’t for me? 

Sometimes post secondary education isn’t for all of us, but we’re here to let you know that it isn’t the end of the world if that’s what your choice is! There’s a ton of options, all of which can be tailored to fit you and what plans you have for yourself. 

##State University
Post secondary, most of us think of a four year university, the kind we see in films. Though films tend to be inaccurate on how your peers will act (not all of them play quidditch or are in an acapella choir) they aren’t too far off on what you need to expect. Shortly after acceptance or you pledging to attend that college, they'll ask you to sign up for Freshman Orientation. Usually a three to five day camp, you’ll be split into groups and given the grand tour by upperclassmen; among what you’ll see can include a club fair, housing, department buildings and your best friend on campus..your academic advisor. Your advisor is practically your lifeline; they’ll tell you how your degree plan will work. Typically a degree plan consists of 120 credit hours; every semester it’s recommended that you take 15 hours to get done in those four years. Each course you sign up for is about 3 credit hours, with science being four because of a separate one hour lab. If you’ve taken AP, IB or college courses (and earned the credit for it) in secondary, you won’t have to take those classes! Additionally, living on campus in your first year is a requirement at most 4 year institutions. 

###Community College
If you can’t afford to go to a Big State University, you could always attend a community college. Now, contrary to popular belief, this isn’t a bad choice at all. Community colleges offer the same quality of education that universities do, just at a lower price and usually offer an associates degree, but that depends on your specific degree plan. Having a degree from a community college isn’t bad at all, in fact several big name people hold degrees from a community college; Tom Hanks, Calvin Klein, Arthur Goldberg and even Walt Disney were successful with this form of education!  Community colleges do hold a huge benefit: You can use them to boost your grades, especially if you didn’t shine through in high school! Attending for a year or two to save money is a common practice, just meet with your academic advisor to see which credits you take will transfer; you should do this before registering for classes!


####Trade School
What if you know exactly what you’d wanna do...but its not exactly something you could see yourself going to a university school for? What if it’s a specific skill? Then you should try a Trade school. Otherwise known as a vocational school, these institutions offer in depth classes and hands on experience training in traditional fields such as blacksmiths work, painting, ironworks and carpentry. Traditional stuff not your taste? Trade schools for modern fields exist as well, despite only being introduced in the 20th century. You can now get educated in cosmetics, retail, tourism, culinary arts and even pharmaceuticals.  Though some of these trades exists all through the world, trade schools vary from country to country. Application processes are different as are the degree plans. Contact your local trade school for more information!

##Gap Year
Now, let’s say that your final year turns into a draining fight with the education. You manage to scrape through midterms and finals, but come graduation day, you’ve been sucked dry of every amount of spirit you had. Try a Gap Year! There’s nothing wrong with taking a year to recover and collect yourself. That burnt out feeling is something everyone feels, some more strongly than others. Before you make this choice and move to run with it, talk to your parents, a school counselor or a trusted adult. If they have experience, who knows if they do, they can definitely help you. This is perfect if you haven’t decided your major, it saves you money and from dragging yourself down further through full-price classes. If you go through with this idea, you need a plan, so try: http://www.theleap.co.uk/, www.interimprograms.com, www.timeoutassociates.com, www.dynamy.org or www.uncollege.org; all of these websites specialize in planning for a gap year. The most important thing is to keep yourself busy, its easy to lose yourself in relaxation! The advisors on these sites will help you create a schedule to keep your brain in tip-top condition through activities, volunteering and low priced optional courses, on real skills you need! 


####Other Alternatives
Finally, college or post-secondary education may just not be for you. Is that okay? Yes, it absolutely is! Some people assume financial reasons may cause you to pick that route, but don’t let the scorn deter you: There are many people who can be and are successful without a diploma. Your options here are really unlimited, you can get a job, start up a small business or firm, or possibly enlist in the armed services. If you choose to do the latter, contact your local representative for information on the application process. 

If you want some imagery, think of this: Your college options are like a BIG crayon box and your life is the paper you’ll draw on. Even if its not the simplest, neatest and most beautiful thing you’ve ever seen; its personal and its yours. It deserves to be picked and feature everything you want in your future post secondary!

---

**Q: As I understand, even for aircraft where propeller pitch was set manually by the pilot we have some kind of constant-speed unit in the game, it also triggers instantly and not with any delay, as in real life, is this correct?**  
A: Yes, that is correct. At the moment it triggers fast, but it doesn’t happen like this for all the aircraft. More so, when you see a very fast stabilization of the rotation - create a bug report about it.

**Q: Mixture control is only available for decreasing after you have achieved a specific height and also not all aircraft have it either, right?**  
A: The mixture depends on type of installed carburetor and if it works differently for different planes. There is a bug currently where in reality automatic control is enabled, but it states that manual control is available, this is incorrect. It mostly affects American aircraft at the moment, we are working on this right now. As soon as we complete them - the bug will be fixed.

**Q: The influence of the radiator flap opening on cooling and aircraft speed is not properly defined. Right now, its easier to fly with a closed radiator and to just turn off the engine for some time at critical moments. Are there any plans to improve this?**  
A: Thermodynamics is a painful problem, yes. We are not denying it. At the moment we are working on an absolutely new thermodynamics calculation system. Radiator flaps do influence flight speed greatly, but for different aircrafts it is different, since size and shape of flaps are different for most aircraft.

**Q: When will we get a turbo compressor on the Thunderbolt and the G-1 system on the Ta-152 H1?**  
A: Turbo compressor is already present, players don’t have control of it right now. In one of the closer patches (most likely the next major one) we will give you the opportunity to fully control the compressor turbine, also the tachometer will be enabled in the cockpit and you will be able to damage it easily by incorrect usage.

**Q: I was testing the G-10 and it showed 1315 hp on the ground and 1650 with WEP, 1115 hp at 6800m and 1430 hp at 6000m with WEP. All of this is not what is on its data sheet, even though boost and RPM are correct. At 7500m I couldn’t make 688 km/h - only up to 648, though the radiators were open. If a closed radiator adds +40km/h - then I am sorry.**  
A: Yes, opening radiators (Messerschmitt use them everywhere where its possible) eats a lot of speed. To understand that you may check this document about breakdowns of engine losses:
Supercharging the Allison A Presentation to the Aircraft Engine Historical Society July 17, 2009 Indianapolis, Indiana By Daniel D. Whitney, P.E.
There are lots of potential engine power losses and sometimes engine power is noted without counting some of these losses.

**Q: Will we be able to change the center of mass on our planes in the future?**  
A: It only makes sense to do something like this for bombers where there was the possibility to install a heavy bomb incorrectly, this would influence the aircraft’s center of mass. It is impossible to do so on fighters. We attach bombs the correct way, so why would you need to install them manually and change the operations procedure in this way?

**Q: From what sources do you take the overheat information for the engines of different aircraft? Why do the same engines on different aircrafts overheat differently on the same flight modes (same throttle, radiator position, propeller pitch)?**  
A: Thrust rating is taken from a Flight Crew Operation Manual (FCOM) and they usually are very detailed in these documents. And yes, different aircraft with the same engine will have it differently because of difference in cooling system constructions or layout.

**Q: What sources are you using when you  set up rudder compression for high speeds? If none exist, what values are you using and what calculations do you accept? Don’t you think that your calculations may be way off from the real plane performance?**  
A: There are several researches about rudder compression and heaviness on the control elements. They were made by NASA, Air Force Research Institute, Central Institute of Aerohydrodynamics. Sometimes you can get information directly from the construction bureaus or the companies that produce the aircraft. All in all the situation is simple, for most aircraft (i mean types and model line-ups) we have all the data for rudder compression and control elements heaviness. And we just use that data.  

**Q: When will compression be in effect for all aircraft in the game? At the moment, Spitfires for example seem to be unaffected by it.**  
A: It will be in one or another way on every plane after they have been tuned, Spitfires are not tuned fully at the moment. But you also need to remember that their pilots didn’t feel compression too much. There were other issues with them.

**Q: What about air-driven landing flaps which were on some of the planes? These should fold up when you overspeed. Flaps shouldn’t be torn out this way.**  
A: Yes, we are planning to implement it, but we don’t have any ETA on it at the moment. There were three locations for these flaps. Up, down and neutral. Neutral is the one that would cause them to fold up from air pressure. But after take off they needed to be fixed in place, otherwise they would release on slow speed unequally by themselves which could lead to a crash.

**Q: Do flettners work for all the aircraft?**  
A: No, they are not present on all, mainly they are not on aircraft that are still awaiting their tuning.

**Q: I understand that precise adjustment of preliminary tuned aircraft is needed, but when are you planning to tune planes that have completely broken models? Let say B-17.**  
A: B-17’s right now are currently being tested and as soon as it is complete and its parameters are as they should be based on the Flight Crew Operation Manual - we will bring it to live. This aircraft is in final stage already.

**Q: Tell us more about the Instructor situation. We understand that a flight model is made in SB mode and then what? Are you also setting up Instructor effect for the specific aircraft too? Maybe someone else does it? Or is the Instructor able to fly any plane without you setting up anything additionally?
There are many speculations about it on the forums. Many think that you specifically change the FM so the instructor will be able to fly the plane and that is the main reason why people want you to make SB and RB have differently  set up FM’s.**      
A: No one sets up Instructor for the specific aircraft, it can fly on any. It is made so it chooses the safest way to control the plane, so sometimes it will play safe and will choose not the optimal one. It’s like this. When on certain aircraft the Instructor starts to have difficulties, then changes are made in its program. Not for a certain plane, but for certain conditions - for example, when plane’s fin is rotated too much. Overall it is a pretty complex system, though we haven’t done any big changes to it for a while now. Quite often it helps to find errors in certain plane setups. Trust us, we are careful with it.

**Q: “Mach tuck” is a known effect on the aircraft with straight wings, this happens on speeds close to 700-800km/h (IAS). Examples are the Soviet Bi-1 (crashed while trying to reach 800km/h) and the German Me-262 (speed limit of 850km/h). Are you planning to implement it?**  
A: We have done most of the work on the implementation of changes with different Mach numbers. Right now we are testing all the effects resulting from it.

**Q: Will you support and improve the browser map?**  
A: We will be supporting a browser map, of course, and, most likely, will modify it too. How exactly we will modify it is an open question. It is possible that there will be something like this on tablets as well. I mean we will be moving to that direction.

**Q: Are you planning on creating a full open API, which will allow to get different values, like speed, type of the plane, etc? Right now its only possible to get it from localhost port, but data comes with delay which create some desynchronization from real game speed and data collected. If we will have API like that enthusiasts can create support for different devices even now!**    
A: Enthusiasts are doing fine even without API for now. Yes, there is desynchronization, but for FM work we are planning completely different tool (no ETA), which will bring more usefulness in our opinion. That doesn’t exclude chance of API creation, though.

**Q: Will you be making more detailed physics of the landing process? Right now a plane interacts with the ground at the most basic levels.**  
A: Yes. We will improve it, of course.

,summonerschool,"Some of the most successful competitive titles in the past decade have used multiple tiers of mechanics, or different strata of entry cost. This is essentially a low skill-floor, high skill-cap design tool that enables players to pick up a game quickly, but still provide skill differentiation at higher levels.

&amp;nbsp;

For example, Crash Team Racing for the original Playstation used a slide-boosting system. By skidding your vehicle with one shoulder button and correctly timing the opposite shoulder button, the player would net a small speed boost. Incorrectly using the technique would slow your cart down more than if you hadn't tried at all, or cause your cart to spin out of control.

Slide boosting isn't a requirement for beginners the same way using items and braking are, but a player that can will have a monumental advantage over players that can't.

&amp;nbsp;

 Sometimes, players discover mechanics outside of the developer's intentions. This is a subset of emergent gameplay called glitch-based strategies, where players manipulate quirks of the physics engines in a way that edges out the intended mechanics.

For example, Super Smash Brothers Melee players discovered a technique to abuse the physics engine and allow players to use controlled slides to move faster on the ground. This technique, and some of the more advanced variations that come from it, is called Wave Dashing.

More than just character control, a character can use ground attacks, such as smashes and standing grabs, as well standing defensive maneuvers like shielding and sidestepping while wavedashing. Characters forfeit these actions while normal dashing.

The tool has become ubiquitous in competitive Smash play, and characters- which have different dash distances- are partially chosen for their innate Wave Dash talent.

&amp;nbsp;

Similarly, players of the online shooter GunZ discovered a mechanic to cancel animation frames by entering a string of commands quickly. Popularized by Korean players, the technique, which included a number of named moves of increasing complexity, was called K-style.

In normal usage, the game balanced higher damage weapons like shotguns and sniper rifles by giving them long delays between individual shots. By switching to a second high-delay weapon, though, you could immediately fire another shot, then switch back to the first weapon and immediately fire again.

As long as the partially cancelled weapon swap animation was faster than the fire delay between shots, the player could abuse this mechanic to disrupt the intended balance of the game.

There were also techniques to change direction rapidly, to slash and block during the animation of a regular block, or to continuously dash up and along walls. A common, repeatable string involved jumping, double-tapping a directional key to dash, attacking with your sword, switching to a firearm, switching back to your sword, then dashing back, or Spacebar- W - W - left click - item slot 2 - left click - item slot 1 - W - W in under a second.

&amp;nbsp;

In League, collecting resources by minion last hits is a designed, optional mechanic. The game itself doesn't punish you for having an imperfect creep score, and a majority of the active community will never come close in a regular game, but players that can reach close to 100% will have a substantial advantage over those that can't.

Froggen even made a dominant strategy out of optimizing resource collection in Season Two. Combined items are almost always more gold efficient than their requisite components- so he'd try to reach an item threshold first, then leverage that power into an objective or a won teamfight.

Past that, though, there are several emergent glitch mechanics that players have discovered. The character Alistar has two high-value crowd control abilities- Q, an area of effect knock-up, and W, which sends him 650 units towards a targeted enemy and knocks the enemy back a further 650 units. The player with quick enough fingers can use the dash portion of his W as a gap closer and cancel the knock-back portion by hitting Q at exactly the right time. Too soon, and the player stamps the ground in place; too late, and the target is knocked back to safety.

Alistar offers plenty of unique displacement, but he has no ability to initiate from range without using this combination or mimicing its effects with Flash. So the balance team is forced to choose between-

* balancing around the combo, making Alistar a weaker pick for players unable to perform it
* removing the mechanic, nullifying the time players spent learning the combo
* balancing around his base kit, leaving him unbalanced for high-level play.

Since the second would cause fan outrage, and the third would distort the competitive scene that's so crucial to League's growth, they've decided so far on option one.

&amp;nbsp;

And similar to GunZ, certain character animations can be canceled in League. Most ranged attack damage carries (ADCs) stand still after each fired projectile while a brief animation is played. By quickly giving your character a movement command, you can cancel this animation and instead move in that time. Repositioning your very frail, high-damage carry during a fight, or moving alongside an escaping target, can be wildly important to the outcome of a game.

There's also input buffering, when a conditional ability is cast preemptively. For example, the support champion Soraka's E ability is a targeted, 725-range silence. If you cast it on an enemy outside that range, Soraka automatically starts walking towards the enemy, then autocasts when she's in range.

If you cast E, then interrupt her approach with a movement command and repeat, you can prime a silence to cast immediately on the enemy when he gets close enough. So if you input buffer Soraka's silence on an Alistar that tries to W-Q combo, you'll silence Alistar midflight. By using the quirks of League's physics engine, you get a result beyond what normal human reflexes could achieve.

&amp;nbsp;

Since the summoner spell Flash teleports your character immediately, it can be inserted between individual frames of an ability animation.  It also disrupts the usual resolution of the input order, allowing the player to seemingly bend the mechanics of their champions abilities.

 If a player is hit with a 2.5 second stun, presses Flash 0.5 seconds into the stun, then is silenced right before the stun ends, the player will Flash away after the stun ends while silenced. It's a glitch in the way League resolves abilities that can be abused by the player.

A few characters have abilities that apply damage on hitbox collision, like Gragas, Fizz, or Shen. For example, Gragas' E dashes forward 600 units and damages that unit on contact. However, if you use the summoner spell Flash in the middle of the animation, [you can teleport Gragas to a new location and damage the first unit he contacts there.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_3uJtgPg0)

Likewise, as a normal ability, the character Lee Sin can kick an enemy directly away from him. However, if a player starts the kick animation, then uses Flash to reposition behind the enemy before the animation finishes, [the enemy will fly away from Lee Sin's new position](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d-s1ANvAJM).

&amp;nbsp;

Some characters also have animations associated with ability effects that can be played concurrently. For example, Caitlyn channels her Q ability for half a second before firing. If you use her E ability, which fires its own projectile, dashes Caitlyn the opposite direction, and has its own animation, and then her Q, you essentially play both animations concurrently.

Different champions are susceptible to animation canceling to different degrees, and players will practice these combinations in preparation for competitive play.

For some, it's a necessity- Riven relies heavily on ability casts for damage, defense and mobility. If she uses a suboptimal pattern, she both lowers her damage and leaves herself vulnerable to counter-attack.

Other times, it just adds finesse- practicing your muscle memory until you find the rare occasion when it makes a difference.

&amp;nbsp;

So what's the point?

These glitch mechanics often distort the intended balance patterns of their games in a way that intended, optional mechanics do not. It edges out suboptimal content and suddenly the game becomes narrower, less forgiving. 

From the perspective of the designer, this is mortifying. When everything is min-maxed, what happens to content in the middle, made with the same care and intent? 

However, I think the final result is this- glitch mechanics fill the same role as designed optional mechanics, but only for the furthest outliers of competitive play.

BROOKLYN DAILY EAGLE

SUNDAY NOVEMBER 5, 1911.

PASTOR RUSSELL A CLEVER FINANCIER

Duped Prominent Pittsburg Clergymen Into Supporting Cemetery Scheme.

HIS ""DUMMY"" TRANSACTIONS.

Ministers Didn't Know They Were ""Boosting"" Deal of Man They Opposed.

(Special to The Eagle)

Pittsburg, November 4 - That ""Pastor"" Russell succeeded in getting the four leading clergymen of Pittsburg, including the Episcopal bishop of this diocese and the Rev. S. Edward Young, now pastor of the Bedford Presbyterian Church of Brooklyn, to lend their names and influence to further the financial prosperity of a cemetery which he controls, is shown by some hitherto unpublished records on file in this city.

The story of this cemetery deal involves a variety of dummy transactions that would do credit to a Wall Street banking expert.

So cleverly did Russell manipulate the deal that the Rev. Cortland Whitehead the venerable Episcopal bishop of this diocese; the late Rev. Dr. B. F. Woodburn, for forty years a lender of the Baptist clergy here; the Rev. S. Edward Young, the leading clergyman of the Presbyterian Church, and the Rev. J. W. Witherspoon, the leading minister of the United Presbyterian Church, which is probably the most powerful church organizatlon of this city, all of whom were bitterly opposed to Russell's teaching and methods, accepted the position of trustees on the Russell cemetery board before they found out that they had been duped.

The ""Pastor"" Sees a Good Chance for a Cemetery.

""Pastor"" Russell, who has always been counted as a good judge of Pittsburg real estate, a few years ago discovered a plot of ground lying along the old Ruysville road, which is a continuation of Federal street just beyond the city limits, that appealed to him as admirably adapted for cemetery purposes. He figured that there was a good opening for a cemetery in Pittsburg and was looking for a suitable plot of ground to get one started.

The property was purchased for $27,000 by Brother W. E. Van Ambergh [SIC], who was a railroad man in the South before he became a Russell Pilgrim and assumed the important duties of treasurer of the Peoples Pulpit Association, which is one of the big Russell corporations. Van Ambergh is now one of the big financial men in the Brooklyn headquarters.

Van Ambergh was pretty well known in Pittsburg as a Russell satellite, so it was not deemed advisable for him to hold title to the property. Morever, Van Ambergh is one of those who are supposed to be serving the ""Cause"" for $10 a month and expenses, and it might have occasioned surprise to find him the possessor of a $27,000 piece of property. At any rate Van Ambergh, very shortly after acquiring the property, sold it for $30,000 to the United States Investment Company.

Courts Declared Transfers of Russell to Be Frauds.

This Investment company is a dummy corporation to which ""Pastor"" Russell transferred a lot of oil stocks, mining stocks and other property at about the time his wife was trying to collect the alimony awarded to her by the courts. Some of transfers which ""Pastor"" Russell made at this time, were made, the courts declared, ""in fraud upon his wife."" Although it at one time held property worth more than $50,000. this company is capitalized for only $1,000. Of this total ""Pastor"" Russell holds $990. Brother Bohnet, of Miracle Wheat fame, holds $5 and Brother Ernest C. Henninges (who married Rose Ball and departed with her for Australia shortly before Mrs. Russell's suit for separation came to trial, owns the remaining $5.

It is from the United States Investment Company that the Rosemount, Mount Hope end Evergreen United Cemeteries bought the land, which thus lost all direct association with ""Pastor"" Russell's name. Through some of his friends and followers ""Pastor"" Russell had persuaded the four eminent Pittsburg divines to lend their names to the cemetery project. In some way not clearly explained this cemetery was supposed to benefit poor people. On April 18, 1905, the Rosemount, Mount Hope and Evergreen United Cemeteries was incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania by the following: John G. F. Kuehn, John G. Messner, J. H. Giesey, C J. Woodworth and J. Adam Bohnet, all Russellites. The original board of trustees included John G. F. Kuehn, John G. Messner, J. H Giesey, C. J. Woodworth. C. T. Russell, W. W. Giffen, H. A. Guepner, William M. Wright, Francis Winton and the four Pittsburg clergymen to whom reference has been made - Bishop Cortland Whitehead, the Rev. S. Edward Young, Dr. B. F. Woodburn and the Rev. J. W. Witherspoon.

So far as can be learned, the four reverend men did not attend any of the meetings of the board of trustees, which were held at the Russell headquarters, in the Bible House, on Arch street, Alleghany. If they had, they might have learned that, by virtue of a secret agreement, duly filed in the proper recording office in Pittsburg, although its text is known only to the real insiders, the United States Investment Company retains an important measure of control over the property it sold to the Cemeteries Corporation. The agreement carefully prescribes what the Cemeteries Corporation may do with the property, and forbids its sale without the consent or the United States Investment Company.

''Treasurer and President"" Was Only a Figurehead.

J. G. Messner, an insurance agent, with an office at 324 Fourth avenue, who was president of the board of trustees, says that he himself knew precious little about the business.

""Russell told me to act as treasurer and president of the board of trustees,"" he said to an Eagle representative who questioned him about his connection with the cemetery deal.

The business was all done somewhere else. Then one day Russell telephoned to me: 'Messner,' he said. 'I know you're a busy man. I've got a girl in the office here who can handle the money for the Cemeteries. Just send me a check for what money you have on hand, and I'll take care of the business from now on.' I sent him a check for several hundred dollars, which, for some reason, he kept on hand and didn't cash. I only learned of this later, when I got notice that the bank in which the money was deposited had failed.""

Messner was asked what had become of the property.

""I believe it is being run by some of Russell's local representatives."" he answered. ""I understand they are selling a good many lots and doing quite a business. It has a beautiful location and probably was a good investment.""

It was this cemetery deal which helped to open Messner s eyes to Russell's operations, and he severed his connection with the Russellites soon after it was put through.

Pastor Had No Idea Russell Was Connected With Scheme.

The Rev. S. Edward Young, pastor of the Bedford Presbyterian Church of this city, when shown the above dispatch at his home at 1035 Prospect place, wrote out the following statement:

""I recall that several years ago - probably seven or eight years - I was asked to serve as trustee of a new cemetery which had some such name as the Rosemount, Mount Hope and Evergreen United Cemeteries; that Bishop Whitehead of the Protestant Episcopal Church diocese of Pittsburgh, Dr Woodburn, pastor of the First Baptist Church, Alleghany, and other ministers and laymen well-known to me, were to be fellow trustees.

""Upon being persuaded in my own mind that the enterprise was hardly the sort of one I had been assured it would be, I served notice that my name should be dropped from the list of trustees. I never attended a meeting of the trustees or any meeting with anybody in connection with the matter, and really do not know what became of the enterprise, whether it took actual form and became operative or not. I put no money in it, had no stock in it, no promise of stock or other interest. The Eagle's dispatch is the first intimation I have had of Pastor Russell's relation to the properties.""",,False,,0,,Amazing Newspaper article about C. T. Russell uncover!

,mariokart,"Hey again. I have more thoughts and feelings to share about this wonderful, woeful game. You are about to read. Get ready!

**/ *RECAP* /**

If you missed my first post, check it out [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/296552/what_i_learned_in_mk8_online_is_a_lot/). These early sections will address some topics brought up by the /r/mariokart community. To all you attractive racers and critics alike, you have my applause. And if I repeat myself, you have my apologies.

**/** *VR PAIRING* **/**

We've seen how wonky the system can be at times. Some races are completely divided while others are unfairly one-sided. Why can't I just race with other people like me? Well, the problem roots in the pool of available players, not just the matching algorithm.

When the game was new, dedicated and competitive racers earned VR very quickly. This created an early gap between players and heightened the skill ceiling dramatically. It was the same phenomena that happens in every online game. But without many racers between casual and hardcore, the divide felt even greater.

This led to a lot of complaints from the middle brackets. You either raced against seasoned experts or reckless newbies, and the tone of the game suffered as a result. At this point in MK8's lifespan, you will race tryhards the higher you climb. But with time and the gratuitous point system, more people will reach the upper brackets who aren't. Rooms will feel more balanced as everyone progresses upward to widen the matchmaking pool.

Since writing my first post a few weeks ago, I've joined more balanced VR groups than before. As long as more people play online, this will only improve.

**/** *FIRE HOPPING* **/**

Fire hopping is debated in the same vain as snaking. It's easy to oppose those who do or don't, but item balance plays a much bigger role than most arguments (technique vs. exploit) give credit for. Allow me to explain.

Effective comebacks are difficult in MK8 when item selection prioritizes distance over position. Near last place on the first lap? Here's a banana, on the house. In MKWii, you'd pick up a Bullet Bill almost every time.
MKWii kept the pack close together through items, making Bullet Bill victories possible. In MK8, they'll only appear if the guy in 1st is half a lap ahead of the pack, and by then it's too late. Without reliable items to bring you to the leader, the difference between skill level is more pronounced and the pack splits. And fire hopping can thin out racers even more. Here is where the controversy lies. *Ahem.*

* MK8's item balance isn't designed to combat the extra distance that can be gained by fire hopping.

In a game where distance determines items, this point is crucial. MK8 doesn't offer many solutions to a distant leader. Even triple reds might not be enough. Does the leader deserve the win, then? No idea. I won't argue about Mario Kart ethics because that would be stupid and misses the point.

Fire hopping doesn't guarantee a win, nor a place in the 9000+VR bracket. In most cases, the difference made by fire hopping is minor. It is only problematic when items do not accommodate racers who are behind because of this design flaw. Frantic mode fixes this to a degree, but the *chance* to win from any place is what makes the Mario Kart series special. This does not mean entitled to win. Big difference, bub.

**/ *WEIGHT CLASSES* /**

In my first post, I ignored characters to compare kart setups I've used online and off. Now I'll discuss strategy for each weight class I found to be effective. Let's assume each class is using the standard set, knowing that strategies can change based on different part combinations and subclasses. Warning: you will lose friends if you win with 1 speed. I'm not sorry.

**/** *LIGHT* **/**

You are the slowest class in the game. Admit it. On courses with long stretches, you are at a disadvantage. Not only will heavier characters pass you, they'll knock your frail body into the next dimension. What do you do?

You weave. With the fastest acceleration and best handling available, you won't suffer any speed penalty for driving around other racers to avoid collisions and items. You'd be surprised how easy it is with small characters to weasel your way through the pack. Lemmy is hard to notice when there are 3 Rosalinas on Jet Bikes to keep tabs on. Just stay away from the outside near other racers and collect coins as soon as possible. Don't be an easy target to push into the off-road.

Lightweights also have great traction. Combined with their small frame, you can make *very* tight turns that might be dangerous for heavies on courses like Dry Dry Desert. Use turns to your advantage since speed alone won't cut it, but the high mini-turbo stat will.

This class is pitied for their weak base stats compared to the other two. But if you like the characters, fuck it. They *are* viable in the hands of a good racer; just don't try to 3-star 150cc Grand Prix with them.

**/** *MEDIUM* **/**

Everyone loves you. Most of the iconic Mario characters are in this class for a reason. They don't have any particular strengths or weaknesses which makes them attractive and easy to play. Arguably, they are the most flexible class in terms of strategy:

* They have good handling to avoid heavies and take sharp turns well.

* Weigh enough to knock around lightweights.

* Can keep distance from heavies until the next item block while passing lightweights.

* Their traction is comfortable on every course.

These perks give medium weights the freedom to change tactics on the spot. But in most cases, you won't need to. Lightweights must avoid heavies and heavies the off-road, but medium characters can ignore most bad situations. Drive well and use items as needed, really. That's it.

**/** *HEAVY* **/**

In previous Mario Karts, your acceleration was so low that the risk of getting hit far outweighed your ridiculous top speed. But in MK8, everything changed. Regardless of the few ways to recover quickly, your low acceleration is still pretty good by itself (thanks to acceleration tiers and diminishing returns.) It's almost as if there wasn't a tradeoff for the highest speed stat in the game. *Striking.*

Of course there was, and that sacrifice is in handling, traction, and mini-boost. But if you mastered drifting , this isn't much of a hindrance. There are only 5 courses you need to worry about:

* Mount Wario

* Bone-Dry Dunes

* Sherbet Land

* Dry Dry Desert

* Donut Plains 3

These courses feature slippery 'off-road' sections that can punish poor traction. Drifting too late can slide you into off-road or let nearby lightweights overtake you. And with low handling, hopping is the only way to correct yourself penalty-free.

Your goal as a heavy is to lead the pack by muscling through with your weight advantage. Knocking other players at the start might keep them in the pack long enough for you to get away. But as soon as you fall behind, avoiding items and recovering from them is troublesome. This is true for any class, but the heavies' large hitbox makes them especially vulnerable. Green shells and Toad's Turnpike traffic will love you.

**/ *STAT RANKING* /**

If you are looking for an objective hierarchy, it's not here. While speed is the most important stat in a racing game, some people might attribute higher acceleration to their wins more than flat-out speed. As such, stat ranking comes down to personal preference or the strategies mentioned above. I can already tell you that traction means little to me unless I'm setting a WR in Time Trials. Which I haven't.

I'll list a ranking for each weight class I feel suits them best at their most basic level. Keep in mind these are entirely debatable. They do not include subclasses nor reflect part combinations whatsoever. 

**/** *LIGHT* **/**

* Acceleration = Handling &gt; Speed &gt; Traction &gt; Weight

Lightweights cannot depend on speed to win a race. But fast acceleration and superb handling will allow them to recover quickly, correct their lines, and avoid hazards.

**/** *MEDIUM* **/**

* Speed = Acceleration &gt; Handling = Weight &gt; Traction

Medium characters are fairly even. A good balance between speed and acceleration lets them move quickly, but are harder to knock around than lightweights.

**/** *HEAVY* **/**

* Speed &gt; Weight &gt; Handling = Acceleration &gt; Traction

,DnD,"[Previous](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/28rvv5/bbegtobe_meet_the_psionic_shotgun/)

After last week’s tomb raiding, we were ready to resume our investigations in the city. A simple Gather Information check revealed that this Zaxus fellow was a regular at a local tavern, appearing there every Saturday. Unfortunately, it happened to be Wednesday at the time (both in-game and IRL), so we had some time to kill. The Cleric took that a bit too literally, suggesting that we find some small creatures to grind for XP and loot. As the Neutral Good party member, I couldn’t help but object, and I instead brought up the job I’d been offered at the art gallery some two sessions ago. That job happened to be guard duty, since they’d been dealing with a rash of break-ins recently. Between me and the Beguiler, we managed to win the Cleric over to accept the offer. Besides, it was paying fairly well for just standing around for a few hours.

The first two nights were quite uneventful, but the mystery thief finally showed up on Friday night. As we heard the window shatter, we got into our hiding positions. The Beguiler was lurking in the general shadows of the room, the Cleric was hiding behind a massive sculpture of the local church of Pelor, and I was standing atop a podium, trying my hardest to be a sculpture myself. Unfortunately, it’s been a few days between when we played and when I’m writing this, so I’m afraid I don’t have a clear enough memory for the round-by-round breakdown of the action like I did in the other episodes. The Beguiler cast Power Word: Pain at some point and the Cleric wound up throwing a flask of Black Sand as a splash weapon. As for myself, I first tried creating an Astral Construct to grapple the intruder, in the hopes of bringing him in alive to the authorities. When he eluded the construct’s grapple attempt and then disintigrated it, my priorities changed. I drew forth seven poisoned spikes from my bag, and proceeded to hurl them at this foe. Only one managed to hit him, and another hit the sculpture due to a Nat 1 die roll, but one was all it took since he failed all three fort saves against the poisons on the spike.

After the Thief fell, we surveyed the mess we’d created. There was Black Sand and bloodstains on the floor, and I’d managed to take out an exquisitely carved flying buttress with my poorly-aimed spike throw. Psionic Fabricate and maxed-out ranks in Craft (sculpting) managed to fix the damage, and we were paid something like 20 gold apiece, before the deduction for hiring cleaners to get rid of the blood all over the floor. At this point, it was Saturday morning, so we decided to head down to the tavern to find Zaxus.

After a few hours of lurking in the tavern, our mark finally showed up. A silver-bearded dwarf in full plate walked in, followed by two heavily armed and armored guards. He seemed friendly enough, chatting up the bartender and other patrons. He appeared to be an amiable cleric of Pelor in every way, except for the guards he kept close by. The Beguiler decided that he’d try to get some information from Zaxus, by means of disguising himself. He quickly ducked “into the loo,” as he described it, changing his form to resemble an elf and throwing on a set of the robes that we’d looted from the Necromancer’s lair. Zaxus took him for a contact who was supposed to meet him at the tavern, and confided with him that a shipment of pine boxes and diamond dust was to be delivered to the back door of the local church of Pelor. Pine boxes which happened to be about six feet long and weigh 200 pounds, as it turned out. As Zaxus got up to leave the tavern, he wispered a farewell to the Beguiler, “Hail Hextor” (or something like that; it’s been a few days).

We returned to the Mages’ College, sharing our findings with the Wizard, who was at the time studying dragon anatomy. Apparently there had been a flyover of the city the night before, and whatever it was, it was big. As for the matter at hand, she was just as troubled as she was by the dragon sighting. Large numbers of full coffins, along with enough diamond dust to raise hundreds, if not thousands, of corpses make for worrisome tidings. Coupled with the mention of Hextor, god of tyranny, it seemed as though our friend Zaxus was not the kindly cleric of Pelor he appeared to be. The Wizard suggested that we sneak in to the church that night and see what he was up to in there. Knowing that we were likely to need some form of backup, she brought us a bit of firepower: a tiefling Warlock, played by my sister. Apparently the Warlock, with her class alignment restriction of chaotic, was a bit too rebellious for the more structured style of learning favored by the College. That suited us just fine; we could definitely use more dakka in the party.

Upon arriving at the church of Pelor, we realized that there was a little problem at hand: the fact that the back wall of the cathedral was flush with a cliff face which dropped down a quarter mile or so to the city below. The Cleric and the Warlock both had flight, but the Beguiler and I had to make do with a casting of Spider Climb. The back door was set into the wall of the church, with a small step being the only foothold; the door itself opened easily. Once inside, we immediately hid, surveying the room. It was long and shadowy, and seemingly unoccupied. The Beguiler, Mindsight active, carefully probed the room for traps or other items of note. There was a long sliding door, rigged with what looked like the mother of all evocation spells, as well as a shrine to Hextor. Towards one end of the room there was a stairway leading down, with a half-giant guard at the based. As we were sneaking around, the back door opened and Zaxus walked in. Fortunately, we all passed our Hide checks, and he continued on his way down the steps. He was followed by the Beguiler, who snuck down after him, somewhat miffed by the fact that the dwarf was apparently warded against his Mindsight. The Beguiler made do with an auditory scrying, briefly listening in on Zaxus’ conversation with someone before the dwarf noticed the scrying sensor. He launched into some rant about how the Mages’ College could try to stop him, yes, but they were far too late to do anything by now, and that they could kindly fuck off and find someone else to spy on, before destroying the listening device. So much for that line of attack.

Remembering the half-giant Guard, the Beguiler cast Charm Person on him. The Guard was quite friendly, explaining that the door which appeared to be trapped with fireballs was in fact a conjuration-based trap which would fill the hall with a suffocating gas if triggered. He also mentioned that the entire operation there was overseen by some noble called Jerax. Unfortunately, the Guard didn’t have a chance to explain more, as he was interrupted by four more guards coming through the door at the base of the stairs. He almost blew the Beguiler’s cover when he mentioned his new “friend” to them, but the Beguiler hid well enough that he was essentially invisible to all of them, charmed Guard included. The other guards gave him no more than a disgusted look, before they proceeded to the top of the stairs, forming a wall of hired steel to block any trespassers.

Well, we had to do something about those guards, but we didn’t want to risk discovery yet. The Cleric, who by this point had more Walker in the Waste levels than Cleric levels, remembered her passive Local Drought, which raises the nearby temperature conditions to “hot,” forcing forititude saves against the heat and screwing over anyone in metal armor. The guards just so happened to be wearing full plate, as it turned out. After a few minutes of sweating in the heat, they began to strip, removing first helmets, the cuirasses and guantlets, until finally they were essentially unarmored. Where there had been a squad armored guards, there were now just four sweaty half-giants, a far less intimidating threat.

What happened next was just brutal. The Cleric cast Black Sand under the guards, I manifested Energy Wall around them, and the Warlock and the Beguiler hit the guards with Eldritch Blasts and Power Word: Pain, respectively. The guards rapidly succumbed to the quadruple onslaught, forming a shapeless pile of Black Sand which the Cleric quickly gathered up and stowed in her bag. The charmed Guard was still at the bottom of the stairs, blissfully unaware of the destruction of his comrades. It was around this point when the Beguiler tried to listen in on the conversation at the base of the stairs. Mindsight revealed two beings: a humanoid with 16 INT, likely Zaxus, and an aberration with an impressive 38 INT, presumably this Jerax fellow. He wasn’t able to glean much from their conversation, but there was no mistaking the vile nature of their plans.

It was at around this point when the boxes showed up. One after another, pinewood coffins floated through the back door of the cathedral, down through the hall, and finally down the stairs into the mysterious room beyond, to be dealt with in some manner by Zaxus and Jerax. All in all, there must have been over two dozen of the things, eerily gliding through the darkness to be used for some fell purpose which we could only guess at. We must have hid their for over an hour, waiting for something interesting to happen. Fortunately, Zaxus saw fit to reward our patience.

I don’t quite remember how he knew we were there, but he knew. At the base of the stairs, he stopped, turned to where the Beguiler was hiding, and said something along the lines of “I know you’re there, but you’re too insignificant for me to care.” He then proceeded up the stairway, and smacked the Cleric with a lightning bolt, dropping her to around 3 hit points. As we rolled initiative, we knew that we’d have to bring him down quickly if we wanted to still have a divine caster come morning.

Round 1. The Warlock, with her ridiculous dexterity score, won initiative. Now, let me tell you a little something about that Warlock. She was, as I mentioned before, played by my sister, and this was my sister’s first time ever playing D&amp;D. Like any good elder brother, I had helped her get set up for the game, and I’d shown her a few feats and magic items which would boost her damage output. Since she was aiming at a cleric in full plate, her ranged touch attacks were essentially guaranteed hits. The damage they dealt was 4d6 base + 1d6 from a Chasuble of Fell Power + 2d6 for a Mortalbane blast + 2d6 from the Gloves of Eldritch Admixture, for a total of 9d6 damage. Thanks to the poorly-worded Flyby Attack feat, she was able to make two such attacks in one round. Two fistfuls of d6’s were tossed upon the table, and the DM muttered curses under his breath at my meddling. The Beguiler cast Power Word: Pain, as he was so often wont to do, dealing a grand total of 1 point of damage with his unlucky d6. Zaxus, taking the blows from the Warlock and the Beguiler in stride, strode towards the Cleric and hit her with a nasty Slay Living. She managed to pass the Fortitude save, and was dropped to -7 hit points. On my turn, I was about to reach for my trusty poisoned spikes when I realized that Zaxus’ full plate would likely deflect all the blows. Instead, I hit him with an Energy Ray, for 8d6+8 of damage, making full use of his vulnerability to touch attacks.

Round 2. Zaxus was hurting at this point, and the Warlock pounced on the opportunity to act. Drawing on her last daily use of the Mortalbane feat and the Gloves of Eldritch admixture, she sent another 14d6 of pain towards the dwarf. He fell where he stood, his corpse landing alongside the unconscious body of the Cleric (who happened to fail the Fort saive against bleeding out, bringing her one step closer to death). We collectively let out a sigh of relief, and gathered round to inspect the body and heal the Cleric.

Looking over Zaxus’ gear, I was glad I hadn’t tried to use an electricity-based energy ray, for his full plate was in fact solid obsidian rather than the steel we’d been expecting. The Warlock transferred it to her haversack, unloading her own gear on the Cleric for the time being. Considering what little we’d learned of Jerax and his abilities, we decided that we’d rather flee the scene rather than stick around to delve deeper into the caverns beneath the cathedral. As we debated setting off the trapped door on our way out, we realized that the door we’d come in through was sealed by the most intricate lock we’d ever seen. We were trapped.

The door was to big for me to Time Hop, too intricate for the Beguiler to pick, and far too sturdy for any of us to break down (no one in the party had more than 10 STR). I briefly considered rigging the trapped door to explode and then hopping the four of us ahead in time to the point after its detonation, but that proved unfeasable. In fact, the Beguiler was adamantly opposed to setting off the trap on our way out, since it would mean the demise of the Guard he’d charmed and “befriended.” The Cleric would have none of that, so she went over and sprinkled some Black Sand over the smiling, simpleminded half-giant. The rest of the party could only look on in horror as the poor soul crumbled into sand, a faintly confused smile the last to ever grace his visage. As she gathered up the sand in a flask, the Beguiler swore many things, but his tirade was interrupted by the crypt doors opening, and Jerax walking out.

He stopped, surveyed us, glanced at the corpse of Zaxus and said, “that was my best lieutenant, you know. I’m almost impressed.” He then launched into a long-winded egotistical rant about how, even though we had bested his most prized officer, we were nothing compared to him and that we could try to stop him, yes we could, but we would ultimately fail and be condemned along with the rest of the city to be consumed by his undead armies. Men, women, and children alike devoured and reanimated, each death contributing to his vast undead horde, we were powerless before his might, etc. Typical BBEG stuff. So proud was he that he unlocked the door to the outside as a taunt, daring us to try and stop him, before teleporting out in a theatrical manner. We decided as one to make our exit, fleeing out the door before it could close again with us inside. The only time we paused in our flight was so that the Warlock could summon a spider swarm to set off the trapped door, filling the halls with poisonous gas to clear out any guards who might remain. We had had enough of that place for one night.

,runescape,"Hi All,

I'm returning from a break from before EOC ever came out.  I've found myself with some free time on my hands and thought i'd come check it out, with the goal of being able to do some of the cool bosses that have come out. 


I've read up quite a bit and have been playing for about a week now.  My bank was still intact with the items i've collected over the 5+ years i played before, but I had virtually no GP. Like 1.5m total.  I managed to get myself a chaotic crossbow and some royal d hide.  I tried to QBD, but realized its not reliable enough for me yet.  So i've switched to Frosts to make money which is working well.


My first question is in the order I should be trying to do things.  I obviously want Drygores and some great armor, but I'm still a long ways off of that.  Also I want herblore/prayer/summoning to the levels required for bossing.  My stats are below:


99 attack
99 strength
99 defense
99 mage
97 range -&gt; will be 99 from frosts


91 summ
83 herblore (have about 60 super antis from boosts)
75 prayer


So i really want 96 summoning first, but obviously charms play a major role in that and I don't have anywhere near enough and won't for a while.  So my question is, should I prioritize picking up at least a main hand drygore before I ever work on skills?  I have a main hand chaotic rapier currently, and about 84k dung tokens saved up.  But I enjoy dungeoneering so I wont' be opposed to working on that for picking up a second hand rapier if need be.  


Or would it benefit me more to put cash to herblore or prayer first?  I'd like to get to a point where I can do things like QBD or godwars etc... to get away from frosts occasionally.


Also what would a good gear list be to pick up along the way?  Should I be going for bandos and armadyl in the near future?  


Thanks for any tips or advice.  Also if anyone wants to add me, my old friends don't seem to play anymore so I'm up to add anyone for any tips tricks or just some fun.

,AskFeminists,"In reading [Punching Gloria Steinem: inside the bizarre world of anti-feminist women](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/07/anti-feminist-women-hobby-lobby-decision-great) I was struck by the premise of the author that:
&gt;When men are against feminism, it's frustrating, if ultimately predictable - groups with power have always been loathe to give it up.

While we've all heard of anarcha-feminism, there's no [Bayesian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning#Bayesian_model_combination)-feminism or [boosting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boosting_\(machine_learning\))-feminism. We know from artificial intelligence how to remove all power from any individual while still maximizing the utility of the choices those individuals would have made alone. So, if we have the ability to remove *all* individuals from power while preserving group decision-making, we aren't we? Why enable tyranny of the majority (or minority) instead of rule-by-the-wise-but-only-insofar-as-their-choices-are-wise?

Also, as a slight aside, it's not clear to me that ""men"" collectively hold all that much power in a world effectively run by the 0.001%. It seems like inherited wealth is the true determinant of power and the trends in inheritance favor(ed) men. If plutocracy is a given, sure it would be better if the gender balance of inheritance were the same as the birth rates of each gender. But doesn't it make more sense to strip away classification (wealth/gender/race/etc) from power entirely?

Maybe 30% of their taxes could be used toward specific tax funded projects, programs, services, etc, or they can choose to abstain from designating. The government could budget according to the results of the tax season and the people will have voted with their dollars. 


Maybe you'll put a bit extra specifically into health care or, education or, a field of scientific research. Collectively these little boosts in specific fields can encourage growth, which is prosperity and basically what we are aiming for here. Most of the time. 


This seems like it would be difficult to implement but in theory could be successful. I think it is worth having a trial period. Alternative distributions of income are already being considered (minimum incomes). Taxation could afford to be alternated a bit too.

,Tinder,"I've got a pretty good story. edit: This story begins about 2 months ago.

I'm 22, recently moved from Seattle to LA. No experience with girls in my life. Never kissed, never done anything. No girlfriends.

I got Tinder when I moved out here and my confidence was immediately boosted. Girls swipe right on *me*? There are girls who actually find me attractive? It was awesome.

I matched up with one girl, and we started talking. She was cute, I could definitely go for her. After a couple days, we started talking on the phone, and we made plans for her to come over to my place. Also, at this point we'd talked about a lot and she knew that I had no experience. She is 21, and told me that she's never had a boyfriend.

She came over and I had never been more nervous in my life, but I manned up. Can't back out now.
We sat on the couch, and I put a movie on: ""We're the Millers."" The movie title isn't really relevant, but it helps set the stage.

After a few minutes of me nervously trying to make small talk, she said ""I can tell how tense you are."" I got flustered, and said something along the lines of ""...yeah..""

She then said ""do you just want to get it over with?"" (remember, she knew that I had no experience with girls, no kiss, nothing.)

I said ""...yeah.""

She then proceeded to move over to me and get on top of me, straddling me. Then, it happened. My first kiss. Holy shit. The feeling of her lips on mine was amazing. We made out (read: I was trying to keep up, she was obviously very experienced at making out) for 30 minutes or so and then she paused. She then said ""are you ready for this?"" and began to take off her shirt. My internal thought: WHAT THE FUCK MAN THIS IS THE BEST DAY EVER.

She took off her shirt and her bra .... and grabbed my hands and put them on her... and I was touching boobs for the first time. (""No longer just bags of sand, eh?"" said one of my friends when I recollected this story to him.) They were so warm. Unbelievable. It's like everything made sense and all was at peace, all at once.

We continued to make out until the movie was over. Then, we went to my bathroom and she pulled out her hair straightener because we'd discussed straightening my beard. My beard is curly so I wanted to try it.

I was sitting on the toilet and she was on her knees in front of me. Romantic, right? Anyways, as she's straightening my beard, her face gets closer and closer to mine. Eventually, we both know whats about to happen and she sets down the straightener on the counter and we begin making out again. God damn this day is amazing.

We made out for another few minutes until my roommate came home, and then she left shortly after that.

A week or so later, she came over again and we cooked dinner together and watched Game of Thrones.

Unfortunately after that we decided to end it for other reasons. The overall time period from first talking to her to being done was about a month.

I'm thankful for the experience 100%. Often times you hear about people's first kisses, and they're always super nervous and their first experiences aren't that great. Mine? My first experience was amazing, and I'll always be thankful for that.

Basically, Tinder boosted my confidence a lot and now I don't have to continue life past 22 thinking something is wrong with me because I've never kissed a girl. I'm not super attractive, I'm not super ugly either. The beard helps though. Thanks Tinder!

,Trove,"Appologies in advance if you already have this idea, or please ignore it if it's already set in stone.

**The Idea**
My idea is to have the items in ""style"" to be just that, click to override the look in equipment, but not change the stats (that is got from equipment).

Then Transmog, simply (for the user, not the devs), converts an item into a style (and removes the stats).


**The reason for the idea**
Trove is really varied, and it would be great for looks to be independant of equipment (as equipment stats are really important when playing the game).


More importantly, it would be great to be able to quickly change what you look like depending on your mood at the time. It also means we could use all the cool stuff like crowns without having to prism them 8 times etc.


**Benifit to long term play**
It also means you could make transmog more expensive, as you only do it once per style, so people have something else to keep playing for (can you collect all styles), and for those of us who only want a few specific items it's something to save for.
 

**For people with a shadow trove sword etc**
As it's still alpha, you could just convert all the current style items to ""no-stat"" style items, or if you are feeling generous, anyone who has boosted their item, gets an id",,False,,0,,[Suggestion] Transmog idea,,,,,,0.0,,,False,t3_2a4esv,False,,,,,3.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},,,3,,,,self,False,,,,,,True,,1404803330.0,,,,,,self.Trove,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,t5_2z0i3,,,,,2a4esv,,,MisterG36,,6,,,,,,,/r/Trove/comments/2a4esv/suggestion_transmog_idea/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/Trove/comments/2a4esv/suggestion_transmog_idea/,,1404799730.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441278266.0,,,
,offmychest,"I'm going to start from the beginning. I'm going to go into all the details. I wouldn't normally do this but I think I need to if anyone is going to have a chance of understanding how I feel about the situation. It's going to be a bit of an essay, and in places it will seem pretentious, ridiculous, pathetic, or plain stupid, but if just one person reads to the end I will be eternally grateful. Here we go.

**If you want to skip the preamble (if you really, really, want to skip it) then go down to the next bold text**

I am a 20 year old, moderately to high achieving academic History undergraduate. Most people know me as an enthusiastic, outgoing, and very considerate guy. Apparently I'm fairly good looking, which is something that has only became apparent to me since attending a university, as previously I had attended an all boys school and had been very insecure about my looks. I still suffer from a lot of insecurities that I picked up from my younger years, but from the outside you wouldn't think they affected me. I am a virgin. A select few friends know this, either because they have known me since childhood or because I have told them. The point I'm making is that most people wouldn't think I was sexually inexperienced. 

I'm a romantic at heart, as cheesy it is to say it, but also over the last few years a few things have happened that have also made me very cynical and pragmatic, and I must say I struggle between these two ""sides"" of my character. Here is my romantic history (I realise while writing this that a lot of this preamble isn't particularly relevant, but I suppose it will act as an appendix of sorts): aged 17 I started going to a local pub and met a girl (this was a big deal as before reaching ""going out to pub"" age I had no female friends). We talked on FB for a while and I asked her out on a few dates. I was very proud of myself at the time because I got to take her to my school's leavers ball (prom) when many of my friends at the time didn't have dates. However, I was still incredibly shy when it came to intimacy, despite generally being quite an upbeat and funny guy when around her (if I'm honest I still have this insecurity that girls wouldn't want me to be intimate with them, even if when I know that they would - I guess I'm stuck in the ""I do being friends well, let's not go up a level because I might fuck it up"" phase ((I'm working on it)). After the ball I was mad at myself for not kissing her, and a couple of days later I steathily posted a letter through her door asking her out officially (terrible I know). It was a success, although naive me at the time ignored the part of the reply text that read something along the lines of ""I recently broke up with my long term boyfriend so let's not make this too public"". Her ex was about 3 years older than me and I had no chance. After dropping her off at home a week or two later she took the initiative and went in for the first kiss. I reacted with a surprised ""oh!"" and she got out the car and broke up with me by text the next day. Fair enough. 

Girl numero 2 came that summer, when I had just turned 18. My parents went away for a week and I took the opportunity to go to a gig in London with some friends. I met a girl there simply because I took her place in the crowd when she went to the toilet and then apologetically gave it back to her when she returned. Apparently this, and the fact that at the age of 18 I looked at least 21, was good enough to start a conversation. Cue some small talk about comic books (something that I'm very interested in but never talk to with people who aren't interested in the subject) and I get her number. We dance for a bit, and I have no fucking idea what I'm doing. The music was too loud so I was passing my phone to her with notes on it to communicate. She took this as a cue to put her number in my phone. Result. Unfortunately due to the fact that my mum wasn't around to cook for me the weeks worth of takeaways had taken their toll on my body, and this combined with the adrenaline of an attractive girl taking an active interest in me made me veryyyyyy sick. I returned from the toilet and told my friends that I had to go. Myself, my best friend and his girlfriend left but our other mate stayed. Just as we were entering the tube station I got a call from my mate saying that this girl was asking where I had gone, and he put her on the line and I told her that I had to go and that I would definitely contact her tomorrow. I was sad that I hadn't spent more time with her, and this was apparent on the train ride home, as my mate's gf gave me a sympathetic peck on the cheek (bless her, she was well aware of my pathetic love life and I think she saw the similarities between me and her boyfriend who was experiencing his first romantic ((and far more successful)) relationship himself). Anyway, to skip things forward, I started a string of texts with this girl, which established a couple of things. First, I regretted not kissing her on that dancefloor and it turns out she wanted me to kiss her. Great. Secondly it turns out she was a nursing student at university (I had only just finished high school) and was a year older than me, but she didn't seem to care about my age because I looked so much older. Sweet, ego boost to the max. Cue first date, literally all we did was go to coffee shop in London, and then as we said goodbye at Charing Cross station I made out with her. This was the *first* first base for me really. Yay! Cue downward spiral. Essentially in my elation of being with a girl who I knew for sure was sexually attracted to me and I was comfortable with being intimate with, I entered into a rabbit hole of issues that I was not prepared to deal with. We quickly (too quickly if I'm honest) began divulging intense personal secrets because we both felt that we had this strong personal bond. Looking back, I was probably the first honest to god non-douchebag man she had got involved with, and for me it was the fact that I was just happy that a girl actually liked me. She told me about her past eating disorders, her insecurities, her failed relationship with her ex that had almost ended in her moving in with him at the age of 16, and I told told her about my deep depression earlier that year and my contemplation of suicide (I will not be so brash to say that I am a manic depressive or anything like that, only because I have experienced first hand on more than one occasion the result of real depression and have tried to help these people personally, but I will say that these periods of ""depression"" have impacted me greatly and that the most hurtful of all (so far) has been a rather rocky journey of discovery regarding my sexuality from the ages of 16 to 17).

The relationship continued with a lot of long late night phone calls and a few scattered dates (we lived on the opposite sides of London so face to face time was hard), and then I went to university. The ""freshers"" experience for me was great but not what it could have been: I thought I was somewhat in love with this girl and that we were sort of ""going out"" (at that time my naive logic was that if you were dating a girl you must certainly not pursue anyone else in the slightest because this would be dishonest and dishonourable). In the end, she found out I was a virgin, which at first didn't seem a problem but I think it made the age difference sink in, and the fact that I was still on the opposite side of London lead to her effectively breaking up with me. This was a far bigger deal than my first romantic endeavour because I actually thought I loved this girl (although in a couple of months I soon realised how ridiculous this was). I had a few weeks of crying in my room and acting a bit dead, and eventually I got over it as people tend to do. Looking back on it as a 20 year old ""adult"" I see it as a valuable learning experience, and also a major factor in my ingrained cynicism. 

Meanwhile, I was becoming a very noticeable member of my university's a cappella choir (no it's not like glee, but if it helps you envision the story by all means use this as a base). I was asked out by one of the members. We went on a few dates, but I wasn't sure about the whole thing mainly because I wasn't physically attracted to her but I did enjoy her company as a friend. This was of course a new feeling to me as normally I just felt grateful that a girl was interested in me, however by this point (I was nearing the age of 19) the majority of my friends were women. After the fourth date she asked me THE question about if this was going anywhere, and I told her I wasn't ""in the right place for a relationship right now"". I'm not very good at saying no to people, but that ended that romantic relationship. To be honest it was probably the most functional of all of them, but I knew in my heart it wouldn't work as a romantic relationship, and I'm very glad that to this day we are still good friends. 

The last term of my first year was about to end, and I was attending my flat mate's recital. He did his part and he was very good and I supported him. I stayed around in the lecture room to listen to the other students. A girl came on and started singing jazz. She was great, she really was. We all went to the Music Society pub crawl after that, and by the second pub I went over and sat next to her. The first thing I did was compliment her on her singing, and up to that point I don't think I had ever been that flirtatious with a girl before in my life (although, again, looking back on things my general nature had lead many girls to think I might be flirting with them, but at the time I wasn't aware of this). The pub rang the bell for last orders and I had the bright idea of all of us going back to my flat for some ""exotic liqueurs"" that my uncle had offloaded on me that past holiday. She didn't stay long but there was something about her that I was extremely attracted to. We texted for a while, and we met up at a boat party at the very end of term and had a great time. Then I found out she was supposed to go to Italy for a year abroad. Just my luck. At this point I had pretty much given up on women (I know, reading this, it clearly doesn't take much). 

Fast forward to the end of the summer holidays, and I found out she wasn't going abroad because her application had fucked up. Game on. We went on a few dates, and I had a great time but nothing happened because of my fucking insecurity with intimacy. Put it this way - on the second date we went for a few drinks at our local, I walked her back home and ended up in her room. We sat on her bed looking through an old school photo album. Something should have happened, but it didn't because all I could think was ""(A) I'm too drunk, (B) I probably can't get it up, (C) I don't know what I'm doing, (D) she probably doesn't want me to make a move anyway (HA!)"". So that night ended in regret and disappointment, and we sporadically dated up until the present moment (the last date was sometime in late May). If I'm honest, I don't know where that story is going. You'll understand why now, because this is where the real story starts. 

**If you wanted to skip the preamble that gives the wider context to this story, start here.**

At this point in my life I was 19 years old. I was very cynical about love but still romantic at heart. I was determined to lose my virginity but couldn't see the merit in the one night stand, no matter how much I tried, how drunk I got, or how much encouragement I received from friends. 

In the winter of 2013/14 two things happened. I grew to resent my best friend at university because of his steadily inflating ego as he became musical director of various societies and productions on campus, including my own choir which was very close to my heart. He became very possessive over our friendship, and whenever I tried to balance the relationship he made me feel guilty and shit about myself. It was this situation, but not solely, that led to the next major stage in my life: my relationship with Katherine. 

Every Monday night after rehearsals my choir went to the local pub (which was our sponsor ((kudos to Treasurer Katherine for getting us that sponsor)) to wind down for the evening. I had Tuesdays off and Monday night became my drinking night. Myself, my friend the musical director, and my two housemates used to come to the pub and we would all enjoy some pints together. Unfortunately, my housemates quickly stopped being friends and became ""groupies"" for my director friend, and we always left when he wanted to leave. I didn't like this. This sense of collective socialising was fine when I was an insecure first year, but now I was thoroughly cynical and I didn't want to take any shit. The first time they said ""so we're going after this pint yeah?"" and I said ""actually I think I'll stay"" may as well have been a declaration of war. After that point for the next six months my relationship with my housemates did not go well because of this ""betrayal"", but I'll tell you now that it was worth it and I would do it a thousand times over. 

So as I loosened the shackles of my housemates I became free to mingle with the rest of the choir (or at least those who went to the pub, which were surprisingly few). As one of the few male and heterosexual members of the choir, I was somewhat of a rare commodity. I soon fell in with a group of girls that, if I'm totally honest, I really needed at the time. This was the inner sanctum of the society. Four girls, and myself. Two of them on committee, one of them being Katherine (treasurer) and the other being the social secretary. There were two others. They were all older than me (I seemed to have a habit of making friends with those older than myself). We spent our time gossiping, bitching about our housemates and other people, and just generally having a laugh. I was the token straight male, and if I'm honest it felt great. Having time away from my housemates, indulging in my admittedly poor drinking habits, and getting to chat with a bunch of girls who were all honest, and blunt, and fun. I loved every minute of it. The best thing about being the token boy in the group is that it made me feel like a man. I was THE straight male in the group. I was good looking, funny, and kind, and I think they all loved me for it. I didn't hit on any of them, but I loved them all the same. Apart from Katherine. I loved her more. 

Katherine was a year older than me, and due to graduate. We had a brief encounter the previous year where I had been unwittingly chosen as a cock block against the one other straight (and creepy) guy in the choir at a Student Union club night. I was naive, thought she was very pretty, and had enjoyed dancing with her. I also felt grateful that I was apparently the less creepy option. 

A year on and I was still incredibly attracted to her. However, not long after that previous encounter word had got to me that she was a lesbian. This was of course *pretty much*true, and I'll tell you now that as far as I'm concerned she is in a loving long term relationship with her high school sweetheart. 

Skip forward to March 2014, and I'm no longer ""the friend of the musical director"" and I'm now my own man, and all the better for it. I'm sitting opposite her yet again, in that pub, away from all the stresses in my life, chatting shit and making everyone laugh. . And I can't help but fall in love with her. She's strong to the the point of stubborn, cries only when she means it, has the most incredible grey eyes, and wrinkles her nose in the cutest way. At first my cynicism kicks in. I go home and all I think is that there's no point in wanting what you can't have. Then we get closer. More drunken nights at the pub. We talk about sexuality. About how she's bisexual. About how I've had issues with my sexuality. About how my philosophy on the subject agrees with hers. We finish our finals. The four of us spend the entire day in that pub, drinking and having fun. I'm sitting next to her. I'm telling her all this deep shit that I've had years to think about, and she's listening and agreeing, and I'm looking into those beautiful grey eyes and I can't look away. That night I get a text from her best friend who lives with her. After that long night they had both gone back home and had an argument. She tells me that it's about something that I should know about, but I can't get it out of her. For a few weeks this goes on and I still don't know. I'm falling in love with Katherine more and more. I know something is up. I start making improvements in my life. I start working out more, improving my appearance, being more proactive in my studies and in my efforts to start a career. I'm trying to be a better man. 

Eventually I give in. I text her friend one drunken night that there's something I need to tell her. We meet half way between our houses. I tell her that I've fallen in love with Katherine. She tells me that the argument was about Katherine - she was thinking about kissing me that one night, about maybe sleeping with me because she'd never slept with a man before. I start venting about my past romantic life. About how it had been fucked up again and again. About how I had given up, until I had started getting to know Katherine. About how normally I would be cynical and pragmatic, but in this case I just couldn't. Her friend was somewhat upset. I'll tell you now that things have transpired to lead me to believe that there is some sort of love triangle going on here. If I'm honest I don't think I care about that any more though - I still love Katherine.

A few days pass and texts fly back and forth between myself and Katherine's friend about the subject. We argue about the best way to tell her that I'm in love with her. Previously my choir had organised a tour to Italy that I had declined at the time because I didn't have the money, but something had changed. Firstly, I had the money. Secondly, I had an intense wanderlust, a experience something in my life. Thirdly, I was in love with Katherine. These factors lead to me booking a tour of Italy, with three days booked where my choir would be staying. Where Katherine would be staying. I would be lying if I said that she was not the prime consideration in this whole endeavour. 

My 20th birthday party happened near the end of term. Katherine and her friend were among the first to arrive. I spent most of the night with her. My housemate made a big deal about her ""stealing"" me from himself. She made him fuck off, and boy am I glad she did. It only made me love her more. Around 2am a neighbour came round to shut our party down. One of my inebriated housemates tried to get rid of him, but it was Katherine that pushed him out the way and argued our case. She started crying, and my housemates looked to me to sort the situation out. I did, and with as much diplomacy I could muster. If I'm honest it was a proud moment. Katherine left soon after, sadly, but she called me from home to apologise for crying and so on. Of course I didn't mind. I  was madly in love with her by this point. I was just sad she couldn't stay longer.

Around this time I found out she was planning to go to Australia for six months starting this August. That's when I really shifted up a gear. I told her friend that I would have to tell her how I felt regardless of the situation, regardless of her being bisexual and/or lesbian (and if I'm honest I don't think any of us know which, not least Katherine herself). I decided I would tell her in Italy, as that would likely be the last time I would see her for at least half a year. I wrote a contingency letter declaring my feelings in case I pussied out on the final night. I gave this letter to her friend to give to her. Her friend read the letter. Cue phone call at 2am. Friend was crying, rambling about things like her divorced parents, her depression, her alcoholism. At some point in that hour I heard her mumble something about cutting herself and I began running over to her house, and told her to let me in. She had cut herself, not on her wrist but on the outside of her forearm. I was scared and didn't know what to do. All this time with these girls and I had been THE man, and I was doing a bloody good job. But I wasn't prepared for this. I stayed with her for as long as possible, talked her through it, took the scissors away. Nothing worse happened, but I did tell my parents and eventually Katherine, although her friend didn't want me to tell anyone. It made me feel guilty. I had this horrible feeling that it was because I had told her I loved Katherine, when at the same time this girl, Katherine's friend, loved me. She never said it, but to give you a sneak preview, she's messaged me recently that there is something she needs to ask me in person, so I'll update you on that later. 

Skip to Italy. I arrive mid-way on the choir's tour. Everyone is pleased to see me. Katherine's friend knows what's up. My two travelling companions knows what's up. I know what's up. Katherine doesn't know what's up. I know already that she thinks something is going on with me and her friend because we keep exchanging meaningful glances, but it obviously it isn't what she thinks. I spend three glorious days with Katherine and my friends. But all the while I'm thinking about how to say it to her. About how to tell her I love her. About how to tell her I love her, and that I understand that she might not love me. I just need to tell her how I feel, because life is too short to not tell people that you love them. 

Two days in I'm swimming with her off the coast of Capri. Just me and her. I loved it. Then I get stung by a jellyfish. At the time I brush it off, and I soldier through. Nothing is going to stop me spending these last few days with her. But I start to get sick. Really sick. The final day comes, and I'm light headed, nauseas, can barely stand. I walk to her hostel anyway. We all sneak out for a final meal on the coast. I'm not coping well. We sneak back in, up to the roof of her hostel. Myself and a few friends are up there. The rest of the choir find out I'm up that and come up to say goodbye. I'm in the middle of the sofa, my arms around Katherine and her friend like some sort of benevolent pimp. They think it's funny, but I appreciate the contact. Probably the last contact I'm going to have with them. Eventually  everyone leaves, including my travelling companions, until it's just me and the group of girls that it all started with. I get up. At this point I'm barely concious. The jellyfish sting is taking it's toll but I persevere. Nothing is stopping me. Katherine is already crying because the ""leaving process"" is beginning. She still has the whole choir to say goodbye to in the next few days. I'm just the first to go. Ironically off to Venice, the most romantic city in the world. Without Katherine. 

She gets up. I hug her. I tell her I need to tell her something. She says okay. We stumble across the pitch black rooftop, away from our friends. The time for subtlety is over. I stand there in front of her, my legs shaking like mad from the adrenaline. I tell her I love her, more than a friend, and all I want is for her to be happy. We hug for what must have been at least a minute. My legs are shaking like a pair of spasticated slinkys. Eventually I go back to the last few friends left and say some quick goodbyes. At this point I can barely walk and Katherine hasn't said anything. I say ""see ya"" and walk away off the roof. One of my travelling companions comes with me, one of them doesn't. I walk for about twenty minutes back to my hostel. I get a call from the one that stayed behind. ""You've got to come back man, right now."" We meet him half way between the hostels. I'm feel like I'm going to throw up. He won't tell me what went down at the hostel. I jog back as best I can. I climb the stairs. Katherine is sitting on the floor in the corridor. Our friends leave us alone. 

If I'm totally honest what I recall next may not be completely accurate. At this point I was battling against whatever reaction I was having against this fucking jellyfish sting and I hadn't had a drink of water in hours. I was barely lucid. Just my luck right? Ha. I sat down next to her. She said she had read the letter I had wrote as a contingency. It was far more comprehensive than anything I could have said in person. She said it she was surprised by it all. I said she shouldn't be. I held her hand. We hugged. She said something about ""it's a shame I bat for the other team"" and ""you'll find someone good for you, you deserve it"". I know the advice those couple of lines are going to provoke - ""well, she's clearly gay and will never love you in the way you love her"". I don't think that's true. It's difficult to articulate all the conversations with had on this topic. I'm won't lie, as has been the norm for a while now, I'm quite drunk. Anyway, to continue, I didn't say much. We chatted about some random shit, and looking back at it it seemed totally absurd. We talked about the Spy Kids trilogy. She hadn't even seen them. She grabbed my hand. We hugged again. She said she was still processing it all. I asked what happened now. She said she didn't know. I said me neither. We sat in silence for most of that 30 minutes. I honestly thought I was dying, physically and emotionally. I didn't know whether to feel good or bad. I told Katherine about her friends depression. I told her to look after her. It was important to me. Eventually we stood up and walked into the room that our friends were in. We said ""see you soon"". We said ""enjoy the rest of your holiday"". I left. 

I didn't know what to say to my companions. I said ""it didn't go good or bad really"". I got a text from Katherine's friend about how I hadn't given her a proper goodbye, how I had run back for Katherine but hadn't bothered to talk to her properly. At the time I was too exhausted, emotionally and physically, to reply. Later I felt guilty. I patched things up. My friends said I shouldn't have felt guilty. I still don't know what to feel.

All I know is that I still love Katherine. We haven't been in contact since that night. It's been at least 2 weeks. I'm not dealing with it well. I think it's because I left her at the ""still processing"" stage. It was fair enough. I had spent a good four or five months falling in love with her. Meanwhile she thought I was falling in love with one her friends. It was sudden, I admit that. But I still don't know. I need to know. I think I would prefer to know if she just straight up had no feelings for me. But I don't think that's true. She's still going to Australia in August. Her girlfriend is going with her for the first month. I don't know where I stand guys.

I'll admit it, I'm not dealing with it well. My drinking habit is getting worse. I've been at home alone for four nights now and for three of those nights I've drunk excessively. I keep getting angry when I'm sober that I was so stupid for falling in love for someone that had such a slim chance of loving me back in the way I hoped for. Then I cry and drink to try to get over it. It doesn't work. I'm at a loss. I've spent the last five or so months trying to be a better man, both in part for myself and in part for Katherine (and yes, I fucking know that you're supposed to improve yourself for you and not for someone else, but sometimes the greatest motivator is someone other than yourself), and now I don't know what is motivating me. I've lost all motivation. The girl I mention earlier in the preamble, the jazz singer, I've been deliberately keeping away from because all I can think is that every step towards her is a step away from Katherine. 

Reddit, I don't know how to deal with this. I, a 20 year old man, fell in love with a girl in relationship with another girl. I love her, and I don't want to stop loving her. I don't know what to do. I don't know what advice I need. To be honest I know that most the advice I will get is something that I already know but I'm trying to deny. I don't want to stop loving her.

I just hope someone reads this.

,SolForge,"So I've been playing for all of two days now and I've got to say, while I enjoy a lot of aspects of the game like deck building and the reward system I'm really not enjoying the actual game. It seems like 4/5 of the random games that I play are against people who are throwing legendary cards out every turn. 

I realize I'm not going to win a lot of games as a new player, but can't I at least play against other newbs? I can't imagine most new players sticking around for even a week if they're consistently being matched with people who have obviously had time to collect (or pay for) 20 champion/legendary cards while I think I have five total.

Am I missing something? Do most new players shell out hundreds of dollars for cards? Or is the matchmaking just really bad?

Edit: Thanks to everyone who replied to my question. I appreciate the helpful advice. Since I posted this originally I got lucky in some boosters and played my first draft (went 1-3, should have been 2-2 if I hadn't choked in my first match) and picked up enough cards to make a decent zombies deck featuring a Grimgaunt Predator and Xrath as well as a lane-filller deck with 2 lifeblood dryads and Varna's pact.

**7 of sun's height.**

""Everything is ready..."" *I said looking down to the argonian's skull. A black soul gem was ontop of it. It is worth mentioning how i got it...*

*After walking for 3 hours along the frozen coast line of northern Skyrim we finally got to the mage college. We went up a narrow road up the white clift that i remembered from when i was a young conjurer that spent his days and nights inside those tall and grey walls, trying to make sense of the words and drawings that had survived to be collected in that library, tales of distant lands and powerful magic from other worlds. Mainly delusions of old mad men, misinterpretations of the world around us. i knew that if i wanted to learn the truth i would have to leave the dusty pages of the mage's library and get down to the world, the tumbs and cripts, the war...*

""You will go no further."" *Falx and Gaius stopped in their tracks.* ""This are not the woods of Skingrad anymore, people get thrown in jail, or worst, for practicing necromancy. At least around this place."" 

*I held Valiria's hand and kept walking, she looked back at her cousins when we turned a corner of the road and lost sight of them.*

*In the town we went straight to the tavern. Sat down on a table by the fire and paid 5 septims for a bottle of wine and a large piece of bread. It was the nice boost of strengh we both had been dreaming of.*

*Then i saw him, Enthir, he was filling the ears of the townsfolk with his usual bullshit. Been doing it for over 30 years, i don't even know how he managed to get into the college anyway, but Sithis, is he fun to be around. i waited for him to be alone and went and sat by his side. He gave me a weird look at first but didn't recognized me.*

""Hello friend, it has been awhile.""

*He looked at me again and soon his eyes filled with happyness.*

""No! It can't be..."" *He said excited.*

""Yes it can, you thieving elf son-of-a-wenche."" *I said as i pulled back my hood and smiled at him.*

""Cal! You son of a hagraven... I thought you were dead! I haven't seen you since... Well since you quit this place and i decided to stay behind, you know i haven't been the most obedient of the members of the college, but hey, what else i was going to do? Right?. I thought you died in the war or something. Really what have you been up to?""

*We hugged and he opened another bottle of wine so we could get in touch.*

""I've been living in Cyrodiil for most of the time, i stayed there after the war, i had no reason to come back and you know, there are always opportunities after a crisis...""

*Valiria approached slowly to the table and stood there to hear Enthir say:*

""Remember the last night you were here, we got drunk and decided to sneak in to the jarls house and stole his helmet just for laughs, we ended up hiding it in that place to the west, what was it called?""

""Yngvild..."" *I said before he went on.*

""Hahahaha! Yes Yngvild! Hahaha, good luck getting it out of there... Hahaha""

""Uhumm."" *Coughed Valiria, claiming attention.*

*Enthir looked up to her.*

""Oh yes, Enthir, this is Valiria, my...""

""Your wife?! You finally settled down did you?""

*Valiria's cheeks turned red.*

""No! Not anymore. I mean, yes, i did, but before, not now. I mean she s not my wife, she is my apprentice."" *I took a big drink.*

*Enthir stayed silent with his eyes wide open. Then he bursted into a big laugh.*

""Hahahahaaaaa! Waaaaaaaa! Did you say apprentice? Hahahahaha! Of what? Being a giant jerk and leaving me with the bill for the tavern and alone to explain to the jarl how i saw ""vampires"" leaving with his helmet. And that i followed them to Yngvild. Thanks Auriel that man would believe anything! But pardon me, continue explaining how this young girl is learning something from one such as you..."" *He offered a chair to Valiria and she accepted and sat down.*

""A lot has changed since we got drunk right now. My powers gave grown far behond what i once dreamed of. I've fabricated spells that defy the rules that are fed to young minds imside those walls. And more are soon to come..."" *I leaned into his ear and whispered:* ""I am close to created my most ambitious spell, the one i said it must be possible on my graduation thesis.""

""Hah!"" *He had to cover his mouth to not let out anything.* ""the sentient thrall?"" *He finally whispered.*

*I nodded.*

""But how did you finally got it?""

""Well after years of... *practice* and *hard work* on all the world's biggest dumps; cripts, graveyards, war zones, vampire nests and lands where slavery is not so frowned upon; i simply got lucky, i got lucky and it found me, i didn't even understand how i did it or how it worked and that drove me crazy, well crazy-er and that led to more *practice* and *hard work* and then i got lucky again. But now i am finally understanding it, i am really close to being able to reproduce it...which leads me to what i am doing here...""

""Oh *nice!* i can feel that big favor comming right about now..."" *He pointed to me.*

""Hey come on! Can't a old friend just drop by unannounced without being accused of having an ulterior motive...""

""Cal, you are full of skeever droppings, have a drink and tell me what is your problem.""

""Well, now that you mention it... I do have a kind of powerful enemy that wants to torture and kill me... It would be nice if i had a black soul gem, for a *protective* spell i am working on.""

""Woah! A black soul gem? I don't even know where to...""

""Now who is full of skeever shit Enthir?""

""Oh well fine, i guess that for a friend and a modest finder's fee i could...""

""How about just for a friend? I have nothing right now and getting the kindness of strangers has never been my strengh... You will be repaid Enthir...""

""See, that is the problem, this powerful enemy you talk about might have something to say about that...""

*Valiria, who has been sitting there quietly finally moves and takes her hands to the back of her neck and then places a pearl necklace ontop of the table.* ""Will this be enough?"" *She asks roughly.* 

*After close inspection, the elf says:* ""It will do for now, i have no doubt you will succeed."" *He placed the gem on top of the table making sure no one was looking. I grabbed It quickly and putted it away inside my cloak.*

""Thanks Enthir, this will not be forgotten..."" *I grimmed widely and started to get up. He placed his hand on my shoulder and said:* ""I want copies of those spells when you are done. I asure you i will be making you rich if you do so."" 

*I nodded and we walked out.*

""I will spare you the details of how that gem got filled, all i'll say is the winterhold guards have an openning position.""

*We went back on our steps and found Falx and Gaius where we left them, we found an openning in the clift and went in for the night.*

*There i was, staring at the skull and the gem. I visualized what i wanted and closed my eyes, believing it before it happened. Green flames started comming from my palms and heating up the skull and the gem. Soul gems can not be destroyed by fire, fire is not only ment to destroy. According to your intent, fire can bring light, warmth and cover or it can be a catalizer, the fuel of change and transformation. The gem melted over the skull and filled every hole or crevice on its surface, it got inside it's pores until they became inseparable, one of the same. The flames stopped comming from my hands but burned forever inside the empty eyes and mouth of the argonian's skull. The green flames could never be extinguished by any power known to men or mer. The skull was forever binded by the flames of my spell. I picked it up, it had turned into a dark and almost metallic green. After looking to Valiria, who's jaw had dropped in awe, i said to her:*

""This is one of the ways to bind a dead creature under your command. It can be done with all sentient beings and trusted animals aswell, a horse, for example. you need the skull of the creature and a gem that could take in their soul. You need to be in possession of the skull in order to summon the. He will come when you want and will leave once he is no longer needed. But he will not be the same, he will be more powerfull, he will be covered in the flames that forged the spell. Now the skull works as a beacon. Come, i will show you the conjuration spell to call him. We will be on our way in the morning.""

""What now? Where are we going next?""

""I already told you child, we need to get the eyes of a vampire...""

GG 4-2 Jin Air over CJ

Game 1 recap: effOrt hatch pool vs TRUE hatch gas pool. TRUE starts speed but cancels it when effOrt scouts, thus allowing him to take an earlier third because he still has the ""threat of speedlings"" while effOrt does not.  TRUE delays his lair and makes a swell of roach speedling off 3 base, while effOrt techs up to lair and +1, roach speed, while taking his third.  TRUE has way too much and smashes through effOrt's significantly smaller army once he reaches about 130 supply.

Game 2 recap: Bunny does not float to the gold, despite much speculation that he would as a ""sniper build"".  TRUE goes pool hatch gas vs Bunny's reaper expand.  TRUE starts a Lair at 5:15 on 2 bases, skipping speed.  Bunny has opted to go for a widow mine drop.  Bunny gets 5 drone kills with his 2 hellion 2 mine drop.  Spire goes down at 8:30 and 1/1 melee/carapace, and metabolic boost start.  I totally missed the third timing for TRUE :( I think it was right around 8:30 as well though.  Standard ling bane muta vs 4M midgame develops.  Bunny is dropping a ton and has cancelled TRUE's fourth four times. Bunny's fourth is now up and well defended, TRUE's is still not up, both around 170 supply at 18 minutes.  Bunny's 3/3 is done, cancels the fourth again, TRUE counterattacks but Bunny pushes it back, cancels the fourth again.  Mutas get trapped trying to harass, fourth gets cancelled again.  Bunny walks across the map and kills TRUE's ling bane army while mutas kill his fourth, but TRUE has nothing left.

Game 3 recap: Rogue goes hatch gas pool vs Bunny reaper expand, normal metabolic boost timing.  Earlier third CC for bunny, starts stim and 6 hellions.  5 roaches are made defensively, but the addition of 2 widow mines to the hellion harass does a little more damage than expected.  Meanwhile, Bunny has taken the 2 o'clock third, rather than the 12 o'clock third.  Standard midgame develops with 4M (and 6 hellbats!) vs ling bane muta.  Bunny has done a good job denying creep spread.  Bunny kills Rogue's fourth while dropping in the natural, excellent multitasking.  Bunny's 4th is up and the parade push is just too much for Rogue, who could not hold with a 3 base economy, never getting a sufficient muta or baneling count to effectively trade with the bio.

Game 4 recap:  Cross position TvT on Frost woo!  Maru gas rax vs Bunny rax gas (13), ends up being cloaked banshees for Maru, while Bunny gets a Raven first.  Bunny takes a CC, but Maru starts making tanks and does not get a CC.  Maru puts his CC down after 2 banshees and beginning the push, but he decides to go home.  Bunny loses 17 workers to the two banshees while he has loaded 2 tanks and 8 marines for a counter drop.  Maru is down to 8 SCVs after pulling to hold.  Both have 3rd CCs building, Maru counter attacks with his 3 tanks, marines and banshee but Bunny holds well with a bunker.  Bunny goes for a 4th CC hidden in the top left.  Bunny goes for a drop but has nothing at home, so Maru's rally of units turns from a soft contain into a walk in and kill you attack.  Bunny taps out when his drop lands and Maru walks in with all his units.

Game 5 recap: Maru is 2raxing, surprise!  Pool first from Hydra.  Hydra holds with enough lings, Maru expands, 3rd CC quickly follows in base.  Hydra gets a roach warren and +1 ranged attack, as well as roach speed when the lair finishes (no third still).  Ok Hydra is just making a ton of roaches, 26 to be exact.  Maru holds though with good micro and the support of a tank, Hydra transitions into 3rd base and spire, as well as ling upgrades.  Maru drops and snipes the spawning pool before speed finishes, but it doesn't make much of a difference.  Game stabilizes into standard ling bling muta vs 4M.  Maru sieges Hydra's 4th, but Hydra holds well after a few minutes of back and forth fighting.  Supplies are even at 20 minutes, Maru's +3 attack is done with +3 armor on the way, lands his 4th.  Hydra cleans up another attack well but the counterattack to Maru's 4th fails badly, supplies even up again.  Maru snipes Hydra's 4th, Hydra's mutas counter to Maru's 4th but Maru just walks to Hydra's natural and kills him.  

Game 6 recap: CC first for Maru, 1 gate expand before cyber for herO.  Robo tech for herO, early, rather early robo bay, standard play from Maru.  herO gets double forge, then blink and 1/1.  Maru goes up to 5 rax before 3rd CC.  Maru's double drop manages to snipe herO's natural nexus, but herO takes that back and his third and 2/2 rather than counter attacking.  Maru cancels the third a few times, wins a big engagement vs 4 colossi and blink stalkers, but Maru just rolls.  herO barely holds but has taken a lot of losses.  Maru's 3rd is up now though.  Maru recollects and attacks again, herO barely holds again, but he is very much at a supply and economic disadvantage.  Maru takes a final push at herO's building 3rd and overwhelms him.  

GG!

This also means that CJ is locked at 4th overall for the season standings, and they will play SKT1 in the first round of the playoffs on July 19 I believe.

,SquaredCircle,"No trolling, just facts and evidence that supports it. I love how this will become a shitshow and a series of posts about why people think hes not even the best superstar of today. I also expect the mods to try to delete this too, but...yeah. This post isnt going anywhere, rest assured.

Okay then, so you roll into the fact that hes hes been a main eventer for a decade (plus), put over nearly the entire roster (see below), and has been a 15 time champion. Nobody has ever those 3 things collectively in the period John Cena has. In the HISTORY of professional wrestling.

Now, for the list of superstars that john cena has put over (or elevated {cena beating somebody clean is better than 99% of the roster jobbing to said superstar}) Get ready folks. Below is the reason why 99% of Cena haters are ignorant, they refuse to admit he put over most of these guys when their careers were all boosted by the GOAT.

1. Billy Kidman (research)
2. Bull Buchanan (gave him a job when he was dead in the water)
3. Red Dogg (Rodney Mack was going to get dropped before repackaged)
4. Daniel Bryan (yep, DB's 1st on air match was against Cena, the WWE wanted to drop him but he worked a gem)
5. Booker T
6. Carlito
7. Batista
8. Orlando Jordan (really)
9. JBL (solidified JBL as a main event talent)
10. Kurt Angle (this one is debatable, but Angle was taking 10 somas a day and was going to be released but the WWE kept him for a lot longer due to his successful feud against Cena)
11. Edge
12. Rob Van Dam (put him over to the WWE crowd)
13. Kevin Federline (seriously)
14. Umaga
15. Khali (his feud after the failed Undertaker feud was much more successful)
16. Mr. Kennedy (Kennedy...)
17. Randy Orton (the 1st of many times)
18. HHH (this was post DX HHH when he had legitimate zero heel heat)
19. Big Show
20. The ENTIRE Nexus (blame WWE for slaughtering this angle)
21. Sheamus
22. The Miz
23. CM Punk (probably the most anyone has put over anyone in the history of the business, like it or not, he made CM Punk a legit WWE main eventer when the company obviously didn't believe in him)
24. Dolph Ziggler
25. Ryback
26. The Shield
27. Daniel Bryan (yep, hes on here twice. This sent DB into the stratosphere just like his fued with Punk)
28. Alberto Del Rio
29. Bray Wyatt

15 time champion, most over face for the longest period of time in the history of pro wrestling, put over more talent than any wrestler of all time. Stale gimmick or not, folks, he is unarguably the best to ever do it.

Cheers :)

,leagueoflegends,"**TL;DR:** An algorithm could easily discern AFK players (who were never able to connect/suffer from crippling lag/hit by blackout) just from the chat logs and a look at player items/cs and levels throughout the game and allow an AI to immediately grant losses forgiven if a certain threshold of requirements are met.

Some probable signs that an AFK happened by end game:

- The game logs repeated or extended DCs by one or more players
- A player may be 10 levels behind everyone else
- A player may have low kills, deaths, assists and CS
- Chat log may contain any of the words ""lag"" ""crashed"" ""4v5"" on allied team
- Enemy team may an early global gold lead in the absence of kills simply because they have more players to take advantage of gold sources
- A player died at their own fountain in their spawn position

There needs to be weighting added to each sign obviously, but the collective data should be able to identify if an AFK had significant impact on the game. At the very least, it could take care of clear-cut cases without the need for human intervention. 

I'm not a programmer, but surely this wouldn't be too hard to write and test? 

**Edit:** Keep in mind if there is an increase in deliberate leavers, leaver buster should balance that out eventually with penalties.

,leagueoflegends,"Hello, this is the first concept I have ever made. There are two things I feel league of legends is missing, and ogre champion. As well as a champion who uses food to deal damage and buff allies. This is a very early concept of so called champion, please bare with me as I am not the greatest artist, I just drew a rough sketch of how I think he would look, but its pretty bad. As well as his abilities, lore, and roll. 

This may seem really complicated on the surface, but overall its actually quite simple and easy to understand.

PS: I am also making a champion spotlight animation for him, inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PcIYp9nQcQ.

The lore is kind of bad, so you can skip over it I you want.

Monitello, cuisine master of Ironspike
Lore: Deep within the IronSpike Mountains, lives a bulky built and brutally strong coloney of ""Ogres"" refered to as the Sumok'Feron tribe. These massive beings care only for two things in the world being Rak'Chefur, meaning Cuisine Master and winning the annual Sumok, a battle of sheer strength. Each year there are massive festivals filled with delicious foods made from only the highest quality ingredients. It was the 99th anual Sumok when Monitello was born, he was expected to be a normal Ogling. but to the tribes suprise he came out half the size of a normal Ogling. The entire tribe filled with laugher, claiming ""he wont amount to anything"" and ""What a runt"" Monitello grew up within the village, being made fun of at training because he could never win a Sumok with the other Oglings. Monitello was crushed, he contemplated running off every night. One night while on his way home from Sumok school, a group of Oglings about twice his size walked up and shoved him to the ground he was terrafied, but there was nothing he could do. The other oglings beat him to a pulp and left him there unconcious in a pool of his own blood.The next thing he knew he was waking up in his bed with no memory of the incident. His head was throbbing, and he could barely move. He knew what happened to him that instant, he made a vow to himself that he would find away to grow huge and extract revenge on those who tormented him his whole life. A year had past since the incident and Monitello had just turned 12, the age where the Sumok students also start attending Cullinary classes. They were all seated and instructed to chop some ingredients and make a hearty stew, like expected the first time the oglings practice these skills, they're not very good. Some cut themselves, all of the pieces were too thick and uneven. Except for Monitello's, his ingredients were chopped to perfection he was already boiling is stew while the instructer came to him. The instructer was amazed by how fluent Monitello was in the kitchen, he had never seen such swiftness and fast learning. Thats when he knew, Monitello would be his next apprentice. The next several years he trained Monitello ending with him winning the the title of Rak'Chefur. But he was not happy with just that, he needed more. He heard of this place called ""the league of legends"". Where all the greatest heroes gathered to fight, he decided to set out to the league of legends to learn about different fighting styles as well as cuisines, as well as to show the world how great of a cook he is. 

Passive: Monitello can gather 6 ingredients from slain minions, monsters, large minions, large monsters, epic monsters. Monitello will put ingredients into a his cooking pot, and the result will depend on what ingredients were mixed. Ally's can feast from Monitello's pot, healing them slightly.

Filler: Small minions ingredient: A filler ingredient Small monster ingredient: A filler ingredient

Canon minions ingredient: Grants a very slight extra duration for the buff. Large monster ingredient: Grants a very slight extra duration for the buff

Special: Elder lizards tail: Infuses Monitello's pot with the flavour of Elder lizard, giving all champions who have consumed it a buff that deals (X) burn damage on auto attacks and slows for (X) for (X seconds)

Blue Golems Eye: Infuses Monitello's pot with the flavour of Blue golems Eye, giving all champions who have consumed it a buff that will restore (X)mana gives a small speed boost for (x seconds)

,Yugioh101,"Hi everyone! It's been a long, long time since I last collected / played Yu-Gi-Oh. So long ago that, unfortunately, all of the cards that I have are so hopelessly out of date that most people would find them humorous.

Now that I have money of my own (and surplus enough to consider spending it on something like this), I'd like to get back into things. I'd love to hear any advice on what I should buy (I remember begging my parents to buy me tins and boxes of booster packs - not sure if that's a good idea anymore), but also help getting back into the rules and gameplay basics. I understand there have been introductions to the game such as ""synchro"" cards (not even sure if that's current anymore haha), and I'm not sure what they mean or how to utilize them.

Besides playing the TCG, I've always been interested in the artwork. If there are any newer cards that you feel I might want to look into purchasing, let me know too!

I just realized I should probably mention something here about my budget, as I was prompted to in the original post. I have virtually no budget. Money is no object.

Thanks in advance. :)

P.S.: From the other post, I got a hefty bit of information about synchros, XYZ monsters, and a tip about the upcoming pendulum monsters.

,leagueoflegends,"Hello, this is the first concept I have ever made. There are two things I feel league of legends is missing, and ogre champion. As well as a champion who uses food to deal damage and buff allies. 
This is a very early concept of so called champion, please bare with me as I am not the greatest artist, I just drew a rough sketch of how I think he would look, but its pretty bad. As well as his abilities, lore, and roll. 

This may seem really complicated on the surface, but overall its actually quite simple and easy to understand.

PS: I am also making a champion spotlight animation for him, inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PcIYp9nQcQ.

The lore is kind of bad, so you can skip over it I you want.


Lore: Deep within the IronSpike Mountains, lives a bulky built and brutally strong coloney of ""Ogres"" refered to as the Sumok'Feron tribe. These massive beings care only for two things in the world being Rak'Chefur, meaning Cuisine Master and 
winning the annual Sumok, a battle of sheer strength. Each year there are massive festivals filled with delicious foods made from only the highest quality ingredients. It was the 99th anual Sumok when Monitello was born, he was expected to be
a normal Ogling. but to the tribes suprise he came out half the size of a normal Ogling. The entire tribe filled with laugher, claiming ""he wont amount to anything"" and ""What a runt"" Monitello grew up within the village, being made fun of at training 
because he could never win a Sumok with the other Oglings. Monitello was crushed, he contemplated running off every night. One night while on his way home from Sumok school, a group of Oglings about twice his size walked up and shoved him to the ground
he was terrafied, but there was nothing he could do. The other oglings beat him to a pulp and left him there unconcious in a pool of his own blood.The next thing he knew he was waking up in his bed with no memory of the incident. 
His head was throbbing, and he could barely move. He knew what happened to him that instant, he made a vow to himself that he would find away to grow huge and extract revenge on those who tormented him his whole life. A year had past since the 
incident and Monitello had just turned 12, the age where the Sumok students also start attending Cullinary classes. They were all seated and instructed to chop some ingredients and make a hearty stew, like expected the first time the oglings
practice these skills, they're not very good. Some cut themselves, all of the pieces were too thick and uneven. Except for Monitello's, his ingredients were chopped to perfection he was already boiling is stew while the instructer came to him.
The instructer was amazed by how fluent Monitello was in the kitchen, he had never seen such swiftness and fast learning. Thats when he knew, Monitello would be his next apprentice. The next several years he trained Monitello ending with him winning the 
the title of Rak'Chefur. But he was not happy with just that, he needed more. He heard of this place called ""the league of legends"". Where all the greatest heroes gathered to fight, he decided to set out to the league of legends to learn about different 
fighting styles as well as cuisines, as well as to show the world how great of a cook he is. 








Passive: Monitello can gather 6 ingredients from slain minions, monsters, large minions, large monsters, epic monsters. Monitello will put ingredients into a his cooking pot, and the result will depend on what ingredients were mixed.

However, I've been having trouble finding places to buy these. There are tons of US based sellers on Ebay and sites like Troll and Toad, but they all seem to charge such an exorbitant amount for shipping that it's not worth considering.

,magicTCG,"This will be a pretty basic guide to anyone who wants to hop into the fun that is any MTG pre-release. Mainly oriented towards beginner players, but open to anyone's opinion! 

What is the event?

The pre-release event is a sealed Swiss format tournament. You will choose a colour and be given a package that is slightly seeded to that colour. In the pack, you will receive an promo card (according to your colour) that you can play in your deck, a spin-down d20 dice to record life, and your booster packs. For the M15 pre-release, you will get 5 booster pack and one seeded booster pack that tries to stay within your chosen colour. Out of these pool of cards you create a 40 card deck and play (usually 4) rounds against others. If you are new and that scares you, do not worry! Pre-releases, like FNM, are very new user friendly.

What should i bring?

Although many people will give you different answers to this question, here is the Taylorleb Pre-Release Camping kit:

17 of each basic land: Although you can get basic land from your Local Game Store (LGS), do you really want to be running around collecting land during your precious deck building time?  Something to record life totals: One D20 already comes in your pre-release kit, and i would suggest bringing one to record your opponents life as well.  An alternative to dice that i would suggest is Pen and Paper. With paper you can view the history of the game as well as record hands if any are revealed. Sleeves: You want to keep that Kiora you cracked nice and safe when playing, so $4 draft sleeves are a great investment! Playmat!!!!! I cannot stress this enough! Usually pre-releases are a lot busier then other MTG events and a LGS will have to put out a lot of tables (almost always dirty). You do not want to ruin your new sleeves and/or cards you just got!  Snacks! Everyone gets hungry, and these events can last up to 4+ hours. Do you really want to have to run down to a hot dog stand during the event and risk missing a game? Trade Binder: Pre-Releases are a great opportunity to trade for those cards you are looking for! Just be careful with your stuff and never leave it unattended! Do not bring your ""pimp"" binder as there will be a lot of people that are not commons at your LGS.  

How should i prepare?

A lot of people laugh when people ""prepare"" for a pre-release event, but it is very important! I would suggest lots of sleep the day before (especially if going to the midnight release). Do not stuff yourself with greasy food right before you play. Believe it or not this actually slows down your brain because it is tying to focus on processing the shit you just put into your body. One of the most important things I do before a pre-release is study! Even if you are not a 'hardcore' player, you still do not want to have to spend 10 minutes of a match looking at what mechanics do. If you do not keep up with spoilers, I would suggest checking out the Magic: The Gathering facebook page the day before the event. They post all of the cards on there, just do a quick little run through of the cards! 

So there you have it, Taylorleb's guide to a pre-release. I would love to hear if people have anything to add onto what i have said! I hope this helped!

,seduction,"*Apologies in advance if I should have posted this as a field report, first post on here and i'm not 100% about the specific post type*

A bit of background; I'm studying abroad in Romania by the beach and my go-to wings and other 'going out' friends were either busy or had already flown home as it's the end of the semester. I've been a seddit lurker for a couple of months and after seeing you guys talk about going out solo I just thought 'fuck it', and gave it a run. It really opened my eyes to the positive changes that my body language must give off after practising some of the techniques you guys suggest on here. 

I chose a beach bar that I frequent, not too busy, but usually an excellent quality of prospective females. I grabbed a beer at the bar and started to size up the room and literally 30 seconds later was approached by a hb8 romanian chick I'd eyed further down the bar but has classed as off limits due to the guy she was standing with. This is the first time I've ever been approached by a girl in my life, and it honestly felt awesome. I know we shouldn't rely on being approached by them, and that overcoming AA is an integral part of the overall process of learning seduction, but this was an awesome confidence boost, which can only be a good thing. 

She was really chatty and laughing from the off and I just had to maintain the mood and keep things flowing, and I was collected enough to be consciously slipping in kino (like brushing her hair off her neck to look at her earrings, touching her arm and waist when we laughed etc) and literally minutes later k-closed in what must be record time for me. 

We moved to the dance floor, which is a bit of a weakness in my game actually, if anyone has any good places to start with general club dancing please enlighten me. I'm not saying i'm terrible but I would never class myself as the best or smoothest dancer on the floor. Obviously on the dance floor it's easy to keep the mood fun and high energy, and continued to k-close for a while, but eventually things did come to an end. She got a call from a friend asking her to urgently go and meet them, but I got the #close and will hopefully be seeing a lot more of her next semester after the summer break.

**TLDR; Major confidence boost after being approached by hb8, with k/# close all on first solo outing** 

Thanks for all your help so far seddit, this is an awesome community.

*Also sorry for the wall of text, may have got a bit carried away with the details.*

,stunfisk,"So I made a post a while back for a mono grass team, and it's been working fairly well, but it's limiting, and it's still a struggle to pull off a victory. So I decided to step up my game, and make a team of some of the hidden ability pokes I've been collecting, but have just been gathering dust in my PC. Keep in mind that while I do have poke bank and black 2, I won't have access to most dream world pokes, and not really looking to breed pokemon in black 2, so try to refrain from suggesting things not available in X and Y. With that said, here's my team.

&gt;Venusaur @ venusaurite

&gt;Ability: Chlorophyll

&gt;Nature: Modest

&gt;EV's: HP 252/SpA 252/SpD 4

&gt; -Sludge Bomb

&gt; -Giga Drain

&gt; -Leech Seed

&gt; -Sleep powder/Roar/HP fire

This my all time favorite pokemon, and my first pokemon. I just love his bulk, and his ability to hit hard while regaining HP. HP fire seems like the best thing to dissuade the grass and steel types that wall him, I don't want to breed for hidden powers unless I absolutely have too. Sleep powder would be great, but this team is already status heavy. Still, this is probably my go to option. I've used roar as a way to deal with undesirable match-ups in the past, but I don't have any entry hazards to abuse this time, and I feel it doesn't synergize well with leech seed. I'm also considering giving him a 4/128/128 defensive EV spread instead so he heals more from draining moves, despite the fact he'll take slightly more damage.

&gt; Sableye @ Leftovers

&gt;Ability: Prankster

&gt; Nature: Sassy/Careful

&gt; EV's: HP 252/Def 4/SpD 252

&gt; -Metal burst/Knock off

&gt; -Taunt

&gt; -Will-o-wisp

&gt; -Recover

Pretty standard Sableye, he's here to absorb the psychic attacks for Venusaur, and stop set up sweepers. I want to use metal burst for something out of the ordinary, as I feel this team is pretty cookie cutter as it is, but I worry about his ability to survive hits. Sucker punch and foul play are viable options here as well, but I feel they're situational. Knock off seems like the safest bet, and would not only provide utility, but something to use against psychic and ghost types.

&gt;Rotom-H @ Choice scarf

&gt;Ability: Levitate

&gt;Nature: Timid

&gt;EV's: HP 48/SpA 252/Spe 210

&gt; -Over heat

&gt; -Thunder wave

&gt; -Volt switch

&gt; -trick

I'm pretty confident about the moves on this guy, but not so much the EV's/nature. I feel he's way to fast for a choice scarfer, and should have a modest nature and more points invested in HP instead, especially with the trick/thunder wave combo. Any rotom users who can give me advice on a better spread?

&gt;Alakazam @ Life orb

&gt;Ability: Magic Guard

&gt;Nature: Timid

&gt;EV's: HP 4/SpA 252/Spe 252

&gt; -Psychic/Psyshock

&gt; -Shadow ball

&gt; -Focus blast/Dazzling gleam

&gt; -Energy ball/Charge beam

This guy is fast. Revenge killing and wall breaking material right here. The immunity to hazards and status damage will be nice, since this team lacks a rapid spinner/defogger. I'm kinda at a loss for moves, though. I think charge beam will be nice for extra flying/water coverage and boosting him high enough to secure a OHKO. Dazzling gleam would be good for additional dragon coverage, but focus blast would provide some much needed ice coverage.

&gt;Azumarill @ Choice band

&gt;Ability: Huge Power

&gt;Nature: Adamant

&gt;EV's: HP 252/Atk 252/Spe 4

&gt; -Aqua jet

&gt; -Play rough

&gt; -Superpower

&gt; -Ice punch/Facade

I've heard a lot of good things about Azumarill, figured it's time I give it a try. Ice punch would be good for grass and flying coverage, but I'm really concerned this thing will be a magnet for burns, hence why facade is listed as another choice.

&gt;Gliscor @ Toxic orb

&gt;Ability: Poison heal

&gt;Nature: Impish

&gt;EV's: HP 244/Def 248/Spe 16

&gt; -U-turn/Knock off

&gt; -Protect

&gt; -Toxic

&gt; -Earthquake

For this last slot I wanted a good physical wall, a ground type that can absorb electric attacks, and something to block statuses, and Gliscor fit the bill. I considered assault vest Donphan an mold breaker Excadrill here for rapid spin support, but with prankster taunt and immunity to all entry hazards on my team, I didn't feel it was necessary. I'm leaning towards u-turn over knock off so I can have another pivot, and Sableye can get that anyway. My biggest concern here is if having 4 status moves on my team is to much, there's no way I'm gonna use them all.

So that's the team. Any input is appreciated!",,False,,0,,[HMF] Building my first OU team for Singles.

**Propulsion**

The Chatham Fast Combat Logistics Vessel is powered by the Trivvalian designed SU3R thermal nuclear mobile energy plant. The SU3R is the Trivvalian designation for as Sea Utility reactor, Type Three manufactured by RedEnergy, and is often named as the ‘Suer’ (pronounced ‘Sir’). The Chatham FCSS was intended to keep up with the highly mobile naval task forces which scour the globe. The Chatham class is designed to lodge a single SU3R plant, and powers three RE4400+ propeller turbo-shafts. This configuration was rated at approximately 96MW, or 130’000 shp, and allows more than 36 knots.

The decision by the Thrace design team to use a thermal nuclear plant to power the Chatham was due to the nature of modern fleets and the world which those fleets sail. With the rising cost of fossil fuels, which has been utilised as an energy source for many years, as well as the negative effects of carbon emissions had led to the Thrace team to seek out an alternate energy source. The choice of nuclear energy was almost immediate, with the rapid adoption of nuclear power in other naval vessels, as well as an essentially reliable and plentiful energy solution. Firstly, the Chatham can go more than twenty years without a core replacement. Secondly, in some cases forces can go months without laying eyes on land, and it is a necessity for supply vessels to keep up with fleets which require supplies as they cannot simply dock as resupply. The lighter Chatham vessel has a higher-than-average speed which allows it to break and re-join the formation with ease. 

The RedEnergy Corporation has previously been known for the conversion of military nuclear power plants, mainly naval, for civilian use. In 1964 the SNS Vallen, a Solmian Aircraft Carrier, was damaged heavily in a collision with the smaller HTV Lipzik, a Trivvalian Frigate, during routine operations. Fortunately the reactors weren’t damaged during the collision, and the Carrier, due to be decommissioned in two years, was brought to an early retirement. RedEnergy was already pioneering Trivvalian nuclear technology and leapt at the chance to proceed with the next stage, and by 1966 with the purchase and conversion of the Vallen RedEnergy had its first mobile thermal nuclear station. Due to the nature of the Vallen, with it’s large cargo space and hangers, became an vessel attached to an expeditionary mining group looking for resources in the Ellorean artic. Since then the Vallen has been put in use with dozens of other projects, and is now just the first of twenty-eight floating power plants, with several being moved inland via rivers and canals. The RedEnergy projects have been supported heavily by the Trivvalian government.

Several problems faced by RedEnergy regarding a mobile nuclear power station was regarding what would happen in the event of an incident or accident aboard the vessel. After several years of testing on board the Vallen it was found that a lead-cooled fast reactor would be best, supported by a pressurised water coolant system. In the event of a leakage or incident on the reactor the lead could be cooled rapidly solidifies. However constant input of water would be needed, as the Lead alloy used as a coolant has a very low melting temperature. The SU3R was based off the up-rated reactors used on the Vallen and later mobile stations, and thus is a smaller, lighter version, producing approximately a quarter of what the larger SC#R series of mobile plants.

The thermal power given off from the SU3R reactor will be removed from the primary reactor cooling loop and then circulated to power the Chatham. Thermal energy not used will be circulated out-system through specialised cooling systems and dispersed over a time in an effort to minimise the Chatham’s signature. This thermal energy will be passed through water to create steam to turn the energy plant’s turbines, which will power the Chatham’s electrical and mechanical systems. 

The reactor is located just rear of the central blockhouse which contains the bridge and crew sleeping arrangements. During development it was found that, in the case of a collision such as the Vallen-Lipzig incident, this was the most secure area in the entire ship and would provide the best protection against any impact. Due to the fact that the Chatham is to keep up with combat fleets, the bridge was regarded as the most probable place for any attack, and as such the reactor was located away from any ‘strike’ zones. 


**Electrical Systems**

Being an Auxiliary ship, the Chatham is not equipped with any advanced sensory equipment normally seen on a ship with regular combat roles. However because often it will operate in a combat environment, the Chatham is equipped with a version of the venerable 387 Communications LS/QAI 4 ‘ANTICS’. As many vessels worldwide operate with either Yohannesian or Lyran vessels, with their Quasi-AI Wilhelm and Cromwell systems, 387 Communications has worked with Yohannesian and Lyran development teams to create the ANTICS system. ANTICS by itself a Quasi-AI system but it is also a Patch which operates with all up-to-date Wilhelm and Cromwell systems. ANTICS was created as a bridge between the two systems, enabling countries who operate large numbers of Lyran, Yohannesian and domestic vehicles to not have to worry about issues regarding the inter-operability of any of these ‘quasi-AI’ systems. The version currently in use with the Chatham is the LS/QAI 4M, which not only collects data from the ships radar, facilitate the use of long range communication systems and allow control of the Point-Defense Anti-Air weapons, but also collects tactical information from other ships in the immediate area with either the ANTICS full system, or the ANTICS patch on the Wilhelm or Cromwell AI. The LS/QAI 4M will allow the ship to keep up to date with everything that passes over either net, so that commanders do not have to be concerned about inability to keep up to date with information regarding the battle-space which the ship occupies.

However the LS/QAI 4M is not the only system which the Chatham relies upon, and is equipped with it’s air, surface, air traffic control and target acquisition radar. The main radar, the 387 LS/MAS 44B(U) is an active phased array which is a great improvement on the previous LS/MAS 17 previously used and currently seeing service with vessels across Ellorea. Four of these are installed on the Chatham to provide 360 degree coverage of the surface and air surrounding the ship. Designed for both blue-water and littoral operations, the MAS 44 combines the functions of several old radar systems providing Surface and Aerial search, navigational functionality, and weapons fire control. The MAS 44 operates in a two band functionality, and the single antennae can share both bands. The first ‘Search’ band has the advantage of all-weather durability with a narrow beam search for tracking and high resolution data input, whilst the ‘Combat’ band is used separately to guide missiles to their targets. Previous versions of the MAS, such as the MAS 17, have had trouble with ‘untraditional’ targets – slow moving, or static surface contacts – often found in anti-piracy roles. When in prototype testing with the destroyer HTV Red Droll in anti-piracy roles in the Ellorean Arctic, some high-end warfare capabilities unnecessary for pirate-hunting were able to be temporarily sacrificed in exchange for increased surface search functionality by utilising both bands for searching, however crew members recognised an increased time for weapons to be targeted whilst both bands were on an active search. The Chatham has significantly less warfare capabilities than the Red Droll, and as such the ‘Combat’ band would likely never be utilised, allowing for an almost permanent boost to surface-search capabilities.

###Longstanding Questions!

&gt; Game difficulty: new players get stomped, but past a certain time, the game becomes too easy. No middle ground on difficulty

* Lots of good reports from T4
* Last few events were scaled better for damage
* 2 Updates ago we changed the level curve; we could do it again
* Want to avoid ""Flat Line"" progression

&gt; Update 14?

* Won't be next week, but we're working very hard!

&gt; Are we removing the MK-1 Braton from the new player experience?

* Basic weapon selection for new tutorial!
* ""Beginner"" mod system still planned

&gt; Rewards exclusive to questlines?

* Absolutely! There will be a Kubrow Quest!
* Quests increase your faction standing, guaranteed reward structure, extra Mastery

&gt; What happened to the Corpus Freeze-Ray gun?

* Oh just RENDERS, ANIMS
* The return of the Valley Girl Lotus voice!
* Weapons that compliment the Warframe elements (Ember with Ignis people love it!)

&gt; Shotgun balance?

* Right up there with Sniper Balance! Also with Oberon!
* We will start looking at them once U14 is done, but we've got to get quests done!

&gt; Trinity's ability for team survivability put in question after Suspicious Shipment weapons. Reactive healing impossible to use in high-damage density

* More HUD indicators for player status to help awareness
* We'll look into new solutions after U14!

&gt; Why not replace XP/Cash rewards with boosters?

* Hell, why not? Can we, should we, would we? 
* But we totally agree that sign-in rewards need to be improved
* Next week, we're gonna put a crack in that DE vault! What's a weapon that's in the Vault... maybe we can cycle some of the rewards like the GORGON
* Login Rewards 2.0? :P

&gt; Player ship cosmetics?

* OH FUCK YEAH SHIPS HAVE COLOR CUSTOMIZATION
* It might not launch directly on U14, but it is a feature and it is coming!
* Potential for interior cosmetics. Hula Lotus? Vor Bobblehead? 
* You will see the planet you're orbiting, as well as enemy and player ships, while in your own
* In 14.0, you cannot invite friends into your ship, but it will be added!
* Lobby re-architecture on frontend to be persistent until you choose to leave
* DOCKING Video! The new Liset (scout ship) and larger player Carrier ship (menu hub)!

&gt; Will we be able to dock Lisets to existing dojos?

* Huh, that's kind of cool!
* The Player Ship will definitely not replace the ClanTech in coolness

&gt; Are we going to add Vacuum ability to all Sentinels?

* A few pitfalls, like that we'd need to give Carrier a new power that makes it unique and useful
* It's on the radar; not a huge concern but we will take a look
* There are two ways to solve: we could boost the other Sentinel abilities
* We do expect Kubrow-Mania on U14 though!

&gt; Network/Hosting is horrendous. Void Keys are even worse! Are there any solutions to making networking better?

* NAT punch through solution needs a second look
* Squad existing outside of single player hosting a message. Can switch to favorable host within a party
* Majority of discussions off the livestreams is on retinkering old content and features
* We're reading into other solutions: we saw how Killzone 3 did it, but it has problems of its own. Still researching

&gt; Where is Darvo?

* He's a shady guy, pops up here and there. Will be making a return TO THE MAX!
* ""We recorded dialogue this morning. I said the D word!"" -Rebecca

&gt; Community Event Melee Weapons/Enemy Designs

* We've already shown the Sword n' Board stuff
* We just modeled the Tonfa: Renders, Animation

&gt; Downsizing clan tiers?

* Glen and Steve have been talking about best ways to implement. On the radar!

&gt; Is it possible to have basic Event Statues for all clans who participate?

* Unfortunately no
* ""Glad you're not my dad"" -Twitch chat

&gt; Utility and Warframe damage abilities?

* No balances until U14 launch

&gt; Complete foundation changing of Warframe: adding Mods is a crutch for new content. Effectiveness of weapons is not based on GEAR, but MODS. Why is Warframe a game of DROPS and not SKILL?

* Our beginner mods and mod tiers will help new users scale into the system
* Steve: The Mod system does not devalue skill! The variety of builds that players create is about complimenting playstyle
* In terms of ""essential mods,"" we're hoping that U14 will address that
* The Mods give Warframe its depth. We don't want to do a POE tree with a thousand nodes

&gt; We do talk about bandaid mods though

* True, but that's a small number of mods. We have tradeoff mods
* The biggest flaw the mod system does have is that the power tradeoff is capacity. But Corrupted mods are beginning to change that, and we're thinking of continuing that path

&gt; We've seen out-of-game UI stuff. What about in-game UI stuff? Endgame mission stats?

* It is definitely changing! It's not done yet
* It will change to show you everything you got. 
* Working on mid-mission access to collected drops

&gt; Marketplace Plat cost readjustment?

* Costs seem alright for now

&gt; Corpus and Grineer weapons are being created, but why aren't they using it? Random weapon wielding?

* New units and AI are usually designed with sepcific weapons in mind
* However, we could tie a certain SET of weapons to units (Leaders?)

&gt; Why not disable unlocking for nodes you don't have adjacency to? If you get taxi'd to Pluto, your account won't unlock the mission

* Taxi unlocking will be disabled for U14. You can still be invited to missions outside your unlocked system, but post-lobby you will not be able to enter until unlocked
*Other small features; menu support for small features right after U14 (14.1) 

&gt; Likelihood to player studios; player created items selling for Plat (like Steam Workshop?)

* We're actually making a weapon skin contest soon!
* We read how the Steam workshop selling works, and it's super involved with legal stuff, and we want to avoid that craziness
* But we absolutely want to find a way to put player content in easily

&gt; Will we ever be able to fight UNARMED, or DISARMING enemies for temporary weapons?

* Not sure how often being unarmed would come up in context of the game
* Also, enemy scaling might not support that at this time
* To make some enemies imposing; we sort of cheat with the scaling for certain enemy types
* Goes back to an earlier question: once we look at enemy scaling and balance, it will open new opportunities for this system

&gt; Will freerunning be expanded upon? Community suggestion's been insane!

* Control complexity need to be discussed
* Art sets are not designed with those systems in mind, we'd have to redo a lot of tiles
* We should however polish up existing animations
* New animations maybe? Even flatter slide animation?
* After August and Gamescom
* Knockdown recovery skill input vs. mod improvement? 

&gt; Dark Sectors in U14?

* Getting a new gamemode and improvements for conflicts

&gt; Cert, time of update, experience with Rainbow Bridge

* Trust us, we hate the disparity between PC and PS4 builds
* New plan: we put advance content onto PS4, withhold it until event starts, then unlock that content on PS4 servers and launch PC update at the same time. Consecutive events!?

&gt; PC/PS4 transfer? 

* Planned for U14-ish!

&gt; Tethra's Doom mods being added back to the game? Other content stuff?

* Sure! 
* Wyrm Prime weapon will be added too

&gt; For a lack of new Warframe content, here's something else:

* VIDEO

Hello once again r/PokemonGiveaway!

I don't know if you remember me/ know me/ whatever, but I've been co-hosting quite a number of cloned shiny pokemon giveaways. Shiny pokemon aren't the only thing I'm collecting, I'm also collecting bankball pokemon.

I play pokemon with my little brother, who recently created a reddit account /u/VeridescentGreen after finding out you could get *free pokemon* on this subreddit. &gt;_&gt; However, I won't allow him to request for any pokemon, especially shiny ones, from giveaways without first hosting his own giveaway.

Therefore, I want to gauge the interest levels in the following pokemon scheduled to be given out next week in a ""Fish and Chimps"" theme giveaway co-hosted with my little brother if the interest levels are high enough:

#####Fish (I will be giving these out):

* Finneon - HA Water Veil - Dream ball - 4EM
* Feebas - HA Adaptability - Dream ball - 4EM
* Carvanha - HA Speed Boost - Dream ball - 4EM

###### Chimps (my brother will be giving these out):

* Slakoth [Bankball not yet found]
* Chimchar - HA Iron Fist - Poke ball - (currently) 2 EM


####Would you guys like to the above pokemon if a giveaway was hosted? 
###What other fish or chimp pokemon would you like to see?

I will be checking back this thread tomorrow. Goodnight people! I hope you guys can give me a concrete gauge on interest levels :)

P.S Also, I'd really appreciate if anyone with a bankball Slakoth can contact me to set up a trade :)

,LoLChampConcepts,"**_____, The Caustic Miasma**

I'm bad with names! Hey everyone, help me decide on a name for this champion, because I couldn't come up with anything good enough.

Gameplay wise, he is an offtank melee support with a lot of debuffing abilities- he slows, blinds, reduces armor, and has what is essentially a channeled, amped up Wither for an ult. His E has an active and a passive- the active acts like an ally target cleanse, and the passive gives him health regeneration the more debuffs he has on nearby enemy champions. The MAX HEALTH REGEN is just calculating what his health-per-5 would be if he had every possible debuff applied to the entire enemy team.

Keep in mind I have no real experience with designing this sort of thing, so he's probably going to be SUPER unbalanced, numbers are going to be all over the place, I apologize. I don't know what I'm doing.


+--------------------------------------------------+


**APPEARANCE**

I am unfortunately also not an artist. The Caustic Miasma here is a non-organic being consisting of a hextech device made of magic infused materials, surrounded by a humanoid cloud of corrosive gasses and chemicals. Think of him as being made of smog, with floating machine bits (especially around his torso) to spice it up. The cloud is dark grey, but the hextech can be any combination of colors.


+--------------------------------------------------+


**LORE**


&gt; The city-state of Zaun is known as a haven of freedom, a hive of commerce and technological discoveries. Many of Valoran's greatest advancements in hextech engineering and magical experimentation were made there. This freedom comes with a price, however, one that the inhabitants of Zaun choose to ignore.

&gt; Across the bay from Zaun lies it's rival city of progress, Piltover. As different in morality as they are equal in ambition, the inhabitants of Piltover strive to make the world a better place through technology. One such researcher had noticed that a dense, choking smog- a byproduct of Zaun's productions which had long been contained to the city- had begun to creep closer and closer to the idyllic Piltover. Determined to keep his city from being plagued by this noxious fog, he moved to Zaun in order to learn a way to get rid of the smog.

&gt; Over several months the researcher tried and dismissed many possible methods, but finally he found one that held hope. Using samples of magic-infused metals, he created a device that would feed on pollutants in the air, sucking them up like a vacuum. Emboldened by his success, he returned to Piltover and went to work creating a full size machine to deploy in the city, removing any of the smog that might drift in. But in his haste, he had not fully discovered how the strange metal worked, and upon completing his machine he found that once it had collected enough of the smog, it came to life. Seemingly powered by whatever magic and chemicals had made up the gasses, the techmaturgical being began searching for more of it's fuel source, destroying the researcher's laboratory in the process. Not satisfied with the amount of smog in Piltover, it left for Zaun to feed it's growing appetite.

&gt; Once there, the rich and curious of Zaun began trying to seize this being for their own, convinced that it's power could be useful to them. But no matter how much they tried, none of them could seem to capture it, as it carved a path through the city, consuming stores of potions, chemicals and rare elements. Finally, the Institute of War stepped in and managed to communicate to it a message- ""Come fight for us, and we will provide you with all the food you could ever want.""


+--------------------------------------------------+


* **Passive** - Acidic Fumes
&gt; All enemy units near ___ have their armor reduced by 5%, stacking every 2 /1.5 / 1 seconds up to a cap of 10% / 20% / 30%. (Increases at levels 6 and 12)


* **Q - Gas Leak** [ COST: 90 ] [ COOLDOWN: 16 ]
&gt; ____ builds up explosive gasses inside of himself, gaining increased movement speed every half second for 7 seconds. After 7 seconds or upon recasting, the gasses explode outward, dealing magic damage and slowing surrounding enemies within 300 range for 3 seconds. The damage and slow are completely effective after the full 7 seconds have passed- for every half second it is cast early, they are 5% less effective.
&gt; [ MOVE SPEED: 5% ] [ MAX MOVE SPEED: 70% ] [ MAGIC DAMAGE: 80 / 135 / 190 / 245 / 300 (+ 60% AP) ] [SLOW: 45% / 50% / 55% / 60% / 65% ]


* **W - Siphon** [ COST: 70 MANA ] [ COOLDOWN: 22 / 21 / 20 / 19 / 18]
&gt; **Passive:** ____ feeds off of pollution, gaining health regeneration for every debuff he has inflicted on nearby enemy champions. The effect lasts an extra second after the champion in question is out of range.
&gt; [ HEALTH REGEN: 6 / 6.5 / 7 / 7.5 / 8 ] [ MAX HEALTH REGEN: 252 / 273 / 294 / 315 / 336 ]
&gt; **Active:** ____ removes all debuffs on a target ally champion and reduces the effect of incoming slows on them by 50% for the next 3 seconds.


* **E - Blinding Cloud** [ COST: 50 / 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 / 100 MANA ] [ COOLDOWN: 12 ]
&gt; ____ emits a cloud of thick smoke around himself at 600 range for 5 seconds, dealing magic damage every second. If an enemy remains in the cloud for long enough they are blinded for 3 seconds.
&gt; [ MAGIC DAMAGE: 20 / 35 / 50 / 65 / 80 (+ 15% AP) ] [MAX MAGIC DAMAGE: 100 / 175 / 250 / 325 / 400 (+75% AP) ] [SECONDS UNTIL BLIND: 2.5 / 2.25 / 2 / 1.75 / 1.5 ]


* **R - Asphyxiate** [ COST: 100 MANA ] [ COOLDOWN: 110 / 100 / 90 ]
&gt; ____ smothers a target enemy champion for 6 seconds, becoming invulnerable and untargetable for the duration. While ____ remains attached to the target, they take magic damage every half second and have their movement and attack speeds reduced dramatically. When the effect ends, either manually by recasting, or naturally, ____ reappears behind the target. (Is effected by Tenacity, Cleanse, Quicksilver, Remove Scurvy, ect.)
&gt; [ MAGIC DAMAGE: 50 / 65 / 80 (+25% AP) ] [ SLOW: 70% / 80% / 90% ] [ ATTACK SPEED SLOW: 50% / 60% / 70% ]


+--------------------------------------------------+


**ABILITY DISCUSSION**


* Acidic Fumes
&gt; This is kind of my least favorite part of his kit, but I wanted it to be there to help proc the passive on his W. Since simply being near an enemy will give them stacks of Acidic Fumes, this will automatically give him the health regen, and the longer he stays near them, the more health regen he gets. Also armor reduction is good for supporting.


* Gas Leak
&gt; I wanted to give him some form of chasing ability, otherwise his various debuffing and such would be useless. So giving him a speed up that doubled as his slow sounded like a good way to go, so I turned him into a time bomb- get faster and faster and faster so you can chase them before exploding to slow them. But in order to get the most out of it, you need to let the wind up be the full duration- blowing up early makes it less good, so proper planning makes you a better player of him.


* Siphon
&gt; Can I just say, this is my favorite part of his kit by far. I love the idea of a support essentially having a cleanse that they can use on their carry to save them. Buuut I didn't want it to be too op, so the cooldown is fairly long. The passive effect on it turns off when it's on CD, so using it too soon in a teamfight might handicap you by removing part of your tankiness.


* Blinding Cloud
&gt; I think this one allows for a lot of play and counterplay- the damage it does isn't fun, but it's not all that big of a deal- the real fear is staying in it long enough for the blind to proc. A skilled enemy player will be able to keep out of it long enough to keep them from getting blinded, but he could use this to his advantage as well by forcing them to back off. I also think players who are facing him should see a little UI thing above their champion that shows how long until they get blinded (kind of like the nautilus or yasuo icon).


* Asphyxiate
&gt; In case it wasn't clear, it has the effect of Wither on steroids (slows, reduces attack speed, also does magic damage), but it has to be channeled by him the whole time (meaning he can end it early if he wants to). While he's channeling it, he is 'attached' to whoever he used it on, being untargetable, kind of like Yi's Alpha Strike. I wanted this to be a heavily support based ult, essentially shutting down an enemy ad carry, or locking any fleet footed enemy in place long enough for your team to pick them off. The long duration I feel makes up for the fact that it's soft cc (albiet very hard soft cc) and only effects one enemy.


+--------------------------------------------------+


* Gameplay and build paths


As primarily a support, he could easily start with a Relic Shield or an Ancient coin, where he and his team would benefit from them greatly. Tanky items like Aegis of the Legion and Frozen Heart would do well, with them benefiting from sticking in the middle of teamfights. Iceborn Gauntlet would also help him chase people for his team, with Gas Leak already giving him a speed boost followed by a slow- this would just give him another slow to keep them from getting away. Since he scales decently with AP, some mage items wouldn't go awry either- I could easily see Zhonya's being a good pick on him, allowing him to keep himself safe after his ult finishes, in case he didn't build very tanky. Spirit Visage would be an essential pick on him, as it would boost his health regeneration passive even more to make him survive that much longer in fights.


He could also play in the toplane as a bruiser, with his passive reducing enemy armor, his Q providing bonus damage and a slow without interrupting his attacks, his W giving him health regeneration and his E providing a blind against those pesky AA champs (looking at you Jax). Jungling could also work, as his ganks would be great pre-and-post 6, although I'm not as confident in his clearing (since his W passive only procs on champions). The only place he wouldn't fare so well is against mages and heavy casters, as all his CC consists of shutting down AA heavy champions- leBlanc would just ignore his blind and slow and burst him down.


He's a bit of an all in champ when he has teammates nearby to capitalize on it, but he's much less useful by himself. His Siphon would make him a literal lifesaver in any duo lane, and his W passive gives him sustain every time he goes in, as counterproductive as that might sound.

,Jokes,"Once there was a boy named Zach. Zach was born into a very poor family. They didn't have much money for new clothes or video games or internet access, so Zach had to get his entertainment by joining a club at his high school, where he was just beginning his freshman year. He'd been a rec diver in middle school, so he thought he might enjoy putting on a little muscle by joining the swim team. There were only ten or so people on the JV team so he made it easily, despite his inexperience. He came to practice after school everyday and worked out as hard as he could before going to work for his family's survival, because he believed in going all out in everything he did. He was no shining star at first, but over time, he came to be the fastest swimmer on the team. Coach did not fail to notice this, and promoted him to the varsity team (much to the dismay of the seniors onboard).

In the meantime, he wore the same gray swimsuit everyday, and he never did anything but school, swim, work, chores, sleep. His mother gave birth to a little brother in October just a month before the county tournament.

Unfortunately, they can't make it to his meet that day. He's up on the blocks and ready to go. They blow the whistle and he's off. . .swimming. . .faster and faster. . .there's only one guy keeping with him at the flip-turn. He floors it back, but oh! he gets a cramp at the last moment. Nonetheless, he snags second place and a new Personal Record.

After the race, Coach comes up behind him and wraps his towel around him and slaps him on the shoulder.

""You made second! You know what this means don't you! You're going to state!""

""Wow! Really?"" he replies.

""Yes, but there's one thing. You need to bring $50 by the first day of December to pay for registration.""

""Oh, I don't know about that, Coach,"" he says, questioningly, eyes downcast, ""we aren't exactly the richest folk in the world.""

""Oh, come on man, it's just $50. I'm sure your dad will give it to you if you ask really nicely. And if you can't come up with it all, I'll give you a few bucks just to get to see you swim like that again!""

""Oh, thanks Coach. I'll ask him.""

So he goes home to his dad, who just happens to be in his chair making calls.

""Dad, guess what!"" he begins.

""What, son?""

""I made second place in the county meet!""

""That's great! I wish I could swim like that! I guess that means you get to go to state?""

""It sure does. . . ,"" and he sighs, ""but I need fifty dollars for registration. . .""

""Oh, no worries, son, we want to see you succeed. I'm sure we can scrape it together. . . .""

"". . .by next week.""

""Well, there are going to be hardships, but we can do it.""

So they cut back on food, stopped going to the movies, and had a small yard sale, and within the week they had fifty dollars. Zach went in to see Coach with the money.

""Well, Coach, we had to go through so many hardships last week, skipping lunches and working overtime, but I got the fifty dollars. We're going to state!""

Of course, the baby got a rare early case of colic and once again the family could not attend the meet. He rode in Coach's car to the state capital, receiving a pep talk the whole way.

So Zach is up on the blocks again. He's focused better than ever. The buzzer sounds and he's in the Zone before he even hits the water. He's flying faster than ever before. He flip-turns a full second before anyone in any of the lanes. He maintains his second all the way back to the starting end, and drags himself, thoroughly exhausted out of the pool.

His eyes are still apparently swimming because he is not sure why Coach is congratulating him at first.

"". . .not only first place, but a new School Record! You're the best swimmer our school has ever had! You're going to the semi-finals! You're going to Regionals!""

"". . .! WOOHOO!""

""And you're going to get a brand new swimsuit with your name on it and a towel with the school mascot. Just bring $200 with you to school next. . .""

""Wait a minute, Coach!"" he interjects, ""two. . .HUNDRED. . .American dollars? Did I not tell you about my situation before this meet?""

""Yes, well, you have to get it for the hotel and registration. I'm sure you are your dad can work something out. I know you want this, and I want it for you, for our school, as much as you. You're the best we've ever had. You have to try.""

""Okay, Coach, it's going to be hard, but I'll try!""

So Zach goes home to his dear old dad the news.

""Dad, I got first place at state and I broke the school record on lap time!""

""That's great, son! So, you're going to Regional?""

""Yes. . .well. . .if we can get $200 by the end of the month.""

""Well, we are behind you 100%, son, but there are going to be hardships. You'll have to throw in with us to get you there.""

So Dad starts working another job at night, and Mom uses the last of their foodstamps on a month's supply of Infamil and peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches. They take out a second mortgage on the house, and Zach and his sister spend every hour at home baby-sitting, while the other is out working.

Somehow, they manage to stay afloat the whole month, and get the $200, so Zach, worked completely to the bone and worn slap out but still as determined as ever returned to Coach with the cash.

""Well, Coach, the hardships I and my family went through were nigh on unbearable this time, but I got the $200 for the Regional meet. Let's get this show on the road.""

Zach's family had to stay at home working to keep themselves alive, while Zach drove with Coach to the next state. He did nothing but stretch in his hotel room the night before so he would be at the top of his game in the morning. His mom called three times worrying about him, once in the middle of the night. ""The baby woke me up-we're running out of Infamil,"" she claimed.

The next morning, Zach stood on the blocks poised for the dive. He knew he would win before the buzzer even sounded. He wouldn't admit it to himself, but he knew. He made it down and back in under 20 seconds, but Zach was standing with a towel around his shoulders accepting his gold medal before he even realized he'd left the platform. Coach woke him up with an open-handed blow to the back.

""You won, son! You're in the Finals! You're going to Junior Nationals!""

""How much is it this time?""

""Oh, just a little old thousand dollars, and that's because the rest of the team, and the boosters, and I, are providing the other thousand. We really want you to win this one. Do you think you can manage it?""

""Well, we've been through a lot of hardships already. I suppose I'm getting accustomed to it. I'll try Coach. I won't let you down if I can help it!"" Zach replied

""Yeah, you're worth the investment, kid. Good luck!""

So Zach went before his Dad again, between his 3PM-11PM and 12AM-8AM job shifts, and told him the news. Dad of course, was expecting the mood damper this time:

""Congratulations! Great Job, son! I knew you'd do us proud! How much is it for Nationals?""

""A thou."" 

""SHIT*! *ahem* I mean. . .we're behind you still, son. I know we can work it out.""

They cut the baby down to one Infamil a day. They were all too busy working all night to hear its endless bawling anyway. Sis picked up another job. Zach picked up a paper route, but was exempted from afternoon work so he could train. Dad continued working his three jobs, but they to put Ma out streetwalking betweens shifts to make ends meet. They were all malnourished, and still insisted that Zach take extra portions. They began renting out the attic to anyone who could do without breakfast. If ever any family faced hardships, it was this one.

But they got the grand.

He goes to Coach. ""Coach, I got the money. We're going to Alaska!""

Don't ask who's idea it was to have the thing in Alaska.

Well, of course, the thing was televised. Mainly as a human interest story about Zach. Zach's family took the night of the competition off to watch Zach swim. . .on their neighbor's television, of course, because they had sold theirs when their cable got cut off.

Before he went up on the blocks, he got to talk to the news reporter.

""I know you've heard what kind of hardships I've been through to get here,"" he proclaimed, ""but I'm just happy to have such support and to get a chance to swim. I'd like to thank my family, if they're watching. I love you guys. We shared these hardships, and, should I win, the victory will be all of ours!""

How very touching. His family cheered.

Out of the blocks Zach flew at the buzzer. A kid who had been swimming since he fell out of the womb was in the next lane, and kept right next to him the whole. He even pulled ahead a few times, but not only did he lack the sheer determination Zach, he also lacked the streamlining several months of near-starvation can give you. Zach won by three tenths of a second, snagging the gold once again.

After the race, and before the awards presentation, Coach wrapped Zach up and steered him toward a man in a business suit.

""Hi Zach. I'm as touched by your story as any, but I'm more impressed with your skill as a swimmer. I'm with the US Olympic Team. We want you to swim for Team USA in the Olympic Games in Africa next summer.""

""Well, sure, but. . .how much will it cost?""

""Haha, don't you know anything about the Olympics, man?""

""What?""

""You ain't gotta pay a dime.""

Zach collected his medal and went home. A mob of students in his school cafeteria carried him around on their shoulders until concerned administrators broke it up. He was proclaimed a hero in his town, and even got some obscure resolution passed about him in the state legislature. Wasn't worth the paper it was printed on, of course, but his family didn't hesitate to frame it. They also received plenty of what was worth more than the paper it was printed on. Cold hard cash, always enclosed with Zach's fan mail.

While the money covered most of their recently accrued debts, they never forgot their time of need and continued to live frugally. They were completely accustomed to hardships. Zach didn't fail to mention this when he boarded the yacht Team USA purchased to party their way across to Africa during that Olympic summer.

""You all know what hardships I've been through, but I hope you can overlook that. Also, I hope the ladies and the bartenders on this boat can overlook the fact that I'm still a sophomore in high school.""

Well, the party began immediately, and when the drinking and the sex got old, the Olympians sought out a little friendly competition between them to entertain themselves. They were only a couple of days from shore, and fairly restless to pick up their last-minute training.

So one night, they were all sitting around a table with their beers. Yes, Zach too, but the guys swore not to tell his parents. One guy turns to the guy next to him.

""Hey Joe, you're on the track team right?""

""Yeah, man, I'm a sprinter.""

""Aw, really, lemme see you run?""

Another piped up, ""Yeah, I wanna see this too, Joe!""

So Joe took a lap around the deck in just under 15 fifteen seconds-Zach was timing. He almost knocked a waiter over the side as he sped past.

""That's amazing, Joe!""

""I've never seen anyone run that fast in my life!""

Zach was speechless.

He stopped in front of his challenger and caught his breath. ""Lar, I don't know how you Field guys spend your time, but I've seen you out there, throwing your disc-thing. Give this boy here a show of your own.""

""Sure give me a discus.""

Joe grabbed a dinner plate and tossed it to Larry.

""Stand back, kid""

He wound up and flung the plate almost to the horizon, where it exploded before hitting the water.

Everyone looked up to the Sun Deck where Barney, a pentathlete, was just lowering his rifle.

""Nice toss, Lar!"" He shouted down, ""Welcome to come toss birds at my ranch any time!""

""Nice shootin' yourself, Barn!""

They all proceeded to pat one another on the back, and return to their table, when Steve joined them. Larry grabbed him and addressed the rest of the table.

""Ya'll know my teammate, Steve, here. Best javelin man in the western hemisphere, he is.""

""Give us a demo, man,"" said Joe.

""Ain't got a javelin.""

Joe grabbed a midget that was walking by.

""Throw this,"" he said, handing over the midget. ""Not because it's short, but because it's French.""

So Steve went to the rail and drew back and heaved the midget screaming as far as it would go. There was a tiny splash on the horizon. There was no sound by the last of the screams on the wind. Everyone was speechless. Moments later, the cheers began.

""I ain't never seen a toss like that in my life!"" Barney said, ""We're sure to win, this year!""

Then they turned to Zach. ""Hey kid. You're a swimmer, right? You gonna put us all to shame?""

""Where do you expect me to swim?"" Zach replied. ""I'm not going in the water with all those sharks, and the swimming pool is only 10 feet wide.""

They all nodded and scratched their heads. ""Well, you gotta show us something!""

""Well, I did used to do a bit of diving in my younger years. I could dive for you.""

""Well, I suppose that would work,"" Steve said.

So Zach climbed onto the diving board of the deck pool, ran to the end, and turned a flip into a perfect dive. He didn't make but a tiny splash.

The guys were unimpressed.

""Well, I guess that was okay. But I think I could do the same. . . ,"" Barney put in.

""Well, tell you what. What if I climbed to the next deck, and dived off that railing. Would you see that?"" Zach countered.

""I'll buy that for a dollar,"" a member of the gathering crowd stated simply.

Zach climbed the stairs to the next deck and pulled himself to the other side of the railing. He dived off backwards, moving ten feet backwards and landing dead center of the pool in a perfect swan dive.

Some started to applaud, until a member of the diving team shouted, ""I learned that freshman year of high school."" He then climbed up and repeated the stunt, adding a backflip for good measure.

""Well, he never said he was a diver,"" Steve said helpfully.

""I don't need your help,"" Zach retorted, and without another word began climbing up three decks onto the radar tower. He stood there fifty feet above and twenty feet behind the pool, lifting one foot and then the other as the radar device turned. He worked up the courage, ignoring the worried shouts from below. Not even hearing them. He took three steps and ran off the edge of the tower. He wrapped his arms around himself, crossed his legs, then bent and twisted. He turned 720 degrees and two full flips before spreading out into swan form and landing head first *SMACK* in the center of the deck, five feet behind the edge of the pool.

He went out in an instant and lay there limp as a ragdoll. The crowd rushed to his side. Someone called some paramedics from the African coast. The moment the helicopter was landing on the deck, Zach was just standing up, with a few helping hands. He had a huge bruise on his forehead and he was a bit woozy, but he could talk. The paramedics ran over, grabbed him away, and laid him on a stretcher to take away in case of concussion. He didn't let them get the buckles down before he stood up again.

""I feel fine, guys."" He held himself erect and walked a straight line back to the crowd.

So Steve just had to pipe up, ""What are you doing, boy? You almost died!""

""I'm alright,"" said Zach. ""I told you. . .

,AssassinOrder,"Today is my, first of many, training sessions with Thomas. 

I wake up in my new home, the assassins’ den under central park. I roll over to the other side of the bed and check my phone. 

“It’s eight fourteen am, I haven’t been up this early in awhile.” I think to myself. 

I stand up, stretching my arms and legs. I head to the bathroom, trying to make myself look neat and clean. As I look at myself in the mirror, I remember talking to Thomas, a mentor at the den. He said that, “If I need any training, stop by the gym and I could help you out.”  

“I think I might need to do that,” I say, while trying to flex with what little muscles I have. 

I’m not out of shape, but if I’m going to be an assassin I need to train pretty damn hard. I walk out of my room and head down the hall to the gym, I get lost along the way, but thankfully Rowan showed me around yesterday, so I got a feel to where the gym is. I get to the gym, with the door closed, I open the doors and the sound of the door opening echos through the room. I see Thomas yelling at a bunch of other trainees, who are climbing a wall. 

I walk up to Thomas. 

""Hey, remember me?"" I say jokingly 

He turns around, a smile crawling on his face when he sees me. 

""Ah great, Rowan I'm glad you came."" He says with a smile. 

""Well I thought it would be for the best. Since I'm going to be an assassin, why not train as one."" I say confidently. 

""Yes, very good. The road to becoming an Assassin is going to a grueling and dangerous, and I am not about to make it easier for you. Are you ready to travel down that road?"" He says, in an obvious attempt to scare me. 

""Yes...yes I am. Let's start training."" I say confidently

""Ok, but first introduce yourself to the class."" He says. 

""Oh ok."" I look around and there's about five other trainees I never met before. ""Hi everyone, I'm Rowan Prayer.""

They all give a collective, ""Hello."" 

I moved in to the line, as Thomas paced in front of the group.

""Before we start, I’m going to time you on how fast you can get over the wall. Its not a big deal if it takes you some time to get over it, it’s more of a mental boost so you can get better and beat your previous time. You'll be going up against the other trainees as well, and the one who scores the fastest time gets to go shower early."" He says with a smirk. 

“Ok” I say nervously.

I get closer to the wall, grabbing the rope and getting ready to climb. I look to my right and see the trainee I’m going up against, It’s a woman about the same age as I am, but seems to be in better shape than I am. 

“Ok on the count of three, we’ll start” He says.

“One...Two...Three. Go” 

I start to climb the rope, with my feet on the wall. I struggle with gripping the rope right, but I make it to the top. 

“Fifty, fifty two, that’s your time kid.” He says.

“Damn, is that bad?” I say while sitting in top of the wall. 

“As something to work your way up from, no. I expect better from you, though. Do it again.” He says.

I don’t say anything, I get back to the front of the wall and on his call, I race against a different trainee, a man a little older than I, and in better shape. I race up the wall. I get a better grip on the rope and plant my feet firmly on the wall. I get up the wall faster, than my last attempt. 

“Forty, fifty six. You’re getting there kid.” He says confidently 

I nod my head, before jumping back down and getting ready to go again. I get ready to climb again, I do the same routine, grab the rope tight and plant my feet on the wall and go as fast as I can. I get to the top and wait for my time. 

“Fifty straight kid.” He says

“Damn thats worse than last time.” I say in frustration, pounding my fist on the top of the wall. 

“Are you feeling disappointed in yourself?"" He turns to me, overhearing my comment. ""Use that disappointment to motivate yourself, now again!"" He says as he puts me in front of another trainee. 

I jump down and climb the rope on more time. I run the same routine. I get to the time and wait. 

“Forty, fifty. You’re getting better.” He says confidently. 

I just nod, I’m too tired to say anything. My upper body aches from the climbing. 

“You all look tired. Good! Lets keep going until you break."" He says sadistically, a sinister smile playing on his face. ""No-one leaves until they beat my time in going up the wall or can't climb up it anymore."" 

I give him a weird look as he walks a bit from the wall. Pulling a sprint, he runs a bit up the wall before grabbing the rope, almost running up the wall. Despite the size of the wall, he got up in a mind-blowing 11 seconds.

“Ah ok…” I say scared, as he climbs back down.

---

I push myself harder and harder. Constantly climbing the wall and jumping back down. 

""What does all of this accomplish?"" I ask tired. 

""I normally don't explain, but I'll give you a short explanation behind it. If you're looking to do field work, you need to be able to do things fast. My training is meant to get you to do this."" He calmly explains, before sending me up the wall again. 

I continue to climb, until I reach my limit. I collapse on the floor when I arrive back down, an hour of wall climbing exhausting me. Thomas walks over to me concerned, but the other trainees look at me, tired but not as exhausted as I am. 

""Hey, you alright?"" He says concerned. 

I nod, trying to find enough oxygen to talk. 

""Yea...I'm..good."" I say struggling to talk. 

""Sure you are. Take a breather, grab a towel from your room to wipe off the sweat, we'll move on to combat drills a bit later."" He says with a smile. ""I want you back here in less than five minutes!""

I nod and stand up, heading out the door, back to my room “I haven’t worked out that hard, ever. I’m sure its going to get worse as time goes by, but its going to worth it.” I think to myself as I run back to my room.

**Gameplay Balance:**

""Hi everyone, my name is Chris Fox and I’m the lead gameplay designer on Garden Warfare. For Tactical Taco Party Pack, we’ve made our biggest set of balance changes and gameplay fixes since launch. We’re constantly reading your comments and suggestions, and taking them into consideration. If you ever want to feedback to me directly, please feel free to get in touch on Twitter (@cjopant). Thanks and enjoy!""

**All-Star:**

- We’ve made a couple tweaks to the Rugby All-Star’s weapon upgrades. With the “Longer Lasting Rugby Supply” upgrade equipped, you would very rarely overheat his gun. This has been tuned back to be more in line with the other All-Star variants. We’ve also increased the damage multiplier on the “Scrum Tested Rugby Balls”. Previously, you would only be able to see the benefits of the upgrade at extremely close range. The new tuning makes the upgraded weapon more useful at any range.

- The Long Bomb’s explosion radius has been reduced. The ease at which you could fire it into a crowded garden, and rack up multiple vanquishes made it a dominating ability. This will still be a viable strategy, but more precise aiming will be required. · We’ve also slightly decreased the damage on the Ultra Tackle. It’s still very powerful, but it’s no longer a one-hit vanquish on Plants with 100 health.

**Cactus:**

- The Power Cactus’ rate of fire has been increased. Though her electric attacks are great at dealing with groups of zombies in Garden Ops, she wasn’t as effective in competitive play as we’d like.

- On the other hand, the Fire Cactus was a bit too effective in competitive play. Her rate of fire has been slightly decreased to compensate.

- We’ve also made some slight reductions to the damage and rate of fire on the Camo Cactus. We intended for her to be powerful in the hands of skilled players, and she definitely still is, but now her performance is more in line with the rest of the Cactus variants.

**Chomper:**

- The Electric and Toxic Chompers have both received slight increases to their base damage output. We’ve also increased the time to overheat on both weapons. Like the Cactus changes, these were made primarily to bring them closer to the rest of the Chompers in terms of effectiveness across all game modes.
Doom Shoom: · Based on a ton of feedback, we’ve added a delay to the Doom Shroom’s attack. This includes a new jump animation, visual effects and audio that play when you walk into his attack range. When you see him jump out of his pot, you now have enough time to safely walk out of his explosion radius. No more instant vaporization when walking around a corner.

**Engineer:**

- We’ve reduced the explosion radius on the Plumber’s weapon. This is another oft-requested change, and rightfully so. The Plumber is still one of the stronger Engineer variants, but it’s no longer as dominating.
Pea Shooter:

- We fixed an issue where you could accidently exit Hyper mode by pressing the button twice on activation. Now, once you activate it, there’s a small delay before an additional input can be accepted on that button.

- We’ve also increased the mass of the Sombrero Bean Bomb. This eliminates scenarios in which the Bomb could be kicked away by a horde of Browncoats.

- The Ice Pea Shooter’s freezing rate has been increased. Previously, it was very difficult to successfully freeze a target without vanquishing them in the process.

- The Toxic Pea Shooter’s base impact damage has been slightly reduced. When his impact, explosion and toxic damage were combined, we found him to be slightly overpowered when compared to the rest of the Pea Shooters.

**Scientist:**

We’ve remedied a few issues with the Scientist’s Energy Warp ability:

- It can no longer be interrupted by The Chomper’s Spikeweeds.

- It is no longer vulnerable to The Goop Shroom’s attacks.

- Like the Engineer’s Jackhammer, and the Pea Shooter’s Hyper mode, it can now be prematurely exited by pressing its activation button.

- The Chemist has seen a reduction to the size of his close-range damage area, as well as his clip capacity. The damage and weapon behavior remain the same, but in close-range situations, more accurate aiming is now required.

- We’ve also reduced the damage of the default Scientist’s projectile. When combined with his close-range damage area, it was more powerful than intended.
Soldier:

- We’ve found that the Camo Ranger was consistently dominating matchups it shouldn’t be, especially against certain Cactus variants. To compensate, we’ve reduced his rate of fire while increasing per shot recoil. We feel that this makes the Camo Ranger/Cactus matchup more balanced.

- Much like the Ice Pea Shooter, we’ve increased the Ice Trooper’s freezing rate. It’s now much easier to freeze a Plant without vanquishing them.

**Sunflower:**

- The Sun Pharaoh’s rapid-fire exploit has been fixed. Big thanks to all of you who reported this one.

- The base Sunflower, Power Flower and Fire Sunflower have all received damage boosts. These three Sunflowers were consistently performing poorer than intended in one-on-one matchups. This should help alleviate the issue.

·         We’ve also slightly decreased the damage on the Ultra Tackle. It’s still very powerful, but it’s no longer a one-hit vanquish on Plants with 100 health.

* Cactus:

·         The Power Cactus’ rate of fire has been increased. Though her electric attacks are great at dealing with groups of zombies in Garden Ops, she wasn’t as effective in competitive play as we’d like.

·         On the other hand, the Fire Cactus was a bit too effective in competitive play. Her rate of fire has been slightly decreased to compensate.

·         We’ve also made some slight reductions to the damage and rate of fire on the Camo Cactus. We intended for her to be powerful in the hands of skilled players, and she definitely still is, but now her performance is more in line with the rest of the Cactus variants.

* Chomper:

·         The Electric and Toxic Chompers have both received slight increases to their base damage output. We’ve also increased the time to overheat on both weapons. Like the Cactus changes, these were made primarily to bring them closer to the rest of the Chompers in terms of effectiveness across all game modes.

Doom Shoom:
·         Based on a ton of feedback, we’ve added a delay to the Doom Shroom’s attack. This includes a new jump animation, visual effects and audio that play when you walk into his attack range. When you see him jump out of his pot, you now have enough time to safely walk out of his explosion radius. No more instant vaporization when walking around a corner.

* Engineer:

·         We’ve reduced the explosion radius on the Plumber’s weapon. This is another oft-requested change, and rightfully so. The Plumber is still one of the stronger Engineer variants, but it’s no longer as dominating.

* Pea Shooter:

·         We fixed an issue where you could accidently exit Hyper mode by pressing the button twice on activation. Now, once you activate it, there’s a small delay before an additional input can be accepted on that button.

·         We’ve also increased the mass of the Sombrero Bean Bomb. This eliminates scenarios in which the Bomb could be kicked away by a horde of Browncoats.

·         The Ice Pea Shooter’s freezing rate has been increased. Previously, it was very difficult to successfully freeze a target without vanquishing them in the process.
 
·         The Toxic Pea Shooter’s base impact damage has been slightly reduced. When his impact, explosion and toxic damage were combined, we found him to be slightly overpowered when compared to the rest of the Pea Shooters.

* Scientist:

We’ve remedied a few issues with the Scientist’s Energy Warp ability:

·         It can no longer be interrupted by The Chomper’s Spikeweeds.

·         It is no longer vulnerable to The Goop Shroom’s attacks.

·         Like the Engineer’s Jackhammer, and the Pea Shooter’s Hyper mode, it can now be prematurely exited by pressing its activation button.

·         The Chemist has seen a reduction to the size of his close-range damage area, as well as his clip capacity. The damage and weapon behavior remain the same, but in close-range situations, more accurate aiming is now required.

·         We’ve also reduced the damage of the default Scientist’s projectile. When combined with his close-range damage area, it was more powerful than intended.

* Soldier:

·         We’ve found that the Camo Ranger was consistently dominating matchups it shouldn’t be, especially against certain Cactus variants. To compensate, we’ve reduced his rate of fire while increasing per shot recoil. We feel that this makes the Camo Ranger/Cactus matchup more balanced.

·         Much like the Ice Pea Shooter, we’ve increased the Ice Trooper’s freezing rate. It’s now much easier to freeze a Plant without vanquishing them.

* Sunflower:

·         The Sun Pharaoh’s rapid-fire exploit has been fixed. Big thanks to all of you who reported this one.

·         The base Sunflower, Power Flower and Fire Sunflower have all received damage boosts. These three Sunflowers were consistently performing poorer than intended in one-on-one matchups. This should help alleviate the issue.",,False,,0,,Tactical Taco DLC Patch notes,,,,,,0.0,,,False,t3_29n1xy,False,,,,,8.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},,,8,,,,self,False,PC,,,,,True,,1404300398.0,,,,,,self.PvZGardenWarfare,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,STEAM,,,,,,t5_305ov,,,,,29n1xy,,,Hohenes,,20,,,,,,,/r/PvZGardenWarfare/comments/29n1xy/tactical_taco_dlc_patch_notes/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/PvZGardenWarfare/comments/29n1xy/tactical_taco_dlc_patch_notes/,,1404296798,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441286366.0,,,

,triathlon,"Hello r/triathlon. Before I get to the actual review, a bit of a PSA for all you tri-newbies. I decided to get into tri's 2 years ago, and this sub was one of the first places I came. I didn't know anything, and wanted to jump into the big kids pool with a 70.3 or a full. You lovely people talked me into working my way up. So I did sprints in 2012, sprints/olympics in 2013, and this year hit 70.3. I am SO GLAD I did it this way. I was able to get the basics down, enjoy the sport, and gradually build a base. As my training for this 70.3 progressed, it was not that mentally intimidating to prepare for. So, pre-review soapbox: If you can, work up in the distances! 

Since this was my first 70.3, my original goal was to just finish, but then mid training cycle I got cocky and thought ""I want 6:30 or faster"". I'm also not going to give my exact times so as to protect my identity at least a little (though I realize some of you on the internet can probably use some wizardry to find out anyways) Let's see how it went!

To the review:

**Pre-race**
I arrived in town Friday with my wife and mother coming along as a cheering section. Since I had registered so early, I was able to do the VIP packet pickup and walk around the expo early. This means I ran out of things to do by Friday evening. Spoiler: I loved the race, but damn is Lubbock boring.

Saturday I woke up, went for a jog, then we went to see a movie and relax. I went to the pro-panel to listen to them talk and then the pre-race meeting. I know that the race has a reputation for being tough, but some of my fellow athletes were really psyching themselves out regarding the hills and heat that were to come. Try not to think about it! I *thought* I was so chill and relaxed. Eventually ate some dinner, made sure my gear was good to go, and tried to go to sleep at 8:00pm.

I **thought** I was chill and relaxed. I tossed, turned, visualized, tossed some more, etc. I did not fall asleep until around midnight. Then, at 3:30am, the alarm went off...

**Race Day**
Despite the lack of sleep, I was jacked on adrenaline. I do not drink coffee (in fact, I hadn't used any sort of caffeine in almost 15 years until I finally caved and began utilizing Shot Bloks into my nutrition). I was ready to go. We loaded up and made out way out to the park. At 4:30am, it wasn't hard to get into the site, but from what I hear, if you go there later, it was hell. We parked and walked down the massive hill to transition (which was missing refs and body markers at that time). I set up my stuff, made sure it was all good to go, and then because I somehow got VIP status, I turned into a creeper and watched the pro's interact with each other on the rack next to me. They were so relaxed and playful. It was neat to see them be so friendly with each other too, despite the fact that they were all about to try and beat each other out for cash purses. Tim Reed and Jordan Rapp seemed like genuinely good guys.

I then made for the porto-john to try and poop. I am more of an afternoon pooper, but I wanted to be sure. Nothing happened, and I felt nothing, so I was ready to go (*or was I?!*). Body Markers showed up, so I went and got written on, then I went for a little warm up jog. The sky in the middle of the desert was beautiful. As a city person, it's always nice to see that many stars. After jogging, I lubed up and put on the wetsuit. It was time to head to the beach! I got a few strokes in before they pulled everyone out to start.

**The Swim**
Like many of you, I hate swimming. Throw in the fact that the Males 25-34 were the last wave and I started to get anxious. The beach got so empty :(. They finally called us up as the last wave (while announcing that the lead pro was just about to get out of the water). We got in the chute for the beach start. My plan was to stay back and let the fast guys go at it. They gave us the signal and we were off. I walked into the water to stay back then took a dive and off I went.

After about 200m I was feeling *really* good and decided ""I can go faster!"" So, I did. Sorry to the two guys I basically climbed on top of in the mid-pack at about 500m. The sun was at a great angle for a large portion of the swim that I didn't need to pull up and sight too much because I could just follow the light in the water. I was getting mentally excited that I might have a PB swim pace for any of my races, and in a 70.3 at that rate! **BUT THEN DISASTER STRUCK.** Suddenly something shifted in my gut, and I had to shit. So. Bad. I was approximately 1200m in and in a rough spot. My pace plummeted as I basically used my wetsuit to keep me afloat, clenched my ass, and turned the last part of the swim into a pull exercise. It was so uncomfortable that I did entertain thoughts of just shitting myself in the water, but I thought I had better not. As I got to the ramp I was scared of what might come out. Fortunately, the strippers were the best I've ever had (or I just used way too much body glide). They ripped that sucker off in one pull and I was OFF...to the porto-john right next to the swim exit.

**Transition 1**
At this point I fully expected my swim time to be an hour or more (My HR monitor isn't waterproof, so it was still waiting for me in transition). Given my stomach situation and current status of being in a porto-john at the beginning of transition, I figured I would just make sure to take my time and recollect myself in transition. I made quick work of the toilet thankfully and got out. It was depressing seeing about 80% of the bikes gone, but I also told myself ""you were the last wave."" Got my shit together and I was off.

**The Bike**
The bike is hands down my best part, and I considered hammering the hell out of it to make up for my swim emergencies. I talked myself out of it though, as that was not my plan. Everyone always tells me about how they hammer too hard in the bike and blow up the run, so I made myself calm down.

The course was pretty tough, but I also really enjoyed it. The switchbacks and climbs in and out of the canyons were pretty neat. The 25mph sustained winds with gusts over 40mph as a head wind for about 20 miles of the course were not as neat. I pushed through it though, and after mile 30 or so decided (*not smartly*) that I felt good still, so I would pick up the pace. This coincided with the last bit of riding into the headwinds, so while I began to hammer, my mph basically stayed the same. I was religious about nutrition, eating every 35 minutes and alternating sips of water/skratch labs drink every 10 minutes. I kept passing tons of people on the bike though, and was honestly surprised to see as many people as I did walking the hills. I eventually got back to the lake, my watch said I was just a bit over 3 hours, which given the course, I was happy to take.

**Transition 2**
Pretty good transition. In/out without an issue. Having the VIP racks right next to Bike In was nice. I threw one some more sunscreen, my visor, and was off.

**The Run...oh god the run**
My plan was to go full liquid from the aid stations, and I would also take a cup of ice at each station to much on/throw down my shorts/shirt between each station. I knew from my bricks that I always have trouble getting my HR down coming off the bike into the run, so it was in my plan to run for about 9 minutes, walk 1 minute and just alternate. I kept this up at a pretty good clip until the 2nd massive hill of the run course. I gave in and walked the whole hill, and decided to make up for all that walking by skipping one of my 1 minute walk breaks. This got me to the 3rd (and largest of the run) hill between mile 4 and 5. I then walked it. When you got to the top, you began a 2.5 mile out and back on what they call ""Energy Plant Road 2"" in honor of the original in Kona. This was 5 miles total (like I said, out and back) of flat, straight, desert road with NOTHING around. After the race, I later discovered that about this time was when the temps started to push upper 90s to 100. The sight of the long road with the head radiating plus the abandonment of my run 9/walk 1 pace finally all came together, and about mile 5.5, I blew the hell up. I know some of it was mind over matter, and a stereotypical triathlete, I like to think I'm usually good about conquering this, but I just couldn't shake it.

I ended up having to do what basically averaged out to walk half a mile/run half a mile for the rest of the run. I also got to experience that lovely feeling so many of you talk about: My stomach just didn't want anymore sugary PowerBar Perform or GU. I was bloated, and I knew I *needed* to get more calories, but I felt sick just thinking about it. Fortunately they had pretzels, so I grabbed a handful about Mile 8 and just munched as I walked that next half mile. I had to fight mentally so hard to make myself run each half mile, holy god it was hard. I was fortunate to have a guy that ran with me for a while from mile 5-9 or so and our conversation kept me distracted, but he eventually dropped back. While this gave me a confidence boost, I also lost my talkin' buddy!

I eventually got over the last hill and began entering the quarry that the park/lake is dug into. Thus began the longest 2.5 miles of my running life. I knew it was fucking hot, and in the park there was little wind. It was insane. But, I just kept moving my legs and finally was able to RUN across the finish line. My watch said just about 3 hours. Whoops, not my goal time AT ALL. I had been pretty mentally alert the last part of the race, but had not spoken in a while. The volunteer pulled me up to the table, gave me my shirt and medal and asked how I was, my response was to open my mouth and go ""Uhhgannrhhn"". The nice lady walked me over to the IV party.

**Post Race**
Let me just say that free IVs post race are the shit. I felt awesome afterwords. Found out my swim time and T1 Time weren't *as bad* as I thought, 55 for the swim and 5ish for T1. My total time was in the **7:20 range**. Loaded up my stuff, stopped by the gas station, bought some bags of ice, and took an icebath in the hotel. That plus the IV and I really didn't feel all that bad the rest of the day. I went to the dinner/after party and was a little relieved to hear all the veterans and pros proudly claim that this years Buffalo Springs course was quite possibly the hardest 70.3 course they had ever done. 

**In the End**
Given the reputation this course had coming in, and the comments this year's course specifically had, I think I took it a bit lightly. I missed my 6:30 goal time by 50 minutes, but given the conditions, I don't know how realistic that really was. There were also many factors out of my control.

In the end, I'm happy I did it, I loved it just like the other distances, and at least I finished (and with plenty of time to spare). Due to my work schedule, I'm not sure if I can do another Half this year (Austin does look tempting). Things will probably only improve, so I'll see what my next half brings.

As for Buffalo Springs 70.3 itself: I don't have enough experience in 70.3s to compare, but I thought the course was fucking hard. However, Mike and Marti and the volunteers deserve THEIR reputation for putting on a great race. The aid stations were top notch, everyone was super supportive, they had everything you needed, and the race went smoothly despite the tough conditions. I would suggest everyone try the race at least once because they run a good one. The one time might be all you want though, as I don't think I ever want to return to west Texas.

,pathofexile,"I've seen a ton of bad info surrounding 5/6 linking items on this subreddit.  Part of it arises from people trying to make inferences from anecdotal evidence and part of it arises from the difficulty of analyzing such low % events.  I wanted to collect some data so people would have something more concrete to look at instead of just hearing stories.

I wanted a 6L chest with lots of armor, life, and some ES (for my EB incinerate build) which I could not for the life of me find on poexyz, so I decided to make try 6Ling the 5L chest I was using.  I used my 6L attempts as an excuse to collect and record some data on fusing.  I spend about half of my fusings after qualitying up to 20% and the other half at 0%.  

I ended up 6Ling my rare chest at about Fusing #1400 and have since been buying up Lightning Coils, Carcass Jacks, and Searing Touches to keep fusing (and selling any resulting 5/6Ls so I can keep on buying/fusing).  [Here are my results after 2000 fusings](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10wikv7LNG1VKXWIWAoNyEV60iJnqLygAWf6ojk4VXps/edit?usp=sharing).

----------
Here are the statistically rigorous results.  Out of 1000 20% fuses, I got 10 5Ls and 2 6Ls.  Out of 1000 0% fuses, I got 7 5Ls and 1 6L.  The resulting 95% confidence interval (calculated by the [Wilson Interval](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval#Wilson_score_interval)) are:

* 5/6L at 20%: [.69%,2.09%]
* 5/6L at 0%: [.41%,1.57%]
* 6L at 20%: [0.05% 0.73%]
* 6L at 0%: [0.02% 0.56%]

If you're unfamiliar with what confidence intervals mean, they can be interpreted as: ""If this data sample was collected an infinite # of times, 95% of the calculated confidence intervals would contain the true chance"" or a bit more simplistically: ""There is a 95% chance the true chance lies in the range"".  The ranges are still quite wide because of the rarity of the 6L events.  I can't even resolve that 6Ling at 20% is better than 6Ling at 0%, though [Chris Wilson stated that 20% will more than double 6L chances](http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/23qgit/discussion_prd_on_jewelers_and_fusings/cgzy3pj).  I will likely need 10k fusings each in order to get some separation between the two distributions.

----------------------

Here are the more useful conclusions ASSUMING my data is a representative sample (i.e. I didn't get really unlucky or lucky).  From these 2000 fusings, it does seem that 6L chances double (from .1% to .2%) under 20% quality with a slight boost in 5L chances as well (from .7% to 1%).  From these chances the expected number of fusings to get a 6L are 500 and 1000 for 20% and 0% quality respectively.  For 5/6L the expected number of fusings are about 100/140.  This does NOT mean that you're guaranteed a 6L by 500 1000 or even 2000 fusings.  If you've spent 500 fusings at 20% and haven't gotten a 6L, the expectation from that point is STILL that you'll need on average 500 more fusings.  Any hope of getting a 6L sooner because you've gotten unlucky up to that point is called [Gambler's Fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy).

Particularly some advice on attempting to 6L a 5Lchest you are currently using.  Make sure you have a large enough pool that you're at least likely to get a 5L back before running out of fuses.  If you trust the 1.2% chance to 5/6L at 20% quality, then 100 fusings gives a 70% of hitting a 5/6L before running out while 200/300 fusings give a 91%/97.5% of hitting a 5/6L before running out.  I'd suggest accruing ~300 fuses before attempting a 6L on your main chest.  Fuse until a 5L then accrue back to ~300.  Rinse and repeat until you get your 6L.  This will minimize the chance that you'll get shafted and end up with an unusable chest.

-----------

Some assumptions I've made for this analysis:

* Chances to link are the same between weapons and chest pieces

* Linkings are independent and identically distributed.  In other words, probabilities don't change over time or with respect to the history.  
&gt; This apparently is not exactly true as it seems the exact linking is guaranteed to change (1-4-1 won't roll into another 1-4-1).  This likely won't have a drastic change on %s though 4Ls will have the largest distortion at 29% with only 3 different conformations to split across (as opposed to the 3Ls with ~50% and 11 conformations to split across).  Assuming each conformation has equal % of occuring, this means about 10% of the possible rolls will be rerolled if you already have a 4L.  If this 10% is distributed equally, that means you'll have ~10% increase in chance to 5/6L given a 4L.  This means little to nothing in terms of practicality since we can't influence 4Ls unless you want to pay an extra chaos or two for a 4L/6S item.

------------
Research Funding:

* Dominus for Crown of Eyes

* RNGesus for vaaling 1% max resist on Stone of Lazhwar

------------

Future Work:

Planning on continuing this at least for the near future.  Hoping that reselling 5/6Ls will keep me sustained currency wise which sort of leaves me in an odd predicament.  On one end I want to get lucky so I can keep this up.  On the other hand, me getting lucky means that my data won't be representative. &gt;.&lt;

,magicTCG,"Hey there.  Got something of a long post here so I'll apologise in advance for that.  There's a **tl;dr** at the bottom if you prefer.

I'm considering signing up for Magic Online but I have no experience whatsoever with it and I'm hoping that the people here who do can help me make a decision about it.

First, a little information about myself.  I'm a 31-year-old Englishman living and working in Japan, teaching English to Japanese people from the ages of 3 to 83.  I've been out here for around four-and-a-half years now.  In the past my main hobby has been miniature wargaming but since moving out here the lack of opponents has meant I just haven't done a great deal of it (not to mention that prices are a lot more expensive here).

I started playing Magic in 1995, picking up a small amount of 4th Edition and 5th Edition, but not really playing much more than a handful of games with my friends in my DnD group at the time.  I picked it up again in 2001, participating in a Planeshift booster draft held at my University's Gaming Society.  I attempted to pick it up again in 2006, but the guy who lent me a deck lent me what seemed to be a combo deck without explaining the combo and I ended up totally uninterested.

Fast forward to 2012 and one of the Americans in my Pathfinder RPG group comes back from a vacation in America with a box of M13 which we then draft.  The entire gaming group gets hooked on Magic and we've never really looked back.

However, the state of English teaching in Japan means that things are always in flux.  Two of the members of the group have already gone back to their home country, another two were forced to move to different cities to get jobs (one of whom is shortly going to be leaving to travel the world), and the new guys in the gaming group just haven't been as interested in Magic as the rest of us are.

Our group has drafted each set that Wizards have released since M13, but Journey Into Nyx was probably our very last one, since we just can't get enough people interested to buy boxes of cards to do a draft.

We have a local card store, but the majority of players there are, obviously, Japanese, with varying levels of English speaking ability.  My own Japanese speaking ability isn't all that great so whilst I have the option of drafting there (on the rare occasion that people want to draft rather than play a Modern tournament or a Legacy tournament) it's not great (not least because they tend to draft with Japanese cards, making the process that much harder for me).

Okay, I guess that was a lot of information about me.  Whoops.

Anyway, this leads me to where I am today.  I've been playing kitchen table Magic for around 2 years and I've been gradually getting better, with a particular focus on trying to get better at drafting.  However, my Magic gaming group is dissolving and I'm looking to continue improving my play.

Enter Magic Online.  It seems to me that Magic Online is practically designed for people like me, who want to play but don't have people nearby who they can play with.

My main aim of playing on Magic Online is to improve my drafting skills.  I'd like to get better at drafting but I feel that the only way I can do this is to actually draft.  I'm not planning on playing any kind of constructed games on there so I intend to turn the cards that I draft around for tickets in order to continue playing.  Having listened to certain episodes of the Limited Resources podcast, I'm well aware that ""going infinite"" is pretty much a pipe dream (especially for someone of my Magic playing ability) but I'll be doing my best to continue playing for as little cost as possible.

Having said that, there's a part of me that would like to try to draft with an eye to collecting a complete set of whatever set I'm playing and then redeem it for a real world set of those cards.  I'm almost certain that trying to do this will be difficult, but it feels to me that at least I could get some kind of tangible reward for what I was doing, as well as giving me a goal to work towards with each draft that I play (beyond winning, of course).

All-in-all, there are several pros and cons that I can see for this, though there are likely others too that I'm hoping that other people can enlighten me about.

* + Magic Online allows me to continue playing despite the lack of local playable locations.  In particular, it will allow me to continue practising drafting despite the lack of local opponents,
* + I can potentially get real world cards if I do well enough,
* - I have an addictive personality, meaning that there is a not-unreasonable chance that I could find myself sucked in and being unable to stop myself from playing,
* - I am something of a shopaholic, and I'm concerned that my ability to turn down microtransactions isn't as good as I hope,
* - I am prone to suffering from depression, and a sustained string of gaming losses can really get me down (in recent months I have been receiving a treatment of sorts for this, so I don't know how badly this will affect me), and,
* - I am uncertain as to how much playing Magic Online will cost me.  I have something of a limited budget to do this and I don't know how far it will stretch.

I'm looking for advice on this situation, particularly from people who play Magic Online and are more experienced with the ins and outs of the program.  What's it like?  I've heard some bad things about the client but, then, I've also heard some good things, too.

What would my start-up costs be?  What would my ongoing costs be?

**tl;dr**: I'm losing my drafting playgroup and want to know if MODO is a viable alternative; is MODO worth getting into for the purposes of getting better at drafting and/or collecting full sets to redeem?",,False,,0,,"Considering starting Magic Online; convince me either way, please!",,,,,,0.0,,,False,t3_29kk9a,False,,,,,0.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},,,0,,,,self,False,text,,,,,True,,1404233628.0,,,,,,self.magicTCG,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,Mini Master,,,,,,t5_2qn5f,,,,,29kk9a,,,MaskedThespian,,8,,,,,,,/r/magicTCG/comments/29kk9a/considering_starting_magic_online_convince_me/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/29kk9a/considering_starting_magic_online_convince_me/,,1404230028,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441287590.0,,,
,Magicite,"Im asking this cause i feel that there are so far to few skills in the game that really benefits you throughout the entire playthrough.

What i mean by this is that lets say you take the aggresive trait, you have an easy time early on (provided you dont hug all the bees, boars and whatnot) but eventually around the time you get your first decent weapon, the two extra damage provided by the trait is negligible and benefit you very little.

As of right now there are quite a few traits that give you that extra boost early on and while that might be sought after by the people struggling with the early stages of the game, choosing these traits will eventually punish you later.

What i feel that i am eventually is getting at is that the only traits as of now that are really benefit you throughout the entire game are those that regain your health such as, Gatherer+potion master aswell as Big eater.

While i am aware that woodcutting and miner's traits provide the same effect continiously throughout the playthrough i feel that these traits are simply bad and offer little to nothing to the player.

I'd like to make the other traits benefit you more and really make you feel that you are playing a character with that trait, as when one plays a potion master with gatherer and eventually end up with +10 big potions.

**My Suggestions for the traits below
*Aggressive  Crit chance and damage upped


*Artisan	 some kind of way to choose what your items gain, or maybe refine ores without the blacksmith and make the armor yourself ?

*Big Eater  Eating hp restore chance=75%

*Defensive	 Chance to block/dodge any damage taken which would result in a damage reduction to the damage taken as a whole

*Gatherer	 Collects twice as many ingredients when gathering.

*Healthy	 Regen hp mechanic every so often ?, with moderation of course

*Intelligent	 Spell crits ?, Increased mag gain overall

*Lockmaster	 Doesn't need a key when opening chests or locks. 

*Miner	 50% chance your Pick will not lose durability. **Start with stone/iron pick ?, Increased ore gain ?** 

*Potion Brewer 50% chance to craft big potions.

*Swift	 +2 DEX **more movespeed ?, faster rate of fire ?, more arrow recovery ? **

*Woodcutter	 50% chance your Axe will not lose durability. 
** I dont really know what to add to woodcutter, i just feel the trait as a whole is just a waste**

Please feel free to debate and question my suggestions aswell as coming up with your own.

P.S I apologize for poor spelling and potential grammar errors.

,boardgames,"[Link to the Collection](http://imgur.com/a/yMG0o)

Evening everyone, thought I would share my collection and contribute back to a fantastic community. Seeing as I managed to screw up my first attempt at this, failing to put the link as a self-post, hopefully this goes a bit better. Second half will be in the comments. 

**Intro and Thoughts Part I**

My friends and I kind of fell into boardgaming about two years ago. We started, like most, with the classic Settlers of Catan. While this tempted us in, the game that really started our collective love affair with the hobby was when one of my best friends’ picked up Risk Legacy. The sense of importance the game gave us through permanent changes, alongside the sheer fun of opening up new aspects and physical pieces of the game really drew us in. Funnily enough we hardly ever play either game anymore, though a lot of this is a result of constantly having new games to play.

This is my collection as it stands:

-	Alien Frontiers 
-	Android: Netrunner (Base Game)
-	Cyclades
-	Dungeons and Dragons (Red Box Starter)
-	Five Crowns
-	Forbidden Island and Forbidden Desert
-	Gloom (with Unhappy Homes and Unwelcome Guests – its hidden away in the photo in the wooden card box)
-	Hey That’s My Fish!
-	Jungle Speed
-	Kemet
-	Lords of Waterdeep
-	Love Letter
-	Pandemic (with On the Brink)
-	Puerto Rico
-	Power Grid
-	Race for the Galaxy (with The Gathering Storm)
-	Risk (Halo and Star Wars versions)
-	Stone Age (Unseen in Photo- Currently on Loan)
-	Survive: Escape From Atlantis!
-	Terra Mystica
-	Zombicide Season Two (with Zombie Dogs, extra Zombies and extra Game Tiles)

And on the Miniatures Front:

-	Dropzone Commander (Two Player Starter with an expanding number of add-ons)
-	X-Wing (Two Player Starter and 9 extra ships)
-	Warhammer 40,000 (Space Marines and Space Wolves)

Awaiting Kickstarter:

-	March of the Ants
-	Copper Country

**Thoughts on the Games:**

**Alien Frontiers-**

A relatively new addition to the collection, I had been waiting on this bad boy to come back into print for about a year before my friends from university picked me up one of the first of the new copies to hit Australia for my birthday this year. I really enjoy it so far, though I have always loved rolling dice so this game speaks to me. It is relatively simple to learn, but it has a lot of nuance in both your immediate turn and your over-arching strategy. While a lot of games share this feature I really enjoy that the game feels circular in the respect that there are no discrete rounds of play.

The new edition is also very pretty to look at, full of high-quality components, in particular the game board. The box has plenty of intentional empty space to allow room for future expansions. My only minor quibble here is that the score tracker is slightly too wide to fit inside one of the sunken parts of the box, but is too short to rest cleanly on top.

**Android: Netrunner-**

An intense game that I have only begun to scratch the surface of, even with just the starter set. Really requires you to try and read your opponent and plan accordingly, which makes it great with close friends as you try and call each others bluffs and counter-bluffs. Also has a lot of strategic depth, but I can’t comment on the deck-building and so on as we are yet to get that far. I am a fan of the artwork on the cards, as well as the overall premise – one of the few games I can readily think of where you can take great joy in being a gigantic heartless corporation.

**Cyclades-**

Full disclosure, I am majoring in Ancient History so thematically I love Cyclades. The board and miniatures are great and I enjoy the overall game. It has a lot of strong points including the diverse paths to victory, as well as the fact that you cannot be knocked out of the game (barring where that would allow someone to win). The bidding mechanic is also a fun aspect of the game I find, there is just something satisfying about laying down a chunk of gold to outbid someone you know and love.

The game isn’t without fault though, your opening moves are incredibly important, so if not all players are paying as much attention (or are on varying skill levels) one or two players can shoot out to an early and often insurmountable advantage. Within our group this usually occurs with myself and one of my friends, normally with me pushing militarily to build a huge economy and him boosting his own through exponential priest acquisition.

**Dungeons and Dragons-**

Have two editions of the Red Starter Box, one that was originally my mother’s from before I was born and one that was picked up by myself a year or two ago. Good fun, especially if all involved really sink their heart and souls into playing their character. Currently awaiting one of my friends’, who has taken on the role of our DM, to start our first proper campaign. Keen as a bean.

**Five Crowns-**

The game isn’t over til the kings go wild! I was introduced to Five Crowns by the most acerbically tongued old woman I have ever met at a boardgames night at one of my FLGS. She might be able to really cut you to pieces with her words but that old bag knows how to have fun. Five Crowns is essentially a variant of Rummy, but it is a lot of fun, is really easy to teach to people, and as with all card games travels well.

If you’re playing proper points it can take longer than you’d think, and the luck of your deal does obviously heavy affect your game, but it is light-hearted and can play up to seven people, so I think it’s brilliant.
**
Forbidden Island/Desert-**

Same, same, but different. Both of these games are rather like extended group puzzles. As with any co-op game it can suffer from quarter-backing. While the easiest way to offset this is to not allow people to guide others, we really like to talk decisions through as a group. In our experience then, the best way is to make sure everyone is involved (if playing with new players), or preferably all on about the same skill level. Often this leads to several approaches being voiced, and hopefully allowing the turn player to make the best decision. When played right there is that great satisfaction of making it against the odds (so to speak) and even a loss can often be hilarious.

Good games that I probably don’t play enough.

**Gloom-**

As a theme, Gloom really is one of those games I love to explain to new players. “Yeah! You all have families, and you’re trying to make sure your family is the unhappiest of everyone’s! But they have to be dead at the end for their unhappiness to count, everyone knows living people will get better in the end! It’s great, trust me.”

Gloom as a game is quite simple, but it plays well at virtually all player levels. The transparent cards are a cool mechanic that I enjoy, and the game is really added to by the expansions. It also has a certain macabre charm to its art and flavour text.

Best played while slightly drunk, and with the rule that all actions must be made into a narrative, i.e. you can’t pass someone a card and say you bring their character from the dead. You should discuss how through fantasmic Frankensteinian fabrications, and with a little help of lightning, you were able to make the dead rise from the sweet embrace of death cue maniacal laughter.

**Hey That’s My Fish!-**

Least components of any non-card game I own, yet still manages some of the highest tactical depth. A game about penguins and fish, HTMF! Essential revolves around area denial and making sure your penguins are in the right spot to collect the maximum amount of fish (points) as possible. Plays best with the full four players, but it is lightning quick and fun in its goofiness.

**Jungle Speed-**

I first played this game with some French girls and other assorted teens about eight or nine years ago while caravanning in the top end of Australia with my uncle and his family. While I did cop a wooden totem to the chin, god bless those stunning, hard to understand, paragons of gaming for introducing me to this classic.

Centring on trying to get rid of your cards, and descending into chaos should your card match another player’s (or at other points depending on special cards), Jungle Speed is frantic. My only lamentation is that the new version I picked up comes with a rubber totem. Seriously, the tension ratchets that extra notch higher when you know that dueling another player could see you lose an eye.

Do not play with rings and/or long nails. Lots of fun all the same.

**Kemet-**

So new I haven’t played it! For shame. Will be rectified as soon as possible. At first glance looks to be the more strategic brother of Cyclades. Excited.

**Lords of Waterdeep-**

While some people find it awkward, and admittedly the coins can be a pain, I really have to say I love the box for how well it fits together. The theme and the game are at times decidedly disconnected (It is always “Throw me one of those purple guys!” not “A wizard joins my party”) but on the whole it is a fun fantasy world to play in.

Plays very much in keeping with other worker-placement games, with adventurers substituting for resources. Rewards clever purchases and focusing as a player on committing to a strategy rather than playing the generalist role. I’m on the fence about mandatory quests, they can be extremely frustrating, but that is kind of the point. Enjoyable, but probably gets passed up by our group in favour of Stone Age a lot.

**Love Letter-**

There is nothing quite like making it through a full round starting with the Princess. Light, fun, and based on playing the odds and counting cards. Easily travels the best of all my games, and is really easy to get into the swing of things after just one round as a new player. Invariably full of joking and general lewdness if you’re amongst friends. My only complaint is that I’ve been stranded on three tokens of affection far too many times. Oh that fickle Princess, why does she spurn me so.

,Steam,"Hi,

I am currently steam lvl 16 and was wondering about Badges and card drops.

I was looking through my badge progress and could see all of the games i still had card drops for. So i was wondering how are the extra card boosters given out? I read this a post that mentioned that as more badges are created it gives people a chance of getting a booster pack.

Does this mean if someone creates a Dota badge everyone has a chance of getting a Dota booster pack? Or is it anyone with any other eligible game getting a chance for booster pack on that game?

Now if i had more games that were eligible for booster drops (If i go through each one and collect the remaining card drops) Do i have a chance of getting more booster packs overall? Or the same amount of booster packs but spread over more games? (So this kind of question is - Is the booster drops account based(with random game selected), or game based(with each game having its own chance of a booster pack reward))

Thanks!

,marvelheroes,"Don't get me wrong... I appreciate the entire thing, but I feel like the drop rates, the amount/type of item drops and entire event feels less cohesive and not as fun as the original Big 10.

When a place is buffed, I'm finding more Artifacts than anything. And the wall bug which is a bitch and a half to collect something hidden underneath junk. The event items aren't guaranteed with a boss kill, let alone dropped often enough for a casual gamer who can't spend hours among hours collecting them (I'm looking at you Flags and Hot Dog Ingredients).

The ability to raid party just increases lag in Midtown when there's a Doop wave. The Doop waves are the best part of this whole thing thus cancelling out some fun when you can look like you're standing next to or attacking the doop but he's dead/you never loaded and nothing drops.

,Warframe,"This has been suggested for a few times, and now I experienced first hand why it would be a good idea.


I was finding 3 ppl to run my T1 survival key with, and thus I said in recruiting: hosting T1 survival, going for 40 minutes, /w for invite. Pretty plain and simple, right? I was trying to maybe get a loki prime part, so with guaranteed prime drops every 20 minutes, 40 minutes was a logical stop, since getting to 60 minutes for a third drop would be to hard with randoms. Also any additional void keys that drop would be nice to have as well, and it sorta rains void keys in void survival.

I get reactions, I invite the first three. One of them is a fresh out of the pod Excalibur with still all his starting gear, but I figure hey no problem, I got good enough gear, we can get him through this and it will be a nice xp/resource boost for him if he gets in a 40 minute run. 


On to the mission. We make it through the first 8 minutes allright, chuckle a bit when Excalibur ask us to mark control modules since he needs one, and ensure him he'll be swimming in them when this is over. And then an Argon crystal drops, and so does the problems. Another guy, with the gloriously Watchdogsinspired name IDefalt, starts saying stuff like 'k lets leave now guys I got my crystal'. And I'm like 'say what now mate?'. He goes on and on about wanting to leave, even tries to convince the newbie to go with him to extraction so he can end the mission prematurely. He was a mastery rank 5, so you'd think he knows the game and the community a bit. But oh know, no matter what me and the other high ranked player said, he absolutely wanted to leave. And I dont know how he did it, but somehow I'm in the middle of slicing and dicing a gunner when BOOM mission ends at 21 minutes. 

I was so pissed. Like really really pissed. Not because of the key, because I have 7 more T1 survivals, but because the dude single handedly screwed all three of us over. We were no where near having to end the mission. But he ended it for us. He was all buthurt about why we didn't want to leave, and fell out of the sky when I told him we would not be leaving before the 40 minute mark. Something I explicitly stated when recruiting for the mission. 


Sorry about the rant here, but its because of players like this that I would love to have some sort of kick mechanic in the game. Maybe only in void missions (since those are not infinitely repeatable that easily, they require keys), and only by the host (who is by definition also the owner of the key thats being used). You can not kick people once the mission objective has been completed.  Kicking people should give them the rewards they have collected so far, but no bonus XP or end mission reward if its not a defence/survival/interception. It removes them from the mission and prevents them from screwing with you and fucking you over, well knowing that there is nothing you can do (since aborting as a host now also uses up the key).


So I'd hope to see some sort of control mechanic like this implemented for the host of a void key. Not everyone is fortunate enough to have clan mates or friends they can trust to run voids with, and this way those that have to resort to randoms have at least some way to ensure they dont wast their key because of someone prematurely popping life support, ending the mission on their own, etc...


Or alternatively, implement a mechanic so people can leave survival missions when they want without ending the mission for other clients, similar to the defense/interception system. Like when you reach the extraction point a screen comes up asking you if you want to leave or stay, if you leave you get your rewards and it ends for you but not for the others.",,False,,0,,Can we have some sort of kick option by the host,,,,,sug,0.0,,,False,t3_29e4ko,False,,,,,73.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},Suggestion,,73,,,,self,False,volt,,,,,True,,1404054401.0,,,,,,self.Warframe,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,AKA GewoonMartijn,,,,,,t5_2urg0,,,,,29e4ko,,,MisterDerptastic,,45,,,,,,,/r/Warframe/comments/29e4ko/can_we_have_some_sort_of_kick_option_by_the_host/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/29e4ko/can_we_have_some_sort_of_kick_option_by_the_host/,,1404050801,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441290592.0,,,
,magicTCG,"Hello magicTCG!


I played Magic with my brother when we were younger and now I'm looking to get back into the game. From my research it seems like Standard and Modern are the real ""competitive"" game types but I could be pretty wrong. After looking into these game formats, I've come to realize that almost all of the cards we have are no longer viable for play in these formats which is fine, I love collecting and such for new decks/sets. So I know how to play the game even though there have been a lot of changes since I last played at my LGS. 

So basically my question is ""What's the best way to start?""


Should I go out and buy one of those intro/event decks and maybe a deckbuild toolkit to buff it hopefully?


Should I buy some booster packs/boxes?


Should I just go to FNM drafts and build it up that way?


I'm sure these are all typical questions and viable options depending what I want to do, but I'm looking to get restarted with all this new tech and play the game at my LGS maybe with some friends returning too.

,bigdickproblems,"For the last few weeks, I've been reading many of your posts, and a great number of them have collectively given me a moment of metanoia. Forgive the obscure choice of word, but I prefer its strong connotations (and the title clarifies it plenty). Virtually everything I knew about sex was wrong until I started taking the call to action I kept reading about in BDP.

Before I met the lady of my life at age 24 and had two daughters, my mission was to remain a virgin, mostly for practical reasons. You'd be amazed how many potential partners will change their opinion of you when they find this out. What can I say, I'm a unique and picky fellow. Until then, masturbation was my coping mechanism, and naturally porn came with that. I gravitated towards curvy (dare I say, heavy) women, and I had a few favorites. Some of those favorites would do hardcore and a few in particular would tackle dicks with extreme girth. From watching their ""normal"" hardcore videos and comparing their reactions, I became obsessed with big girth hardcore. Maybe it was the people-pleaser in me, but I desired more than anything to get that reaction as often as I could. I knew such an obsession was unhealthy, and I struggled with it for years.

A lot of confusion came with the excitement of having sex for the first time, mainly from absurd expectations. My wife was rare in that she never ""popped her cherry"" during our first sex. Also, in our initial curiosity of sexual positions, I found I simply couldn't do many of the positions I witnessed in porn. Throughout our sporadic mix of sex and parenthood, she had yet to achieve her first orgasm. I was disappointed in myself and often let paranoia get the best of me. My obsession with big girth porn continued.

My wife, throughout all of this, was a rock. Our communication about this was fairly open, and her love for me never wavered. She had a maturity about sex and emotion in general that simply dwarfed mine. This alone didn't solve my obsessions, but it made me fight them, unsuccessfully.

A friend recommended the movie ""Don Jon"" a few months ago, laying out the basic theme, which interested me. I won't give away any spoilers, but the main character gets over similar obsessions. It was inspiring in that I wanted to understand the truth he came to. To paraphrase a quote from the movie, ""You think the sex you see in porn is real?"" I accepted the words but knew I lacked understanding.

Eventually, my big girth obsession led me to BDP, where I learned how to properly measure my penis. Despite my obsession, I never managed to measure my own girth until that point. The statistics were surprising: 93rd percentile in girth, and average everywhere else. It was a confidence boost, but not the end. Reading about condom fits got me paying attention to it. Only then did I realize my penis would turn two different colors with a painful red ring dividing the two. Four years of sex, and I didn't even notice it. Unbelievable.

I told my wife about everything I found on BDP, and it opened a rich level of conversation we never had before. I started researching, understanding and accepting clitoral stimulation, and she started asking others about masturbating and understanding her capacity for orgasm, something she already had healthy expectations about. We were already chomping at the bit to start having regular sex after our second child, and we planned a date night a few weeks from that moment. It was time I needed to get my head in the right place.

More reading of BDP and the ideas I got from ""Don Jon"" got me to a point where I knew I wanted to seek a more emotional and meaningful sexual experience, something that completely lacked any focus on her orgasm. When the time came, the sex was fantastic, and not because of any feelings of ecstasy (though they were there for sure). It was from understanding that perhaps -- perhaps -- my wife happened to have the perfect sexual compatibility for someone with my girth: no teeth during a blowjob, only minor pain after long gaps between sexual encounters, etc. I took that understanding and ignored any insecurities. She still didn't get her first orgasm, but we weren't actively seeking it. It didn't really matter. Going with what felt good and and making my wife my only obsession was my cure.

Three days later (today), I'm still on cloud nine and brimming with confidence. I honestly don't have any more desire for porn in my life, because I truly long for my wife now the way I thought I longed for porn. I simply want to share my story for anyone who might be in a similar situation and thank everyone here for giving me the knowledge to boldly tear down sexual myths and barriers.",,False,,0,,BDP Changed My Life,,,,,,0.0,,,False,t3_293h0i,False,,,,,17.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},,,17,,,,self,False,,,,,,True,,1403736734.0,,,,,,self.bigdickproblems,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,"6"" x 6""",,,,,,t5_2sqd6,,,,,293h0i,,,JaguarFlair,,4,,,,,,,/r/bigdickproblems/comments/293h0i/bdp_changed_my_life/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/bigdickproblems/comments/293h0i/bdp_changed_my_life/,,1403733134,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441295683.0,,,
,TheWarZ,"Fellow Survivors,
 
Over the last few months we've been teasing a new free game experience that we are working on which will be available to all I:SS players. The wait is over and we are ready to share more details!
 
We are happy to announce that we've started development of a new spin-off game called Infestation: New Beginnings that will be available for FREE to all I:SS players this Fall. The new game will coexist alongside I:SS and will provide a different type of survival experience for our players. More information about the schedule of Alpha and Beta sessions is included at the end of this post.
 
We started thinking about this game back in November 2013, about the same time that OP Productions, LLC decided to shift away from Hammerpoint Interactive. We assembled a new in-house development team and joined forces with another development team to continue work on the Infestation brand. While some members of the Hammerpoint development team have joined us, most of the team is new and eager to address many of the unrealized opportunities present in the original Infestation: Survivor Stories. It became very clear that most of the changes the team wants to make are impossible without a game-wide wipe and reset. This is something that OP Productions hasn't been ready to do – after all, many loyal, active players are still enjoying the game.
 
Infestation: New Beginnings was born with a very clear goal: to create a truly free gaming experience for our players that will not require them to spend money in any way to advance or stay competitive and dominate! It must offer a fun, user-friendly experience for both new players and seasoned fans of the brand. Though this is no small task for an independent development team of our size to achieve, we owe it to our players to take on this challenge and we hope you will support us in this journey.
 
The team has been laser-focused on rebuilding the world of Infestation to create a product that revolves around the game world by providing tools and systems to players that actually change the world and make it more suitable for players to live in.
 
Here’s a look at some of the changes and additions we’ve been exploring for Infestation: New Beginnings:
 
New “Wild West” Themed Map
We’re introducing a completely new environment. We thought that it’d be cool to create a game with a Wild West vibe, so we designed the map to resemble the Southwestern US. Its initial size is 64 sq. km (square 8x8 km), comparable in size to the original Colorado map back in the I:SS Alpha. It has more open landscape for players to discover, and the area of the map that can be explored will be even bigger than the original Colorado map.
 
New Character Creation and Customization
All players will be able to create one customizable male or female character for free. There will be a variety of customization options for the face, clothing, hair style and color that can be unlocked by players. We will also be making unique, non-degrading cosmetic items available to allow for more customization. All character customizations will be permanent and will not disappear when your character will die.
 
Instant Revive
In New Beginnings, as soon as you die, you’ll be able to instantly jump back into the game. We wanted to remove the “instant-revive-for-GC” option that was present in Infestation: Survivor Stories as we felt it wasn’t fair to all players.
 
Global Inventory Changes
The only in-game locations where players can access their Global Inventory are VAULT buildings in safe zones. The size of the global inventory will be restricted. It’ll be big enough to satisfy heavy collecting habits for many players and there’ll also be a limited way to buy more GI slots for extreme collectors. Even so, it will still be limited in comparison to I:SS.
 
No Marketplace
The Marketplace of I:SS will be replaced with two new systems:
Package store: The package store will be accessible from the main menu and will function like a DLC shop, where players can purchase packs of discounted items. However, the number of packs available for you to buy will be time-limited to ensure that pay-to-win play is not possible. Packs will include sets of cosmetic items, skins for guns, and a cool new concept item called a “Gift Bomb.” Using this item triggers an explosion that rewards everyone in the immediate area EXCEPT the triggerman with some cool items. This is like going to a bar and saying, “next round is on me, everyone!”
Players Exchange: This system aims to feel like a stock exchange that allows players to buy and sell any item for GD only. The availability of items and their prices will be affected by what the players buy and sell, and will be balanced by the dev team to keep the I:NB economy in check. We will monitor the exchange to avoid clear speculations and black market situations, as well as controlling attempts at dupes and exploits. Players exchange will only be accessible from inside safe zones. This new method comes directly from some of the lessons we learned about managing the economy in I:SS.
Goodbye Premium Accounts
Premium accounts will be retired and replaced with purchasable “Boosts” of varying durations.
 
Server Channels
These will be streamlined and will also include “novice” channels to make it easier for new players to learn the game.
 
Stronghold Servers
Stronghold servers are not planned for this game.
 
Private Server Rentals
We are still debating about how this should be done, but one thing is clear: server owners will have way more options to control their servers. However, for the Alpha and Closed Beta periods we’ll only be allowing players to set their rentals to be publicly available. This will be changed in the Open Beta, but we’ll first want to test game mechanics and server infrastructure as much as possible. At the end of the Alpha and Closed Beta, accounts that rented servers will be reimbursed their rental costs.
 
New Loot and Crafting Systems
I:NB takes place around 10 years after the zombie outbreak, so as a result there won’t be many of the original I:SS items left in the world such as food, meds, guns or ammo. For New Beginnings, we’ve emphasized finding “materials” and “components” and crafting usable items from them. For example, very rarely will players find factory-made bandages but players will find components that can be used to craft bandages. Rare “original” items will have better overall properties compared to crafted ones, but will be harder to acquire and thus may have a higher resale value on the Players Exchange.
 
Availability of Projectile Weapons
Factory-made guns will now be extremely rare. Most of the time you’ll have rely on melee weapons or home-brew guns that you craft from the loot found in the environment.
 
Melee Weapons
Our ultimate goal is to have variations of cool, craftable, and crazy melee weapons available, similar to what one might see in a series like Dead Rising. We will most likely have a limited supply available for the Alpha, but we will add more as we go.
 
Ammo, Magazines Changes
We have redesigned how you load ammo in the game. Magazines are separate items and by attaching a magazine to the gun, players define how many bullets the gun can hold. Players will have to find or craft ammo and load it into the gun, and will also be able to unload bullets from guns and stack them in your backpack.
 
Skills
We’re exploring a new way of allowing players to gain “survival” skills rather than “hardened” skills. This system will be community-driven so at launch it will not be implemented. We will be soliciting ideas and feedback from our players.
 
Repairs
Repairs using GD are gone. Instead you’ll need to find Parts and Tools to repair broken guns, cars, armor, etc.
 
Building in the game
We are adding the ability to build your own base on the main map. This is the biggest new feature we’re adding to the game. You’ll be able to build private bases on a claimed land lot and we are also working on communal building systems for land lots as well. This will not be part of our initial launch since the building system is still in an active development phase. We’ve started with our Barricades system and our intention is to expand it into a full-featured building UI experience.
 
We have a large number of other changes to the game mechanics, and covered lots of them here http://forums.infestationmmo.com/index.php?/topic/148552-infestation-new-beginning-what-do-we-know-so-far/, and we will be continuing to provide you  with updates and developments as we work.
 
So the big question then is: when will you have access to this game? 
Infestation: New Beginnings will launch in several phases: the Alpha sneak peak, Alpha access, Closed Beta access, and the Open Beta.
 
The Alpha sneak peek will be available to the following categories of players:
Legendary and Pioneer accounts
Anyone who spent at least $10 USD (or equivalent) on GC since March 31, 2014
Anyone who has played at least 200 hours since March 31, 2014
The goal of this phase is to challenge the game’s overall stability, servers, and systems. We believe players trying the game at this phase have been the most invested players in I:SS and can therefore provide the most valuable feedback that will affect development going forward.
Alpha access will be available to ALL I:SS players who have played more than 40 hours. This will be the first massive test of the game.
Closed Beta will be available to all players who have an active I:SS account.
Open Beta will be available for anyone to play.
We’re really excited about sharing all of this new stuff with you and we’ll do our best to support both I:SS players and new players who try out I:NB.

***BEGINNER***

* \* *COINS* In Mario Kart 8, you can hold up to 10 coins. Getting hit causes you to lose 3 and falling off the map loses 2. The first reason coins are important is the small instantaneous speed boost that every coin you collect gives you. This applies even to coins you get while already having the maximum of 10. The second reason only applies to your first 10 coins: each coin you pick up increases the top speed of your kart. Getting 10 coins in the first lap so that you have two full laps of top speed is a great way to keep an early lead. Of course it is worlds harder to hold on to your coins in multiplayer, so be on the lookout for always making your way back up to 10. Tip: Coins found in set locations on the track will re-spawn in multiplayer, but not in time trials. Tip 2: Often when you get hit and three coins fly out of you, one of them will be somewhere in front of you. If it's not too far off line, try to pick it up as you start moving again!

* \* *START BOOST* As with most Mario Kart games, you can get a healthy boost right off the starting line by timing hitting the gas correctly. The countdown in Mario Kart 8 starts at 3. Each number fades onto the screen and drops a small distance before stopping, and then giving way to the next number. The correct timing to get the biggest boost is to hit the accelerate button the moment the '2' in the countdown hits the lowest point of its drop, and then hold the button for the remainder of the countdown. Be careful though: ever so slightly early will lead to a spinout on the line, which is way worse than simply getting no boost at all. The start boost has different tiers of effectiveness depending on how late after the correct timing you start holding the button. Tip: The timing actually depends on how 'revved' your engine is, not directly on how long you've been holding the button. Starting the revving just as the 2 drops is the perfect timing to rev it up to the correct level to get the max boost. However if you think you hit too early and will risk a spinout, releasing the accelerator for a moment and then hitting it again, could get you revved up perfectly as well. Get a feel for this and you can change a spinout into a perfect start every time you would have otherwise messed up.

* \* *JUMP BOOST* This is a pretty easy speed boost to hit consistently and it will definitely shave off the seconds. Any time your kart is about to go airborne (whether from a small bump in the road, cresting a gentle hill, or hitting a big speed ramp) hit the jump button just as you're about to leave the ground. Your character will do a mid-air trick and get a decently-sized speed boost immediately after (you might be in the air if the jump deploys your glider, or you might be already on the ground if it was a small hop). That's about all for this trick. It's simple enough.

* \** *ZERO-G COLLISIONS* Ever notice the track spinning upside down and sideways and all kinds of crazy stuff? Did you also notice the blue glowing panel that precedes each of those sections and makes your wheels turn blue and face the ground like a hovercraft? That's Mario Kart 8's zero-gravity starting up and it makes for all kinds of awesome track architecture possibilities. Collisions with any other racer who also has zero-G wheels will give you a nice boost. If you're the one that gets hit, you'll get the boost, but you will also have gotten thrown off to the side pointed at the out of bounds area, at which point a boost might be unwelcome. So watch out! In the zero-G segments of the track, there will also be blue glowing bouncy pegs sticking up in the road. These might look like something to avoid at first, but hitting them will give you the same speed boost as hitting another zero-g kart. Tip: Try to just barely graze the boost pegs. You will get the boost slightly more quickly without your kart having to fudge itself to the side first.

* \** *CONSCIENTIOUS ITEM-USE* If you have an item, don't be so trigger-happy and ready to use it instantly. Wait for the perfect moment where it will have both the most benefit to you and the most detriment to everyone else. If you are in first place you are in full on defense-mode. Hold onto any item while in 1st for dear life because it WILL save you. When you get that awful little icon at the bottom of your screen telling you a shell is coming, throw your shell or banana backwards (hold down and hit the item button) at the last second. Your item and the oncoming one will collide and neutralize each other. Alternately (thanks /u/slotherina) holding the item button will lock your item behind you and act as a shield. Also save mushrooms and coins for a speed boost in case you do get hit. YOU CAN ALSO KILL BLUE SHELLS IF YOU ARE IN FIRST PLACE. If you have the horn that throws out a sound-pulse through the ground and you use it just as the blue shell has locked on and is about to hit, you will destroy it. MUSHROOMS: Look out for the many short cuts the tracks have. Often there will be a wide turn with a grassy middle area that can be entirely bypassed by mushrooming in a straight line through the grass. Keep your eyes peeled for the best shroom spots in each track. THE CRAZY-8 ITEM: This item is kinda nuts. You get 8 items circling you in a very intimidating shield. When you hit the item button, whichever item is directly in front of your kart will be the one that is used. If you are behind in the race, my best advice is to use the star as soon as possible and drop the shells, banana, bomb, and blooper ink as you pass your opponents. Then if you still have the mushroom and coin, use them strategically after the star is over. Beware when holding on to this item. Anyone colliding into you will steal whichever items they hit. It might be the bomb (which won't hurt you if someone rams it by the way), but then again, they might steal your star.

* \*** *DRIFTING* This is the big one. You will not get to a competitive skill level in this game without mastering drifting. There are two main reasons. The first is that drifting allows for incredible turn control, allowing you to stay very inside of the turn and setting up a great line for the next segment of the track. If you travel in straight lines and follow the inside of every turn, you'll cover the minimum amount of ground it takes to finish the race. With a few exceptions, this is ideal and you will finish faster. The second reason why drifting is so important is that it offers two tiers of speed boosts, depending on how long you've held the drift for. How it's done: When you're nearing the turn hit and hold the jump button and then turn your control stick (or tilt if you're using tilt controls) in the direction of the turn to begin the drift. The drift will continue for as long as you hold the jump button or until you get hit or end up in grass/other out of bounds areas. You'll instantly notice a big difference in the handling of your kart. While in a drift you have two main control options. If you turn *out* of the turn your drift will be very wide. If you turn *into* the turn your drift will be very tight and allow you to take much sharper turns. Note that neither is necessarily better and constantly shifting directions to match the curvature of the track is the best technique. Also note that holding out of the turn will not make you turn that way; both directions will curve you in the drift's direction. It is simply a matter how tightly you are turning. The second main facet of drifting is the boost it provides. If you have blue sparks from a short drift or orange sparks from a large one, this signals that you will get a speed boost when the drift is released. Blue is a minor one, orange is big. Tip: The drift boost (commonly called a mini-turbo) gets charged up as the drift continues. It charges quickly while you are turning into the drift, and more slowly as your drift widens and you are turning more against the drift. It's not always optimal to go tight to charge the mini-turbo faster if doing so will take you far out of line. Experiment with starting the drift at different distances and angles relative to the track's curve to find that sweet spot that lets you hug the inside AND charge up a max turbo. Tip 2: There are two main types of karts in terms of drifting ability: the inside drifters and the outside drifters. The inside drifters are mostly the 2-wheel sports bikes. They are capable of much tighter drifts and wont throw you to the outside when the drift starts like most 4-wheel outside drifters or non-sport bikes will do. This may sound like an instant advantage, but it's really a matter of preference. I've 3-starred every cup in both 150cc and mirror mode with an inside drift bike, but time trials is dominated by the outside drifters since they tend to be heavier. 

* \*** *DRAFTING/SLIPSTREAMING* If you ride closely behind an opponent's kart you'll notice some air currents flowing around your bike. This means you're caught in the slipstream behind their bike. Maintain this position for like 3 seconds and you'll start to fly past them in a boost. Combine this with the ""zero-G collisions"" technique I discussed earlier and your boost will stack and you will rocket past in a huge boost. Either way, hit the opponent. You will knock them away.The reason I've rated this one 3 stars is that you have to be very careful if the enemy you're drafting behind has any items trailing behind them or rotating around them.

,whowouldwin,"Since /u/ChandyC 's thread got deleted and I'd spent a little bit of time writing this I didn't want it to go to waste and actually got a bit curious. 

**Could this creation, a culmination of some of Marvel and DC's highest powers (+Batman) defeat CA Superman?**

The challenge was to, through any fictional means make Batman strong enough to fight CA Superman. 1 minute incapacitation for victory.

&gt;First Batman **steals Kyles white ring** in the same manner he stole Hal's in JL:War. Slight of hand and magic PIS.

&gt;Get the help of Martian Manhunter to implant certain memories/events creating personality differences that would enable him to wield it. Erasing all evidence that he was ever in his head. 

&gt;Get Flash to take him back in time to the moment where one of the Marvel/DC crossovers happened. Stay in the Marvelverse and **train under the mystic arts with Classic no-jobbing Dr. Strange.** The true goal of this training was all to defeat Doom. With Batman's prep and Classic Strange magic, Doom will fall when Bats wants him to fall. Which happens to be the second before he is about to **absorb the power of PR Beyonder.** Batman flies in with a signature batkick (dat prep and magic) and K.O's him, standing where Doom was absorbing the power of the Beyonder. 

&gt;Batman consults the Presence who recommends he obtain the power of the **White Phoenix of the Crown** (who has also held the universe in her hand). At on point the Shi'ar shattered the White Hot Room and the Phoenix Force went to Earth to resurrect Jean Grey and she became White Phoenix again. Batman will do the exact same thing he did to Doom and **intercept the transfer of power** (I'm so creative).

&gt;Batman will now jump back to the DC universe with a Dr. Strange spell (prove that he doesn't have one) after the events of Final Night. He'll **collect the essence of Zero Hour Hal** that is still lingering around the sun at the time, obtaining his power. 

&gt;Boom, **Zero Hour White Lantern the Beyonder-Phoenix Bat-god**

&gt;5D Imp, Power Cosmic, Odinforce, Speedforce are all negligible at this point. The only artifact I can think of that would be worthwhile would be the amulet the Living Tribunal obtained when he needed a power boost against Protege. But that's nothing much either. And fml, I couldn't find a way to give him Lucifer's powers.

That's pretty much what I got. I haven't actually read the Infinite Crisis but I heard CA supes actually got a bit banged up fighting some super monitor.

,electronic_cigarette,"This may seem like a rant, but it's not.  I'm trying to help.

1.  Celebrity involvement.  I know this seems silly, but celebrities have influence in Washington and with individuals.  Put an ad with a person suffering from the effects of tobacco on, and it's sad but never really made me want to quit.  Put a celebrity on enjoying a safer alternative and lots of people take notice.  It's sad, and it should be the other way around, but that's how Americans are now wired.  Start showing people vaping instead of smoking in movies and on TV.  Use early tobacco's own tactics.  Celebrities bring numbers, numbers influence lawmakers.  Sometimes.
2.  From a practical standpoint, make it easier and more affordable, and a positive experience.  The money is in the high priced batteries, tanks, supplies, etc.  But a lot of those things are priced high and require too much tinkering.  People say it'll never be as easy to vape as it is to pull a smoke out of a pack and light up.  Why not?  It exists right now with disposable, but the margins are thin and it's priced out of range.  The flavor may not be as good as the expensive equipment, but neither is smoking a cigarette, and we all got used to that.  Improve entry level equipment, make it not leak, not require tinkering, priced right and easy.  ""I'd like a pack of vapes.""
3.  Moving to more practical issues, it's time to move on from the EVOD/Protank type BCCs.  The EVOD kit is recommended a lot to new vapers, and I bought one as my second or third kit.  The kit was great, priced right, marketed correctly, but ultimately was more trouble than it was worth.  The heads are fundamentally flawed, which is why we flip grommets, rebuild, rewick, change to thick juice, add more wicking, and compensate for the fact that the heads are poorly designed.  Blame it on QA if you want, the design is flawed.  Double the coils if you want, rebuild, use cotton, etc., but remember the points above.  This is never going to work for average people.
4.  Start recommending things that *do* work.  Cartomizers, as much as people dislike them here lately, work.  Carto tanks work.  And when I say work, I mean they don't leak juice in my mouth, on my clothes, on my computer, and I get a good vape cheap.  Improve the design of carto tanks to make it easier, and you've got a good starter kit.  Top coils work better, too.  Yes, they leak sometimes, but a lot less than bottom coils if you don't rebuild.  But nothing beats a prefilled carto on a simple battery.  juice vendors take not.  Start making prefilled cartos with good juice, and price them low.  Use XXL to make them last longer, they're the same price.
5.  Labs.  Certifications.  The Medical Marijuana industry has labs for testing, and vendors pay for testing because it sells more product.  Data from testing will help in your fight against legislation.
6.  This is a rant.  MBV, I am targeting you.  Thug Juice is offensive.  It's a popular flavor, and is marketed towards a certain demographic.  But it's racist, you know it, and you need to rebrand.  I've personally decided to boycott your products until you do.  I don't expect others to do the same, but it's my own personal beliefs.  It's hard to take an industry seriously that allows one of its most popular, and from what I understand tasty, juices to invoke the image of being a ""thug"", that contains watermelon, grape and menthol.  Same with vendors marketing Drank or other such juices.  We should be better than this as an industry.  Newports were marketed towards young, black populations and they never called them ""Thug Smokes"".  Come on, guys.

In short, use technologies that work, create kits that don't leak and try to get closer to the pulling it out of a pack and lighting up ease of use, create testing that boosts the prestige of products, creating self regulation and collecting data, and get some celebrities on board.",,False,,0,,"Things that need to be changed in this industry for it to be taken more seriously, convert new users and get them off analogs, and make a lot of money for vendors",,,,,,0.0,,,False,t3_292ors,False,,,,,0.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},,,0,,,,self,False,favorite,,,,,True,,1403721303.0,,,,,,self.electronic_cigarette,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,Brasberry Mint,,,,,,t5_2qmlu,,,,,292ors,,,llamaspit,,25,,,,,,,/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/292ors/things_that_need_to_be_changed_in_this_industry/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/292ors/things_that_need_to_be_changed_in_this_industry/,,1403717703,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441296049.0,,,
,Watches,"[FULL REVIEW WITH PICS HERE](http://www.wristtimes.com/blog-1/2014/6/24/review-exhibition-casebacks-by-thomas-preik)

Since I began to collect watches, I always enjoyed ones with crystal case-backs that showed off the movement. I think it is an affliction particularly acute to new collectors. You get to see the beautiful mechanical movement, the intricate embellishment, and generally bond with the incredible engineering that goes into a watch you spent a lot of hard earned money to acquire.

While cruising the forums, I kept seeing posts of people showing off Rolexes (gasp) with exhibition case-backs. If you don't know why this is 'gasp' worthy, it's because Rolex, as near as makes no difference, hasn't made any production watches which have a windowed case-back. In fact it is a sure sign that a particular Rolex is fake. In my trips to Chinatown years ago with my first watch friend, I would play with the fake Rolexes, most of which had these windows on the back to see the movement. I guess they figure people who haven't actually seen a real one, would naturally assume since it is a nice watch you would be able to admire the movement from the back.

Recently my curiosity got the best of me and I decided to check out the case-back maker that everyone raved about, Thomas Preik from Custom Watch Concepts. They are based in Germany and claim to engineer their case-backs to be just as waterproof and corrosion resistant as the originals they replace. While they have the most case-backs for Rolex models, they also make them for the Omega Speedmaster Professional, a few Zenith Chronographs, vintage Breitling and Junghams.

From their website, I paid the $170 (including shipping) for a sapphire case-back to fit my vintage Rolex 1675. Since I don't wear it around water, and it isn't my primary watch, I felt it would add a little extra enjoyment to the watch. Less than a week later, having completely forgotten I ordered it late one night, a package from Germany showed up in my mailbox. The case-back was in a small plastic ziplock bag, and a catalog and pen from the company were also included. After examining it with a magnifying loupe, it was clear to me how well machined it was, and had no blemishes or scratches, the metal was even and strong, and the sapphire was thick and clear. Great quality control. Here is what it looks like:


The next morning I went to my local watchmaker to install it. I was going to do it myself but had trouble getting the original case-back off the watch and didn't want to do any damage to it. He put it on in only a few seconds, and said it lined up with the gasket correctly. I didn't pressure test it yet, but from what I hear they are built to handle a 100+ meter test.

Once I got to my desk at work, I took the watch off, turned it around, and loved what I saw.

For the first time in a while I got to enjoy watching my watch tick away, and I had never seen a Rolex movement in this way. The colored wheels and the subtle finishing on the rotor and main plate are fantastic, and the fact that this case-back had the same riveted ring to screw it off as the original Rolex one was icing on the cake.

I soon noticed there was another benefit as well. This particular case-back seemed to be about 2-3mm taller than the original. Custom Watch Concepts says that most of their case-backs are the exact same height as the original, but I think some of the vintage ones, like mine, are slightly taller.

I always felt that my 1675 wore a bit small, without noticeable wrist presence, and it dug into my wrist often. With the slight extra boost, it now sits proudly, with some clearance between the crown and my wrist, making it more comfortable and easy to wind or adjust without taking it off. 

From everything I've seen so far, I'm extremely happy with Thomas Preik's casebacks. The shipping was fast, the price was reasonable for the quality and it gives me back a joy I haven't experienced in quite a while. Highly recommended.


**INB4 flame war: I am aware that some people think this is a bad idea, a lame idea, a compromising and potentially damaging idea. I wouldn't do this to all my watches or a divers watch I regularly used, and I would ALWAYS KEEP THE ORIGINAL BACK, so it can be undone at any time. I have full respect for those who would never change anything on their watch, that's how I am for the most part, but this hobby is supposed to be fun and I intend to enjoy it as I see fit.**",,False,,0,,[Review] Exhibition casebacks for vintage watches by Thomas Preik / Custom Watch Concepts,,,,,,0.0,,,False,t3_292ab4,False,,,,,5.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},,,5,,,,self,False,,,,,,True,,1403713236.0,,,,,,self.Watches,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,t5_2qls5,,,,,292ab4,,,sennheiserz,,2,,,,,,,/r/Watches/comments/292ab4/review_exhibition_casebacks_for_vintage_watches/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/292ab4/review_exhibition_casebacks_for_vintage_watches/,,1403709636,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441296237.0,,,
,wiiu,"I'm not top tier status yet, but I've learned a lot from a bunch of places around the web and playing the game myself. I want to compile it all here for easy reference for anyone looking to improve. The guide is divided into beginner and advanced sections with each topic labeled as one or the other by my assessment of how fundamental it is to the game, and how difficult it is to perform. I've starred each technique with one to five stars based on difficulty (one being easiest). If there is anything you wish to know or would like me to add, leave a comment and I'll edit it in!

***BEGINNER***

* \* *COINS* In Mario Kart 8, you can hold up to 10 coins. Getting hit causes you to lose 3. The first reason coins are important is the small instantaneous speed boost that every coin you collect gives you. This applies even to coins you get while already having the maximum of 10. The second reason only applies to your first 10 coins: each coin you pick up increases the top speed of your kart. Getting 10 coins in the first lap so that you have two full laps of top speed is a great way to keep an early lead. Of course it is worlds harder to hold on to your coins in multiplayer, so be on the lookout for always making your way back up to 10. Tip: Coins found in set locations on the track will re-spawn in multiplayer, but not in time trials. Tip 2: Often when you get hit and three coins fly out of you, one of them will be somewhere in front of you. If it's not too far off line, try to pick it up as you start moving again!

* \* *START BOOST* As with most Mario Kart games, you can get a healthy boost right off the starting line by timing hitting the gas correctly. The countdown in Mario Kart 8 starts at 3. Each number fades onto the screen and drops a small distance before stopping, and then giving way to the next number. The correct timing to get the biggest boost is to hit the accelerate button the moment the '2' in the countdown hits the lowest point of its drop, and then hold the button for the remainder of the countdown. Be careful though: ever so slightly early will lead to a spinout on the line, which is way worse than simply getting no boost at all. The start boost has different tiers of effectiveness depending on how late after the correct timing you start holding the button. Tip: The timing actually depends on how 'revved' your engine is, not directly on how long you've been holding the button. Starting the revving just as the 2 drops is the perfect timing to rev it up to the correct level to get the max boost. However if you think you hit too early and will risk a spinout, releasing the accelerator for a moment and then hitting it again, could get you revved up perfectly as well. Get a feel for this and you can change a spinout into a perfect start every time you would have otherwise messed up.

* \* *JUMP BOOST* This is a pretty easy speed boost to hit consistently and it will definitely shave off the seconds. Any time your kart is about to go airborne (whether from a small bump in the road, cresting a gentle hill, or hitting a big speed ramp) hit the jump button just as you're about to leave the ground. Your character will do a mid-air trick and get a decently-sized speed boost immediately after (you might be in the air if the jump deploys your glider, or you might be already on the ground if it was a small hop). That's about all for this trick. It's simple enough.

* \** *ZERO-G COLLISIONS* Ever notice the track spinning upside down and sideways and all kinds of crazy stuff? Did you also notice the blue glowing panel that precedes each of those sections and makes your wheels turn blue and face the ground like a hovercraft? That's Mario Kart 8's zero-gravity starting up and it makes for all kinds of awesome track architecture possibilities. Collisions with any other racer who also has zero-G wheels will give you a nice boost. If you're the one that gets hit, you'll get the boost, but you will also have gotten thrown off to the side pointed at the out of bounds area, at which point a boost might be unwelcome. So watch out! In the zero-G segments of the track, there will also be blue glowing bouncy pegs sticking up in the road. These might look like something to avoid at first, but hitting them will give you the same speed boost as hitting another zero-g kart. Tip: Try to just barely graze the boost pegs. You will get the boost slightly more quickly without your kart having to fudge itself to the side first.

* \** *CONSCIENTIOUS ITEM-USE* If you have an item, don't be so trigger-happy and ready to use it instantly. Wait for the perfect moment where it will have both the most benefit to you and the most detriment to everyone else. If you are in first place you are in full on defense-mode. Hold onto any item while in 1st for dear life because it WILL save you. When you get that awful little icon at the bottom of your screen telling you a shell is coming, throw your shell or banana backwards (hold down and hit the item button) at the last second. Your item and the oncoming one will collide and neutralize each other. Alternately (thanks /u/slotherina) holding the item button will lock your item behind you and act as a shield. Also save mushrooms and coins for a speed boost in case you do get hit. YOU CAN ALSO KILL BLUE SHELLS IF YOU ARE IN FIRST PLACE. If you have the horn that throws out a sound-pulse through the ground and you use it just as the blue shell has locked on and is about to hit, you will destroy it. MUSHROOMS: Look out for the many short cuts the tracks have. Often there will be a wide turn with a grassy middle area that can be entirely bypassed by mushrooming in a straight line through the grass. Keep your eyes peeled for the best shroom spots in each track. THE CRAZY-8 ITEM: This item is kinda nuts. You get 8 items circling you in a very intimidating shield. When you hit the item button, whichever item is directly in front of your kart will be the one that is used. If you are behind in the race, my best advice is to use the star as soon as possible and drop the shells, banana, bomb, and blooper ink as you pass your opponents. Then if you still have the mushroom and coin, use them strategically after the star is over. Beware when holding on to this item. Anyone colliding into you will steal whichever items they hit. It might be the bomb (which won't hurt you if someone rams it by the way), but then again, they might steal your star.

* \*** *DRIFTING* This is the big one. You will not get to a competitive skill level in this game without mastering drifting. There are two main reasons. The first is that drifting allows for incredible turn control, allowing you to stay very inside of the turn and setting up a great line for the next segment of the track. If you travel in straight lines and follow the inside of every turn, you'll cover the minimum amount of ground it takes to finish the race. With a few exceptions, this is ideal and you will finish faster. The second reason why drifting is so important is that it offers two tiers of speed boosts, depending on how long you've held the drift for. How it's done: When you're nearing the turn hit and hold the jump button and then turn your control stick (or tilt if you're using tilt controls) in the direction of the turn to begin the drift. The drift will continue for as long as you hold the jump button or until you get hit or end up in grass/other out of bounds areas. You'll instantly notice a big difference in the handling of your kart. While in a drift you have two main control options. If you turn *out* of the turn your drift will be very wide. If you turn *into* the turn your drift will be very tight and allow you to take much sharper turns. Note that neither is necessarily better and constantly shifting directions to match the curvature of the track is the best technique. Also note that holding out of the turn will not make you turn that way; both directions will curve you in the drift's direction. It is simply a matter how tightly you are turning. The second main facet of drifting is the boost it provides. If you have blue sparks from a short drift or orange sparks from a large one, this signals that you will get a speed boost when the drift is released. Blue is a minor one, orange is big. Tip: The drift boost (commonly called a mini-turbo) gets charged up as the drift continues. It charges quickly while you are turning into the drift, and more slowly as your drift widens and you are turning more against the drift. It's not always optimal to go tight to charge the mini-turbo faster if doing so will take you far out of line. Experiment with starting the drift at different distances and angles relative to the track's curve to find that sweet spot that lets you hug the inside AND charge up a max turbo. Tip 2: There are two main types of karts in terms of drifting ability: the inside drifters and the outside drifters. The inside drifters are mostly the 2-wheel sports bikes. They are capable of much tighter drifts and wont throw you to the outside when the drift starts like most 4-wheel outside drifters or non-sport bikes will do. This may sound like an instant advantage, but it's really a matter of preference. I've 3-starred every cup in both 150cc and mirror mode with an inside drift bike, but time trials is dominated by the outside drifters since they tend to be heavier. 

* \*** *DRAFTING/SLIPSTREAMING* If you ride closely behind an opponent's kart you'll notice some air currents flowing around your bike. This means you're caught in the slipstream behind their bike. Maintain this position for like 3 seconds and you'll start to fly past them in a boost. Combine this with the ""zero-G collisions"" technique I discussed earlier and your boost will stack and you will rocket past in a huge boost. Either way, hit the opponent. You will knock them away.The reason I've rated this one 3 stars is that you have to be very careful if the enemy you're drafting behind has any items trailing behind them or rotating around them.

I'm out of characters. Hope this helps someone!

,razorbacks,"For those of that don't know, ESPN U has been replaying some of the bowl games from this past year. I got to watch part of NIU's loss to Utah State, and started to wonder what our game might look like against NIU this upcoming season so I decided to look at the numbers.

NIU will be losing their stud QB Jordan Lynch, who was the lifeblood of their offense the past two years. They had a QB battle this past Spring, but not one of the 3 competitors came out as the clear cut starter and the starter won't be announced until the end of Summer camp. 

Despite the huskies losing Lynch, they return 8 offensive players, 4 of whom are on the offensive line. NIU is expected to have a solid 1-2 punch on the ground with Cameron Stingily (1,119 rushing yards in 2013) and Akeem Daniels (returning from injury). These two backs should have a solid line to run behind to help the uncertainty at QB. Their two leading receivers return as well, Tommylee Lewis (lead team with 86 receptions) and Da'Ron Brown (lead team with 752 receiving yards and 9 TDs). 


On the flip side, Arkansas is returning 7 offensive starters but that number is somewhat skewed. With the addition of Cameron Jefferson at OL (graduate transfer from UNLV) the hogs get someone at a position of need (left guard) who has been a 3 year starter. If we're willing to count Jefferson as a returning starter, that puts our OL at 4 returning starters with the 5th spot (center) being filled by JuCo transfer Sebastian Tretola. The hogs should have a line that can gel together, and similar to NIU, provide a steady running game for our RB stable. 


So how will each team's defense fair against a respective experienced OL and proven RBs? Lets take a look at some more numbers...


NIU's collective OL weighs in at 1,493 lbs, with their lightest player at the RT position coming in at 284. Arkansas' collective DL weighs 1,160 lbs, with our lightest players at DE (Flowers and Wise) both weighing 267. The difference in weight between NIU's OL and Arkansas' DL is 333 lbs, in favor of NIU. 


Obviously the OL will typically outweigh the DL given on the duties expected at their respective positions, but lets take a look at Arkansas' OL compared to NIU's DL.


Arkansas' combined weight at OL (with Jefferson and Tretola, not Charpentier and Smothers) comes in at 1,606 lbs, which outweighs NIU's OL by 113 lbs (AKA me in 7th grade). The NIU DL weighs in at 1,049 lbs, which is 111 lbs less than the Arkansas DL.


So when we compare the trenches we see:

**Ark OL: 1,606 lbs vs NIU DL: 1,049 lbs** *Ark. outweighs by 557 lbs*

**NIU OL: 1,493 lbs vs Ark DL: 1,160 lbs** *NIU outweighs by 333 lbs*


You're probably thinking, ""Pablo, what the hell are you trying to get at?"" First off, my name isn't Pablo. Secondly, you'll just need to stick with me here.


Considering each OL is the most dense unit of returning starters for each team, I thought the OL matchup with each DL was going to be the most crucial in the game. Arkansas will win or lose games because of the play of the offensive line, since we'll be relying heavily on them for us to rush (hopefully) for 200 yards. If we can't win the trenches on offense, then that kills our offense. We can't (yet) 100% depend on our passing game to perform and win games for us. 


I think NIU is in a similar boat as us this year, and will be relying on the experience of the OL to out-physical the defense and run the ball effectively. Without that, the chances of winning become slim for both Arkansas and NIU this year.Now lets take a deeper look at who each OL will be lined up against.


Arkansas probably gets the edge here. The huskies don't return a single starter across the DL, but 3 of their 4 defensive linemen this upcoming year will be upperclassmen. I'm sure they've gotten experience throughout their 3-4 years on the team, but having an entirely new starting cast on the line can be difficult. There isn't a leader that knows the ropes and has the experience of being a starter, so if they start to get pushed around and are made ineffective then I expect them to look lost with no one to look to for experience or help.


Arkansas only has one returning starter along the DL and that is senior DE Trey Flowers. Flowers was apart of a tenacious DE combo last year with Chris Smith, and should take the lead role along the trenches for the Arkansas DL. Deatrich Wise should complement Flowers nicely as his fellow DE, giving fans flashes of his pass rushing ability when he constantly applied pressure and was involved in tackles against Johnny Manziel. Darius Philon will take one of the starting DT spots, coming off a great Spring. Philon saw plenty of action last year when senior DT Robert Thomas had a season ending injury, so Philon has a solid amount of experience coming into this season. 


Now lets bring this rant full circle. To combat the inexperience as a starter along the DL for Arkansas and for NIU, I looked at the size of each OL and DL. The difference in size favors the hogs, which I think will help them in this game. The Arkansas DL is only outweighed by 333 lbs as opposed to NIU's DL being outweighed by 557 lbs. 


I believe that the drastic weight difference between the Arkansas OL and the NIU DL, combined with the NIU inexperience along the DL, will allow Arkansas to win the battle in the trenches on offense.


I think it's more of a toss up for Arkansas on the DL against NIU's OL though. The weight difference is over 200 lbs less than what it is for NIU's DL facing Arkansas OL, and at least Arkansas returns a starter along the DL, but still having 4 starters return on the OL for NIU is a huge advantage. This matchup will be closer than the Arkansas OL facing the NIU DL, in my opinion and will be the deciding factor of the game. If Arkansas' DL gets pushed around by NIU's OL and they are able to rush effectively on us, I think we could be in for some trouble. Let's not forget that NIU has been winning a ton of games the past two seasons (23) and their players have a winning attitude about them. They were able to stun Iowa, at Iowa, in their first game last year. These guys know how to win and don't have a problem with being an underdog, in fact they love it. They definitely play with a chip on their shoulder, and it scares the hell out of me.


One more thing that I noticed that should boost Arkansas' chances of winning, are the games that each team has leading up to our matchup on September 20th. 

NIU's games leading up to the Arkansas game, are:

**@ Northwestern**

**@ UNLV**

**@ Arkansas**


Arkansas' schedule leading up to playing NIU is:

**Nicholls State**

**@ Texas Tech**

**NIU**


While playing at TTU the week before isn't desirable, it certainly isn't as bad as what NIU has to go through...when they visit us on the 20th, it will be their 3rd straight away game against a quality opponent. No bye weeks in between, just 3 straight weeks of traveling. I'm sure that some fatigue will set into the NIU players, and their moral might be low having to play as the bad guys on the road for the 3rd..straight...week...


I know I've basically just written a book and am shocked that any of y'all are actually reading the whole thing, but this game is a big one on our schedule this year. Our out of conference games are crucial for us this year, and we need to win all 4 of them if we want to have a chance of making a bowl game.

TL;DR: The trenches are important, experience is thin on D for both teams, the schedule leading up to the game is brutal for NIU (3 away games in a row).

,nosleep,"I was small enough to be led by hand, but instead my mother insisted I hold fast to the small bars of her shopping cart. Even at my young age the physical disconnection was not lost on me. It was explained away as simply an easier way to manage my whereabouts without hindering my mother’s ability to shop. On this particular day the list of items sought after was unusually short, yet never one to break her customs, my mother pushed a shopping cart to and fro. She collected her meager pile of items and crammed them in the metal seat designed for the likes of me so as not to have to bend and fish the items back out when it came time to pay.


 It was not until after check-out that she deviated from her normal shopping routine. Normally while pushing a cart filled to spilling capacity she would make her way to our parked van, load it up, and abandon the cart in a near-by parking space to inconvenience the next customer. This process left me, as always, gripping the bars on the side of the cart until we had crossed the parking lot. Only when I heard the clicking of the van doors unlocking prompted by the keyless entry was I instructed to get in the van and buckle myself in my booster seat.


 On this day, however, the few items we had needed fit perfectly into two plastic bags. And on this day I witnessed my mother do something I have never before. She walked the cart with its screeching, uneven wheels to the cart return corral inside the store, pushing it into line with its waiting brothers. Then, with both bags dangling from a single wrist, she proceeded to the exit. Left with nothing to hold onto as she had uncharacteristically abandoned our cart prematurely, I instinctually reached out for her hand. At that same moment, she was lifting her cell phone to her ear, leaving my hand to grasp at empty air. 


With no concern as to my whereabouts she gingerly breached the first set of automatic doors with me hot on her heels. It is here, in the space between the two sets of automatic doors that three cleverly placed quarter machines sit, mocking children as they pass. Before this day I had never been to this magical spot without a hand firmly clamped on cold steel to forcefully drag me away. It is because of my simple, childish mind reveling in this glory that I made a fatal mistake. For as I stood there mesmerized, face pressed against the glass of a machine that promised mouth-watering candy for a measly quarter, my mother with her phone still plastered to her ear passed through the second set of automatic doors. As the vacuum once again sealed itself as both sets of doors sat static and firmly shut, I noticed I was alone. At first I was unsettled knowing once I was discovered not to be at my mother’s side I would surely be punished. Then, as I approached the automatic doors my mother had just passed through and they did not open, did not shutter, did not register my slight weight, I panicked. 


I screamed, I banged, I whimpered hoping my mother might hear me. Surely she would turn back and see me trapped in my now claustrophobic tomb and come release me. It resolved in me this would not be so. For no matter how loud I was, her attention stay fixed on her phone call. To my ever growing dismay my attempts to gain attention did not go unnoticed. Sitting just before the first set of automatic doors I had passed through was a wooden bench. I had noticed this bench on other occasions. Usually a tired, elderly person chose here to rest as their younger, more agile children pulled the car around for them. Sometimes people chose this place to wait for the local bus to take them home for the day. I believe that was the initial intentions of the man now occupying this bench, that was, until his eyes perked up to attention at my calamity. See my mother got a horrible parking spot today at the far end of the lot and by the time she unlocks our van doors, I will be long gone.

,swtor,"The Tao of the Bloodmark


The tier three Scouts, Bloodmark (Imperial) and Spearpoint (Republic) represent a significant design departure from the previous Scout class ships.


Most notably, the lack of Barrel Roll as an Engine option and the complete lack of Thrusters as minor components.


[EDIT]The ship has been given a modest base speed boost, ostensibly to make up for these shortfalls.[/EDIT]
As pointed out below, I'm wrong on that: All scouts have the same base stats.


These are widely considered to be grievous flaws in the design, earning the ship a reputation as something you fly for ‘fun’, or for the initial spawn in a Domination round before switching to a battlescout, rather than as a serious tool in Galactic Starfighter.


I believe these views are seriously misguided and this remarkable little ship is being spurned by many for no legitimate reasons.


The T3 scout brings a couple of very neat tricks to the table. The most obvious of which is its one unique component: the Tensor Field system ability.

[Edit: T-Field Description]
Tensor Field gives the Bloodmark and all allies within range a significant boost to speed and turning ability. At tier four, you can choose between an Accuracy Buff or an Evasion Buff for your teammates. At Tier five the choices are an extra +15% speed boost or an engine recharge buff.

You'll need to be careful when letting T-Field off when defending nodes as you're giving your teammates a substantial and usually quite surprising boost to maneuverability. This can cause accidents when precision flying.

Tensor Field’s most obvious use is right at the start of a Domination match and from experience, if one team uses t-field and the other doesn’t, it’s almost a guaranteed win for the side with a T3 scout (assuming no huge experience gaps between the sides).


Even at base level, the extra speed boost is enough that Bombers can get to very close range of a node before running out of engine power.


Once fully upgraded, taking boost recharge at tier five, your heavy Gunship and Bomber support craft teammates will arrive on-scene long before enemy strike fighters can get into range to cap the node.
A teammate in a fast scout can get deep into enemy approach lanes and cause all kinds of havoc with the benefit of your tensor field boost at the start.


The occasional enemy fast scout that turns up to a node finds a very hot reception closing in fast.
Beyond that initial use, tensor field has a myriad other beneficial applications in node defence.
I really do recommend taking boost recharge rather than the extra speed as the final upgrade. I used the extra speed for a long time, but friendly bomber pilots convinced me to try the boost recharge instead which, incidentally, turns Tensor Field into a sort of poor man’s Booster Recharge. If you’ve ever played a booster-recharge Blackbolt or Sting, it plays very similarly.


I simply cannot stress enough how vital this one component is to the whole ship. It’s the only component unique to the Bloodmark and, simply, if you’re using something else you’re doing it wrong. You’d be better off in any of the other scout class boats if you leave Tensor field at the door.


The other useful trick Bloodmarks bring with them is the interesting secondary weapon selections available. (I can hear the naysayers laughing now…)


I’ve spent a ton of requisition and have fully upgraded all three options.


First up, yes, the naysayers are correct: Ion Missile is all but useless, especially compared to the other offerings.


The EMP Missile is a very solid choice. 


With some co-ordination from teammates, a single, well placed EMP missile can shutdown even the most heavily defended node for 15s along with wiping out even the most carefully constructed nest of mines and other nefarious instruments of doom.


Having tried all three, I’ve decided the crown jewels in the Bloodmark’s secondary weapon loadout are those Thermite Torpedos.


They take an age to lock on, have a frustratingly small targeting reticle and seem to be slightly more buggy than other missiles, but pretty much anything you hit with a thermite torp is most likely going to die.


If it’s not the whomping great wodge of damage up front or the DoT that follows, it’s the horrific -100% DR debuff it applies to its target for the next 15s that lead to inevitable demise. 


Land a thermite torp and follow it up with a couple of shots and even a full-hull bomber is smoking cloud of flaming debris somewhere off the Kuat Mesa.


I suggest taking the four degree extra firing arc at tier four instead of the speed boost. Thermite’s have a huge range, so unless someone uses a missile lock break move, your torp will chase them halfway across the map. Bigger arc means more lock-ons, which means flipping off more torps overall.


A neat trick is to hold the lock-on while boosting at the target and letting the torp drop right on top of them.


I also take the 6% Accuracy/2 degree firing arc crewmember: Jaesa (Imp) or Qyzen(?) for yet more torpedo firing arc.


Primary weapons are really up to each individual pilot. Personally, I use Laser Cannon because I reckon they look cool hanging off the wings of both the Bloodmark and the Blackbolt.


The shield component is also a mixed grab bag depending on personal preferences.


I resisted the knee-jerk impulse to take Distortion Field and opted for Repair Probes with the ammo replenish at tier three.


Distortion Field really should need no introduction, it’s the Meta choice of scouts for a reason.


Switching out Disto Field requires a significant change in the tactics you use with this ship. Frontal jousting just got very dangerous.


The flipside is that if you survive, you’ll heal yourself and teammates up to full-hull in short order along with infinite Thermite Torps.


The lack of Barrel Roll as an Engine choice is what really sets this ship apart from its scout class brethren.
I’ve experimented with Snap Turn and Interdiction Drive engines so far.


Of the two, Snap Turn is, imho, far superior and allows for some rather cool moves such as diving straight at a damage overcharge power-up in a TDM with someone in pursuit. Collect the power-up and hitting Snap Turn before face-planting the wall, then getting some shots into your harasser being one that comes to mind.


Another neat use of it is to lure people into chasing you back towards your teammates.


Interdiction drive promises a lot and fails to deliver. I tried disto-field/interdiction over repair/snap. A setup which lasted all of three matches for the expenditure of 20k odd Ship Requisition.


Distortion Field/Snap Turn, I confess, would probably be a better solo-ship setup.


Your mileage may vary.


Sensors, the ‘useless’ component on any ship are really your choice. I run Dampening on my Blackbolt and Range on the Bloodmark.


As for Capacitor, again, it’s all down to what suits you best. Personally, I run with Damage, although on this particular ship, I’ve also made very good use of Range.


Your Reactor choice is similar, either Turbo or Large, again depending on your personal playstyle and preferences. If you’re a nimble fighter good at ducking fire, Turbo will probably help more.


If, like me, you suffer a little from lag (I’m on a ~250+ ping), you may find that Large reactors offer more protection.


Armour should be pretty self explanatory, Lightweight is the Meta Choice for good reason, it’s the best option for Scouts.


I alluded to crewmembers earlier and as mentioned, I have Jaesa for the extra firing arc and accuracy.
Vector gets a look in Defensive for the extra evasion and shield power.


My Tactical choice is Mako, mostly for the Running Interference active co-pilot ability and the boosts to sensors (hey, if you’re forced to have sensors, may as well have good ones). 


She also has a few cute sayings when you blow stuff up, an especially stylish kill gets rewarded with “That’s going on the holo-net!”


Down in Engineering is my good friend and almost constant flying companion, Blizz the Jawa! Seriously, I use him on pretty much every ship I fly (and I use C2N2 on pretty much every Republic ship).


The 10% extra engine capacity and -13% engine costs Blizz brings to the table are simply far too powerful to pass on for a ship that relies on agility and speed to be effective.


I generally use Running Interference as my co-pilot ability on this ship, but this could easily be substituted for Concentrated Fire if you like.


Now, with all of that said, there are a few small changes I would like to see to this ship.


Mainly, I’d like to see the devs ditch the Capacitor minor component and replace it with Thrusters.


This alone would catapault the Bloodmark up into the sort of territory the Sting currently inhabits.


Adding Barrel Roll to the mix would also make it much more “scout-like”, but I’m coming to terms with Snap Turn and actually enjoy the change.


Many have called for the Interdiction Missile to be added to the secondary weapons lists. I’m not 100% sure myself. I’d certainly give them a try if it happens, but having gotten used to Thermites, that kind of upfront damage is really hard to say no to.


I would also like to see a Bloodmark style scout that eschews the secondary weapon for a second System ability, adding in EMP Pulse to the available list. I confess, I’d probably use Tensor Field and Targeting Telemetry in such a ship.


Well, there you have it, my take on the T3 scouts. 


An interesting little ship that, when played to its strengths, can turn the tide of battle quicker than an Ion railgun.


Played badly, or not played to its natural strengths, it’s a gimped Blackbolt without barrel roll.


It lacks the insane burst damage ability of the Sting and misses out on the myriad of multiple set-up options the Blackbolt can lay claim to in exchange for some truly unmatched group utility and the kind of support that will have heavy-ship users begging you to group with them.

,magicTCG,"Now I'll begin by prefacing this post with this statement: in NO way is this meant to be a rant against net-decking, net-deckers, or anything of that nature. I have net-decked before, and I'll probably do it again. Additionally, this post pertains primarily to competitive play, although casual formats can certainly be effected.

Okay now onto my post. Is brewing a lost art? I personally grew up in a time where the internet was barely even a thing yet, and I was also playing magic. There were very few outlets that I knew of to find information about magic, and my friends and I were largely playing with collections comprised primarily of booster pack rare's and pre-constructed decks. Flash-forward to present day, and I'm back into the game and am also playing semi-competitively. Like I mentioned previously, I have net-decked, and will likely continue to net-deck to some degree. That being said, I have found myself becoming quickly disillusioned with constructed play once I had begun to see how limited the number of ""good"" decks were available to me. Maybe that's just how standard is, and maybe I could find greater inspiration from other formats such as modern &amp; legacy, but overall it seems as though brewing is no longer widely accepted in competitive play. Strangely enough, this seems to be at odds with how the game was originally designed, i.e., a collectible card game that players would be able to improve their existing decks by collecting new cards and discovering new strategies/interactions, etc. What I've noticed is that people generally seem to be very afraid of trying new things and exploring alternative strategies, and I find myself missing a part of magic that I remember quite fondly from my early experiences with the game. Even when I do brew and come up with something potentially strong, I find myself hesitant to post it online or show anyone I know for fear of ridicule (which may seem silly to some but is very real for me). So without further ado, what are you guys' thoughts? Are there other brewers out there that feel the same way? Am I spewing nonsense? I'd love to have a conversation about this with you guys. Let me know in the comments!

**EDIT:** I think my point got kinda lost, perhaps even misinterpreted as an anti-netdecking/anti-competitive argument. Not so. I tend to be kind of scatterbrained so I'll try to make this as to the point as possible. I think the advent of net-decking and the heightened awareness of competitive magic (and competitive decks) has detracted somewhat from the spirit of the game's original design, and I miss that (despite it being a useful tool). Furthermore, brewing is no longer as widely accepted/practiced in competitive circles, and I think this cheapens the experience of the game and limits the possibilities that the game has to offer to those who enjoy tournament magic.",,False,,0,,Is brewing a lost art?,,,,,,0.0,,,False,t3_28u1ma,False,,,,,0.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},,,0,,,,default,1403493413,,,,,,True,,1403489235.0,,,,,,self.magicTCG,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,t5_2qn5f,,,,,28u1ma,,,[deleted],,35,,,,,,,/r/magicTCG/comments/28u1ma/is_brewing_a_lost_art/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/28u1ma/is_brewing_a_lost_art/,,1403485635,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441300142.0,,,
,Warframe,"DEar Tenno, we have intercepted several Grineer scouts leaving the breeding grounds with samples of the hives. We suspect they are attempting to recreate these hives to produce more Grineer that are stronger.

Intercept these Grineer scouts in order to make sure they do not report back to their leaders with these samples. We fear that they will be on Eris, where the Hives are, and Uranus, where Tyl Regor is in charge of Grineer manufacturing

Part 2

The Grineer have successfully created a version of the pits, and it's getting ugly over there (Uglier than normal Grineer) There's been an unintended side effect of the new pits and the new grineer are stronger faster and uglier. They deteriorate far faster than regularly though, which gives us the advantage. We need to take down these plants and destroy the armies of the grineer. If we can hold out long enough then we will be able to take down these plants and save the system from complete grineer domination.

POint System- Part 1
There are special capture missions where you have to capture grineer spies by fighting large amounts of infested- Eris or Large amounts of Grineer- Uranus

Every Capture gives you A blueprint part for the plan for the breeding pit. When all the parts are collected you advance to part two

Part 2- Go to the pits in a series of Sabotage missions! Receive 2 points per run depending on the Node you're on
Easy- 5 Points per successful run and Extra 2 if you can destroy the Soldiers taht remain

Medium- 7 Points and 3 if you can beat the soldiers

Hard- 9 and 6 if you can beat the soldiers

Get 20 points- Badge

Get 50 PointsWraith of some sort- Amphis Wraith?

Get 100 points- Hind Wraith- Damage Boost, fire rate boost

Plot twist- To get the Hind you have to beat the final boss- Steroid Tyl Regor

Becomes Twice his usual size and more bulgy
More Health

,magicTCG,"Before I start, let me first explain why I was first driven away from Magic for a while. I used to collect like crazy. I started the game when I was in 6th grade (right before 6th edition). When I got older and had my own job, I would start each new set/expansion with a booster box. I had thousands of cards. Then my apartment was broken into and my binders full of rares and ultra rares was stolen along with a few decks. Not all my rares were in that binder so I was ok for while. But then I lost my job, and soon after I got evicted from my apartment while I was visiting my mom (based on the speed I'm pretty sure it was illegally done). They just tossed my stuff out on the streets. That included any cards I did not bring with me. Anything that wasn't picked over was ruined by the time I got there. So this absolutely killed my interest in Magic for a long time.  
  
Then recently I wanted to get into TCGs again. So I went back and explored some I played previously. Pokemon, while has some gimmicks, actually evolved pretty well. Yu-Gi-Oh on the other hand became nothing but gimmicks and became a convoluted mess. However it was Yu-Gi-Oh that made me realize how great magic is.  
  
I always thought it was insane in magic to have so many one word ""rules"" (e.g., Flying, Vigilance, Hexproof), but Yu-gi-oh does not have such things nor does it have any sort of short hand. So each and ever card has to explain the rule in Yu-Gi-Oh for every one it applies to in as long-winded as possible. What Magic gets done in a ""Enchanted [creature type] gets +2/+2"", Yu-Gi-Oh says ""Equip a Monster with this equip card. The monster gets 500 more attack points. The monster gets 500 more defense points. The monster's attack and defense points return to normal if [insert the card's name here] is put into the graveyard. If it is not a [Creature type] put [insert card name here] into the grave yard."" No, this is *not* an exaggeration for those who have not played that game. Once you know the rules to Magic, the shorthand and the one word rules just work better.  
  
Obviously, its not just how the card rules are written that makes me love Magic. Its the fact **every** card has a purpose or can at least be useful. Even if not immediately evident, the cards that seem detrimental can provide a huge advantage if combined correctly. You may have a 1/1 no ability creature, but its fast to get out and doesn't limit you. There are cards in Yu-Gi-Oh and Pokemon that are nothing but booster pack filler where they may as well have filled those spots with blank cards.  
  
I think the biggest thing I love about Magic is that there are no absurd limitations. You aren't limited to only having a certain number of creatures cast, attacking, defending, or in play nor how many spells you can have in effect. Yes, Magic can get out of hand because of the lack of limitations, but its a game built around manipulating rules. Other games just fall apart.  
  
I'm excited about getting back into Magic again, but I still miss my old card collection. Its hard to not get upset when I look through the remains of my collection in hopes of finding a card I knew I at one time had.

,bravefrontier,"Hi guys, welcome to the latest New Unit Analysis. Today we'll be taking a look at [Estia](/cg) the tragic princess from the latest vortex dungeon.

We'll be comparing her to a few light units and discussing her current niche and future prospects. The selection for this group of comparisons is a bit different from the norm since she's not a top tier unit and free to boot, so it's probably more useful to see how she compares to a spectrum of units of varying strengths than just the best of the best.

Disclaimer: As always, I try to keep these as objective as possible, but they're ultimately my opinion and yours may differ. Please read them with an open mind and a view to make your own decisions. :&gt;

[Estia vs. Sola, Aem, Vanila, Atro](/cg)

[Estia's Stats:](http://bravefrontierglobal.wikia.com/wiki/Princess_Estia)

[Estia's Stat Comparison Chart](TBD) Thanks to /u/VortexRyan!

Lord: HP 4986 ATK 1488 DEF 1300 REC 1650

LS: 50% boost to REC of friendly Light Units

Hit count: 10 (drop check count 2/hit)

BB: 10 hit multiple target Light element damage and boost to all allies DEF for 3 turns (24BC to fill, DEF +39%, damage modifier +134%)

* First of all apologies for the incomplete information. I thought it was more important to get this analysis out before her event ends than wait until her final form is available to have all the information present but it should be enough to give her a fair analysis in any case. Looking at her stats, you can tell straight away that she's not going to be a top tier unit. Her HP is on the low side of average and will only drop off in viability as the metagame advances and while her ATK and DEF are perfectly useable at the moment, they're still only average at best and not going to be as effective in the future. She does have fantastic REC for a light unit though. Her LS is designed to try and remedy Light's biggest nemesis in that a lot of its top tier units have terrible REC but it's very limited in its scope of use and most mono-light teams would much appreciate a damage boosting leader skill over this one. Her BB is her main selling point at the moment, being a multiple target attack that also raises DEF, meaning it's currently one of a kind (the rest are only available on SBBs). Though how useful this niche is will depend on how strong her buff actually is. You'd hope for at least 50% though.

* First up I've chosen [Sola](/cg), by sheer virtue that she's also a free unit and thus there's value in comparing the two. Compared to Sola, Estia has better HP (+285), ATK (+175) and REC (+50) but less DEF (-185). That DEF advantage probably wins over Estia's HP advantage (though not by all that much) meaning Sola's better off defensively but loses out significantly in ATK and not so significantly in REC. Since the defensive difference between the two units isn't particularly large, Estia probably has the stat advantage here. She also can be assumed to have a better hit count but probably not by a large margin. Comparing their BBs, Sola's is pretty neat, boasting the ability to inflict elemental weakness damage on 3 elements and neutral damage on the rest while Estia supports the party by boosting DEF and also deals at least neutral damage to all elements by virtue of being a light unit. I think overall Estia has the more useful BB since DEF boosting is quite valuable for mono-light, particularly if you don't have access to it through other means (Lubradine, Atro etc.) and Sola's BB is suited for a purely offensive unit which she doesn't particularly perform all that well at anyway (her stat total is too low to really do well in that role). Estia probably wins this one by virtue of the fact that she can compensate for her low stats by being useful in a support role while Sola can not.

* Next up is [Aem](/cg), who is next in line for his 6* evolution. For now though, he's well known for having stats that used to be considered good but are now outclassed by a whole lot of units, meaning he's desparate for a stat makeover. Compared to him, Estia has better DEF (+300) and REC (+635) but lower HP (-180) and ATK (-40). Estia's DEF definitely outscales Aem's HP here. 300 DEF equates to about 90 more damage mitigation (without modification) per ATK meaning after taking a mere two hits, she starts outscaling Aem's HP advantage and the ATK difference between the two is miniscule. In addition, Estia boasts a huge REC advantage which is actually significant because Aem's REC is pretty awful, so Esetia definitely wins statwise here. Aem's hit count doesn't do him many favours either (5 hits - though his attack animation is pretty good) and his BB is a simple 8 hit multiple target attack that has no added effect which definitely isn't as useful as Estia's DEF buff bestowing BB. Until Aem gets his evolution (which is next up in line so expect that in a few weeks), Estia's a stronger unit at this point in time.

* Now we have [Vanila](/cg), another free unit from the recently ended Maiden Series. Compared to her, Estia has better DEF (+10) and REC (+280) but less HP (-275) and ATK (-110). The DEF difference is negligible here meaning Vanila definitely has the advantage defensively with her large HP advantage and she also wins offensively. Estia does win in REC and thus is more sustainable, but it's probably not a big enough advantage to overcome the other deficits she faces so I'd actually have to give the stat advantage to Vanila. Comparing their BBs, Vanila's random target BB isn't particularly amazing though it is useful on single target bossese where it can maximise its damage and possibly nail a status that the boss isn't immune to, but overall Estia DEFINITELY wins in overall value with her DEF buff and true multiple target BB. If you don't have access to another/better DEF buffer for your mono-light squad and/or you're not a fan of random target BBs, Estia's probably your better choice. Keep in mind that you probably only want one Estia at most though since DEF buffs from BBs don't stack.

* Lastly, there's probably some value in comparing Estia to [Atro](/cg), a rather strong light unit that's currently available to give you some context about where Estia sits. I chose Atro over someone like Sefia since he boasts a DEF buff with his SBB to meaning they're competing for similar roles. Compared to our male swordswoman, Estia boasts better REC (+5...haha) and that's it. Atro beats her in every other stat: HP (+50), ATK (+125) and DEF (+305), so not by insignificant margins either. This is expected of a 6* unit, but Atro's a starter and thus not particularly strong statwise as 6* units go and Estia's likely not going to get her 6* form for a while (though that's speculation). Estia definitely loses statistically. She makes up a bit of ground with her hit count (Atro's 4 hit combo is really bad) but definitely not enough to compensate and the fact that Atro has an SBB that also boosts DEF (though only by 30%) which in conjunction with his ATK buff means that he really does a good job of stripping her of her main niche, particularly considering he's also a staple mono-light leader so a commonly seen member of mono-light teams which makes it very difficult to justify including Estia on a lot of squads.

* So in summary, her stats are okay. They're far from top tier but they're not quite bottom tier meaning they're middling at the moment which is definitely useable right now but probably means she'll fade into obscurity very soon (unless a 6* form is announced), her DEF buffing niche is really nice but with the likes of Atro being a great mono-light leader and Lubradine just a really strong support unit all round, as well as the plethora of DEF buffing units in other elements, she finds it difficult to justify a slot on the squads of most players. She is free though, meaning she's a great choice as a filler unit if you lack anyone better.

***

[Estia: Indepth Look](/cg)

* First thing to keep in mind is that she's a free unit, so there's no real downside to obtaining her unless you're gemming, she's a collectable too, so if you're into that, she's of some value.

* So going over her stats again, her HP fails to break 5k as a Lord which I guess is still 'average' at this point in time but will be considered 'below average' and then 'bad' very soon in the future as more and more 6* units are released. Her ATK/DEF iare also pretty okay at this point in time, at just under 1.5k and 1.3k respectively but again, aren't all that impressive and soon will be considered pretty subpar. Her REC is solid though, so that's something.

* Her LS is awful. a 50% boost to REC is a pretty large boost, but it only applies to Light units and while they're notorious for having low REC, if you're running mono-light, you'd take a damage boosting leader skill over Estia's any day and there are quite a few available: Atro, Sefia, Vanila, Will. I mean, even if it was a boost to REC of all units it'd still be mediocre, but at least then it'd be useful as a filler leader for newer players (...who probably wouldn't be able to take her down to grab her anyway, eh, I'm struggling to find a use for her leader skill). If you got some use out of it, please comment below, I'd love to hear your take on things! I can imagine it being mildly amusing to use in conjunction with Will's SBB which might allow you to get away with relying on Heart crystal healing and not having to run a healer.

* Her BB is her main, and probably only real selling point. A DEF boost is a nice thing for any unit to have however she's in an unfortunate element to really shine with it though. Lubradine and Atro are both within her element and are far better units than she is overall. Atro in particular really takes her to town since while his boost might actually be smaller (it's only 30% and hers is *probably*, hopefully 50%), he also boasts an ATK boost and is Mono-light's best leader making it difficult to incorporate her into any team led by Atro. Lubradine has MUCH better stats all round and boosts ATK and REC as well and an upcoming 6* form that will propel him so far ahead of her he won't even be able to see her in the distance. Still if you lack an Atro/Lubradine, Estia's a really solid filler unit to provide her DEF buff for mono-light teams, assuming her buff strenght is indeed at least 50%.

* When all's said and done, at the moment, Sefia, Lubradine, Atro, Duelmex and probably Vanila in most situations are probably better units for mono-light (and other team archetypes) than she is, but if you need a filler unit, she's probably going to be a better choice than Sola or Aem (though with Aem, that's not going to last for very long) and she'll perform adequately in that role.

* In terms of future prospects, I'm not going to go into detail because given her currently already shaky niche, it's obviously bleak. She's outclassed by every single new evolution and new unit. Unless she gets a 6* evolution down the track, I don't see her being used by P2P players at all, her only role is probably as a filler unit for mono-light in the sheer inability to obtain something better.

* My apologies for the bad news guys, I'm just the messenger though, laying down the facts as I see them so don't shoot me. Estia's a pretty good filler unit but she's probably unlikely to rise beyond that status. On the plus side, she's technically free so you're not losing out in obtaining her unless you're gemming to survive her.

***

[Typing Discussion](/cg)

* As always, the most important thing to note here is that if typing is the only thing holding you back from using a unit, you should definitely just go ahead and use them. Please don't discard units because their typing isn't 'optimal'.

* Anima's probably her best type. Her REC is really solid and takes the hit that Anima gives it well, and her bordering on below-average HP definitely appreciates the boost.

* Since her primary attraction is as a support unit, she values her survivability much more than her offensive capability meanin Guardian is a really good choice, particularly considering her below average DEF. The loss in ATK makes her quite weak, but she definitely gains more than she loses.

* Lord is probably up next since she doesn't really want to sacrfice her meagre bulk for anything.

* I'd probably put Oracle fourth. The wiki shows a horrendous HP drop, but I think that's using the old Oracle calculation pre-buff so it's unlikely to be that significant, she's probably not losing as much bulk as she would with Breaker and the extra REC she gets goes some way in keeping her alive provided she doesn't get one-shot.

* Finally Breaker's probably not her best typing considering she wants to take on a support role and her offences aren't ever going to reach spectacular levels (she only really reaches 1.6k with Breaker) and the hit to DEF really hurts her since she was already below average at 1.3k in that department and she barely breaks 1.1k after the drop which makes her quite frail.

***

That's it for today guys, hope you enjoyed the read even if it wasn't good news. At least now you know not to kill yourselves gemming to try and obtain her (though might be worth trying for just to unlock the future Vortex events where capturing her and Xenon is apparently a requirement). Sorry to be the bearer of bad news for those looking for a really good vortex unit. :&lt;

As always, I welcome your comments/criticims/encouragements. If you found this read enjoyable or helpful in any way please drop an upvote. I'd love the vote of support. :&gt;

,CoDCompetitive,"Hey guys, Nitten iN here, and with competitive Call of Duty growing larger every day, I thought I'd throw some ideas I had for Major League Gaming to help make CoD the best eSports title it can be! Let me know what you think :D

- Contracts for player's public display of negative thoughts of league/MLG. 
   - In professional sports, players and staff who publicly criticize officials or the league that they are a part of are fined immediately. Something like this needs to be in place to help portray a better image for MLG. For exmaple, Jkap tweeted to MLG the other day pointing out that a mistake was made about their record, while also mentioning how upset he was. Someone reading this would question the integrity of the MLG name (although they should for this situation). With a proper contract, this could be made private, avoiding any form of public shaming.

- Dedicated staff to keep track of all stats accurately.
   - This goes along with the situation described above. There should never be mistakes in team records, statistics, etc. Too often people like Puckett or Benson will tweet out asking the public about a match score or something along those lines. MLG should be on top of statistics just as the League of Legends LCS or NBA is.

- LAN MATCHES - Ex. LCS at Riot Studios
   - How long will MLG allow the only recognized CoD League be determined by online play, especially in a game largely influenced by connection? All league matches should be played on LAN to make sure all matches are played on even grounds. Yes, this would mean players would have to travel quite a bit, but this did not stop the LCS. A game so dependent on split-second plays should **NEVER** be influenced by a player's connection.

- BO5, one or two matches max per team in a day

   - Every league and tournament match should have the same format. Though AW may not have the same game modes, it should remain consistent in the rotation at all times. (Dom, SnD, Blitz, Dom, SnD) Also, teams should not play three matches in a day unless absolutely necessary. This makes preparing for specific match-ups more difficult, and makes each match seem less important. Having one or two matches allows the teams to focus on each match-up, and the viewer will be more invested in each match.

- Higher production value on top plays (Accept user entries as well)

   - Many viewers of ESPN look forward to seeing the daily top 10 plays to see some of the most exciting moments in the world of sports. I was ecstatic to see MLG bring this to CoD, but the production quality seems to be a bit lacking. I'm not sure if it's the music or the voice-over, but something about it just seems off.

- More experienced casters. Ex-pros.

   - While many of the casters do a great job at the moment, I think we can all agree that we would rather listen to someone who has played CoD at a competitive level talk about some of the more in-depth access of the matches, while also being able to break down the game better for inexperienced viewers.

- Events need more production value consistently. (Soundproof booths, nice casting tables, etc.)

   - This is already happening, so hopefully this continues in the future. However, some events in the past seemed to be a bit unappealing to the viewer. The matches should be shown in a way that makes the viewer wish they were there for more reasons than just to see their favorite players.

- MORE THAN 2 ADS. People get pissed when seeing the same ad over and over.

   - It's totally fine that MLG forces ads now, since it will help grow CoD, but when I see the same damn trailer 25 times per event, I start to lose my mind. I can only watch a trailer for ""3 Days to Die"" so many times before I start to get frustrated.

- Weapon breakdowns/player's class/etc. Explain to viewers why certain weapons/classes are being used.
	 
   - Before matches, or even between rounds, the casters should show some graphics with stats on the different weapons/equipment so the viewers can understand the choices players make for their classes. Weapon stats such as range/damage/etc. would help a lot!

- Map heat maps? Where players usually go/set up. Explanations as to why.

   - A bit self-explanatory, but it would be really interesting to see where players tend to go on each map. This would be great for every game mode, honestly, to see what routes teams tend to favor, or what power positions are used the most! This could really help players learn the maps even better.

- Pre-recorded interviews to make them look better.

   - It's great to interview players after a match to get immediate reactions, but many sports (both athletic and eSports) will bring players to a private room to record interviews, allowing them to edit the interview to be as smooth as possible, without and short or awkward responses.

- Player profiles: (Their past, how they got here. The current ones are a good start, could be improved.)

   - It's great that MLG has brought these into pregame footage, but I think they could do an even better job! Instead of just showing us their first event, maybe talk about where the players came from! GB's in MW2, etc.

- League should have playoffs (Certainly at a spectator LAN if possible)

   - I may be in the dark here, but I don't think there's a real playoff for the MLG league. It would be cool if the top teams would make it to a real bracket in which there's a single elimination setup. This double elimination drags out tournaments, and removes the odds of teams being knocked out completely by an underdog.

- DRAFT: Toughest thing to implement, but players should have contracts at the minimum. Constant roster changes cause imbalance.

   - Yes, some teams are starting to make contracts for players (NV, Curse) but this should be a league-wide thing. By doing so, people won't be so hesitant to back a team with their favorite player. (For example, I support Clayster, but I didn't get an OpTic Scuf for fear that he could leave in the near future.) Also, drafting players onto a team would allow the worst teams to get a chance at grabbing the best upcoming players!

- Instant replays: Good nade? Replay should be shown. Slo-mo snipes, etc. Not just round-ending killcams.

   - This goes out to the developers more than MLG, but it would be awesome if we could get free-cam replays for any awesome kill or close call! 

- Teams should represent a location. Atlanta Curse, Chicago Optic, etc. GIVES PEOPLE A REASON TO SUPPORT SOMEONE OTHER THAN THE TOP 4-8.

   - One major flaw in the current league is that fans tend to support teams for odd reasons compared to most sports. Either fans support specific players, or a big name team (Optic, NV, EG). By respresenting states/regions, there could be more of a connection to a specific team!

- More teams, combine two seasons into one per CoD title, all-star break, divisions, etc.

   - It would be great to see a league of 16-32 teams separated into conferences, like the NBA or NFL, which would allow for rivalries, better brackets, etc. This goes with the contract thing I mentioned before, since some type of CBA (Collective Bargaining Agreement) would have to be made to balance the league. Though this would likely break up some great teams, distributing star players throughout the league would make for more exciting match-ups! This could allow teams like Rise to stand a chance against EG.

- MAKE ALL STAR MEAN SOMETHING: No double elimination playoffs, winning all-star conference picks 3 of 5 maps for finals.

   - Having an all star game with players trying their hardest to win would be incredible to watch. Of course, they'll have to want it for more than bragging rights, so making a ""home-court"" advantage for the finals would be a great way to do it!

- Controller cam? Iffy, but could be good to see reaction time, different player girps.

   - Self-explanatory.

- Fantasy League? &lt;333333

   - This would be great to boost viewership for league matches! People would watch to see how their specific players are performing.

I know this was a long post, but I think MLG has a lot of room to grow, and is certainly on the path to doing so. Let me know if you agree, disagree, or have any ideas to add! I'm not a professional player or anything (yet ;)..) but I'm a huge fans of eSports as a whole, and I do play on a competitive team.

,SandcastleBuilder,"So I've recently come into a portion of the game where things have started to become really grindy again. The last few times I reached a point like this, I realized I was kinda missing out on something (Glass Ceilings, Glass generation, Judgement Dip, etc.).

So currently I'm just generating **Glass** through the Furnace/Blower. I'm approaching WWWW Blocks and WWW Chips. To get these to infinite, do I just continue upgrading Refinery / Chiller until I get Infinite, or is there some Boost looming on the horizon that will amplify my Glass generation significantly.

With Production Control I'm into H Tools, and my **Achronal Dragon** Power is at ~100F. I've unlocked every Draconic boost I've come across. (CDSP, Crystal Dragon, Dragon Forge, Draft Dragon, Thunderbird)  
All of the Dragon Stats are still 0 though.

I'm still only getting **Goats** from MHP. I have ~5k, but I know these values will skyrocket later and I'm wondering what steps I might take to progress down that path as well.

Lastly, I have no idea what **Mustard** is about. I don't have any. Occasionally I've seen it go to Mustard Castles (?) shortly after making an infinite purchase, I think?

Basically for the last 2-3 days, when I check the game out all I do is:

* Upgrade Extruder/Purifier to reduce sand usage
* Upgrade Chiller/Refinery to buff Glass generation
* Upgrade Achronal Dragon by destroying every temporal duplicate available
* Upgrade Automata Control (up to 555, I know 777 is the next milestone I think)

I have Vault Key being purchased on ASHF via Shopping Assistant, and I have BeachBall keeping my Ninja streak going and clicking Redundakitties &amp; solving Logicats.

*A few more caveats*. 

* I got to 40 Glass Monuments to get the auto-Mould thing, and I have 100 Discoveries. I know I should probably warp around and collect more Discoveries and get more Monuments, but looking through the Boosts didn't seem like that was the correct path to open up the ""rest of the game"".
* The only Boosts in the shop are Bag of Holding and Robotic Shopper, currently.

**So what do I do now?** Is there a ""next step"" that will open up a significant portion of the game where I can micro for a while? Or do I just have to keep doing what I'm doing until I hit Infinite Glass?

Thanks in advance, you guys have been very helpful with any questions I've had in the past!

,Diablo,"So this is something I've been kicking around with some friends as a potential new Rift mode for Softcore characters. My apologies if this is something that's been brought up in the past but my quick attempts to search for something similar yielded no results.

The Idea: ""Midcore Rifts"" work similar to both Basic and Tiered rifts in terms of functionality; random dungeon assigned with a random mob group, player kills mobs to summon a Rift Guardian. There are however a few key differences:  

*  Player Death results in the player being removed from the rift and all Gold/XP/Loot gained from any progress in that rift are removed and lost to the player.  
* Each level within a Midcore Rift has it's own Rift Guardian that must be killed in order to progress to deeper, more difficult levels of the rift.  
* Once the Rift Guardian for a level has been defeated, players will have an option to ""cash out"" of the rift and return home with all the Gold/XP/Loot they've accrued, or to continue into a deeper, more difficult level of the rift.  
* Gold Given/XP Earned/Legendary Drop Rates continue to scale along with the difficulty of the rift, making it so later levels are  more rewarding and have better chances to drop items than the initial levels.  

The Issue We're Trying to Solve: Admittedly, this is more opinion and personal experience than anything but for me there seems to be a lack of consequences for playing Softcore mode, even at higher Torment levels. I understand this is sort of ""the point"" of playing Softcore and the most obvious answer to this problem is probably something along the lines of, ""Just play Hardcore dude..."" However, I think there might be room for something that offers an interesting and engaging compromise for other players like me, who enjoy the sort of min/maxing, theory crafting without consequence, push your damage to the limit gameplay style without having to worry about completely losing all of their progress with a single character death. I think something like this could promote interesting ""push your luck"" style gameplay and drama to the game for Softcore players and give them even a small taste of the hardcore experience (who knows, maybe even convert a few Softcore players to Hardcore).

Anyways, I'd love to know what you guys think about something like this. Would other people be interested in such a mode or is this just me being way off base here? If there have been other ideas like this in the past that were shot down, why?

Some additional notes and ideas for the build:

* Legendary Drops specific to this type of Rift. These drops could also be broken up into ""pieces"" that only appear on certain floors, motivating players to try and get further in order to collect all the pieces needed to craft/repair a unique legendary.
* Stats on certain legendaries grow as you advance through levels. Each time you go down a level there's a chance that one of the legendaries you looted along the way earns another stat point in one of it's default rolled stat affixes. Again, provides more motivation for players to go further into the Rift.
* Random Boosts/Buffs given to players at the end of a Rift level when they choose to continue on. Sort of slot machine style, players are given a random bonus buff once they kill the Rift Guardian that lasts for a long period of time (the whole next level?). Gold/XP Boosts, Magic Find, +% Crit Chance/Attack Speed/Cooldown Reduction/etc

STRATEGY
---
Let me preface this by saying I learned a lot about how to do this run better by doing it once and failing. The general flow of the run turned from item collecting to boss killing to farming souls/items and resource management.

I may do another run of this sometime or continue the current run later on, but I'm a little burnt out at the moment - it can be very frustrating *not* being able to attack!

ITEM COLLECTING
---

The hitlist:

* Ring of Thorns (Kill Pate)
* Old Sun Ring (Shaded Woods chest)
* Moon Butterfly Set (Buy from Maughlin NG+)

**Ring of Thorns**

This is an easy early item you can get by killing Pate in Forest of the Fallen Giants. However it most certainly is not even worth your time as it hardly ever procs (yes, it's a random chance) and when it does it does completely negligible damage to enemies that *happen* to get hit by the spray. My only success was on the enemies at Heide's Tower of Flame that were big enough to get hit by all three projectiles and were susceptible to what I suspect was piercing damage against their weak armor.

Each of the three projectiles does between 15-150 damage (during my run) and it was affected by physical attack boosts like Ring of Blades. Maybe a build with better physical attacks buffs might benefit from this, but the ring doesn't even proc with your shield up. Needless to say I didn't end up using this much.

**Old Sun Ring**

This amazing little ring will kill things far faster than the butterfly set so it's great to use for groups of low HP enemies (i.e. Royal Rat Vanguard). Similarly to the Ring of Thorns it will not activate with your shield up, but that's because your shield absorbs all of the durability damage from an attack. The Old Sun Ring activates at set levels of durability loss on the ring (static and consistent) and does around 300 fire dmg per small aoe explosion. Keep in mind that high durability armor (ie Havel's) reduces durability damage to the ring and you may end up taking *even more* damage than lighter armor to activate the ring.

To get the Old Sun Ring you need a Fragrant Branch of Yore to get to the Shaded Woods. One can be easily acquired by killing the Dragonrider to get 12k of the 13.4k souls required to buy the Cat Ring, jump down the well to The Gutter and you should find one right before The Black Gulch.

**Moon Butterfly Set**

I started out my run with a Bonfire Ascetic to get Majula into NG+ easily but you also have access to at least one Bonfire Ascetic in The Lost Bastille midway through the iron-maiden-like elevator.

I actually did a lot of testing on this set as it's the most effective way to kill enemies and bosses without attacking or taking damage. Essentially I found out you only need to wear two pieces before you reach a hard cap on poison application. If you'd like to learn more details go [check out my original thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkSouls2/comments/287atw/how_the_butterfly_set_and_poison_work/) for more info.

The hardest part of using this set to poison enemies is the need to be in constant contact with them until they get poisoned so they don't lose their poison build up. Subjectively I can say that there are some poisonable enemies/bosses that *can* be poisoned but they have so much resistance that stepping away from them for a moment lets them recoup several seconds of poison buildup.

You can find a list of poisonable bosses in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkSouls2/comments/215elq/spoiler_bosses_you_can_poison_quite_easy_complete/).

THE RESULTS
---

Most of the bosses were easy enough with this build... if they were poisonable. Many of the bosses are not poisonable and for those the options I came up with were to

**A)** Use Old Sun Ring with a metric shit load of Repair Powder. ~6 explosions @300 dmg per ring &amp; ~2 powders per durability means 1 powder = 900 dmg. To put this in perspective I was stuck on Najka which with 23,000 hp would need the first use of the ring plus 24 powders to kill in a *perfect attempt*.

**B)** Use Immolation (unacquirable to me at the moment).

So basically it looked like I was going to need a *lot* of Repair Powder. I exhausted all of the rats in Grave of Saints with a Travelling Merchant Hat on and they only dropped *seven* powders - making getting to Chancellor Welagar (who sells an infinite amount) my only option.

This is when I found out that you can alternatively pass the Shrine of Winter with 1M Soul Memory, [which was apparently already common knowledge](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkSouls2/comments/28b266/psa_you_can_open_the_shrine_of_winter_with_1/). So I started farming souls... without attacking anything. After more or less two days of casually farming souls while looking for drops that might help me as well I only attained 100k souls, meaning I'd need to farm souls for another 6 days if I wanted to open that door for a *chance* to beat the remaining bosses and finish the run  ...aaaaaaaaand that's where I called it.

---

If you have any suggestions on how to finish either my run or a fresh run in this category I would love to hear it as the whole run was a lot of fun before the farming began and I'd really like to beat it!

,skyrim,"So after doing the thing where you transcribe the lexicon or whatever where you move the beams of light to reveal the elder scroll, the quest didn't mark as completed after doing so. 

I didn't think anything of it at the time and thought I might need to return later after visiting Septimus. So I do that and go and collect the blood and read that book that gives you a stat boost, and that quest is marked as completed, however the recover elder scroll quest is still active, and there is no further quests made available to me.

So I go back to that beam of light room and see the elder scroll sitting there in that blue cylinder thing and retrieve it (not sure if I retrieved it the first time, don't remember now). However, after retrieving the scroll I still haven't received any quest update and there isn't any Elder Scroll in my inventory.

,HFY,"So, having just re-read Studs Terkel's ""The Good War"" for about the 5th time, I was inspired to write something. I stumbled across this sub and immediately started doing some world building and planning some characters. Obviously, if this first part gets a good reaction I would like to write some more entries. Let's see how this one goes.

Of course let me know if you catch any typos or mistakes, and I love to hear opinions on the story itself.

also, since it is difficult to do footnotes in the reddit format, i'm including footnotes with (parentheses)


Read PART 2 [Here!](http://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/28swx3/ocbreaking_the_wedge_chapter_2/)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


34 years from the end of hostilities, I've taken it upon myself to collect stories from survivors of the first galactic conflict in human history. A time when Man was pushed to his limit, and came out the other side more resilient than ever. These recollections are the sort of thing *not* included in the Naval Intelligence records. Feelings, memories, and reasons, rather than facts and figures. 


**Admiral of the Fleet Jamie Calbraith - GRN Retired**

*Nearing 69 years of age, one would never guess it. He is slender in figure, but still fit and in fighting shape as he shows me around his home in Akron, Ohio. His soft speech and calm demeanor while offering me a drink belies the ruthless nature which he relied on during the war.*

You know I was born and spent most of my childhood in New York? Before everything happened of course. I decided to settle down in the midwest because it reminds me of that last few weeks when I was still just a dumb kid with no real worries.

My parents sent me to stay with a great family friend who lived out here, Captain Perry Lawrence, in the summer of '75. (First contact with the Wedge Federation was made in May, 2175) I think they were worried that the Kravahn were going to invade. If only they had tried that, things may have gone much better for us in the beginning. 

*Why were your parents worried about invasion?*

Well we had just made first contact for Christ's sake! These weren't green little men like everyone always imagined in the early 20th century. They were 5 foot tall winged monsters with talons like razorblades and faster-than-light warp drives on star ships! Contact was having serious implications in a lot of human institutions - we weren't alone? What if there are even more out there? What if they decide we aren't worth talking to? Even without contact with the Kravahn, things around that time were a bit unstable. The first true Federation of the United Nations had only been tentatively established in 2166, and the world government was headquartered in New York. It made perfect sense that if an invasion happened, it would happen where Mankind's leaders were gathered together.

*Why send you to Captain Lawrence specifically?*

Oh, well we didn't have any family left in the States, and Captain Lawrence and my dad went way back. They served together in the old American Navy during the war of Korean Unification. My old man got out when his contract was up, but Perry was career Navy through and through. That summer was great. Perry would take me fishing on the pond behind his house and regale me with stories from his days in the Pacific.

*So you were in Ohio during the bombardment?*

Luckily, yeah. I was supposed to return to Manhattan in about three weeks when it happened. The bombardment was the second worst day of my life. It seemed like it came out of nowhere, I still don't know the reason behind the attack itself, they must have just decided we had nothing to offer, but I do understand the reasoning behind the target. The Crows (Crow is a crude slang term for members of the Kravahn Wedge Federation) thought that if they hit us where it hurts, where all of our leaders were gathered, we would fold like a cheap suit. They really didn't do their due diligence (laughs mirthlessly).

Their biggest mistake was obvious. The Crow deployment around Earth was supposed to be diplomatic in nature. The small number of ships was enough to vaporize New York in minutes, sure, and they probably thought it would be enough to force us to surrender. Humanity didn't have warp drive technology or energy field weapons yet, but 400 Minuteman II missiles took out those ""diplomatic"" ships just fine.

By the way, most of this I learned about later - after the fact. I was able to piece together a pretty good course of events through my training at the Naval academy and of course through Perry explaining things to me. I was *not* privy to all of this information at the ripe old age of 17 in 2175.

So after the dust settled humanity had to figure out what to do. We knew we couldn't fall back to squabbling amongst ourselves. We finally had a common enemy to unite us, and if there is one thing humans can do exceptionally well it's hating ""the other"". We needed to maintain that united front. In a special session the new world government named itself the Gotham Republic, in remembrance of New York.

*What was next for you?*

Well, Perry allowed me to enroll in the Gotham North American Naval Academy. All of the young men on Earth were enlisting in the Navy and the Marines. The next generation had to learn new ways to defend Earth. We were all learning new experimental techniques and tactics. The eggheads were reverse engineering the Crow technology from wreckage collected after the nuclear strikes. No one had ever fought in space before, it was a brand new way of warfare, the true final frontier. Perry re-enlisted and was given command of one of the first ships to come off the assembly line, the GRS *Erie*: a Heavy Frigate. He had me assigned to the *Erie* as an Ensign fresh from the academy in 2179 so that he could keep an eye on me.

The next year was rather uneventful. The Crows sent some forward scouting ships into the Solar system, and the *Erie* was involved in some of those minor engagements. We went mostly unscathed and were learning how to fight in three-dimensions. If the Crows had pushed their advantage rather than sending tentative scouts they probably could have overwhelmed us during those first few years. Humans are adaptable, sure, but the Crows were evolved to hunt in the air. They were used to attacking from any direction, and we were playing catch-up with our gravity-centric minds.

During this whole time I was able to observe Captain Lawrence and how he behaved in command. He was always cool as a cucumber. Even when we were under fire from Crows he never lost his calm demeanor. It was a huge boost to morale. He also still had a soft spot for me (laughs). Every day during off hours he would school me in command and history. He would always tell me things that would stick with me through my whole career like ""A great Captain makes the tough decision, not the easy one."" and ""Love of a commanding officer is a far better motivator than fear of the enemy.""  He certainly lived by those words. We all worshipped him, his tactics and level head saved lives during that crucial first year where every ship counted.

Our sterling combat record got us assigned to a protective fleet in the asteroid belt in 2180, which was predicted by the genies to be the staging area for an all out Crow assault on Earth. It was our job to break the Wedge before it reached Earth again. (Genie is slang for an operative in ""GNI"" or Gotham Naval Intelligence.)

*We've all heard the story of the 'Erie' during the Battle of the Belt, can you tell us what is was like from inside the ship?*

Well, what nobody knows is that our key involvement in the battle was a huge mistake! This has all been declassified of course, but we salvaged a lot of valuable information from Crow wrecks. The Crow battle logs showed that the navigators in their fleet miscalculated the mass jump!  The Erie was on a patrol assignment at the far end of the belt when the entire Crow Navy just warped in! Several million kilometers from where GNI expected the attack would come.

I mentioned that the bombardment was the second worst day of my life? The Battle of the Belt was by far the very worst. We were suddenly surrounded by Crow ships. Of course we were all pissing ourselves, except for Captain Lawrence. He was in complete command, shouting out vectors and instruction to weapons and engines. 

The problem was it didn't matter how valiant of an effort we put up, it was 1 frigate against three Wedge Federation battle groups, and the rest of the belt defensive fleet would take at least 20 minutes to warp in response to our distress beacon. (A battle group consists of 100 ships of various classes)

You'd never know that we were doomed watching the Captain though. He ordered the communications team to broadcast [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YOYlgvI1uE) on the *Erie* and across all known Wedge Naval frequencies to improve our morale and ""strike fear of the gods into those winged savages"" (laughs.)

About 15 minutes in and we still hadn't been blown out of the sky yet, which came down to the Captain keeping us all calm, and the navigators doing some of the best evasive action I've ever personally witnessed. Even so, Crow boarding teams had made it past the *Erie*'s point defense and were taking the lower decks by force. The Captain saw that there was little we could do, but knew that the rest of the belt defense fleet would arrive soon. He ordered the evacuation of all personnel into life pods. While the lower decks burned, pods launched out into the belt, far too small to be noticed by the Crow capital ships.

With 2 minutes left until the arrival of the Gotham reinforcements the Captain ordered the evacuation of the bridge, and sealed the Crow marines who had boarded the *Erie* behind blast doors. She was bleeding atmosphere, and there wasn't a lot of time left until we would be captured. The Crow marines were cutting through the doors to reach the bridge. The Captain pulled me aside and said ""Jamie, today we have our final command lesson. I'm ordering you to evacuate the rest of the bridge crew into the Captain's escape pod and to launch immediately."" Of course, I was scared out of my mind at this point, I was still just a kid really. I begged him to come with us to the pod, but he wouldn't hear of it. ""Ensign, you have your orders. I left a packet for you in the escape pod, it contains your last lesson.""

Well, you know what happened next. Captain Lawrence stayed behind on the wounded *Erie*, and rather than allow the ship to be captured, directed the ship's computer to set a course for the bridge of the capital Crow ship: the WFS *Wind at Dawn*. The explosion as the *Erie*'s warp drives fired from inside the *Dawn* took out 12 nearby Wedge ships, which included most of their naval high command.

I spent the rest of the battle inside a tin can escape pod crying my eyes out. The *Erie* was responsible for sinking a total of 16 Crow ships on her own, and taking down the *Dawn* along with the Crow chain of command allowed the Gotham Navy to rout the Wedge Federation fleet. They would never have a serious foot hold in the Solar system again.

*What was the final lesson waiting for you in the escape pod?*

He left me his most prized possession, something that had been in his family for generations. It had a note tacked onto it that said ""A Captain protects his crew, his country, and above all his vessel, read the words embroidered on this flag and always remember what a Captain's highest duty is.""

*With teary eyes Admiral Calbraith points with his glass towards a flag on the wall. It appears to be a Navy battle flag from centuries past. A field of deep navy blue with white lettering which reads:* 

*""DONT GIVE UP THE SHIP""*

,pathofexile,"Hey guys, 

I have this idea for a build in my head and I want to collect some oppinions on it. 

I wanted to use an endgame unique that is not getting much love and make a viable and fast clearing build for solo play around it. Unfortunately I do not have much time at the moment to play the build for myself so this all just theory. 

The Item I want to use is [Oro's Sacrifice](http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Oro's_Sacrifice) because I think it has great potential with its average damage being comparable to a level 20 [Fire Trap](http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Fire_Trap) and good scaling methods due to weapon elemental jewelry and a nice 50%+ multiplier with the [weapon elemental support gem](http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Wed). 

And some of the best and fastest clearing build are ignite builds that use elemental proliferation. Oro's having 20% chance to ignite is basically allowing us to skip chance to ignite as a support gem and just use flammability. 

Main Attack links:
* 4Link:Leap Slam + Weapon elemental + elemental prolif + conc effect
* 5th link: increased aoe
* 6th link: fire penetration/life gain on hit/life leech

Secondary attack (singe target):
4Link: Molten Strike + weapon elemental + multistrike + life gain on hit

Why only a 4 link? because I eventually want to use an [Kaom's heart](http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Kaom%27s_Heart) to compensate the downside of Oro's a bit and boost the damage even further.

,nba,"The season's in the books, and we've had a couple days to bask in the after-glow of the Finals.  Now that being objective is easier with the excitement of the season behind us, who do you think are the most over-rated and under-rated people in the league going into 2014/2015?  My votes below.

**Over-rated**

* **Doc Rivers** An inspirational figure.  Has a gift for getting proud, competitive millionaires to buy into a collective vision.  Put the Clippers organization on his back this season.  I say over-rated because he's arguably the most powerful and respected non-owner in the league right now, but as a coach and GM his credentials are questionable.  Before the Big Three era in Boston, he was a sub-.500 coach.  Boston's stifling, league-crushing defense was Thibodeau's brainchild, and their offense a product of Ainge masterfully understanding which pieces would fit together well.  He boosted De'Andre Jordan's confidence but his Clippers have not really outperformed those of Vinny Del Negro.  

* **Kahwi Leonard** Elite defensively, athletic, potential to be a 20-10 guy for a decade.  He earned that Finals MVP.  Why over-rated?  Let's settle down with the super-star talk and see if he can reach deep and drop 30 against a playoff team on the second night of a back-to-back when the old guys are out of gas before we start calling him a top-10 player.

**Under-rated**

* **Kevin Love** Never led his team to the post-season.  His team has been a perennial disappointment when he's the best player.  He's not superb defensively.  Why under-rated?  1) David Kahn.  2) Ricky Rubio's jumpshot.  The dude has gotten little to no help for years, I don't feel this is a reflection of him. Advanced stats aren't everything but those stats reveal he's SO good at providing value that it's hard to argue he's not a legitimate superstar.

It saves a custom team of pets (and their ability list) which lets you swap on the fly.  Much, much easier than manually picking and choosing pets for each Tamer.


**III. Leap-Frogging to Level 25**

The hardest part of this whole process is getting your first pet to Level 25.  As far as I know, you can’t just buy a Level 25 on the AH… you need to have leveled one to 25 first.  Every subsequent pet will be that much easier to level.   Eventually you’ll be able to level multiple pets from 1 to 25 in less than an hour.  But initially it’s a much, much more grind-y process.  Luckily, there are ways to speed it up to take under 3 hours.

The incredibly slow way is to level pets against ones that are within 1-2 levels of your current pet… slowly grinding your way up the chain to 25 over hundreds of battles.  That path is stupid.  Don’t do that!

You will instead use a sequence of pets that have a Type advantage to leap-frog up the ladder of experience.

* **Grind a Mechanical Pet to Level 10**.  Speed up the grind by doing the early Tamer battles (follow the questline starting in Orgrimmar) to get more XP from the quest reward .  Any pet with a Mechanical moveset will do, but ideally get a Rare quality one for best results.  If you have a Clockwork Gnome, Darkmoon Zeppelin, Darkmoon Tonk, or Mechanical Pandaren Dragonling… use them since you’ll want to level them later anyway.

* Go to Deadwind Pass and battle **[Arcane Eyes](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=68819)**.  These are Level 16-18 Magic type pets, which your Mechanical pet will have an advantage against.  As low as Level 10, you should be able to take them down.  You want to weaken and capture them.  They are also good to fight because Arcane Eyes will always be by themselves… no pesky backup pets to deal with.  Your objective is to weaken and capture 3 Arcane Eyes of UNCOMMON OR RARE quality.  NOTE: They are above ground **near Karazhan**.  If you're not near Karazhan, you won't see them.  They also tend to spawn more frequently during night hours.  See the [WoWhead's spawn map](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=68819) for details.

* Now comes the hard part: Go to Dragonblight and look for **[Dragonebone Hatchlings](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62852)** (buzzards hanging around skeletons north of Wyrmrest Temple).  These are Level 21-24 Flying type pets, which your Arcane Eyes will have a Type advantage against.  The problem is they’ll always have 2 backup pets, which can and will fuck you over sometimes.  Keep fighting and capturing until you have at least two Uncommon (preferably Rare) Dragonbone Hatchlings.

* Easy mode: **Slaughter Aquatics in Vale of Eternal Blossoms**.  Take your Flying Pets, go to Vale of Eternal Blossoms, and fight the Eternal Striders and other Aquatic type pets all along the destroyed riverbed (TONS of them… and less competition… near Mistfall Village).  Your Flying Pets will destroy these with ease.

* Congrats, **you now have at least one Level 25 pet**!

(this is all covered by this guide, if you don't like my writing style: http://www.wowhead.com/guide=1865/leveling-your-first-battle-pets-in-a-day-5-4-0)


**IV. Leveling Other Pets (the faster but still grindy way)**

Now that you have your Level 25 Flyer, you can use it to quickly power-level another pet to 25 much faster.  Simply go to Vale of Eternal Blossoms, put the “carry pet” in the first slot, fight the Aquatics… the Aquatics normally just do a self-heal (for 0 HP…) as their first move.  So you don’t have to worry about the pet dying.  You let the carry pet attack, then swap to your Flyer.  Kill the Aquatic team with your Flyer, and your carry pet will get ALL the XP (because the Flyer is Level 25 already).  You'll quickly get to ~ Level 18 and not too much longer until 25.

Repeat process as-needed.  I recommend Leveling these pets as a priority:

* [Crow](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=67443) (or [Gilnean Raven](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=63098))  [Crow is a wild pet found in Darkmoon Faire; Gilnean Raven is a 1-time purchase for any Worgen character]
* [Terrible Turnip](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=63365) (rare drop from Tiller Farm)
* [Anubisath Idol](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=68659) (drop from Twin Emperors in AQ40)
* [Emerald Proto-Whelp](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=68850) (get an Uncommon or Rare from Sholozar Basin… P/P or P/S are the ideal breeds to have, but not critical)

You want the Crow/Raven for grinding Vale of Eternal Blossoms, Terrible Turnip for capturing Wild Pets, and Anubisith Idol &amp; Emerald Proto-Whelp for defeating the Master Tamers.


**V. Tamer Questline**

The best way to level Pets is by doing the Master Tamer and Pandaren Spirit dailies.  You can raise two to four pets a day from Level 1 to 25 (even more if you optimize your routine).  To unlock them, you need to go through the full Pet Battle Tamer questline, defeating 20+ Tamers around the World… of Warcraft.  You can completely annihilate most of the early teams with any Level 25, but things will get tougher when you hit the Tamers in Outlands. 

All Tamers have a static team of pets, so you may need to level pets with a type advantage to best counter them.  I recommend you to level Anubasith Idol &amp; Emerald Proto-Whelp first, because they can cheese their way through most of the Tamers.  If you still can’t defeat them, then level a specific type-advantage Pet for that battle.  You want to get to unlock the Pandaria Master Tamers ASAP to quickly level Pets.


**VI. Pandaria Master Tamers, Pandaren Spirits, &amp; Beasts of Fable**

Once you unlock the Pandaria Master Tamers, you can defeat ALL of them using only two pets: Anubasith Idol and Emerald Proto-Whelp.  Follow this move-by-move guide to defeat them all AND level a 3rd pet at the same time.  These 2 pets can also defeat 3 of the 4 Pandaren Spirits (you’ll need a Snail and a Darkmoon Zeppelin for Thundering Spirit).  Note: CHOOSE PANDAREN WATER SPIRIT AS YOUR REWARD THE FIRST TIME YOU DO THE SPIRITS.

[Beginner Master Tamer Guide](http://www.warcraftpets.com/community/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=4580)

These two pets will get the job done, but you’ll want to level and optimize the pets used in this guide to make your routine quicker, easier, and more consistent (Anubisith Idol misses 30% of the time and RNG WILL fuck you over semi-regularly when using him).

[Veteran Tamer Dailies Guide](http://www.warcraftpets.com/community/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=7556)

Additionally, you’ll want to be doing the Beast of Fable quests each day.  These are easy to cheese if you level two new pets: [Pandaren Water Spirit](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=66950) and [Chrominius](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=68662).  Pandaren Water Spirit can drop from the Flowing Spirit daily (or you can choose it as your reward the first time you do all 4).  Chrominius is a drop from Blackwing Lair.

You’ll want to level up additional pets to have optimized teams for each of the Beasts of Fable, but those two can take care of most of them on their own.  See the link above for details.


**VII. Speed Leveling for Badasses**

You want three things: Safari Hat, Lesser Pet Treats, and Pet Treats.

Beast of Fable quests reward [Lesser Pet treats](http://www.wowhead.com/item=98112).  When used on a pet, they give your character a buff for an hour, increasing all pet experience gains by 30%.  Use these before you do your daily routine.

If you’ve done all the Pandaria Master Tamers, you’re very close to getting [Taming Azeroth](http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=6607), rewarding the [Safari Hat](http://www.wowhead.com/item=92738) and the title “Tamer”.  To complete the Achievement, you’ll need to get on a cross-faction alt and fight one or more of the Tamers specific to their side.  That will get you the 40 you need.  Just do one of the easy ones in Westfall or Redridge Mountains.  Safari Hat, when worn, increases pet experience gains by an additional 10%.  There are add-ons that will automatically equip it before battles so you never forget to put it on (or swap back to your normal helm). 

[Pet Treats](http://www.wowhead.com/item=98114) are something you can buy with reward currency from the Celestial Tournament.  They boost XP gained by even MORE than the Lesser Pet Treat, and they stack together!  At maximum buff, you get close to double XP for your pets!

So the idea from here on out is to pick the pets you want to level for the day, put on your Safari Hat, use a Lesser Pet Treat, do one to three battles in Vale of Eternal Blossoms vs. wild aquatics to get the pet to Level 6 – 10, and then carry them through some of the Master Tamers until Level 24-25. 

EDIT: /u/SpriteMonkey had a great suggestion about using Veiled Stair and a Beast pet with Devour to quickly cap out many Level 23-24 pets in a short amount of time.  [Link to comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/28dl28/vutters_guide_to_pet_battles_and_stuff/ci9yq1e)

Notes:

* The Master Tamer pets sometimes do AoE damage to your back row, which can kill Level 1-5 pets,
* The pet experience gains work on a curve such that a Level 10-16 pet gets more XP from a battle than one below 10 or one above 16,
* You don’t want to waste an entire fight’s XP on a Level 24, so you stop there and grind in Vale for the last level.


**VIII. What is Worth Fighting For?**

Ultimately, the two “end-game” goals of Pet Battles are the Celestial Tournament, and PvP.   

For the Celestial Tournament, this is BY FAR the most comprehensive guide out there.  It contains a variety of alternative team makeups for each Tamer in the Tournament, and step-by-step instructions for each fight.  You literally can’t lose if you have the right pets:

[WoWHead's Celestial Tournament Guide](http://www.wowhead.com/guide=1827/a-pet-battlers-guide-to-defeating-the-celestial-tournament)

Can’t help you much with PvP, but there are team guides on YouTube and forums such as: http://www.warcraftpets.com/community/forum/


**IX. Collect Them All &amp; Other Tips**

Collect all the Wild Pets for [World Safari](http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=6590) (Zookeeper title).  Some pets only spawn in specific weather conditions, or are super rare spawns.  May want to check quickly after Server Maintenance, or park alts in their spawn areas and check in every so often.

Leave a low level alt parked in Shrine and turn in the Beast of Fable quests each day with that toon.  In full heirlooms, you can gain levels fairly quickly (every 1-3 days) just by doing those turn-ins.  Better than getting a measly amount of Valor and some Lesser Charms IMO.

You should save Battle Stones for pets you need for the Tamers, Tournament, or PvP because you want them to be Rare.  Afterwards, use them on pets that do not appear as Rare or are hard to obtain as Rare.  See this guide: [Optimize Battle Stone usage guide](http://www.wowhead.com/guide=1782/battle-stones-and-you)

For min-maxers, the first Celestial Pet you take from the Tournament should be [Xu-Fu](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=71942/) to count towards the 20 cats needed for [Crazy for Cats](http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=8397) Achievement


**X. Closing Words**

Thanks for reading my guide and I hope you enjoy building your collection of rare and powerful pets!

,Fantasy,"One of the ideas I saw mentioned in the [Fantasy Update and Input Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/27suew/rfantasy_update_input_where_we_are_and_where/) was a desire for more discussion on other fantasy related things besides books. I thought I would talk a little about my other favorite hobby and how they cross over. I am going to tell you about **Fantasy Board Games**.

When trying to explain modern board games to others, nearly everyone who plays them has experienced the blank looks and comments along the lines of “Board Games? You mean like Monopoly or Risk?” However Board Games as a hobby have been growing lately. More and more people are getting into and discovering the wide world out there. If you would like a glimpse into the hobby as a whole, check out [This Introductory Video](http://www.shutupandsitdown.com/videos/v/intro-boardgaming/_) from one of my favorite board game blog/review sites. In this post I will be focusing on Fantasy games and what they have to offer. 

Here are some games I think every Fantasy Fan should check out.

**DISCLAIMER**: I have not actually played all of these. I do however put plenty of research into my board game purchases and have read a fair amount about them all. I feel comfortable enough to give a brief rundown and recommendations, but for more info follow the links.

* [**Descent: Journeys in the Dark**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/104162/descent-journeys-in-the-dark-second-edition). I am sure many are familiar with RPGs, D&amp;D and the like. That community is still alive and well and can be a blast. In my experience, I had too much trouble getting a regular group together to do some serious pen and paper games. Everyone is just so busy lately. [*Descent*](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1lshqe/game_of_the_week_descent_journeys_in_the_dark_2nd/) offers up a similar experience, but out of a box. The game is about a group of heroes making their way through various forests and dungeons in a fantasy realm going on quests, defeating monsters and collecting loot. Where it gets interesting is one player will be controlling the Overlord, the dark mastermind behind the forces of evil. This game is a 1 vs Many with the heroes cooperating and the Overlord pulling every trick available to stop them. One of the really neat aspects of this game is that it can be played in individual scenarios of various lengths, or you can string them together in a campaign mode where your choices, wins and defeats carry over.

* [**Mice and Mystics**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/124708/mice-and-mystics) for fans of *Redwall*, those with young kids, or just people who would enjoy a [fun game](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/265q1b/game_of_the_week_mice_and_mystics/). The players will be Mice going on an epic quest to save their kingdom. This one is fully cooperative and everyone is playing together to win. Similar to *Descent*, this is played through scenarios that lead towards a larger over all story. It is a little more simple and straightforward which makes it more accessible.  Cooperative games are also good to draw in those who do not enjoy conflict or competition. I found [this review](http://www.nohighscores.com/2013/05/24/mice-and-mystics-review/) to be very moving and paint a good picture of the game.

Maybe you would be more comfortable with something more familiar? Then perhaps try-

* [**War of the Ring**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/115746/war-of-the-ring-second-edition) So who here has heard of a little book called *The Lord of the Rings*? It is pretty old, you may have missed it…Anyways for those who wanted to act out the epic Quest of the Ring with a friend, take a look. One player will be the forces of good, trying to push back the darkness and leading the Fellowship towards Mt Doom to destroy the One Ring of Power! (I am telling you guys, it is a really good book, and you should check it out.) The other will be the Forces of Sauron, attempting to crush Middle Earth beneath his fist and reclaim his Ring. Listen, we all know the story. If ever wanted to act it out on the table, this game is for you.

* [**A Game of Thrones**]( http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/103343/a-game-of-thrones-the-board-game-second-edition) another game based on obscure genre novel ^*cough*. If you ever felt the desire to actually play the eponymous Game in [*Game of Thrones*](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1aarln/game_of_the_week_a_game_of_thrones_the_board_game/), this is about as close as you are going to get. Each player will control a noble house; Lannister, Stark, Baratheon, etc. You will be scheming, posturing, making alliance, massing armies, attacking, and attacking the aforementioned (former) ally. All for the ultimate goal of conquering Westeros and claiming the Iron Throne. It has been said that in the Game of Thrones, you win or you die. I can assure you that the *Board* Game of Thrones has a higher survival rate.

If you are ready to dive right into the deep end-

* [**Mage Knight**]( http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/96848/mage-knight-board-game) This is a game of growing in power, moving across the kingdom and destroying everything in your path. This is on the more difficult end of the game spectrum and not for the faint of heart. If you get into it however, it can be a great time. You start out as a powerful [Mage Knight](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/140at7/game_of_the_week_mage_knight_board_game/) and make your way across the board, recruiting allies, defeating monsters and generally bulking up. *Mage Knight* has different game modes. It can be played up to four people competitively or cooperatively and can even be played solo. I know playing board games by yourself sounds rather depressing, but this game can be viewed as a rather elaborate puzzle of efficient actions and it is quite satisfying to do well. 
Oh look, there is a monastery over there. I bet those nice monks would let me rest up a little bit. But you know…I heard they have a pretty neat artifact in there. One that would be really nice to have…Should I burn this place down and take it? No that would be wrong…but then again, I could really use that artifact…

Not all Fantasy is about Wizards and Knights. Also true for Fantasy Board games-

* [**Kemet**]( http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/127023/kemet) OK, so this is stretching Fantasy a bit, but it is one of my very favorite games and I am going to cheat a little. In [*Kemet*](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1uqxix/game_of_the_week_kemet/) players are Egyptian Gods leading your tribe of worshippers into battle over control of the Nile Delta. OK, so I am assuming a few of you have played or at least heard of *Risk*. That game has some flaws. Length, people turtling up and not attacking, swingy battles, people too spread out. If you ever thought to yourself you would like to play a game like Risk only vastly better and also thought that what the game really needed was a Giant Scorpion then check this out. The board is set up in such a way that everyone is equidistant from one another and this is a game where you have to attack and attack some more to win. There is a myriad of upgrade tiles that provide tactical or economic boosts to your armies and the method for determining battle outcomes is a tense well balanced activity with some bluffing involved. I really love this game. You should all play it.

Alright, so that is just scratching the surface of what Board Games have to offer. While I highlighted some Fantasy games for obvious reasons, there is so much out there for all different kinds of people. If you want to know more the site I linked, Boardgamegeek.com, is a wealth of information but rather overwhelming and difficult to navigate. Also be sure to visit /r/boardgames, a terrific sub and where I spend the other half of my reddit time.

Feel free to ask me any questions you have. If you want to know about me personally, [here is my collection](http://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/Jay%20Red%20Eye?own=1&amp;subtype=boardgame&amp;ff=1). 

And if you happen to be in San Antonio and would like to try some of them for yourself, please let me know!

Thanks for reading and I hope this was informative.

----

**Speed** - Your overall top speed. Collecting Coins boosts this, too.

**Acceleration** - How fast you reach your top speed. Good acceleration means quick recovery from Items that hit you.

**Weight** - Weight affects both how far you drift off course when you power slide and how much you are affected by other drivers who hit you. Lighter karts get knocked around more. Heavier karts drift farther off course.

**Handling** - Handling is how close you stick to a corner. Bikes have much better handling than karts.

,vita,"*Coconut Dodge Revitalised* has been out on the Vita for a while now, it came out early Summer 2013, and I've not seen very much about it since. This disappoints me, because in my opinion, it's a great game.

The premise of of *Coconut Dodge* is that you play as a crab, Clawrence, who collects treasure on a relaxing looking beach. The game controls simply and elegantly, you use the left analogue stick or d-pad to move left and right, hold X to boost, and tap and hold X to turbo boost. That's it. There's no crowbarred in touchscreen features, no wonky and imprecise motion/tilt controlling. However just collecting gold wouldn't be a very good game in itself, so the coconuts so eloquently foreshadowed in the title make an appearance. Dodge them. Dodge them or die. This seems simple, and it is. You get three hits, then you die. The further you get the faster it gets. The more gold you collect means the higher you score. The premise is simple then? Yes. But the additions to the simplistic gameplay are what makes this game standout.

If dodging coconuts to get gold wasn't enough for you (which frankly I personally can't understand, but there we go) then you might be happy to know that that isn't quite all there is. The coconuts don't always fall randomly. The game is split into levels, of sorts. There's no break in the gameplay, but after a while you will reach a maze. This is a trickier, yet more rewarding section if done correctly. The coconuts fall in patterns, with gold or jewels between them, often pointing out routes to take. There's usually more than one route, at least for some sections in all mazes. The harder route will usually have jewels instead of gold pieces. It's a prefect balance of risk vs reward.

Secondly, the game has beach balls. That's right, beach balls. These appear from the sky and have a number in the centre. The number they have shows how many bounces they have left. If it says 3 on it, bounce it back up into the air by having it hit you three times, and you'll be rewarded. These are the yellow beach balls. Obviously, the further you get, the more bounces are required. There's a second type of beach ball, the blue type. These slow the game down, there's no rubbish item that you can just collect to slow the game down. You want to make it easier? Work for it. You might slow it down, or you might bounce the ball into a flurry of oncoming coconuts and be hit, or, you could bounce it off the screen, and waste the potential.

The game also has a few bonus items. Bonus treasure, which is bigger and more exciting looking than gold or jewels, and rewards you more. It also has the Viking Helmet, which makes you invincible and gives you the ability to enact revenge on the coconuts by destroying them, and earn points. This only lasts for a short while, as you'd expect.

Finally, the bonus game modes are all very interesting. There's four of these, the first of the bunch that I'll talk about is 'Hardcore', which is the same as normal, but with only one life. It's good, it's just not as interesting as the others. The second is 'Impossible' mode. This is much better than hardcore mode, even though it's really just an extension. In impossible mode you have one life, just like in hardcore mode, but on top of that, everything that falls from the sky is a black silhouette. For the most part, this is manageable. The difficulty really kicks in when you reach mazes. You're suddenly forced to pay attention to the shapes and it becomes vital to differentiate in very little time to make a small gap or snag some treasure. On the topic of mazes, the second last bonus mode is called 'Maze Master'. Select one of the 29 mazes that you've discovered in normal mode to practice. It's so frustrating to die at the same point in a game over and over, especially if it takes a while to reach that point. This mode stops that, it allows you to practice the mazes and reduce the chance of being caught out by being taken by surprise. Of course this only works until you find a new maze, but that's the fun of progression. The final mode is 'Keepy Uppy', the football fans among you will recognise that this is probably a mode where you have to keep the beach ball bouncing as long as you can. That's just what it is, and it's great.

*Coconut Dodge Revitalised* is a game with tight controls, catchy music, bright and simplistic visuals with an easy to understand design language. The nature of the game is that of a mobile game. I often hate mobile games, there's too many overly simplistic games with sloppy controls. *Coconut Dodge Revitalised* shows these traits the door, then proceeds to throw them through it. It has enough depth and variety to keep it interesting. Sure, you're always dodging coconuts, but not always in the same way. And dodging coconuts while bouncing beach balls is very rewarding and gets difficult fast. Best of all? It's £1.99 (or your regional equivalent) and there's a demo so you can prove me right before remortgaging your house to pay for it. The only thing I dislike about it is that I'm not that good.

,wiiu,"Everyone hates the coin item. It's like the fake item box (RIP) of the generation - it does basically absolutely nothing, especially when you have 10 coins and serves no practical purpose.  
This is somewhat common knowledge, but the purpose of coins within the game are to not only allow you to unlock more karts, but also to increase your top speed and give you a speed boost. When you have hit 10 coins, the max, you have reached a higher top speed than normal, and every coin you collect gives you a barely noticeable speed boost - I nickname them [""Mini Mushrooms""](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110710013255/nintendo/en/images/f/f0/MiniMushroom_NSMB_Wii.png) because that's basically what they are - Mushrooms that provide speed boosts on a much smaller scale.  
It's common for you to find the Coin item in the higher places, namely 1st and 2nd. Because they can't be used defensively, and serve nearly zero purpose once you have 10 coins, no one goes, ""Yay, I got a coin!"" Instead, they go, ""Fuck, another coin!""  
As with actual coins, however, the Coin item also gives you a tiny speed boost when you use it. We are here to take advantage of this.  
When you get hit by anything (Lightning, Blue Shell, Red / Green Shell), you lose 3 coins. That means if you had 10 coins before, you're now down to 7, meaning your top speed and total coins collected for that race are now lower.  
If you have 10 coins and you use your Coin item, you are neglecting the top speed / collection benefit of the coin.  
So what am I telling you? You should save your Coin item if you have 10 coins already. If there is a chance you are hit by an item, if you have your coin item in hand, you can boost straight back up to 9 coins, which gives you a higher max speed than 7 coins do. It still provides this minimal speed boost. That way, your item is fully utilized. Of course, if you have 10 coins, you should still try to swap for a defensive weapon, so if you're approaching another set of item boxes, and you aren't expecting a Shell on its way, use your coin and pray that you get a Shell instead.  
Save your coins, players!  
This adds basically nothing to the game, as the speed boost is basically neglected because it's really tiny, and so is the max speed boost, which isn't anything major.

,leagueoflegends,"The other day I noticed a thread regarding player endorsements from companies that offer services outside Riot’s terms of service. As if I was an e-sports Batman someone called for me to “get on it.” The thread, later removed under the assertion it was “witch hunting” (odd, as it didn’t name a witch), can be read here: http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2804oa/top_streamerscontent_creators_advertising_illegal/

Just to show you guys that I do care I thought I’d share a few thoughts. I also thought, rather than shoehorn those thoughts into one of those editorials you enjoy so much, I would just post it on this forum, away from the clamour for web traffic.

In what must qualify as one of those rare moments in life I found myself agreeing with the original poster that Elo boosting account services are “wrong”. It isn’t that I particularly care for Riot’s terms of service, rather that it does go against the core of the single player experience. There are many other minor transgressions that do this also that few seem to care about but I think most would agree that a game that has competition at its centre, the main appeal of which is to assess your own improvement through directly competing against your similarly skilled peers, is ruined by such fakery.

I certainly would encourage you to reserve that ire for those among the players who have and continue to Elo boost directly, rather than those sponsored by companies that so happen to do it as a sideline. It still goes on and it’s a pretty poorly kept secret as to who has done and still does. Perhaps there was some excuse back around the dawn of Season 1, when the game wasn’t really commercially viable as an e-sport. Now it seems somewhat needless with the opportunities out there. And also be under no doubt that Riot have been informed about the players doing it and have in some cases taken no discernable action against the offenders, further making a mockery of their so far inconsistent disciplinary policy.

With that said, I must say it does seem that there is a lack of consistency in the consensus arrived at by the collective (that is, the community members who cared enough to comment on this forum). In summary that conclusion was that it was wrong for streamers and content creators to endorse any companies that offered services outside of Riot’s terms of service, even if they weren’t promoting those services directly. This would be fine were it not for the fact that the ad-block culture has made it increasingly difficult for those people to earn a substantial living without such endorsements. Indeed, I am confident that the average e-sports figure would much rather stay away from any service that could result in a potential scandal blowing back on them, be it Elo boosting, account hacking or game keys that never materialise. After all, it certainly isn’t the faceless companies that will receive the verbal flogging that will ensue. However, needs must as the devil drives and with diminishing returns for simply offering the same broadcast that made them popular in the first place, other alternatives become increasingly necessary.

I talk to a lot of these people in my work, be it Twitch TV e-celebrities, Youtube “sensations” or websites that provide video content. Each time I have a conversation I am informed that the percentage of people who are using ad-block has increased. Most recently I heard one individual lament that it was as high as eighty percent and effectively made their numbers meaningless in terms of monetisation. 

Now, anyone who knows my work knows that when every senior figure in the industry was expected to come out in a campaign against ad-block, I was a lone vocal proponent of what ad-block brings to the table. I was told I was endorsing theft – from people who play copyrighted music without permission on air no less – and was contributing to a gloomy future for the industry at large. Now, I am not retracting what I articulated at the time, namely that it not only acts as a necessary shield against disgustingly intrusive advertising but also provides us with an element of consumer choice in who we effectively fund, but it is a reality that the rise of the ad-block using fan is only going to further push the streamers towards alternative revenue streams, such as the ones cited. 

E-sports is steeped in a culture of “get what you can, when you can” on its best days. The “cyber athletes” are young, taking part in something that is equal parts sport, goof and gap year. There isn’t the infrastructure to transition into other roles naturally when a playing career ends. The fact is that a playing “career” these days can in some cases barely limp past a year. Finally the Popes have something to point to and laugh about it lacking longevity. Where is the room for loyalty to organisations and team-mates, respect for contracts and a gnawing instinct for self-preservation in such circumstances. For a very limited few e-sports can be hugely lucrative, putting millions in the bank. Many will at least be able to fund an education or at least a decent standard of living while acquiring one. How many will return in their mid twenties with their new qualifications and ambitions? 

What some of you might not know also is that the community demand for high quality content, both in terms of innovation and production value, combined with an unwillingness to support it financially are rapidly turning “content” into a loss leader. I’m not just talking about the idiots with flawed business models that burn through enough money to rid the third world of debt while hoping it will be counter-balanced though Google Adsense. I am talking about people who are legitimately dedicated to regularly bringing you what you want – on site interviews, reality-style shows, one off mini-documentaries – who never see anything near a return on that investment. All too often we have to prop up the content creation through other aspects of the business. There’s a real reason why the year everyone predicted would be “the age of studios” hasn’t come close to eradicating bedroom broadcasting.

So there is a part for you to play in all this, some self-reflection at least. Ask yourself which you truly feel more strongly about – your players endorsing, even tangentially, products and services you find morally questionable, or having to sit through 90 seconds of advertisements on occasion. Better yet, why not imagine yourself a shareholder of sorts and hit the “subscribe” button. It makes for a much better platform from where to provide feedback than sitting on the sidelines wanting your players and figureheads to be both ethically upstanding and penalised financially for doing so.

,ptcgo,"Hello reddit friends, 

last night i stumbled upon pokemon online tcg. I know, lucky me. my girlfriend now loves me more than ever. neither one of us has stopped playing since. 

That being said, neither of us have ever played pokemon card games in the past, so were both slightly overwhelmed. i was hoping maybe some of my questions can be answered here.  

1) is this game worth playing if you dont actually have a card collection in real life?  neither of us have one, and im sure we arent ever going to have one. can you play just collecting the online cards?

2) are there any sets for booster packs that are better to buy than others when you are starting out? i mean we literally have only the starter cards, and there are like 25 different booster packs in the store. knowing where to start seems impossible. 

3) i see there is a tourney tab. can anyone explain the tourneys, cost/reward/ when is the right time to step into it. 

4) there is a scanning app ive seen. i assume it helps transfer real cards into the virtual universe. could someone explain this? is there more to it?

5) what does ex mean? ive gotten a few boosters while playing the AI challenge thing, and scored a card that had this at the end. does this make it better?

6) ive gotten a few cards that are doubles, but the abilities are different. should i just pick the one that has an ability i like more? are there alot of these? 

7) how can you tell what rarity something is? im used to games having clear indicators for things like this, and it seems like im missing it here. 

8) is there a place with a real beginners guide? ive read a number of them on the interwebs, but it seems they all assume you know all the pokemon/all the sets/ etc. and i dont. 

also i guess i should say, ive played a ton of tcgs over the years. especially alot online. currently my lady and i both play hearthstone.  so when it comes to the actual play there isnt a problem at all. we both understand the mechanics of how to play the game luckily. 

im sure im still missing a ton of questions that need asking, but this is all i can think of right now. thanks for your time and hopefully i can get some insight as to what im missing.

,iOSProgramming,"This is a bit of a repost from /r/marketing but I thought all of you app developers might be interested in hearing about our launch experience so far: 

wall of text incoming..

As I'm sure many of you know, building an app is only half the battle, as much of the challenge lies in getting people to download and use your app. 2 weeks ago we launched a productivity app in the iOS app store called RadResume. It's a free resume and cover letter building tool that lets you create beautiful, elegant &amp; effective resumes on your iPhone &amp; iPad. If you're curious to check it out, here's the link:

https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/radresume-create-professional/id735065382?ls=1&amp;mt=8

I wanted to share with you our experience so far in the app store from a marketing point of view.

First some numbers:

* Nearly 4000 users of the app so far.
* Our average session time is 7:38 meaning people are spending a fair bit of time in the app. But it's also a testament to how quickly our app lets you create a nice looking resume.
* A little over 1500 people have used our LinkedIn import tool to import their data to generate a resume.
* A bit over 2% of our users have completed In App Purchases.

**Marketing Activities We've Engaged In**

* We've done the obvious like setup a website: http://www.radresumeapp.com along with the requisite twitter and facebook accounts.
* During the development process we blogged about various topics related to app development.
* Prior to launch we collected email addresses on our site from anyone that was interested in hearing from us when the app was live.
* We created a demo video which you can see here: http://vimeo.com/96873515
* We created a downloadable press kit for app reviewers and press to use.
* On launch day we engaged our personal networks of family and friends to download the app, use it and leave us a positive review in the app store.
* On launch day we started to reach out to the tech / app review press. We tailored each of our e-mails and wound up sending out around 170 messages to try and attract the attention of these various sites. If you're interested in the list, here it is free for download: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Rb2y9EbhDFWZrfgTG0GyOYJ2y4JM4tKRHf5CV7I7VGc/edit?usp=sharing
* Posted about our app in various apple related forums including MacRumours.
* Reached out to a few dozen career / job hunting related sites and blogs.
* Reached out to a few dozen design / culture / hey this is cool related sites and blogs
* Reached out to around 10 app review YouTube channel owners.
* Participated in a few app review exchange marketplaces.

**What's Worked and What Hasn't**

* The demo video we created has been collectively viewed 269 times. While this may not seem like a lot, for an app demo it's not bad. We know there is room for improvement here however as something much more creative infused with humour has a much greater chance of getting spread around. If our app continues to gain traction we'll likely put some effort into creating a demo video more conducive to viral sharing.
* Our press outreach has been a fairly mixed bag so far. We used a service called Banana Tag to track which of our cold email introductions to the app were opened, clicked on etc... Out of all the press emails we sent out 96 of them were opened, meaning the rest were deleted, went into their spam folder, etc. Thus far we've received **four press reviews**, only one of which drove any significant downloads and popped us up to the #10 spot in the Indonesian app store for productivity apps for a day.
* We've gotten some replies from a few career / hr blogs that want us to do a guest posting for them so that should drive some downloads when these posts get published.
*  Our ASO efforts have been a mixed bag as well. In the first few days we were ranking quite highly in various English speaking app stores for some of our keyword phrases such as ""resume, resumes, cover letter, cv, cvs"".. but we've since taken a bit of a tumble. Our current rankings in the U.S. app store for these searches are: resume: #25, cover letter: #3, resumes: #4, cvs: #6.


**Marketing Arrows Left to Fire**

* We plan on reaching out to other somewhat related productivity apps and engaging them to see if they have any interest in doing cross-promotional activities.
* Follow-up outreach with press. We know our app isn't the sexiest and most prone to be written about so our follow-up approach will be to wow them with our usage numbers.
* Continue outreach to influencers in the app review / Apple sphere as well as in the HR / career sphere.
Build customer testimonials.
* Continue to build our internal e-mail list of customers and market to them with new features / resume templates.
* Work on some more creative things like resume tip infographics.
* Continue tweaking app metadata to get better ASO results.

Three other things I'd like to mention...

**In-App Purchase Piracy**
As first time app developers, we were surprised at this super high number of jailbreakers that are stealing our resume templates via IAP piracy. I guess we thought Apple had a better handle on this, but I guess not. We'll be adding a few counter measures to curb this in an upcoming release, but holy hell do people like to steal IAP content... according to Google Analytics... over 80% of total IAP activities have been fraudulent. Kind of crazy. 

**Paying for App Reviews**
The reality is that unless you literally have money to burn, DON'T DO IT. The sites that you really want to review your app with huge exposure won't ask you to pay for reviews. The ones that do ask you to pay for a review, their traffic is insignificant and paying for a review with them is akin to flushing your money down the toilet. 

**Pricing Models**
Pricing in the app store is tricky. We opted to go the FREE model with IAP as our primary source of revenue. We're not sure if this was a mistake or not yet, but we definitely are going to experiment with our pricing. Once the app has some more templates available we're possibly thinking of flipping the app away from FREE and giving away the majority of the templates. This will likely have a huge negative impact on overall download numbers, but it might actually increase our revenue. This remains to be seen. If we choose to go that route and then in the future flip the app back to FREE for a limited time, it will likely get picked up by all the NOT FREE to FREE trackers on the web and get a nice boost in download numbers that way. In any case, pricing is tricky, I'd encourage all app developers to experiment to find the sweet spot for your app.

Hope this post was somewhat insightful to anyone out there working on their app or looking to promote something they've already created. I'd love to hear any feedback / suggestions about our app or our marketing efforts so far.

,leagueoflegends,"If I have heard correctly riot plans on reworking yorick, I have never played yorick myself but I have heard plenty of people complain about yorick and as a person that mains top I have only ran into one yorick the entire time I have played so I think yorick needs a rework.I think yorick should have regular abilities like normal champions but should also have a system along the lines of thresh and malzahar where he needs to collect souls from minions and champions and once he gets X (I think 10 minion souls or one champion soul are good numbers) amount of souls his next ability will spawn a ghost.I have some ideas for his abilities but i don't have names so if you guys want to suggest some names.Q-This could be one of those simple abilities that make your next attack do extra damage like wukongs Q  nasus's Q, also when he has 10 souls he can spawn a damage ghost that scales with AD. Also leveling your abilities will make that ghost stronger.W-This marks a enemy (puts like a tombstone icon above them) and slightly lowers their armor and magic resist whiles it on them and any ghost you spawn will target that person. This ability can help you cs under tower as you can make the ghost target minions to help you farm from a safe position or zone a champion by marking them or focus an adc out of a team fight with your ghost. This will also spawn a tanky ghost that scales with your health when you have 10 souls.E-This could be a area of effect slow where he makes a swamp similar to trundles pillar of ice but with out the pillar and it could work similar to jayces Gate thing where any ghost that walks through it gains a movement speed boost. This can also spawn a ranged ghost that scales with AP when he has 10 souls.R-His ult will connect a chain similar to LeBlanc's chain or karma's chain to any enemy around him and this suck  souls from everyone around this could do a little bit of damage but the main thing it does is give yorick a stock pile of souls. This will last for like X seconds or until yorick or all of the enemies break the chain(Also he can only get a max of 100 souls for balancing this). Now that he has these souls he could choose to reactivate his ult and spawn a mega ghost that gets stronger depending on the amount of souls you have in stockpile or you can choose to spam your regular ghost(you still have cool downs on your abilities so you can't spawn 10 ghost at once but you can still put out alot of ghost in a short amount of time). Also you can't choose to spawn a couple ghost then use the leftover souls to spawn the ult ghost you can only choose one or the other not both.This is my idea for yorick please suggest any better ideas that you may have.Also I typed this on my phone and this is my first reddit post so I apologize for any mistakes.",,False,,0,,Yorick rework,,,,,,0.0,,,False,t3_281ra4,False,,,,,0.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},,,0,,,,default,1402672071,,,,,,True,,1402668767.0,,,,,,self.leagueoflegends,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,t5_2rfxx,,,,,281ra4,,,[deleted],,3,,,,,,,/r/leagueoflegends/comments/281ra4/yorick_rework/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/281ra4/yorick_rework/,,1402665167,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441313580.0,,,
,TwoXChromosomes,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to discuss this, but I thought you all might have some insights on how to address this situation, or if I should at all:

A few wonderful things have happened to my fiancé and me recently. I’m wrapping up my master’s degree and both of us recently got new jobs that, financially speaking, boosted us from poverty and crippling student debt to nearly middle class status.

His is a full-time job at a grocery store with good benefits and a decent salary. It’s a great job for him, and he’s already excelling at it; his managers have given him more responsibility than any other new hire, and they’ve pegged him as a potential manager in the future. He started coming home satisfied, and he was thrilled at the potential to move up in the company. 

Before this, he’s had four consecutive part-time jobs with which he was dissatisfied and which dragged him into depression, so this was a great change.

I am exceedingly proud of him, and I love seeing his smile every day. 

A few days before he got the job, I was hired as a web editor. Because of the nature of the job—as well as my experience and education—it pays about twice as much as his grocery store job, ~~making me the breadwinner.~~ **and as a result, I pay most of our expenses. (Folks pointed out that ""breadwinner"" isn't accurate because it's 100% a team effort. After all, he does get 90% of the groceries now!)**

When he got his job, he called his two older brothers to tell them the good news. He loves, admires and respects them immensely, and they usually support him.

But not this time.

This time, when he called to say he’d gotten a new job, they did not congratulate him. They did not tell him that they were proud of his achievement.

Instead, they told him that he should keep looking for a different job. They told him that a job at a grocery store is inadequate. 

It doesn’t pay enough, they told him. It isn’t good enough, especially when he’s planning to marry a “strong woman,” even though it makes him happy and he’s proud of his work. They told him I'll leave him for someone with a higher-paying job.

To make matters worse, they won’t leave it alone. They call to ask how the job hunt is going when he’s not applying for new jobs. They ask when he’s going to do more, to be better. 

Despite my reassurance that I don't give a damn about his salary (and if I did, I wouldn't have agreed to marry him when our collective debt grazed six digits), my fiancé now feels like he should be looking for a different/higher paying job. With every call, his satisfaction with his current job declines, and his smile wanes. His brothers did the same thing with his last job, and he ended up hating it enough to look for the current one.

Of the two of us, I’ve always been more competitive and driven. I’ve consistently had two or three jobs in addition to multiple majors in undergrad and, afterward, my advanced degree. I pursue my goals relentlessly and tackle challenges head on. Before I met him, I fully intended to take care of myself and to succeed, with or without the help of a romantic partner. Now that I’ve found the man I want to spend the rest of my life with, I’m fiercely dedicated to providing for both of us so that we can pursue the life we want.

Meanwhile, he’s as zen as a Buddhist monk—calm, caring and introspective. 

I want to emphasize that he is not a weak person by anyone’s standards. On the contrary, he’s the strongest person I’ve ever met, and he’s incredibly supportive in every way. He’s as steady as a mountain and tempers my fiery personality, making me a better person. He’s the yin to my yang, my matching puzzle piece, my best friend, my sun and stars.

And I am absolutely *livid* that his brothers have the gall to suggest that his achievement is inadequate and that he could somehow fail to meet my expectations just because he makes less money than I do. Not only is it insulting to him that they failed to congratulate him on his new job, but I’m also personally insulted that they think I’m shallow enough to leave him over something as trivial as a paycheck. The pressure they’re putting on him also—perhaps unintentionally—implies that it’s unacceptable for me to act as the breadwinner, and I can only assume that it’s because I’m a woman.

I don’t want to respond to his brothers’ behavior angrily. I think it would only make things worse. After all, they haven’t told me any of this; I hear about it through him. 

But every time I think about it, it makes me furious. I want them to apologize and start acting like the brothers they should be.

How should I handle this? Should I say anything to his brothers at all? Can I say anything to my fiancé that might help him?

**tl;dr My fiancé got a new job that he loves, but instead of congratulating him, his brothers harass him to get a better one, saying I’ll leave him because he makes less money than I do.**

**Edit: It might be worth mentioning that this has been going on for a couple of months, and I haven't said anything yet—and hadn't planned to confront them, especially without consulting him first. As some people have mentioned, it's not positive to come between brothers because it's their business, not mine. I just don't want him to quit this job that he loves just because his brothers think it's inadequate.**",,False,,0,,Unsure how to respond to the douchebaggery of my future brothers-in-law,,,,,,0.0,,,False,t3_281p0p,False,,,,,0.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},,,0,,,,default,1402668563,,,,,,True,,1402666833.0,,,,,,self.TwoXChromosomes,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,t5_2r2jt,,,,,281p0p,,,[deleted],,4,,,,,,,/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/281p0p/unsure_how_to_respond_to_the_douchebaggery_of_my/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/281p0p/unsure_how_to_respond_to_the_douchebaggery_of_my/,,1402663233,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441313609.0,,,

**Background**

Long story short, back in 1999, MRBC (Monster Rancher/Farm Battle Card) was a trading card game that came into existence and then died out just 2 years later with almost no following or digital trace. I really loved it, and I wanted to be able to play it.

However, the game barely existed physically, and a lot of the cards were never translated into English. So, I started trying to completely reproduce the game, from the ground up. I collected as much of the original art as I could, gained from game sprites, ebay auctions, and lengthy google image searches. I also found all the cards’ data online, but that was far easier thanks to game walkthroughs.

Currently, I've digitally re-designed and physically produced the [original](http://media.tumblr.com/7820587fea54f0b41347e0921b71589f/tumblr_inline_mue7769YV11rlzos8.jpg) [3 series](http://media.tumblr.com/b18a7bfc7a2195bc888ce03f918e06ce/tumblr_inline_mue7fihcqp1rlzos8.jpg) [of cards,](http://media.tumblr.com/38e4cd21d32b05d63c2a9858e20b9ebc/tumblr_inline_mue8ke52I41rlzos8.jpg) as well as [tokens,](http://media.tumblr.com/2f9f9529acffee6da2cd5082b5468211/tumblr_inline_mue83x9Alz1rlzos8.jpg) more [tokens,](http://media.tumblr.com/07ccb9ea58713f54dd0824bb991579a2/tumblr_inline_mue84a7HgK1rlzos8.jpg) [holo's,](http://i.imgur.com/zMbr0YO.gif) and even [some shiny tear-able boosters.](http://i.imgur.com/zC9dfCC.gif)

**Now MRBC is playable online, as a beta,** *thanks so much to LackeyCCG, a handy cuztomizable TCG program.* It is very much a beta- the program is kinda finicky, and will misbehave often if you don't learn it's ticks. I've done my best to customize it to make the experience of playing MRBC as smooth as possible. The cards themselves are also beta's. Right now, all cards from series 1-3 are playable, and I am working to get the never-translated series 4 playable. I am updating the cards themselves to be more legible and a bit cleaner, as well as working to add in the new translations, which are in clearer English, and have better game-wording.

**DOWNLOADS**

[*Windows*](http://www.mediafire.com/download/9ql775bsqh4k7db/MRBC_windows.zip)

[*Mac*](http://www.mediafire.com/download/nhlxjixx4q1tnse/MRBC_mac.zip)

-------

**Program instructions:**

1) After downloading, just unzip, launch ""MRBC via Lackey.exe"" and you're good to go!

2) In the main game window, I recommend dragging the blue-granite ""hand zone"" down so that it's top is level with the bottom of the card preview window (in the top left.) If you are playing with friends who are using Skype, Teamspeak, etc., I recommend dragging the chat log window all the way down so it's out of sight. That way, your hand zone will be much larger, and the cards will be bigger.

3) To play online, click the ""server"" tab near the top of the program, then go into the right window, and either host or join a game. (You'll likely need to check the box which says to use a proxy server.)

4) When creating a deck, make sure to place monster not directly into your deck, but instead into the ""Monsters"" tab. Then, when playing, your monsters will not get shuffled in, and will instead be in the ""Monsters"" tab by your deck tab.

5) After playing a monster, click it, then click control+p / control+l to add / subtract life points.

6) Hitting ""Make 1 Guts"" will make the furthest to the left card in your hand into 1 Guts. You can drag cards in your hand to wherever you want so as to Guts what you want. Hitting ""Use 1 Guts"" will burn a Guts for you. (Use / burn are also control+g / control+b by default.)

**Rules of the Game (shorter explanation)**

Winning:

You win if all of your opponent's monsters die, or if your opponent ever needs to draw and can't.

Card types:

Cards come in two types: monster cards, which are listed as C0XY, and skill cards. Skill cards are further divided into attack, defense, and breeder cards.

Monster cards: 

These represent the monsters the players pit against one another. They are separate from the rest of the deck, and are set aside at the beginning of the game. The initial life value defines how much life they start off with, and whether the monster is aerial or ground-based is also indicated on the card. A monster can only use skill cards belonging to it, except for special ""Allmon"" cards that can be used by any breed.
There are also fusion monster cards, which have a primary breed and a sub-breed. The primary breed determines which attack skills, the sub-breed determines which defense skills the monster can use. If the sub-breed is ""???"", the defense skills also come from the primary breed.

Skill cards:

To play a skill card, its cost needs to be paid by using guts. This is done by moving a number of cards equal to the skill's cost from the top of the player's guts pile to their discard pile. At the end of your turn, you may send as many cards from your hand to your guts pile as you want. At the beginning of each turn, you draw cards until you have exactly 5 total cards in your hand.

Attack skills: These cards are used to deal damage to your opponent's monsters. They can be power attacks (sword symbol), intelligence attacks (book symbol), or special attacks (""!"" symbol). Some skills may also have special properties, triggering various effects when played, as defined in their description.

Defense skills: These cards are used to avoid or lessen the effects of attacks. They can be blocks (shield symbol) or dodges (staircase-like symbol). Their exact properties are defined in their description. They can only be used during your opponent's turn when you are getting attacked.

Breeder skills: These cards represent actions not taken by monsters, but by the breeder (player). Some of these cards are environmental effects (""o"" symbol), which affect every player and remain in play until replaced by another environmental card.

Setting up the game:
The two players place their monsters on the table, and set their life to the initial values indicated on the cards. Then they both shuffle their decks and determine who goes first. The second player then draws five cards, and can choose to turn up to two cards into guts BEFORE player 1 begins. Then, the starting player's first normal turn begins. (The starting player may attack on turn 1.)

Turn progression:
The two players take turns. Each turn consists of the following phases:

- Draw phase: The active player draws cards from his deck until they have 5 cards in their hand. If they already have 5 cards in hand, the top card of the deck has to be moved to the guts pile. If you can't draw enough cards to make a hand of 5, you lose.
- Battle phase: The active player may attack once with each of their monsters that are still alive. A breeder card may also be played once per turn. The opposing player can respond to the cards being played by playing cards of his own to defend against their effects. If the active player kills all the opponent's monsters by reducing their life to zero, they win the match.
- Guts phase: The active player can take any number of cards from their hand and place it on top of their guts pile.

Deck construction:

A deck must contain three different monsters, and exactly 50 skill cards. There can be at most three copies of any skill card in the deck.

Warrior type characters have it easy in that they can get their armor just by straight up crafting the ore into their gear, but the dex and mag characters must also collect a second reagent to make their gear.

[Are there three different ""Cherrys?""  A singer, a voice actress and an artist?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci627wx?context=5)|I'm afraid to disappoint you, but there is only one Cherry...
[What are your favorite lyrics from any of your songs? Where do you get your inspiration for new songs?  How do you plan to play your music live? Will the characters be displayed in some way, given that they are digital?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci6277b?context=5)|For me personally, Friday Night Gurus. It's a song about Dyna Mink and me. I find that rather cool. (and it's not about Daft Punk as I saw suggested this week, much as I love Daft Punk).
[Where did you get the inspiration for the character Goldie Foxx?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci62729?context=5)|Believe it or not, I stole a chair from a friend at a dinner party and he accused me of being like Goldilocks. Goldie Foxx sounded better to me though and I needed an excuse to wear mirrored aviators.
[Hey! Have been a fan for a while and loved how you guys have grown and progressed and I really freaking hope you get the 50k, a world tour would be so great for you and I'd love to see the exposure you'd get and how much fun fans could have.  My question is, what kinda techniques are you thinking of using for live stuff? I know Gorillaz used 3D projections a good few years ago which might work, but at the same time the tech could be expensive. Part of me would honestly enjoy just seeing the people behind SK and the characters on stage, but if you're gonna do these live shows you might as well do them right and get Cherry up there etc. Have you guys settled on one method?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci629em?context=5)|Ahhh. Good one. You may have seen one of the screens we are using for our live shows (posted earlier)? We have some amazing tech on the go, but what we are hoping is that the visual content will also make our show something quite unique. Having partners such as Immersive who have done major shows for many amazing artists, gives a huge sense of security.
[What do you think of other virtual bands? Gorillaz? The Vocaloids? Have you ever heard of Mistula from the Philippines? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci629n1?context=5)|I hadn't head of Mistula actually. I'm sure Cherry has. Will go and check Mistula out...
[Any word on when we're getting the Jenny video? &lt;3.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci628fo?context=5)|I know we have said this a million times, but it is in production! I don't think enough people realise that the opening 19 seconds of our Kickstarter video is a sequence from the Jenny video. There's another chunk finished which will be in our live show. It's just a question of Cherry stringing the parts together once we have the first live shows in the bag. They have become all-consuming to say the least.
[Hi Goldie! I asked this question on your facebook page a while back, but is there any chance of things like jewelry and other small trinkets being added to your shop? I really love the merchandise you all have now (I bought the 'Bounce Her' print pillow case and it is SO perfect\) but would really like some smaller, cheaper things I can wear on a day to day basis.  To add to that, what is the band's collective standpoint on fan-made merchandise? I only ask because I'd like to make necklace pendants based off of yours and Mink's heads in the 'Eros and Apollo' video (How's that sound?\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci62u9z?context=5)|Yes, we're hoping to launch our own store soon. Society 6 was a stop gap whilst we got the live shows going. It's definitely on the cards though...
[Would you ever collaborate with other animated acts? I hear Murdoc Niccals got himself into some financial trouble and could really use a boost.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci62cm1?context=5)|That would be fun! We'd like to collaborate with people in your World too though.
[That's fair enough! I hear Damon Albarn is a good musician too.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci631kl?context=5)|Song 2 is one of my favourite songs. Love it.
[How exactly do you guys plan on creating a live show? Will it be based mostly on screens/projection/video? Or will there be costumes and other stage effects?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci62aff?context=5)|With some surprises thrown in for good measure!
 |And the visuals are already starting to look amazing.
[Love you guys! When you came up with the songs, was it put together piece-by-piece separately over the internet, or did you all meet together frequently for creative sessions?  As far as the collaboration, was it pretty equal, or was there a dominant brainchild for the music, like Jimmy in The Postal Service?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci629t9?context=5)|We like to see ourselves as a audiovisual collective, with different members taking the lead in different situations. Dyna Mink is the DJ, I play the keys (and fiddle with kick drums) and Cherry covers all the remaining bases. As you suggest, we found each other on the internet and have existed virtually ever since. The whole album was written in the fibre optic cables of this World.
[What program do you and Dyna-mink use to make your music? do you have any advice for a new music producer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci626gr?context=5)|Logic Pro...I swear by it. Although I don't really swear very much. Best advice I can give is (clichéd as it sounds) to stay to true to what you enjoy making the most. If you don't like it, you shouldn't expect others to either. And keep pushing!
[Have you ever considered collaboration with Gorillaz or any other virtual bands?  Assuming your tour would be coming to the states, where would it be?  Love your music! Can't wait for the live show!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci62exp?context=5)|We did consider that, but we wouldn't want to confine ourselves to the digital world. We definitely intend to visit the US. Initially we would probably have to look at the major centers where we have enough support to warrant putting on shows. Off the top of my head, we'd probably try East Coast, Chicago-ish, Florida, Houston/Austin (not sure which) and West Coast. We need to speak to an agent to work out how to do this, but this was always the plan once we had actually created the show in the first place - hence the Kickstarter!
[What does Cherry use to animate all those music videos by herself? Props to you guys for doing it, it looks fantastic.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci62d41?context=5)|Thanks! That's a question I should probably leave her to answer when we do a group AMA at some point...
[How are your live shows going to be preformed? Is it going to be completely digital, or will there be performers on stage?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci62b4e?context=5)|Dyna Mink and I will be there on stage. Cherry's appearance is dependent on whether she gets her rider sorted. Did someone order the flowers and repaint her dressing room yet?!
[How did you all come across the agreement to use Cherry's artwork as the image for your band? (Which is stunningly beautiful by the way.\) Was it just a mutual agreement, or did you go through several decision making phases?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci628mp?context=5)|Very good question. And very hard to answer. Put it this way, we all found each other by chance and it was a very straightforward fit.
[What will you do if the Kickstarter doesn't reach its goal? Is that the end of all hope for non-Finnish fans who wish to see you perform live?  Can't wait to see you at Ilosaarirock!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci62esb?context=5)|I don't want to tempt fate, but we really need the Kickstarter to reach its goal. Everything hangs off it, but I'm trying not to think about that too much. We still have 3 1/2 days and I'm hoping this weekend is going to be an active one! It's certainly a massive rollercoaster ride doing a Kickstarter campaign - I don't think we foresaw that. (keep spreading the word - we're not supposed to talk about it on here I don't think according to the rules)!
[Is it just yourself, Dyna-mink, and Cherry in the Studio Killers, or are there more people working behind the scenes? If so, how difficult is it to write music and lyrics, as well as animate music videos all by yourselves?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci62akf?context=5)|This is an easy one. Just us. Although we are starting to work with more and more specialists, such as Immersive, without whom we wouldn't be able to consider our live show. We have also co-written a few songs (including Grande Finale) with friends.
[What brought you to music, and electronic in particular? Maybe a stupid question but, do you guys play instruments? If so, which ones?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci62a6g?context=5)|We have always loved electronic music and have a not-so-secret love affair with French electronic music over the last 15 years or so. Between us, we play the wheels of steel (old skool expression), piano and guitar. I think Cherry might occasionally play the drums too, but we don't really have much room for them in our tracks, unless they're V Drums.
[What similarities do you and your character Goldie Foxx share? How are your personalities different?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci62qjw?context=5)|Are you suggesting that somehow I am not one and the same?!
[Will you guys give a voice to Bi-Polar Bear? I'd love to hear that bear talk, I bet he's quite the conversationalist. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci62rr0?context=5)|Now this is a good one...he actually features once in one of our very early videos. I think it's David and Peter right back in the early videos on our YouTube channel. He has one word and it is: ""bo%*ocks"".
[In the past you said that you would reveal your real identities as soon as someone correctly guesses them all. Has anybody come close (as in, say, guessing 2 out of 3 correctly\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci629zs?context=5)|But I am Goldie Foxx, he is Dyna Mink and our beautiful, ever so slightly temperamental friend is Cherry. We have always been very open about that! The information is all out here somewhere...
[Hey Goldie! I'm a huge fan and I'm very excited about your kickstarter, I hope this leads to a performance in the US someday :\)  My question is what is it like for everyone writing and performing songs from the female perspective? Does remaining anonymous affect this? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci62kk2?context=5)|Writing from a female point of view is easy for Cherry. Luckily for Dyna Mink and me, we can concentrate on the music mostly and try and create the right vibes to inspire her.
[Any chance i can hope for a studio killers vinyl? you guys are great!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci62lkz?context=5)|Yes! I wanted to do a picture disk for our Kickstarter as a reward, but wasn't sure we'd get enough interest. We will do one at some point though.
[You guys are so close to meeting your goal, but I feel like you could all benefit from another week if possible.  Is there a reason you left the kickstarter open for a small amount of time?  I love you all and hope you come to the U.S. preferably LA area :\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci62kxy?context=5)|I'm asking myself that question too, but basically we had to run a quick campaign, because our production costs are sky-rocketing for the first gigs and in order to be able to perform at these festivals, we needed to secure funding quickly. It's real seat-of-your-pants stuff!
[You are performing live for the first time ever this summer, which will happen at two Finnish festivals. Can you give us any details on how you will be visualized on stage? Won't the midnight sun cause problems if darkness is required, or will you perform in a large festival tent? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci63153?context=5)|I posted a few still earlier today of one of our 4 screens we'll be using on stage, just to give you a teaser. From what I understand, we will be in a 10,000 capacity tent. These are huge gigs and I'm going to be getting those butterflies going again nearer the time!
[What other animals would you like to work with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci62lmx?context=5)|We're working with an otter now actually.
[How big of an influence were/are Gorillaz on the band if at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci63bjy?context=5)|Believe it or not, they weren't an influence, much as we like them. We just wanted to do our own thing and figured there had to be room for more than one audiovisual collective in this World.
[On the subject of music producing, what is your favorite add on to use when you work with logic? i'm a big fan of Sylenth1! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci62gh8?context=5)|We use Sylenth a lot. Also ANA. And lots of analogue. I have just ordered a Jupiter 50 actually, which I know isn't analogue, but it just looks so great and I need a solid keyboard for ""live"" which will cover all the bases.
[How do you handle finances/decision-making in the collective? is there a standard legal apparatus to do it or is it ad hoc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci6345p?context=5)|We discuss things a lot. Occasionally in a heated, yet polite manner, but there is no legal apparatus!
[What is the gender ratio of the creative members of the band?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci62bo9?context=5)|Blimey. 2:1. Are you including Bears?
[What are your feelings on people who have these perplexing questions about who you ""really"" are behind your digital visage? As if you'd lie to your fans!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci63ddz?context=5)|Exactly. It always confuses me too!
[When will you release the Sweet Disposition cover? I'm addicted to the snippet and need to hear the full thing...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci62ahc?context=5)|Most definitely!
[Hey Foxx! What ever became of the plans to open the SK online Shop? I know it was all ready to go and then some problems came up but we haven't heard anything since.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci62mw0?context=5)|Yes. You were very patient with us on that one. We didn't actually have any control over that in the end and have been trying to find a good alternative ever since. I think we may have found a very exciting new outlet, but we feel we shouldn't announce anything until it's sorted to avoid a repeat of the last attempt at a launch.
[How do you as an animated band prepare before performing in front of a live-action crowd? Are there lots of animated nerves involved?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci62fdg?context=5)|We get the tour manager to check the broadband/DSL connection to make sure we can actually get to the venue in the first place!
[I love you guys! Your music is awesome. Where did you get the inspiration for your characters?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci631h6?context=5)|I thought we weren't allowed to do that? Will put it up and see what happens!
[Also, you should probably put a link to your kickstarter here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/280293/i_am_goldie_foxx_from_studio_killers_ama/ci631h6?context=5)|Our characters came from within. Isn't that how it is for everybody?

,Diablo3witchdoctors,"So you want to be a hardcore pet doctor?

I have a hardcore pet doctor with nearly 200 hours played that is farming T6 solo.  I'd like to write a guide for fresh hardcore pet doctors to follow.  This guide will probably be very similar to most guides you see for building up a pet doctor, but I haven't seen any that are geared specifically towards hardcore.

--------

****The Skill Build****

[The Basic Build]( http://us.battle.net/d3/en/calculator/witch-doctor#WlYTUQ!WTVe!bbcbcb)

Plague of Toads (Rain of Toads) - Fetish generator.  Use Addling Toads if you find a Rhen'ho Flayer.

Piranhas (Piranhado) - If you are playing with a group and someone else is already using a pull ability, consider changing to the Wave of Mutilation rune so that you can hit more targets, more often.

Zombie Dogs (Leeching Beasts) - This is if you have a TMF.  Some people will tell you to use Lifelink.  Is that 10% damage mitigation going to save you after your passive pops and you are running for your life with 150k hp?  Or is your dog who is still attacking and healing you for up to 90k per attack?  I would only consider changing this to Burning Dogs when you are stuck using Magefists while gambling for Taskers.  If you don't have a TMF, then I would consider using Lifelink.

Gargantuan (Wrathful Protector) - Don't use any other Gargantuan.  Pop this big boy out whenever you are fighting large groups of trash (8-10+) or an elite pack.

Spirit Walk (Healing Journey) - It doesn't heal for much, but Spirit Vessel will heal you to 29% instead of only 15% while using this rune.

**The last skill spot is versatile and you should swap it out depending on your needs.**

Big Bad Voodoo (Slam Dance) - This should be the goto skill for your last slot.  Only swap it out if you are stuggling with damage mitigation or are grouped with other WDs that are already using it.

Horrify (Frightening Aspect) - I had to switch to this in T5-T6 until I got a Unity.  With GI, you can keep the armor buff nearly the entire time while in combat.

Mass Confusion (Paranoia) - This is an offensive alternative to BBV.  Use this when there are other WDs in your group who are already using BBV.
--------
****Passives****

Spirit Vessel - Obvious choice here for hardcore.

Fetish Sycophants - The entire build is focused around this passive obviously.

Grave Injustice - One of the best passives in the game.  Using a Thing of the Deep increases this range to 40+ yards.  Use it and abuse it.  This is what allows you to use Wrathful Protector back to back.

Pierce the Veil - Obvious choice.  I should mention that some people use Midnight Feast once they have a TMF, but I feel that this is a mistake.

--------

****Paragon Points****

Core - Move speed to cap &gt; Int

Offense - IAS &gt; CHD &gt; CHC.  Try to maintain a 1% CHC to 10% CHD ratio.

Defense - Armor or Resist All &gt; %Life.  Whichever is more toughness.

Utility - LoH &gt; Area Dmg

--------
****Offensive Stats****

Your primary element is physical.  The only exception to this is wearing Magefists while you are looking for Taskers.

Int &gt; CHD &gt; CHC &gt; Attack Speed &gt; Flat Damage.  Again try to stay 1:10 ratio with CHC and CHD.

Socket the highest Int gems you can afford.  Very rarely should you sacrifice trifecta stats on gloves, rings or amulet.  Even going from yellows to legendaries.  I used a yellow trifecta amulet on my character for 90+ hours.  The orange color of an item isn't what matters, its the stats that matter.

In hardcore with this build I draw the line at those offensive stats.  All other stats like CDR and +skill dmg I will reroll for toughness.  This build doesn't greatly benefit from +skill dmg.


****Defensive Stats****

Vitality &gt; %Life &gt; Armor &gt; All Resist

I take armor over all resist because you will already have high resist due to being an int user and the Horrify rune buffs armor by 100%.  Always socket your helm with %Life.

--------

****Gambling Priorities****

1. [Mask of Jeram](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/mask-of-jeram-3OrCkW) - Witchdoctors rely on their masks to make them effective.  This item alone will advance you a torment or two.  Nearly all of your damage comes from your pets, and this item will boost their damage by 75-100%.  This is your most powerful item.

2. [Thing of the Deep](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/thing-of-the-deep) - Pickup radius stacks on GI's initial range of 20 yards.  This makes it 40 yards at minimum.  The reason you gamble for this before Taskers is because Taskers has the potential to be very difficult to get.  A good frog is rather easy to get in comparison to Taskers.  It will last you into T4, when you will considering swapping to a Serpent for damage mitigation.  Reroll the manaregen for vitality.  If yours has vitality, reroll the manaregen for %life.  Rerolling offhands can be a real pain so don't break the bank on this and take the first thing that's beneficial to you.

3. [Tasker and Theo](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/tasker-and-theo) - This is another one of those items that will advance you a full torment or two.  With these and a MoJ, you should be farming T3-T4 easily and efficiently.  Taskers always roll with IAS, so if you are lucky enough to get CHC or CHD you should reroll the vitality to make them trifecta.  These gloves increase the damage of your pets by 40-50%.  Always use these gloves no matter what stats they roll.  While gambling for these you will probably see a few pairs of Magefists.  You should use Magefists or Cain's until you find Taskers.

4. [Harrington Waistguard](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/harrington-waistguard) or [The Witching Hour](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/the-witching-hour) - I think Harrington's is better than Witching Hour.  Harrington's works really well with pet doctors.  Once you get all of your fetishes out take a second to scan the room for a clickable.  More than doubling your damage for 10 seconds at a time can lead to some really fast rift clears.  Some maps are covered with clickables, and then others are scarce.  You'll often find them in groups of 2-3.  Make sure you watch your buff and don't waste clickables, 10 seconds is longer than you think.

5. [The Tall Man's Finger](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/the-tall-mans-finger) and [Stone of Jordan](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/stone-of-jordan) \ [Unity](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/unity) - At this point you should be farming T4 with ease.  I really don't like gambling for items that cost more than 5 bloodshards but if you need 2 or more of the above rings its worth it.

6. [Ice Climbers](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/ice-climbers) - At this point you are able to farm T5-T6, but its dangerous.  Even with the Unity trick immobilizing effects and wallers can get you killed.  These boots will reduce that risk significantly.  You may go 20 runs without needing them, but eventually you will run into that double pack of elites with vortex, frozen/jailor, waller, arcane, etc.  Vortex/Immobilization combo is the real killer so you have to break that combo with these boots.

--------
****Followers and their gear****

If you are playing solo this will be very important.  Build your followers for utility, not damage.  Damage should always be secondary to utility when it comes to your followers.  Their damage is truly insignificant compared to yours.  Always take their utility skills.

Relics - You'll want the invulnerability relic.

[The Ess of Johan](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/the-ess-of-johan) - Really amazing follower amulet.  My Templar charges in and pulls all the mobs in on top of him.

[Bul-Kathos's Wedding Band](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/bulkathoss-wedding-band) - Drains 0.5% of the enemies hp per tick.  T6 rift bosses have roughly 3.7billion hp.  That's 18.5 mil a tick.  My Templar charges in, pulls all the mobs in and starts draining them with this.

[Unity](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/unity) - You'll need a 2nd Unity ring for your follower if you are going to use the Unity trick in T6.

[Azurewrath](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/azurewrath) - The only reason to use this weapon on a follower is the 20-25% chance to freeze on hit.  Your follower will actually freeze RGs in the middle of the animations for their special abilites and it will cancel the ability.

[The Furnace](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/the-furnace) - Enchantress only.  This weapon will do tons of damage to a full health RG.  7% of 3.7 bil is 259 mil damage.

[The Tormentor](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/the-tormentor) - Enchantress only.  I used this a lot in lower torments because I hadn't found anything better.  It has a chance to charm enemies on hit.

--------

****Items to look for while progressing****

[Cain's Destiny](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/artisan/blacksmith/recipe/cains-travelers) - Using the 2 piece bonus with pants and boots is common.  You should also consider using trifecta Cain's gloves until you find Magefists or Taskers.

[Aughild's Authority](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/artisan/blacksmith/recipe/aughilds-search) - The shoulders and bracers are a must have.

[Rhen'ho Flayer](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/rhenho-flayer) - This weapon is a game changer, even if it rolls with lower damage than your current weapon.  Once you get this weapon make sure you switch your toads rune to Addling Toads and go up a torment.  The toads will confuses everything in the room, causing enemies to stop attacking you and start attacking each other.  Most people say SMK is BiS.  Which I think I would have to agree with on softcore, but on hardcore I think this competes for the top spot.

[Starmetal Kukri](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/starmetal-kukri) - Rarest WD weapon in the game.  Use BBV in every fight if you find this bad boy.

[Thunderfury](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/thunderfury-blessed-blade-of-the-windseeker) - Always rolls with a socket, you'll have the chance to reroll one of the other stats for higher damage.  You'll be spamming toads so the proc from this weapon does significat damage in lower torments and good CC in upper torments.  It reduces the attack speed of enemies which means your fetishes will last longer.

[Doombringer](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/doombringer) - Physical damage weapon.  Always rolls with the same 5 primary stats; you'll have to reroll the life per hit for a socket.

[Thing of the Deep](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/thing-of-the-deep) - You'll gamble for one of these early.  But if you find one before then great!

[Uhkapian Serpent](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/uhkapian-serpent) - You'll need one of these for T4-T5+.

[The Tall Man's Finger](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/the-tall-mans-finger) - BiS ring.  Gives you the big dog with the big damage, and gives your fetishes more room.  Win, win.

[Stone of Jordan](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/stone-of-jordan) - Everyone wants one of these.  You'll use this and TMF if you aren't using the Unity trick.

[Unity](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/unity) - Needed for the Unity trick for T5+.  Has decent stats too.

[Ring of Royal Grandeur](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/ring-of-royal-grandeur-3qRFop) - You'll only need this if you plan on using Blackthorne's and getting the 4-piece set bonus.  Not required.

[Ice Climbers](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/ice-climbers) - Immobilizing effects will end up killing you eventually in T5-T6 without these.  I prefer using Ice Climbers over Blackthorne's 4 set.  Using Ice Climbers allows you to get rid of the RoRG and ground effects are easy to avoid.  Its vortex comboed with frozen, waller, or jailor that will get you killed.

Blackthorne's - Look for [Blackthorne's Chest](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/blackthornes-surcoat), [Blackthorne's Pants](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/blackthornes-jousting-mail), and [Blackthorne's Boots](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/blackthornes-spurs).  You may want the option of using 4 piece with a RoRG.

--------
****Progression through the Torments and what to expect****

**Fresh 70** - Look for or craft two yellow rings and a pair of gloves with 3 of the following stats so that you can reroll them into trifectas:  Int, CHC, CHD, IAS.  You should never have a toughness stat (vit, %life, allresist, armor) on any of your jewelery or gloves.  The only exception to this is Taskers (because it doesn't matter what its stats are its fucking awesome regardless).  Next look for or craft a yellow amulet with 3 of the following stats and reroll it to have all 4: Int, CHC, CHD, +Physical.  If you have the plans for Aughild's and Cain's, craft Aughild's shoulders, chest, and bracers.  The bracers should have +Physical and CHC.  Craft Cain's boots and legs.  Fill your other slots with rares with decent stats.

**T1-T3**- If you've done the above you can pretty much walk straight into T1.  From here you are collecting drops and farming shards for your Jerams.  Damage mitigation won't be an issue until T4+.  Once you get your Jerams you'll probably spend a decent about of time in T2-T3 until you can get your hands in some Taskers.

**T4** - If you have a Jerams and Taskers, you shouldn't have any problem efficiently farming T4.  6-8 minute clears on average with some quick ones in the 5 minute range if you get lucky conduits or a big group of summoning mob types.  You will notice that damage will start to get a little spiky if you are using a Thing of the Deep instead of a Uhkapian Serpent.  You should have seen a several drop by now but if you don't have a nice Serpent, start gambling for one to advance to T5+.  If you feel that the damage is too spiky, this is the point at which I would consider swapping BBV for Horrify with the armor rune.  Frightening Aspect will significantly buff your toughness and make bad situations a lot more comfortable.  (It would take me from roughly 12.5 mil toughness to 18.5 mil).

**T5-T6** - At this point you will have to use one or more of the following: Serpent, Unity, and/or Horrify to survive.  All three will probably be overkill.  I feel like T5 is the sweet spot for fun gameplay, atleast for me.  In T5 you should be able to get by with just a Serpant and Horrify, but you'll have to stay on your toes.  I normally use a Serpent and Unity in T6 and it makes me super tanky (fighting up to 4 elite packs at once).  You will notice that your fetishes die off quickly.  Some rift guardians will completely wipe out all of your fetishes and it will take forever to kill them.  Try to use BBV, Mass Confusion or Harrington's to do as much damage to these guys as quickly as possible or you risk getting really slowed down.  Don't lose your momentum against them, but sometimes its unavoidable.  At this point having a geared follower is important if you are playing solo.

,d3hardcore,"So you want to be a hardcore pet doctor?

I have a hardcore pet doctor with nearly 200 hours played that is farming T6 solo.  I'd like to write a guide for fresh hardcore pet doctors to follow.  This guide will probably be very similar to most guides you see for building up a pet doctor, but I haven't seen any that are geared specifically towards hardcore.

--------

****The Skill Build****

[The Basic Build]( http://us.battle.net/d3/en/calculator/witch-doctor#WlYTUQ!WTVe!bbcbcb)

Plague of Toads (Rain of Toads) - Fetish generator.  Use Addling Toads if you find a Rhen'ho Flayer.

Piranhas (Piranhado) - If you are playing with a group and someone else is already using a pull ability, consider changing to the Wave of Mutilation rune so that you can hit more targets, more often.

Zombie Dogs (Leeching Beasts) - This is if you have a TMF.  Some people will tell you to use Lifelink.  Is that 10% damage mitigation going to save you after your passive pops and you are running for your life with 150k hp?  Or is your dog who is still attacking and healing you for up to 90k per attack?  I would only consider changing this to Burning Dogs when you are stuck using Magefists while gambling for Taskers.  If you don't have a TMF, then I would consider using Lifelink.

Gargantuan (Wrathful Protector) - Don't use any other Gargantuan.  Pop this big boy out whenever you are fighting large groups of trash (8-10+) or an elite pack.

Spirit Walk (Healing Journey) - It doesn't heal for much, but Spirit Vessel will heal you to 29% instead of only 15% while using this rune.

**The last skill spot is versatile and you should swap it out depending on your needs.**

Big Bad Voodoo (Slam Dance) - This should be the goto skill for your last slot.  Only swap it out if you are stuggling with damage mitigation or are grouped with other WDs that are already using it.

Horrify (Frightening Aspect) - I had to switch to this in T5-T6 until I got a Unity.  With GI, you can keep the armor buff nearly the entire time while in combat.

Mass Confusion (Paranoia) - This is an offensive alternative to BBV.  Use this when there are other WDs in your group who are already using BBV.
--------
****Passives****

Spirit Vessel - Obvious choice here for hardcore.

Fetish Sycophants - The entire build is focused around this passive obviously.

Grave Injustice - One of the best passives in the game.  Using a Thing of the Deep increases this range to 40+ yards.  Use it and abuse it.  This is what allows you to use Wrathful Protector back to back.

Pierce the Veil - Obvious choice.  I should mention that some people use Midnight Feast once they have a TMF, but I feel that this is a mistake.

--------

****Paragon Points****

Core - Move speed to cap &gt; Int

Offense - IAS &gt; CHD &gt; CHC.  Try to maintain a 1% CHC to 10% CHD ratio.

Defense - Armor or Resist All &gt; %Life.  Whichever is more toughness.

Utility - LoH &gt; Area Dmg

--------
****Offensive Stats****

Your primary element is physical.  The only exception to this is wearing Magefists while you are looking for Taskers.

Int &gt; CHD &gt; CHC &gt; Attack Speed &gt; Flat Damage.  Again try to stay 1:10 ratio with CHC and CHD.

Socket the highest Int gems you can afford.  Very rarely should you sacrifice trifecta stats on gloves, rings or amulet.  Even going from yellows to legendaries.  I used a yellow trifecta amulet on my character for 90+ hours.  The orange color of an item isn't what matters, its the stats that matter.

In hardcore with this build I draw the line at those offensive stats.  All other stats like CDR and +skill dmg I will reroll for toughness.  This build doesn't greatly benefit from +skill dmg.


****Defensive Stats****

Vitality &gt; %Life &gt; Armor &gt; All Resist

I take armor over all resist because you will already have high resist due to being an int user and the Horrify rune buffs armor by 100%.  Always socket your helm with %Life.

--------

****Gambling Priorities****

1. [Mask of Jeram](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/mask-of-jeram-3OrCkW) - Witchdoctors rely on their masks to make them effective.  This item alone will advance you a torment or two.  Nearly all of your damage comes from your pets, and this item will boost their damage by 75-100%.  This is your most powerful item.

2. [Thing of the Deep](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/thing-of-the-deep) - Pickup radius stacks on GI's initial range of 20 yards.  This makes it 40 yards at minimum.  The reason you gamble for this before Taskers is because Taskers has the potential to be very difficult to get.  A good frog is rather easy to get in comparison to Taskers.  It will last you into T4, when you will considering swapping to a Serpent for damage mitigation.  Reroll the manaregen for vitality.  If yours has vitality, reroll the manaregen for %life.  Rerolling offhands can be a real pain so don't break the bank on this and take the first thing that's beneficial to you.

3. [Tasker and Theo](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/tasker-and-theo) - This is another one of those items that will advance you a full torment or two.  With these and a MoJ, you should be farming T3-T4 easily and efficiently.  Taskers always roll with IAS, so if you are lucky enough to get CHC or CHD you should reroll the vitality to make them trifecta.  These gloves increase the damage of your pets by 40-50%.  Always use these gloves no matter what stats they roll.  While gambling for these you will probably see a few pairs of Magefists.  You should use Magefists or Cain's until you find Taskers.

4. [Harrington Waistguard](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/harrington-waistguard) or [The Witching Hour](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/the-witching-hour) - I think Harrington's is better than Witching Hour.  Harrington's works really well with pet doctors.  Once you get all of your fetishes out take a second to scan the room for a clickable.  More than doubling your damage for 10 seconds at a time can lead to some really fast rift clears.  Some maps are covered with clickables, and then others are scarce.  You'll often find them in groups of 2-3.  Make sure you watch your buff and don't waste clickables, 10 seconds is longer than you think.

5. [The Tall Man's Finger](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/the-tall-mans-finger) and [Stone of Jordan](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/stone-of-jordan) \ [Unity](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/unity) - At this point you should be farming T4 with ease.  I really don't like gambling for items that cost more than 5 bloodshards but if you need 2 or more of the above rings its worth it.

6. [Ice Climbers](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/ice-climbers) - At this point you are able to farm T5-T6, but its dangerous.  Even with the Unity trick immobilizing effects and wallers can get you killed.  These boots will reduce that risk significantly.  You may go 20 runs without needing them, but eventually you will run into that double pack of elites with vortex, frozen/jailor, waller, arcane, etc.  Vortex/Immobilization combo is the real killer so you have to break that combo with these boots.

--------
****Followers and their gear****

If you are playing solo this will be very important.  Build your followers for utility, not damage.  Damage should always be secondary to utility when it comes to your followers.  Their damage is truly insignificant compared to yours.  Always take their utility skills.

Relics - You'll want the invulnerability relic.

[The Ess of Johan](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/the-ess-of-johan) - Really amazing follower amulet.  My Templar charges in and pulls all the mobs in on top of him.

[Bul-Kathos's Wedding Band](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/bulkathoss-wedding-band) - Drains 0.5% of the enemies hp per tick.  T6 rift bosses have roughly 3.7billion hp.  That's 18.5 mil a tick.  My Templar charges in, pulls all the mobs in and starts draining them with this.

[Unity](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/unity) - You'll need a 2nd Unity ring for your follower if you are going to use the Unity trick in T6.

[Azurewrath](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/azurewrath) - The only reason to use this weapon on a follower is the 20-25% chance to freeze on hit.  Your follower will actually freeze RGs in the middle of the animations for their special abilites and it will cancel the ability.

[The Furnace](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/the-furnace) - Enchantress only.  This weapon will do tons of damage to a full health RG.  7% of 3.7 bil is 259 mil damage.

[The Tormentor](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/the-tormentor) - Enchantress only.  I used this a lot in lower torments because I hadn't found anything better.  It has a chance to charm enemies on hit.

--------

****Items to look for while progressing****

[Cain's Destiny](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/artisan/blacksmith/recipe/cains-travelers) - Using the 2 piece bonus with pants and boots is common.  You should also consider using trifecta Cain's gloves until you find Magefists or Taskers.

[Aughild's Authority](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/artisan/blacksmith/recipe/aughilds-search) - The shoulders and bracers are a must have.

[Rhen'ho Flayer](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/rhenho-flayer) - This weapon is a game changer, even if it rolls with lower damage than your current weapon.  Once you get this weapon make sure you switch your toads rune to Addling Toads and go up a torment.  The toads will confuses everything in the room, causing enemies to stop attacking you and start attacking each other.  Most people say SMK is BiS.  Which I think I would have to agree with on softcore, but on hardcore I think this competes for the top spot.

[Starmetal Kukri](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/starmetal-kukri) - Rarest WD weapon in the game.  Use BBV in every fight if you find this bad boy.

[Thunderfury](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/thunderfury-blessed-blade-of-the-windseeker) - Always rolls with a socket, you'll have the chance to reroll one of the other stats for higher damage.  You'll be spamming toads so the proc from this weapon does significat damage in lower torments and good CC in upper torments.  It reduces the attack speed of enemies which means your fetishes will last longer.

[Doombringer](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/doombringer) - Physical damage weapon.  Always rolls with the same 5 primary stats; you'll have to reroll the life per hit for a socket.

[Thing of the Deep](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/thing-of-the-deep) - You'll gamble for one of these early.  But if you find one before then great!

[Uhkapian Serpent](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/uhkapian-serpent) - You'll need one of these for T4-T5+.

[The Tall Man's Finger](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/the-tall-mans-finger) - BiS ring.  Gives you the big dog with the big damage, and gives your fetishes more room.  Win, win.

[Stone of Jordan](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/stone-of-jordan) - Everyone wants one of these.  You'll use this and TMF if you aren't using the Unity trick.

[Unity](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/unity) - Needed for the Unity trick for T5+.  Has decent stats too.

[Ring of Royal Grandeur](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/ring-of-royal-grandeur-3qRFop) - You'll only need this if you plan on using Blackthorne's and getting the 4-piece set bonus.  Not required.

[Ice Climbers](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/ice-climbers) - Immobilizing effects will end up killing you eventually in T5-T6 without these.  I prefer using Ice Climbers over Blackthorne's 4 set.  Using Ice Climbers allows you to get rid of the RoRG and ground effects are easy to avoid.  Its vortex comboed with frozen, waller, or jailor that will get you killed.

Blackthorne's - Look for [Blackthorne's Chest](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/blackthornes-surcoat), [Blackthorne's Pants](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/blackthornes-jousting-mail), and [Blackthorne's Boots](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/blackthornes-spurs).  You may want the option of using 4 piece with a RoRG.

--------
****Progression through the Torments and what to expect****

**Fresh 70** - Look for or craft two yellow rings and a pair of gloves with 3 of the following stats so that you can reroll them into trifectas:  Int, CHC, CHD, IAS.  You should never have a toughness stat (vit, %life, allresist, armor) on any of your jewelery or gloves.  The only exception to this is Taskers (because it doesn't matter what its stats are its fucking awesome regardless).  Next look for or craft a yellow amulet with 3 of the following stats and reroll it to have all 4: Int, CHC, CHD, +Physical.  If you have the plans for Aughild's and Cain's, craft Aughild's shoulders, chest, and bracers.  The bracers should have +Physical and CHC.  Craft Cain's boots and legs.  Fill your other slots with rares with decent stats.

**T1-T3**- If you've done the above you can pretty much walk straight into T1.  From here you are collecting drops and farming shards for your Jerams.  Damage mitigation won't be an issue until T4+.

,boardgames,"My friends and I all used to play Yu-gi-oh, some of us Magic, as well as some Japanese card games. A few days ago we had a big game night for my cake-day and I came to realize that my small collection lacks any sort of real combat between players.

I'm currently looking to pick up a starter(s) and boosters for Marvel Dice Masters, but would rather wait than pay the premium. The Magic-style combat as well as the Marvel skin (I'm a DC man myself, but most of my friends prefer Marvel) is what has me looking at MDM.

I'm not against miniatures and in fact have always been interested in controlling huge armies and fighting it out. However, I'm looking to keep the budget to be at $100 or less, and I don't think that goes too far for wargames.

**edit**: The game(s) can be for 2 to 8 players.

* **2 player game**: The game would be something I play as a friend and I wait for more people or something I can bring with me easily.
* **4-6 player game**: This is my standard group, and what I'm mainly looking for. The game should be a larger and longer game that definitely has some depth to it.

* **6+ players**: The game needs to be simple enough where you don't lose track of what everyone is doing and don't have to wait ages to take a turn.

In summary, I'm looking for a game or games where you get to engage in combat against another player or players. No collecting victory points, no racing towards an end goal, and no complicated and/or hidden win conditions. I don't mind if those are part of the game, but at the end of the day I want to either be destroying another player or eliminating everything they have.",,False,,0,,[WSIG] Need a game with conflict and combat.,,,,,wsig,0.0,,,False,t3_27vr50,False,,,,,0.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},WSIG,,0,,,,self,1402511367,,,,,,True,,1402503279.0,,,,,,self.boardgames,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,t5_2qmjp,,,,,27vr50,,,AliasAutumn,,23,,,,,,,/r/boardgames/comments/27vr50/wsig_need_a_game_with_conflict_and_combat/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/27vr50/wsig_need_a_game_with_conflict_and_combat/,,1402499679,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441316441.0,,,

**01:23** **Zelda Williams** is going to be in the celebrity tournament after a quick break,

**01:24** HAHAHAHA, ""Pik Man and Olimars"".

**01:27** Phew, Amsa gets a second chance to shine later in the fan favourite bracket!

**01:30** Or in something else. I'm completely lost, brackets-wise.

**01:35** The crowd are flipping their shit over Mega Man's final smash!

**01:37** We're watching a video of **Smash Run** - the 3DS exclusive mode. During the warm up, you're collecting as many ""attributes"" as possible to power your character up. Then it's over to the Smash Free-for-All with your stat-boosted characters. Also, a Rainbow Road stage looks great!

**01:48** Time for the finals! Final four are: **our boy from Japan: Amsa rocking Olimar**, Lilo as Wii Fit Trainer, Hbox as Kirby and Gonzalo as Zero Suit Samus. Items are now on low.

**01:56** Kirby's won, but who else will go through. It's a tie between Gonzalo and Amsa. Come on, Amsa!

**01:57** Now way Amsa lost the fan vote, they just got confused because

**01:58** Our celebrities are Keegan Allen from Pretty Little Liars, Zelda Williams from Robbie Williams' sperm, Steven Lunsford and Erin Sanders. Zelda is dressed as Skull Kid with Majora's Mask!

**02:02** The first successful Greninja Final Smash of the tournament! For all we know: the first successful one ever??

**02:05** Cute boy from Teen Show wins. And now it's the Grand Final: Hungrybox vs. Zero

**02:14** Come on Kirby, win it for Daddy Sakurai!

**02:15** Sudden death! Zero Suit Samus just clawed it to time up, then nipped Kirby off the stage. What a fight!

**02:16** Reggie's here! And Miyamoto was hiding in the shadows! ""Nintendo had a great day today... Digital Event... Nintendo Treehouse... it's been off the hook all day... great way to bring it to a close""

**02:19** Sakurai is doing a roundtable for Smash Bros soon, and there is more news to come. We're thanking all the players and announcers. There's some cool Smash Bros. trophies to the fan favourite! Fuck the people in the audience who are booing.

**02:22** Reggie: ""I play all the Nintendo games... but I suck at Smash. But now, with the 3DS version, I'm gonna play it on the go! I'm gonna come back!

,Affiliatemarketing,"

The ideal world of affiliate marketing does not require product development and maintenance. This is one of the easiest ways of launching into an online business and earning more profits.

Assuming you are already in an affiliate program, what would be the next thing you would want to do? Double, or even triple, your commissions, right? How do you do that?

Here are some powerful tips on how to boost your affiliate program commissions.

1. Know the best program and products to promote. 
Obviously, you would want to promote a program that will enable you to achieve the greatest profits in the shortest possible time.

There are several factors to consider in selecting such a program. Choose the ones that have a generous commission structure. Have products that fit in with your target audience. And that has a solid track record of paying their affiliate easily and on time. If you cannot seem to increase your investments, dump that program and keep looking for better ones.

There are thousands of affiliate programs online which gives you the reason to be picky. You want to select the best to avoid losing your advertising dollars.

Write free reports or short ebooks to distribute from your site. There is a great possibility that you are competing with other affiliates that are promoting the same program. If you start writing short reports or provide an ebook related to the product you are promoting, you will be able to distinguish yourself from the other affiliates.

In the reports, provide some valuable information for free. If possible, add some recommendations about the products. With ebooks, you get credibility. Customers will see that in you and they will be enticed to try out what you are offering.

2. Collect and save the email addresses of those who download your ebooks. 
It is a known fact that people do not make a purchase on the first solicitation. You may want to send out your message more than six times to make a sale.
This is the simple reason why you should collect the contact information of those who downloaded your reports and ebooks. You can make follow-ups on these contacts to remind them to make a purchase from you.

Get the contact information of a prospect before sending them to the vendor’s website. Keep in mind that you are providing free advertisement for the product owners. You get paid only when you make a sale. If you send prospects directly to the vendors, chances are they would be lost to you forever.

But when you get their names, you can always send other marketing messages to them to be able to earn an ongoing commission instead of a one-time sale only.

Publish an online newsletter or Ezine. It is always best to recommend a product to someone you know than to sell to a stranger. This is the purpose behind publishing your own newsletter. This also allows you to develop a relationship based on trust with your subscribers.

This strategy is a delicate balance between providing useful information with a sales pitch. If you continue to write informative editorials you will be able to build a sense of reciprocity in your readers that may lead them to support you by buying your products.

3. Ask for higher than normal commission from merchants. 
If you are already successful with a particular promotion, you should try and approach the merchant and negotiate a percentage commission for your sales.

If the merchant is smart, he or she will likely grant your request rather than lose a valuable asset in you. Keep in mind that you are a zero-risk investment to your merchant; so do not be shy about requesting for addition in your commissions. Just be reasonable about it.

Write strong pay Per Click ads. PPC search engine can be an effective means of advertising online. As an affiliate, you can make a small income just by managing PPC campaigns such as Google AdWords. Always monitor them to see which ads are more effective and which ones to dispose of. Ad trackers are an essential tool for all affiliate advertising.

Try out these strategies and see the difference it can make to your commission checks in the shortest of time. You can be successful. Believe in yourself and in your business.

Wishing you continued success!

,dicemasters,"As of this morning I was missing 2 uncommons, 13 rares, and 3 super rares. The point, I was barely missing any, and have no reason to buy more blind boosters, especially with how many extras I have. So as I drove by my shop I did what all gamers do, I bought 20 packs.

The 1$ price point is just too good not to buy packs. 

Then,

I opened my 20 packs, and pulled 9 rares. 7 of which were rares I still NEEDED.

Oh yeah, and a Gobby Green Goblin Super Rare!

I couldn't believe my luck as I kept opening the packs and pulling more and more great things.

So happy.

My first time I bought DM, I pulled a Wolverine Super rare, made a decission as a collector I could not afford to collect all the Super rares and sold it. The next week I pulled a Black widow, and sold it with the same understanding. This week I pulled Mr. Fantastic Super rare, and not Gobby. I am kicking myself for selling those first two.

,pkmntcg,"Hi! 
So I work at a gamestore (hurrah discount), have a lot of travel plans for the next few years and love competitive, strategic gaming, deck building and collecting.
I'd like to jump into a hobby for between traveling that doesn't take up much space (since I'll be moving frequently) I have beef with each of the major card games except for Pokemon, which brings me here. I played pokemon at leagues when I was 10 and the Base set was new, then got out at Rocket. The tournaments were some of my favorite memories.

Now for the questions that I couldn't find answers to. I know buying singles are the best way to go for deck building, though I might get booster boxes every few sets with my discount to give me fodder for trading (which I really enjoy) 

1) Are specific decks the only way to go, or can you get creative? I'll be doing locals, and while I don't mind using ""major decks"" it would be disappointing if only a handful were used by everyone.

2) I'm jumping on in XY, which seems pretty new (I'll be buying my cards when the new set comes out) I keep hearing about sets getting rotated out, any idea when that will happen and which sets it will entail? It makes sense that Black and White would get phased out, and I'd rather buy the boosters and cards from one that won't, such as X and Y. 

3) How rare and useful are things like Full Arts and Ex's? These are both new to me, I opened a few packs yesterday to see what I thought and got a Venesaur EX which is neat, although I might not use it. This question mainly appeals to the collector in me.

,ClashOfClans,"The obvious solution to fix the loot would be to make a loot injection. A single loot injection will not work so we need constant resources over time. Whenever there has been a 1gem boost the loot has dramatically increased. But if we have this all the time, maxing your base would be much easier. So there has to be a counter to that. If we cap the max resources stored in gold mines and elixir pump at 75000 at lvl 11 then it will make it so you don't wake up every morning to millions of loot from doing nothing. Also a neat feature they could implement would be to have the villager actually do something and collect the mines/pumps. It wouldn't be fair to have the villager collect then constantly but say once or twice a day. This fixes the loot problem but it still takes insanely long to find bases. If we cut the shield time in by half, 6 hours for a 40%/1 star or 8 hours for a 90% then you will come across these bases more often. These fixes will make it for better loot more often, but with the capped loot limit of mines/pumps we won't get massive loot all the time either. Tell me what you think of this idea or any problems you see with it. 

Tldr: shorter shield times, cap on max loot in mines/pumps, x2 or x3 loot from mines and pumps, and villagers collecting loot once a day = less search time + better loot.",,False,,0,,[Idea]Potential fix to the poor loot and long searching times when raiding.,,,,,idea,0.0,,,False,t3_27po11,False,,,,,1.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},IDEAS,,1,,,,self,1402339358,,,,,,True,,1402338972.0,,,,,,self.ClashOfClans,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,t5_2usfk,,,,,27po11,,,Sillycow1,,12,,,,,,,/r/ClashOfClans/comments/27po11/ideapotential_fix_to_the_poor_loot_and_long/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/27po11/ideapotential_fix_to_the_poor_loot_and_long/,,1402335372,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441319280.0,,,

**Q:** What is the UPHEAVAL?  

*A:* In short, it's a roughly 40-year period of global social transition. War and policy, internal and external conflicts, technology and art; all of these things and more have been greatly affected by a drastic shift in our social climate.

_____
**Q:** What major conflicts happened to cause the UPHEAVAL?  

*A:* Technology and what it permitted people to do, as well as very powerful negativity towards transgendered and transhuman persons.

To elaborate, on technology: medical care and the incorporation of robotics into the field had allowed people to get fast, cheap, easy, and nearly painless plastic surgery. Consider video games of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, when a person could modify their avatar's physical attributes, this can now be done to every human at a similar cost to tattoos of those periods. It's not exceptionally inexpensive for the *major* adjustments, but it's just as quick and relatively painless.  

This allowed persons who felt that they were in the wrong body to more readily acquire the physical representation that was in their mind. Their personal happiness and well-being were greatly improved, and this improved society in a small but noticable way, as they were more apt to do well in their jobs and in their day-to-day lives.

Implementation of cybernetic implants began to rise, and although it was a far more expensive procedure, there were plenty of people who were willing to jump on the opportunity when money permitted. Tracking chips were something of the first useful items implemented across socioeconomic lines. The human body's ability to create heat was tapped as a means of powering small devices, and vanity implants came to be; a new kind of tattoo.

These could actually serve a purpose...did you ever play Dungeons &amp; Dragons? Tattoos could be magical, or you could get magical rings and armor that gave you additional abilities. A *Ring of Sustenance* could make it where you didn't need to eat or drink. A solar-powered implant (using photosynthesis) could actually provide your body with a small boost of nutrients, and these became widely popular. Various other useful tools and sundries were added to the augmentation list, but I'm not gonna go into that right now, as it's not relevant to why the UPHEAVAL began.

You see, there were a great number of people who made a huge impact in the early 21st Century, most these days just call them the Natty's, the Revvy's, or - one name that's held for centuries - Hippies. They're the Naturalists; they hate just about anything that's synthetic in any form. Despite their cries of equal treatment, they also perpetuated typical human hypocrisy. They'd modify their own bodies with tattoos and piercings and dermal implants, but they found it apalling and a horrifying breach of civil rights when someone inserts a computer chip into their chest that monitors your vitals and geolocation, an occular enhancement that could expand your view of the spectrum and increase focal abilities, or a neural implant that could have you automatically connected to the ""internet"" (we typically call it the C-HUD [*CHUD*] or Collective Heads Up Display), able to almost nearly subconciously traverse an immense array of information.

Not to mention, there were plenty of people in this group that felt betrayed by transgendered persons. Trangendered persons were publicly shamed on street corners and internet forums, harassed and beaten, and, on a few rare occasions, their bodies carved in way to create a ""proper"" look of that individual's birth sex and then cruicfied. Yeah, they would mangle and graffiti up a person, because that person didn't embrace their ""natural"" self.

_____
These reasons were the main precipitating events. There are more social and policy adjustments that go on now due to various policies that were set in place years ago, even though those policy makers may be dead or no longer in office, or their constituents that originally agreed no longer agree or are themselves deceased.

The world doesn't suck here in the year 2300, it's just different. It's fascinating for for both good and bad. The absurd and horrible versus the amazing and beautiful.

,SethBlingSuggestions,"You would have a normal lode runner map with the enemies as zombies with a high sight radius and a -1 jump boost, and you would have a slowness potion so the zombies would pose a threat to you. You would go around collecting gold (yellow carpet) and the command blocks would constantly check if you have a set amount of yellow carpets destroyed via the scoreboard.

When you destroy the floor, the floor would come back in five or ten seconds. The floor could come back with a delayed clone command that activates when the scoreboard value for destroying floors reaches 1. There would also be a command block at the end of the delay to set the scoreboard value back to one. Barrier blocks could be below and to the sides of the floor, so when a zombie falls into a hole made by the player, the zombie is ""trapped"" because of the -1 jump boost effect. The zombie will have to be forced up by the respawning blocks.

,Animesuggest,"Spoiler warning for the following
Series I have watched:  
Bleach  
FMA/FMA:B    
Fairy Tail  
Cowboy Bebop  
Psycho Pass  
Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei  
Black Bullet  
Sword Art Online  
Hitsugi no Chaika  
**Bleach:**  
    Combat is done with swords and magic; that is what I prefer in anime, never been a fan of guns or mecha stuff. The magic has depth, it follows logical rules and is fairy well explored. The motives of the main character are believable and the powers gained from training are interesting. The story is interesting if a bit slow at times and I liked all the arcs (including the filler arcs). What is dislike, however, is as follows: Orihime's over 9000 ""kurosaki-san""s per second, excessive Orihime and other irritating characters screen time doing nothing but whining, enemies going into length before fighting how they are going to win, only to be immediately defeated, cockiness in general, the ridiculous amount of times people lose their powers, people shouting loudly and saying that they can't give up to get the needed boost to beat the enemy, people freaking out excessively, Kon was alright but got weird at times, fan service/""plot"" really doesn't add to the story, I'm here for fighting not flashing but Bleach isn't too bad with it (excluding the anti-hollow watermelon filler episode &amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232;)  
**FMA/FMA:B**  
Like bleach the method of fighting is what I like, even more so since everything was based in science (equivalent exchange etc). I prefer the magic in any series to be like this rather than running off of ""heart"" or ""the power of friendship."" The story is engaging, the main characters have clear goals, and he actually gets with his girl at the end. [There were many excellent dark moments that stay with you](http://i.imgur.com/mRbJDaZ.jpg). Unfortunately, FMA/FMA:B is the worst offender of characters overreacting to something and freaking out, and I wasn't really fond of either ending. Both felt rather lacking, don't really know why.   
**Fairy Tail**  
Here we venture further from my preference with the power of someone being greatly affected by their emotions, but with the depth that magic is explored it is still pretty good. Happy is the best damn character ever especially when he is teasing Lucy. The storyline isn't the most collected but it is still fun to watch the characters grow. I dislike the heavy reliance on screaming ""I'm going to save everyone and win because I have to"" or ""I'm a FT mage"" in order to beat someone. The motion sickness was pushed at the beginning but thankfully references to it have lessened over time. There is a lot of unnecessary fan service; a bit is alright but I'd rather get on with the story. The bad guy saying that everything is going according to plan after they break whatever toy they were using is a little irritating, constantly pulling a bigger, badder plan from their ass.   
**Cowboy bebop**  
I like the high tech low life pseudo cyberpunk feel, the story line was incredibly engaging and the characters are unforgettable. Wasn't a fan of the cowboy aspects, I'm not big on the spaceship scenes, and the usual guns rather than swords/magic were my only dislikes of it.  
**Psycho Pass**  
In a deviation from my normal preference I checked this series out and was pleasantly surprised. I'm a big fan of cyberpunk novels and definitely loved that vibe resonating in this series. The story line was very predictable and I saw plot twists from a mile away excluding the exact nature of Sibl, but it was good regardless. The female main character for the first time ever isn't loaded down with massive breasts in tatters of clothing like many other series which was very refreshing. She also reminded me of Rukia, who was one of my favorite characters from Bleach. The story brought up many interesting questions and left you something to think about every episode. I am a fan of high-tech as long as it doesn't include mechas, guns are tolerable in that situation but I would prefer swords, and Psycho Pass got the technology in without being over the top. Other than that I really didn't dislike anything about the anime.  
**Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei**  
The magic is based on logic and science, even implemented with technology, exactly how I prefer. The story so far is interesting and I look forward to each episodes. However, what the fuck is up with the gross sister loving brother thing? After the first 20 ""onii-sama""s in the first episode I almost stopped watching then and there, but the system of magic and the mystery of the storyline kept me watching. Thankfully there is a much smaller emphasis on that creepy shit in recent episodes (sans the ""scan me, onii-sama"" episode). Other than that, good show.  
**Black Bullet**    
Respectable mix of martial arts and guns with a very interesting storyline. Not a fan of the whole ""assemble a harem of lolis"" thing, grosses me out, but it seems to more make fun of the anime that does that stuff for real instead which isn't as bad. Still not sure if the episode with sleepy sniper chick waking up in bed was making fun of it or performing fan service for the creepy dudes that are into that.   
**Sword Art Online**  
Combat is good, the story is interesting and believable, excellent character growth. Yet we're back with the creepy incest thing. Either the people that write this stuff don't have sisters or they are messed up. Anyway, that's the main thing I disliked. The main character seems excessively dedicated to his girl but it isn't too bad.   
**Hitsugi no Chaika**    
Here I'm getting pretty far genre-wise from the kind of anime I like. Magic is guns here which is unusual but alright, and how magic exactly works hasn't really been explored yet. The main characters don't have much in the way of motives, but the multi-Chaika thing is an interesting mystery to theorize about. Chaika's weird speech pattern took a but to get used to but it makes her personality stand out. No real complaints, just a type of anime far removed from my preference.

Does anyone know why it supposedly doesn't work with only inward drift bikes?

We omitted runs from the averages when an error occurred that resulted in significant time loss. Everything was kept the same; burn out at the start, no mushrooms used, collected coins in relatively the same place and all the drift boosts were preformed in the same place, the only things that was changed were weather or not fire hopping was used and the body type for inward drift bike fire hopping vs IDB not fire hopping and outward drift bike fire hopping vs ODB not fire hopping. We also did not fire hop on down hill slopes per instructions from all of the tutorials. We compared the average time with fire hopping on an inward drift bike against the average of the same bike  not fire hopping and we found that fire hopping was slower by an average 2.501 seconds. We did the same with an inside drift bike and found that it was still slower to fire hop, the difference was 1.974 seconds. From our results it appears that on average  inward drift bikes benefit more from fire hopping compared to outward drift bikes, however there is a net loss of time when performing fire hopping with bikes in general. We have not tested fire hopping with karts or ATVs but from the current records it seems that this strategy is only viable on outside drift karts. But that still does not answer our question, why does fire hopping not work with inside drift bikes?  But also adds the question, does it not work with bikes at all?",,False,,0,,Serious Question.

,MarvelDiceMasters,"Hi all!

I'm so new to the game that I haven't got it to the table yet, so I'm hoping you can help withy my dilemma. 

Opened some booster packs and pulled a rare Professor X and rare Wolverine. My FLGS offers $3 for one and $4 for the other. Right now I just want more dice/characters but don't want to give up cards that add a lot to a team. 

Are these two worth saving so I can stand a chance in tournament play or should I collect my monies and keep boosting?

,runescape,"In recent polls the concept of a skilling boss was available as an option. While both times it did not win, the idea inspired me to come up with my version of a high level, team-oriented boss fight. This is a rough suggestion, but I would appreciate your feedback.

**Arcane Sentinel**

In ancient times, a great war engine was created by unknown hands. The Arcane Sentinel, a massive hulking automaton, resides at the center of a great circular arena beneath the Karamja jungle. Crafted from an unusual material resistant to physical damage and conventional magic, the Sentinel has been disturbed by the recent influx of divine power brought by the Gods' recent return to Gielinor. Enterprising high-level adventurers in teams of 4 to 8 players can seek out the Sentinel for a challenging boss fight based on non-combat mechanics.

The fight takes place in an instanced setting similar to those of existing bosses like the Kalphite King. To access the cavern, each member of a team must first offer a payment of resources. At the start of battle your team has 2 minutes to prepare before the Arcane Sentinel awakes. All resource nodes will be active throughout the battle, but this grace period allows your team to prioritize the stockpiling of certain resources based on your strategy.

* Cut ironwood from trees, mine arcane ore from rock, and siphon arcane energy from springs located around the perimeter of the arena.

* Pilfer stockpiles of resources located under the Sentinel itself. Doing so reduces the spawn rate of enemy minions.

* You have the ability to plant herbs and fish for consecrated cavefish at your camp.

* Construct barricades to block and direct the flow of the minions that the Sentinel spawns, or to fortify your camp.

*Skills used: Woodcutting, Mining, Divination, Thieving, Farming, Fishing, Construction*


Once the Arcane Sentinel activates it will begin spawning minions created from the same material as itself. These minions will seek to destroy your camp and will also be hostile to players. Instead of dealing direct damage to players, however, they will drain skill levels. Your character has a ""skill bar"" equivalent to your total level; once your levels drop below a certain threshold you become incapacitated until they are restored.

Since these minions cannot be damaged by conventional weapons, you'll need to assemble your own army of arcane golems to defeat them.

* To create a basic golem, arcane ore is smelted and shaped at a furnace powered by the burning of ironwood.

* Golems can be customized by attuning the limbs to one corner of the combat triangle, which is useful in countering the minion types being spawned. Add ironwood darts for ranged, runes for magic, and ironwood blades for melee.

* Golems can be further strengthened by imbuing them with signs of power created from arcane energy. For example, the sign of self-destruction causes a golem to detonate when it reaches 0 health, dealing damage to all enemies within a certain radius.

* Animate your golems and they become ready for combat.

*Skills used: Smithing, Firemaking, Fletching, Runecrafting*


At regular intervals, the Arcane Sentinel will generate pulses of damaging energy that radiate from the center of the arena. Workstations, golems, and all players who are not protected will take significant damage. In the case of players, the pulses drain skill levels.  It can also target an individual player with a chilling blast of cold air that lowers your stats. At other times, the Sentinel will release glowing fragments of its essence into the arena, which can be caught by the agile hunter.

* Golems and workstations can be repaired. Cooked consecrated cavefish can be eaten to restore skill levels.

* Ironwood bonfires will also restore levels over time.

* Mix a variety of potions using collected arcane essence as the base. These potions buff your golems, stun or damage enemy minions, or shield players and golems.

*Skills used: Crafting, Hunter, Agility, Cooking, Herblore*


The battle ends either with the Sentinel's defeat or the incapacitation of all players. Successful teams will balance their own skill levels and the health of their golems and camp infrastructure with the damage output needed to inactivate the Sentinel. Although your creations cannot destroy the Sentinel, they can temporarily sap its energy to allow you to loot a variety of rewards. Possible rewards include new high-tier raw materials, crates of goods similar to those found on Treasure Hunter, golem familiar pouches, and XP-boosting add-ons to existing tools.",,False,,0,,What a skilling boss could look like: The Arcane Sentinel,,,,,,0.0,,,False,t3_27jhfz,False,,,,,43.0,,{},,,,,,,,,{},,,43,,,,self,1402147259,,,,,,True,,1402141061.0,,,,,,self.runescape,,,,,,,,True,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,t5_2qwxl,,,,,27jhfz,,,granzi,,16,,,,,,,/r/runescape/comments/27jhfz/what_a_skilling_boss_could_look_like_the_arcane/,,False,http://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/27jhfz/what_a_skilling_boss_could_look_like_the_arcane/,,1402137461,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1441322226.0,,,
,SMITEGODCONCEPTS,"Vidar (Norse) is one of the few surviving Gods after Ragnarok. He avenges his father Odin by killing Fenrir with a huge boot that has made out of all the leftover leather scraps from bootmakers. Thus he walks with a limp. Almost as strong as his brother Thor, but almost never talking. He has long hair, and a bushy beard with a dark set face.

Role: Guardian/Melee

Passive: For each minion/godkill Vidar collects the leather from their boots slowly adding to his own. Gives +physical protection for each stack (If to OP, maybe decrease movement speed as stacks increase or maybe lose stacks on death)

1: Stand Firm: Vidar stands his ground, losing ability to backpedal (i. e. ""S"" key doesn't work), but gaining massive protections (10/20/30/40/50 both physical and magic) for 5 seconds

2: Shattering Stomp: Vidar stomps the ground damaging and stunning enemies close to him, and slowing enemies farther away in a cicle around him. The more passive stacks Vidar has the larger the range, damage and longer stun/slow becomes

3: Jumproar: Vidar finally lets his voice loose while jumping into battle, boosting his allies penetration and damaging enemies in a small radius.

4:Jawbreaker: Vidar targets a single enemy pinning them down under his giant boot. For a period of time both Vidar and the enemy is unable to move or use any abilities that requires movement (like jumping away etc.). Vidar gains increased protections while the enemy suffers decreased protections. Hard CC does not break the affect, seeing as the enemy is still pinned down, but otherwise effect Vidar.

Pros: Very high protection, High CC

Cons: Low movement speed, low damage.

,neology,"Countless times I've been with talkative people only to have a brief minute of silence while everyone tries their food after which normal conversation resumes. Often it goes unremarked upon, and occasionally people don't even seem cognizant that it happened at all.

It seems like a point of etiquette, though I've never heard anyone consider it as such.

Is it poor hosting to let diners become so famished that they have a ""food silence?"" A sign that your appetizers were inadequate, or your meal time too late in the day. Is it poor manners to let a conversation drop, or a positive sign of casual intimacy?  Is a short one a sign of respect for the quality of a meal? Is it poor manners to interrupt one? A sign of narcissism deny people the moment.

On a personal level the experience is often very satisfying. It gives you a moment to really appreciate a meal before devoting half your attention to talking. It gives you a minute to collect your thoughts from the pre-dinner chat, which often provides a nice boost to the quality of the dinner conversation. It often has an almost prayer like quality. Though I could imagine it being a point of anxiety among people prone to such feelings, especially during important meals. Dates/business meetings etc.

I think there's enough there for a word. But most people I've talked to seem unaware that this is even something people do(though once I mention it they generally agree that they do)

I'm not quite sure what to call it. Perhaps some other language has a word for it? I like taciturn, satiate, gorge. Though gorge has certain negative connotations that I don't really want to prejudice the concept with. Perhaps something latin for food/mealtime/dinner and silence/quiet/peace/pause/break.

,sto,"[](/ohhi)Hey all!

It's June, so it's time for the 2nd Risa Summer Event! Compared to last year, there are way more things to do and two major areas to hang out! Let's get started!

- The Ship

One of the first things you see upon beaming down is the new Risian ship you can earn. You earn this through the reputation system event tab by claiming 1000 Lohlunat Pearls. How do you get these pearls? First, purchase a floater from the hut to the right of the transporter (a rental will do you at first, but you may want to save up for a permanent one). Talk to the gal beside the hut and she'll give you the Flying High where you have to follow some tracks on your floater. Complete 3, turn in, and you get 40 pearls!

Speaking of floaters, new to this year are a bunch of new floater colours!

EDIT: Once you unlock either the new ship or the old Corvette on one character, you receive a discount on other toons. Other toons can get the subsequent ship for 40 pearls. Don't grind 1000 pearls on each toon!

* The Promenade

A new area located to the east to hang out, start the new surfboard race, buy a surfboard, trade in eggs/birds/monkey tags/monkeys, get doffs, or just to hang out. Very reminiscent of an actual luxury resort!

* The Race

New to Risa this year are surfboards (purchasable from the Promenade, either a temp rental or permanent one) which you can use to surf on the waters of Risa. Once you have a surfboard, you can participate in the PVP race! Races are held twice an hour (:15/:45 IIRC) and start near the Promenade. The race has you surfing around the entirety of Risa, finishing behind the floater hut. There are jumps and boost boards which will give you a quick speed boost. If you stray too far from the track, you will be disqualified, as well as if you stray too far from the finish area, so make sure you're ready! Also, the flags can be very finicky at the end (you have to interact with a flag to win) so be prepared to hit the flag at the right time.

* Dance Party

Returning this year, every hour on the hour, is the dance party! Located at the resort on the dance floor, an NPC will notify you of the start of the party. Accept the mission from the notification button and attend the dance floor. The NPC (VA'd by Cryptic's own Fark [male VA] and Zero [female VA]!) will prompt you how to dance. Perform the dance emote, and dance the night away! The more you dance, the more lohlunat favors you will receive (which can be used to buy Risian items such as floaters and swimsuits). 

Hint - Open the emote window, from the gear beside your text box. Click the pin button to pin the emote table on your HUD, and use that to easily do dance emotes!

* Horga'hn Hunt

This mission hasn't really changed from last year. Accept the mission from the pop-up notification or talk to the Horga'hn collector at the resort beside the dance floor. Go around Risa and collect Horga'hn for lohlunat favors (and the chance of an egg to raise!). Once you collect 10, you'll finish the mission. Turn it in for a bonus 25 marks. This mission hasn't changed from last year so all the old locations remain if you had a path original planned.

* Sand Castles

This mission can be done either during bonus time or not, the only difference is you earn 5 lohlunat favors instead of 2 during the announced bonus time. If you're doing it off bonus time, talk to the guy on the south edge of the Promenade, otherwise, accept the pop-up notification. Located along the south and east beaches are 5 buckets, this is where you start the sand castle mini-game. Follow the instructions (which get progressively difficult the more you play this game). You'll receive accolades too the more you play! When you finish, turn it in for your lohlunat favors.

Note - Due to the low number of buckets, it can sometimes be hard to do this in a full instance. Since people who don't have the mission can demolish a sand castle some time after it's built, don't take the mission until you can clear a sandcastle or get a free bucket.

EDIT: @sarcasmdetector has made note that there is 6th bucket on the island to the east of the Promenade.

* Pets

Similar to last year, you can turn in eggs from the Horga'hn hunt to the gal at the Promenade (she is no longer at the main resort). These birds can either be kept as a social pet or turned in for mark boxes. 

New to this year are feather monkeys. Similar to the Winter Epohh raising you can do in Q's Winter Wonderland, you can turn in Tropical Tags (6 of them) from the PVP race to the monkey raising NPC in the Promenade. Similar to birds, you can either keep them or trade them for mark boxes.

* Swimsuits

I HAVE to add this. You can buy swimsuits now at the platform beside the transporter pad, near the tailor. They range from 500 to 1000 lohlunats. You can also purchase pretty much anything Risian from him (floaters, boards, etc.).

[As you can guess, these are pretty popular right now and are selling for mega bucks on the exchange.](http://i.imgur.com/czIU1pS.jpg) Atleast, for now until the lohlunat favors become more common.

NOTE: Swimsuits are Risa only.

* Dabo!

A Dabo table is available in the middle of the resort, along with exchange/bank/mail services behind it.

* Hide and Seek with Pavyl

Pavyl returns this year offering a hide and seek game if you haven't played it yet. You can speak to him on the south beach to the east of the resort. Speak to him to start the game (you can only find him at night). 

[Although this is an old map, the Pavyl locations remain.](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/sto.gamepedia.com/7/75/Risa-summer-event.jpg?version=dcccf465a9dbacd475882373c5e63656). It also lists the vista bird locations which can earn you another accolade, along with other misc accolades.

Pavyl has to be located in order, which are numbered in the purple diamonds.

* Doffs

New doffs are available this year! Speak to the doff Risian located above the far east bars. These doffs have skills we have yet to see in STO!

Lastly...

Relax! Sit back, relax and enjoy the sights with your fellow Redditors! 

See you on Risa!

,PuzzleAndDragons,"My town here in Japan just got in a set of 4 パズバト machines, which I had been looking forward to since I saw the website list of 'coming soon' arcade locations. So naturally, I decided to go check it out after work! Never having really played Japanese arcade games before, though, I figured it might be nice to recount my experience, just in case other people get the chance to play the arcade game but are like me and didn't know exactly what to do or how it worked.

Disclaimer: I still don't really know how all the game mechanics work, I've only played it for like a half hour. Don't expect any in-depth strategy or game mechanic discussions. Also, I didn't take any pictures this time, though I may do so in the future if there is any interest.

So first, I went down to the arcade and saw the shiny new machines, right behind the Groove Coaster machine. Man, Japanese arcade games have gotten really aesthetically pleasing. Anyway, there was one guy diligently puzzling away, but the other 3 cabinets were empty. They each had a wide, very comfortable stool with foot bar. There is ample space to rest your elbows/forearms in front of the screen. There was a coin slot in the upper right corner, and the cost was ￥100 to play. Right in the middle of the console, there was a glowing blue back-lit area that said 'Nesica' on it. Apparently this was the built-in card reader for the cards that save your data. I did not have one of these cards, and the little pamphlets to the side of the machine did not have them either, so I made the trek to the sales counter to ask how I got one of these Nesica cards. Turns out you just have to buy one from the establishment for ￥300, and that card saves carries your save data for various games. Cool! It has a cool Groove Coaster picture on it, but I also got a パズバト sticker I can put over the card if I want.

So, card in hand, I went back to the machine, sat down, and put the card over the card reader. The game immediately started checking and creating a save file for me, then the game asked me to insert ￥100. I did, and the game allowed me to select my starting character (I chose the knight chick Patricia), whether I wanted to puzzle on the right-hand or left-hand side of the screen, and my starting team. You get the choice of a basic fire, water, or wood team with their respective starting dragons, or a team which starts with an Earth Golem (or Earth Guardian, I don't recall which). I chose the fire team with a Tyran lead, but in retrospect I think this was a stupid, stupid move. I'm guessing that fire is one of the more popular starting choices, so the smart players who want to beat up on newbies all pick the water starter with Plessie ... As such, I really should have meta-picked the wood Brachy team, but whatever. 

Anyway, the game took me through a very long tutorial mode telling how to play, and showing off some of the game mechanics like character skills, monster skills, targeting, and swapping out monsters. I'll explain that more in a sec. Anyway, the tutorial also introduces you to the different game modes you'll encounter, between tournament battles and versus matches. I didn't really understand everything being said (my Japanese is not that great, honestly), and the text goes by very quickly, but since I play Puzzle and Dragons on my phone, nothing really came as too big a shock. I'm still not exactly sure how character skills work, and how you are able to collect resources for them though ... Eh, I'll get it eventually I'm sure.

So mechanically, the puzzling board is 5 orbs tall by 8 orbs wide, 2 wider than the mobile version. You *can* move diagonally, and it's not very difficult to do if you know how to do it on your mobile device. The orbs move around just fine, though a little different than I'm used to on my slow phone. Not much to adjust to there, really. You have a *long* time to move orbs; I'm not even sure if there is a limit, really. But it behooves you to be quick about it, since stuff is going to attack you based on timers rather than waiting for you to attack and then counting down to when it attacks. The game definitely felt much more fast-paced and urgent. You have your main team consisting of a leader, 4 subs, and you get to choose a friend leader before any tournament battles start. You also have 3 extra monsters which you can sub in and out for your normal team monsters seemingly at any time. This is really cool and presents some interesting opportunities in strategy, I think. I have no idea how all that works with like, monster skills though. Hell, I don't even really know how monster skills exactly work.

The game tutorial takes you through a mock tournament. The tournament structure starts with like ... 16 players I think (in the tutorial, and apparently in the actual real tournaments, if there aren't enough real players to play the tournament will be filled out with computer opponents). In this mode, you seem just fight monster waves like in Endless Corridor. Each monster has a number above it or something, and I guess when you beat the monster, that number gets added to your score. After a certain amount of time (I don't know exactly how long) the game will stop. If you are currently moving orbs while time goes off, those orbs will not disappear and attack! It seems like you have to let go of your orb right before the timer expires, and then whatever matches you made should attack while the 'time up' screen pops up and the board darkens a bit. Then, after all that, all the players in the tournament's names all show up and their corresponding rank, and the top 4 players move on to the next round of the tournament. At some point during this you acquire a little digital 'ticket.' I know you get one for winning; I am not sure if you get one even if you lose. During the tournament process, you can collect up to 3 tickets. At the end of the tourney, you get to roll the green dragon gacha, and a bunch of eggs pop up, and from there you can choose a number of eggs to do stuff with based on how many tickets you have. It seems kind of cruel to enter a tournament, lose in the round of 16 and not get to keep any eggs, but that might be how it works. I'm really not sure. 

In any case, if you're part of the top 4 from the round of 16, you move on to a 1 v 1 match against one of the other players. This mode is different from the 'Endless Corridors' style in that it's your team of monsters vs your opponent's team. You can target their individual monsters and try and take them out for an amount of time, if you knock out all their HP. Also your character has HP; of course, when that is gone you lose. In the 1v1 battle, whoever knocks out all their opponent's HP wins and moves on to the final round, where the same style of battle happens. I honestly do not know exactly *how* you make a player's character HP go down, but it somehow involves killing their monsters. It was kind of confusing, honestly, and my Japanese wasn't up to par when they were explaining the mechanic in the tutorial. If you win, you get a ticket and move to the next round. Same 1v1 battle happens there, and if you win you get another ticket. 

After your playing experience is done, the green gacha dragon appears, you pull his arm and then get I think 5 eggs of various rarities. You get to keep some of the eggs based on how many ticket you've collected, I guess. The tutorial gives you a normal monster egg and a few evo mat eggs. The leveling system for monsters is a little bit different than the mobile version. In the arcade version, you drag eggs onto your monsters; if it's an xp source, your monster gains levels. If it's a monster's corresponding evo mat, though, a little gauge will go up. When that gauge is full, the monster will evolve to it's next form *regardless of whether it's max level*. I don't remember if you have a choice in the matter or if it just evolves. Anyway, the monster's cost goes up too, so you have to keep that in mind for team costs.

Once you've picked your eggs, the game ends and you're offered a chance to continue. If you continue for another ￥100, you get to pick one more egg, then get kicked to the starting screen. After the tutorial I thought there would be like, a rare gacha that you could pull once, but there was not. I guess maybe gold eggs pop out of the green dragon, but I haven't seen one yet. I did manage to get a silver egg, an Earth Guardian which gave my team a large boost over the stupid Taur Devil I started with.

From the main screen you can go to your monster box, which you only have a limited time to do stuff in. You have to move fast, and know what the hell you want to do in there. You also have the opportunity to like, buy new character skills I guess? Using some other form of points you get? Also you have coins, which I'm sure also do something? I currently don't know how all that works. Once your time in the monster box is up, you can choose story mode, direct vs., or battle tournament (which is comprised of players from all over Japan, plus bots to fill out remaining slots if there aren't enough players).

I played story mode once, didn't really understand what was going on, but easily won my 3 tickets. Then I tried a tournament, which was 4 real people and a bunch of bots (it was a Friday afternoon, not the most active time I guess). I got 4th, and got to play against a real person. So there I am with my little Tyran and basic starter fire team ... Versus a blue-based team with fucking Hermes and Phoenix Knight somehow. He was only 1 level higher than me, supposedly. I somehow managed to knock 40 of his HP off before he slaughtered me. Ouch. Wish I had a god on my team. I then played story mode one more time to rebuild my confidence. Easy 3 tix. 

Overall I had a lot of fun playing! I wish I knew how some of the mechanics worked a little better, but that will come with time.

,NoFap,"Pornography addiction nearly took away everything I loved.  I couldn't give it up until I went through some radical shifts in the way I related to myself and others... Really, the entire way I related to reality, as I'll explain.

I hear so many folks on here beating themselves up for ""failing"" and going back to pornography after a few days, a few weeks, or a few months...  People saying or implying things like:

* ""I have an addictive personality.""
* ""I'm never going to beat this thing.""
* ""I'm just an addict.""
* ""I'm abnormal.""
* ""I'm immoral.""
* ""I'm degrading women by doing this.""
* And so on...

If our goal is to leave pornography behind, and replace it with activities that would meet our needs and get us deeply fulfilled, isn't there a more useful approach than thinking that implies there is something wrong with us?

Isn't there always a more empowering and self-compassionate way to look at the situation, that is just as truthful, if not more so, rather than thoughts like the ones above?

Personally, I believe it disconnects us from our innate power when we think of ourselves in any way that implies we're weak, sick, broken, abnormal, immoral, bad, wrong, lame, perverted, deviant, etc...  Any thinking that evokes a sense that we're not powerful enough, not smart enough, not manly enough, not awesome enough, just the way we are.

My personal finding is that **unconditional self-acceptance, self-compassion, and self-empowerment is the way out of this thing.**

And yet, these badges have some limitations, and it is an underlying theme I see in this sub-reddit a lot: Yes, let's celebrate when we've kept agreements with ourselves to stay away from disempowering habits.  But let's not link our self-worth to how long we can stay away from porn or masturbation.  

**Never call yourself a ""failure"" for any reason, even in your thinking**.

This just creates feelings of shame and insecurity, and that is like pouring gasoline on a fire: It just creates more pain that we want to try to escape from by going back to porn.

The reason I stay away from pornography is because it doesn't meet my needs.  It doesn't meet my needs for self-connection, intimacy with my partner, or trust and predictability in my life as to what I might do next.  But I couldn't make that shift to thinking in terms of needs until I stopped thinking of porn as something ""bad"" or ""wrong""... I had to stop making it something forbidden, and that is what drained it of it's power.

**Hell, it's just naked people on a screen, right?**

I believe we give porn power over us by linking our self-worth to it in one way or another.  

* We use it to boost our self-worth by receiving simulated love and acceptance from electronic women on a screen.  
* We use it to beat ourselves up by telling ourselves it is wrong, bad, forbidden, and that we are therefore flawed, weak, and broken for having acquired a dependency on it.  
* We use it boost ourselves again when we manage to stay away from it for a while.  Then we beat ourselves down again if we go back to it.

We create and feed a cycle of thinking in which our adequacy as human beings is conditional, rather than innate.

We've gotten so skilled at questing our self-worth that we may even look at this fact, and judge ourselves as ""losers"" for creating this cycle of thinking!

How do we break the cycle?

Compassionately observe your own thinking, and realize:

**YOU ARE NOT YOUR MIND.**

Any self-judgmental thoughts you have that create this shame and pain are part of a whole system of thinking that **you did not create in yourself**.  

It was injected into you the same way it was for all of us: By the collective conditioning we received from every source of information since birth--the systemic, and largely unconscious patterns of thinking that pervade the entire human race, and which include a kind of virus:

**The idea that it is possible for there to be something wrong with a person.**

No, it's not a conspiracy, there is no one mastermind behind it.

It's a mental virus that evolved spontaneously, and which has been operating quietly but powerfully inside human beings since we first started thinking...

This viral idea has been nurtured by power structures and authorities for centuries in order to disconnect us from our inner power.  It has been used to prompt us to look outside ourselves, to something external (like an authority) to tell us whether we are good or bad, right or wrong, moral or immoral, normal or abnormal.

Why?  **Because this is the most effective way to dominate a large number of people with a small number of people.**

People who actually realize how powerful they are don't make very good slaves.

This virus of disempowering thinking obscures from us from the truth, as I see it:

* We have the power to do whatever we choose at any moment.

* Everything we do is an attempt to meet a need.

* Anything we do that ultimately stimulates pain for ourselves or others was done in response to a very powerful need inside us, otherwise, we wouldn't have done it.

* The more connected we are to our own needs, the more connected we are, automatically, to the needs of others: Because we have an innate need for others' well-being.

* Any thinking that implies there's something wrong with us, or something wrong with others, tends to disconnect us from needs.

* Thinking that implies we are not free, that we ""have to"" do something, or ""should"" do something tends to obscure the truth that we are free.

* If we choose, we have the power to observe our own feelings and allow ourselves to fully feel the discomfort of not choosing pornography when we feel the urge.

* If we choose, we have the power to transform our own thinking: To see any thinking that implies we're impotent, sick, broken, weak, or inadequate, and respond to ourselves with compassion and self-care instead.

* If we choose, we have the power to decide we are willing to feel scared, angry, uncomfortable, lonely, or any of the other ""itchy"", uncomfortable feelings that we often medicate with pornography.

* If we choose, we have the power to accept ourselves unconditionally, even when we slip and go back to viewing pornography, or do something else that ultimately doesn't meet our needs.

* If we choose, we have the power to get really curious about what it's like to feel these feelings... To just sit with them, examine their texture, and if any judgments or thoughts arise, we can examine them too...

This is what meditation really is, I believe:

**Curious and compassionate self-observation that greets every experience that arises within ourselves, and allows it to be just the way it is.**

Why accept every inner experience just the way it is?  Because it's here.

Every thought and feeling that arises within us is actually present inside us: It exists.  This doesn't mean that the *contents* of a particular thought are true (my belief is that the truth is too enormous, too beautiful, rich, and complex to be contained in something as primitive and simplistic as a thought): It is just a thought, or a feeling, or a sense perception.  But it does exist, so there's no sense in fighting it -- allow it to be!

We sometimes resist the presence of thoughts and feelings inside us, and that is what generates pain.  When we accept the presence of whatever is present in our inner experience (without necessarily buying into any particular thought that wants us to believe it), we free ourselves of suffering.

That's when porn loses it's grip on us, and we realize pornography never had any power: Only our **thoughts** about pornography have power, and only when we **believe** what they imply:

* That porn holds something of value for me.
* That there is something out there I'm missing out on.
* That I'll regret a life without porn.
* That I'm more powerful, worthy, and studly while inside a porn fantasy.
* That it would be fulfilling to do these things in real life.
* That I am not powerful, worthy, and studly without pornography.
* (etc... You may have different thoughts.)

These thoughts, and thoughts like them create the power that porn holds over us.  

If we can witness and accept such thoughts without believing them or taking them personally, we are free of them.  

If we can accept and nurture the feelings of insecurity, guilt, and shame that are present inside us, and that we are trying to fulfill by viewing porn, we can meet our own needs for self-acceptance, self-compassion, and self-empowerment.

If we can become aware of all the needs that are present inside us (Love, companionship, fun, contribution, meaning, purpose, and many more), we can pursue many other strategies for meeting them that are more fun and less costly.

,diablo3,"So, I've been very diligent in collecting all possible fire gear in building my Fire Crusader, and have pretty good versions of everything, and currently farming T3/T4 with ease.

I picked up an interesting trinket the other day - the axe Hack - which has a legendary affix to do 92% of thorns damage with each hit.  Fortunately, the axe rolled with good affixes and a socket, so I decided to reroll the ""black damage"" to ""fire damage"" to gain my fire boost.

So, question to you all:

I currently have two pieces of the ""Demon Set"" - which provides 6000 Fire thorns.  Normally, a pretty bad set.  However, with my fire boosts, it provides a bit of help in large packs.  Now, with the Hack, how does the thorns boost work with my fire boost?

Because my thorns are ""fire"" damage thorns, I would expect it would get a boost from my 127% fire damage boost, but because there's no published way of calculating this on my own, I don't know if my build will be any good before devoting time to it.

,ffxiv,"***MASSIVE WALL OF TEXT***

This is not, at all, me truly complaining. I want to calmly and collectively organize what I know about Relic quest, and where it is going. Here is what we know, from all the helpful Redditors who have progressed:

*Novus requires 3 500 myth items for a total of 1500 myth to get started.

*This lets you get a scroll to start your real journey. We know that You need Alexandrite as a Catalyst to make your Novus weapon with Materia. 

*First: 
-Alexandrite-
- can be obtained by: 
-1 daily from daily expert
-1 from an 800 myth treasure-like map
-Of course, everyone's favorite low-chance fate drop. This requires you to wield your Animus and whack away at fates for what early reports indicate is a near-ATMA level chance of getting one.

-Materia-
Next, Materia. You need to meld Materia into your Novus, even if you don't want to change the end stats (which you probably do). Here is what we know:

-You have to start out with Materia level I. You can not jump into Materia IV and boost your way to Novus.
-There is an initial 100% with Materia I, and we know this goes down, because it shows you 100% similar to Materia melding on armor.
-Eventually, after using (not certain) amount of Materia I, we unlock the ability to use Materia II, and it is (only assumed at this point in time) the pattern continues until you are melding Materia IV. 
-The amount each Materia adds is directly reflected towards your total for the secondary. This means that:
    --If you have a Materia I that adds 1, then the x/44 would increase by 1, where as if you are using a higher bonus like +6 from Battledance IV, then your total would increase by 6, bringing you to x+6/44.

-Stats- 
-Your total stat allocation for i110 is either 75 or 62 (possibly more). Let me explain:

Secondary stats have 'high' and 'low' level stats. You can not have 2 'high' or 2 'low' stats. 
-the 'high' for lower-weighted secondaries such as Spell Speed, Skill Speed, Critical Hit, and Accuracy is 44. 
- the 'low' for lower weighted secondaries is 31. 
-Adding these together gets you 75!
Now, if you choose a high-weight secondary such as Determination and Parry:
-The 'high' for higher-weighted secondaries such as Determination is 31. 
-The 'Low' for higher-weighted secondaries such as Determination is (Will fill in when confirmed, my guess is 26).

If you get a 'high' 'low' combo of low-weight stats, your total would be 75. If you chose ""High' 'low' combo of 1 high stat like determination (31) and then a 'low' of a lesser-weight secondary like Critical (31) the total would be 62.

*I am not sure, and will edit, if there are combinations such as 'high' lesser-weighted (41) and 'low' higher weighted (26? think determination) combos available. 

The idea here is that over time, you buy the correct Materia of whatever grade you need, fight the lowering success rate of Materia melding and get your Novus! One thing we do not know at the moment, is if Alexandrite amounts for each Materia attempt rise with the higher level Materia, or if Alexandrite cost is what causes the success rate to go down. Let me explain:

-If it is POSSIBLE to continue using low-level Materia such as I or II based on spirit binding ease or cost, you would need a substantially higher amount of Alexandrite, because of the increased number of Materia used in melding (If it stays 1 Alexandrite:1 Materia regardless of I-IV)
-This would make people who take the cheap route take longer, because farming Alexandrite is a pain in the butt, as it is designed to be.

This is What I know about Novus so far. This is where I talk about what upsets me.

-The introductory Relic quest was what a lot of hard-core FFXI players didn't think was worth of a relic title, but it catered to the masses. Complete the hard mode Primals, Ifrit, Garuda, and Titan, and kill Hydra as well as Chimera. You had to get your 900 Philosophy tomes and then Mythology Tomes to get your Zenith. It took time, and some skill. Players who were good got it first, and as things got easier and people got better, the Relics flourished.
    With the introduction of the Atma and Animus system, we saw fate grinding with a low RNG amount that caused quite a few upset players. With no concrete sense of accomplishment, many players gave up, or at least stopped focusing on the new Atma, especially considering its measly i100 level upgrade without any stats.
    I did not like this very much, but I still grinded hard-core to achieve my Atma, and move onto Animus. This is where players moaned at the grind, but at least felt a sense of relief, they could measure their progress! 9 books of 1500 myth each, approximately 270 brayflox runs if you didn't have any myth ahead of time. Once again this was time consuming and boring for a lot of players, but people got their Animus!
   The Animus weapon granted us increased stats, a new glow, and a sense of satisfaction. The grind was over. 

Final fantasy XIV has always had a special place in my heart. It, being P2P and not F2P, does not succumb to the devices of 'Pay to Win' that F2P models usually follow. Also, though, the best armor in game is only Raidable. I enjoy that. I think that it's awesome that my skill shows my drops, my High Allagan and Unweathered Geralt's armor.
Materia-based and craftable armors have always been released 20 ilvls behind the best armor, to DETER the game from being controlled by those who can 'afford' to be good. And that's my problem: It's happening with Novus.

-They can make Atma drop rate get easier as time goes on. Sure. Lower the cost of each book, or increase myth drop rate significantly. Sure. What about Materia though?

-Materia has ALWAYS been something that is reserved for the crafters, the wealthy, the top FC's that carry for huge cash. At 40-100k a pop for Materia IV and 17% or lower success rate, the supply kept the price as high as it was even more than the incredible demand. Now look what you did FFXIV. You instituted something, a roadblock to people who don't craft, who aren't rich.

-How is someone who can't afford to spend MILLIONS get Novus. Pause and think before answering:

-You can't simply force prices to be lower over time
-Just about every server already has the rich crafter buying up all Materia Stock and reselling for double or triple the cost
-You can't massively increase the supply of Materia to offset the demand, the free market system of FFXIV would left crafters control the Materia anway.
-While you may argue that this is not the BIS, and never is, why should that matter? 
-Relic quests are incremental, I'm going to have to EVENTUALLY find a way to complete my Novus if I want to see the next Installment. I'm going to have to find a way to generate that much cash, with no Crafts currently at a decent level, and no real way besides FC carries to get cash. 
-The Demand for Materia as a Novus requirement will be a joke compared to the added Demand for Materia simply because crafters and merchants can flip Materia for a profit.
-The cost of Battledance Materia III on my server was ALREADY DOUBLE Battledance Materia IV, simply because the III was REQUIRED for the relic quest for WAR. That's:

- 1 class, 
- relic that most people already had, 
-2 Materia required with a 100% success rate.

*COMPARED TO*

-Every class in the game
-Every type of Materia I-IV
-Novus that NO ONE has
-Not even close to 100% success rate.

Sorry for this ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE wall of text. I wanted to be THOROUGH, and if you read it, thank you. Please feel free to gripe, complain, call me whiny, do what you will. I really want to hear feedback on how FFXIV made the most iconic installment of their series, the relic chain, unreachable to so many players.
