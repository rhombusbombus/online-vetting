When Amy went into the kitchen to get plates, the burning smell got much stronger.  ""Jenna, the sauce!"" she said loudly, louder than she'd intended because Amy was surprised that Jenna, avid lover of cooking, had let dinner burn.


Jenna started, dropping the wooden spoon that should have been stirring the puttanesca in the pan. The spoon fell to the ground, getting tomato sauce on the floor and cabinets.  ""I'm sorry!"" she shouted, instinctively shying away from the sudden voice until Jenna saw who'd spoken and her expression of fear turned to one of embarrassment and shame.


Amy looked quickly away from Jenna's blushing face, her eyes settling on the latest addition to the already-messy kitchen: The spoon was a corpse on the dirty, grey linoleum of the floor and the red sauce spattered about it its blood.  ""I'll clean that up if you fix the sauce,"" Amy offered her friend. 


Jenna agreed readily and for the next fifteen minutes, both girls were busy.  Amy scrubbed at the floor and cabinets, cleaning the tomato sauce off and much more besides.  Jenna added a potato to the saucepan and simmered it, though she stirred the pan so rarely that Amy was sure it would burn a second time.  


Before she could ask Jenna what was on her mind, Mlle Inado bustled in through the door and filled the apartment with her friendly, homey noise. ""Amy, did you get all the groceries?"" she called from the front lobby in her sing-song voice.


""Yes I did, Mlle Inado,"" Amy called back to her.  She'd been left a decent-sized list, and very specific instructions to go at 10:30, ""when the stores would be quietest.""


""Did Jenna go with you?"" Mlle Inado asked casually, this time from the hallway.


Amy looked over at Jenna, who was absent-mindedly watching the saucepot slowly bubble and boil.  ""No, Jenna didn't,"" Amy replied after a moment. 


Just then, Mlle Inado, all 5 feet of her, entered the crowded kitchen. ""Oh, Jenna!"" she sounded surprised to see her.  ""You saw my note this morning?""


Jenna gave the pot a stir and nodded.  ""Good, good.  Take your time.  The decision is yours, ok?"" Jenna nodded again at Mlle Inado's cryptic comment, leaving Amy to wonder just what they were talking about.  ""Anyways, is dinner almost done?"" A third nod.  


""Perfect! I'm starving,"" Mlle Inado said.  ""Shall we set the table, Amy?""


Once again, any chance Amy would have had to talk to Jenna was taken from her by Mlle Inado.

-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

""We need to sign you ladies for school soon!""  Mlle Inado said brightly when everyone was seated a few minutes later.  


""Yes, Mlle Inado,"" Amy and Jenna said dutifully and almost simultaneously.  In truth, Jenna would have said yes to almost anything, so distracted was she and Amy was only agreeing in the hopes that she would be left alone to worry about Jenna. 


""Grade 11 is almost a week old already. We can't have you two falling behind,"" Mlle Inado continued, apparently unconcerned by her charges' automatic answers.  ""That, or you need to get jobs, like I said when you first came to me.""


The thinly veiled reference to Mlle Inado's rules broke through the clouds of Amy's worry like the sun after a day of rain.  Jenna didn't seem to notice, but Amy looked worried by Inado's threat.  ""How long will you give us before you kick us out?""


Mlle Inado, seeing that she'd gotten one of her tenants' attention, smiled warmly as though she wanted to dull the effect her steely words had had.  ""I like to give my ladies a few weeks, at most, to get used to things and to get their feet back under them.""


Amy stared blankly at her, clearly trying to work out how long it had been since she and Jenna had arrived at what Mlle Inado's grandly and jokingly called her ""Home for Runaway Girls."" Amy and Jenna were the only two living at the Home (nothing more than a fourth floor apartment in a rundown building) at the moment but row upon row of framed photographs watched them from the dining rooms' walls, a reminder of other girls who'd come and gone in the past.


""I don't like kicking my ladies out, don't like it at all, so I'm always happy to help out with finding work or registering for school,"" Mlle Inado offered, successfully soothing the fears written plain as day across Amy's face.  Jenna didn't look at all concerned that her dinner-companions were talking about how long she'd have a roof over her head.


""I've missed school,"" Amy said wistfully.  Besides her parents, it was the only thing she'd missed since she'd walked away from the home her parents had left her with as many of her belongings as she could fit into her backpack.  


""Let's talk about the local high schools then,"" Mlle Inado said firmly.  She launched herself into a description of the local schools that gave Amy no time to worry about Jenna until, at last, dinner was done. Or at least until Amy and Mlle Inado finished eating; Jenna's plate was still mostly full-she'd apparently spent more time twirling her long, black hair than she had her pasta.


Before Amy could find out from Jenna what was bothering her, Mlle Inado started clearing the table and asked for Amy's help.  Jenna, in the meantime, slipped out of the dining room.  

-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Amy didn't catch up to Jenna for another hour and a half, not until after Mlle Inado had gone out for her evening walk; there were dishes to wash and leftovers to put away and Mlle Inado suddenly needed Amy's help to do all of it.  When she finally got free, Amy found Jenna staring out the open window in the hallway, her hair blown about by a stiff, warm breeze.  


Amy joined her there, half-sitting on the window-sill a few feet away from where Jenna leaned on it.  One girl faced the peeling wall and the other faced the starry cityscape and neither girl broke what was probably the longest silence between them since they'd met on the bus a month and a half ago.


At first Amy waited for her friend to talk, expecting Jenna to be eager to share whatever weighed on her so heavily but Jenna remained stubbornly silent. ""Dinner tonight was good,"" Amy said, just to be saying something. She kept her gaze studiously on the wall and her tone light and conversational.


Jenna didn't turn her head.  ""A little burnt, but still tasty,"" Amy continued valiantly.  ""Mlle Inado was telling me that Wardford Heights has a good cooking program. They apparently place a lot of student cooks in local restaurants.""


Her friend continued to stare out at the towering condominiums and office buildings of Fenirton.  ""I will probably enrol at Wardford. Mlle Inado knows the principal and doesn't think he'll mind me starting a little late.""


Once again, Jenna didn't show any sign of hearing Amy.  Amy sighed.  ""Jenna, what's be-""


""My parents called the house today, while you were out getting groceries.  That's why I didn't come with you.""  Jenna cut in immediately, as though she'd been anticipating the question all day.  Amy's head snapped up to look at her friend, whose eyes never left the city.  Mlle Inado must have told Jenna about the scheduled call, then let her decide whether she wanted to take it or not.


""They want me to come home."" Jenna's voice sounded hollow and defeated.


""Why?""  Amy couldn't understood.  Who beats their daughter so badly she runs away from home, then calls her to ask her to come home?


""Don't know.  Didn't ask."" 


""What did you say?"" Amy was watching her friend closely, wondering if she couldn't see tears shining through the shadows that covered Jenna's face.  


""I said I'd think about it."" Think about it?


""What is there to think about, Jenna?"" Amy's voice demanded Jenna's attention and she finally turned to face her friend, revealing the tears that flowed freely.  ""They beat you and they hurt you!""


For a moment, Jenna couldn't talk.  She just sat on the window-sill, crying.  ""They're my parents, Amy.  They love me.""  Jenna said, her whole body heaving.


Now it was Amy's turn to be speechless and Jenna took advantage of the silence.  ""It was my mom who was on the phone first and she couldn't stop crying.  Then my dad came on and he kept apologizing and they promised things would be different and they must have called all over town to find me…"" Jenna sounded like she was trying to convince herself.  


She certainly wasn't convincing Amy, who felt she had to chime in.  ""They've promised that before, haven't they?"" Jenna nodded imperceptibly, shoulders shaking violently. Amy kept her distance, knowing Jenna didn't like to be touched though every instinct screamed at Amy to comfort her friend.


""You can't go back, Jenna."" Amy pleaded, tears coming to her own eyes. ""It won't end until you're dead, you know.""


""Amy, you don't know that!"" Jenna cried.


""Yes I do, Jenna. People like this don't stop.""


""But they're my parents,"" Jenna said again, as though that excused everything when it just made everything that much worse.


""They still hurt you!"" Amy hissed in frustration and Jenna, retreating instinctively, leaned back farther out the open window. ""It didn't matter then that they were your parents! Why would it be any different now?""


""They promised…"" Jenna whimpered. The open window was yawning behind Jenna, who was more out of the apartment than in it.


""A promise means nothing!"" Amy, suddenly and helplessly angry, was shouting, though she didn't know it. She stepped closer and closer to Jenna, who couldn't retreat any further. ""Promises mean nothing, and family means nothing.  Both can be broken and both can hurt you!""


A memory, as vivid as reality, flashed before her and suddenly, so suddenly, the anger was gone, giving way to a stomach-twisting sadness. Hot, stinging tears started rolling down her face then Jenna's arms wrapped around her, first tentatively, then firmly. 


""You're not talking about my parents, are you?"" Jenna whispered the question into Amy's ear and received a nod in return. 


""You never told me why you ran away from home, Amy,"" Jenna pointed out, voice still thick from crying.  ""What happened to you?""

Amy didn't answer right away-the tears were coming too fast- but once both girls had cried their fill, they sat down side-by-side on the window-sill and Amy told Jenna the story of how she became an orphan.

###CLASSIFIED TOP SECRET
#####The Future of Northern Union Satellite Intelligence
####*For your eyes only*
 
###Overview
Intelligence gathered from orbital satellite sources was critical to the destruction of the Midwestern Air Force by the Northern Union Air Army. While [**RADARSAT**](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/72ucu3/secret_radarsat_constellation_expansion/) has proven a reliable platform for [**MASINT**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_and_signature_intelligence), future Northern Union strategic operations will require a new constellation of satellites to provide NUMAA with orbital [**IMINT**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagery_intelligence) capabilities.        

###Northern Cross

The Northern Union received timely assistance from Columbian Federation’s WorldEye orbital arrays during the Midwestern air war, though this has highlighted our need to pursue our own organic optical satellite capabilities. [**Northern Cross**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Cross_(asterism\)) is a constellation of twenty-four high-resolution pan-spectral imaging satellites providing visual, thermal, near-IR, far-IR and UV imaging at the fraction of the cost of a comparable optical membrane satellite.   

Columbian-based Starlight Systems has significant experience with the construction and design of large-scale mirrors, as demonstrated by the deployment of their [**orbital telescope**](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/7vkyu6/tech_outlandishly_enormous_space_telescope/). NUMOD has, via MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates, commissioned Starlight for the purchase of twenty-four 100-meter segmented mirrors and their supporting CNT struss units, to be delivered in two staged batches.   

While the segmented mirrors are being manufactured in orbit, MDA will construct the remaining components in their Vancouver facilities. Each element of the Northern Cross constellation will consist of a satellite bus, 16k-resolution optical cameras, thermal sensors, NIR and FIR optics, long-range quantum-encrypted laser communications, and other supporting electronics that will integrate seamlessly with the Starlight-provided segmented mirror and its supporting struss. This module of each satellite will be launched by the Northern Union’s very own Manitoba Aerospace, using the company’s [**Goshawk X launch platform**](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/7no5dm/tech_goshawk_x_and_goshawk_x3/).   

Satellites will be deployed in a constant-ground-track 60 degree inclined orbit at an altitude of 25,000 kilometers on four [**distinct orbital planes**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude_of_the_ascending_node) to provide 24-hour global coverage in real time. Final integration and assembly in these orbits will be provided via the [**SSL Orbital Repair satellite**](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/79yas4/tech_space_systems_loral_orbital_repair/), to reduce cost per unit.   

Like RADARSAT, administration of the Northern Cross will fall under NU Model Air Army jurisdiction, with EASAT operating the constellation from NU Model Air Army Supreme Headquarters in UFB Bagotville.   

###CIGNUS
Because the Northern Cross constellation is based on the CF’s extant WorldEye platform, MDA will ensure that Northern Cross’ communications integrate seamlessly with the WorldEye constellation. While both constellations possess the capabilities to operate completely independently, this synergistic arrangement provides NUMOD and the CFDOS the ability to link the two constellations together to create a larger 36-satellite orbital array. The combined constellation, known as the **Comprehensive-Intelligence Geospatial Unified System (CIGNUS)**, will provide the Northern Union and Columbian Federation access to the most advanced orbital IMINT array currently in service. As agreed upon between NUMOD and CFDOS, joint authorization will be required before the WorldEye and Northern Cross constellations can be brought together into the CIGNUS formation.   

In tribute to the unified platform, the individual satellites of the Northern Cross constellation will be named after the 24-brightest [**stars of Cygnus the Swan**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Cygnus), with the first five satellites named for the stars of the constellation’s most prominent [**asterism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Cross_(asterism\)).  

NUMOD has allocated $3.5 Billion in research and development over the next three years towards development of the Northern Cross satellites, which are expected to launch between the years 2044-2045. Cost for each satellite is estimated to be $550 Million, $150 Million of which has been waived by the Columbian MSID who has agreed to cover the cost of the segmented mirror in exchange for CIGNUS integration.

I know how it works but it seems that only me knows it. The requirements are by far the worst idea anyone has ever come up with to prevent abuse. And you have shitty AI control do deal with too. 

1. You wait 3 mins until the surrender prompt comes out. Yeah so we give the afk a ""chance"" to comeback. 3 mins worth of farm lost from the afk already means we are gonna get snowballed hard even if the afk does comeback. Some people here will say, you can still 4v5, well let me ask you, how many 4v5 games did you actually win. 
2. Your team needs to not die and to not kill. So to be safe stay in base, right? Sounds easy right? You tell your team to stay in base, what do they do? FIRST BLOOD!!!! 
3. AI takes over AFK player. FIRST BLOOD!!!!
4. Franco, ruby, akai, chou and i dont know who else can yank or kick or spin you out of base. FIRST BLOOD!!!!
5. 50 protection points. I carried hard for that 1 star and then an afk comes along made me lose a star and all i get is 50 fucking afk protection points? This is really what tilts me. 

Seriously moonton, just save the ones affected by the afk from losing a star and the ones afking will lose a star. Simple as that. If you somehow put in your starlight membership that there is 100% afk protection then you can take my money anytime.

Something like Ranma or Twintails, but reverse.

So far the only one I got is the MC of Mahou Shoujo, Ore, but the anime hasn't aired yet.

In Maze, the MC, Maze, is female Maze by day male Maze by night. But it feels like two distinct characters taking turns being a single body, so I don't think it counts.

There's Sailor Moon Starlights, but it seems in the manga or in the anime the plot says they're just crossdressing, so the transformation doesn't really seem important.

In Inari, Konkon, Koi Iroha, the MC physically turns into a guy... or, rather, into multiple, different guys. She doesn't transform into a male version of herself but transforms into other people, so it's not exactly what I'm looking for.

In Simoun it seems ftm gender-bending is part of the plot, but it sounds rather permanent, unlike Ranma/Twintails where the MC only temporarily becomes a female version of themselves.

In a dozen of anime there are cases of gender-bending episodes, but I'd rather have something that's more memorable than just something that happened once.

    As I gently rock you in my arms to sleep,
    I gaze into your eyes as they slowly drift off to dream.
    I can't help but wonder what things you will dream of tonight,
    lying in your bed underneath the starlight. 
    Will it be of airplanes flying way up high?
    Or choo-choo trains blowing their horn as they race down the line?
    Maybe you will see the race cars as they speed down the track, looking on in amazement as they roared past!
    So much too wonder and so much you've already seen, so many things you could possibly dream. Will your 
    dreams be filled with times spent with family and friends? Splashing in the pool or jumping with your brothers 
    on the bed?
    Or maybe you will be riding your tractor, smiling and laughing as you circled the yard. It's hard to believe you're 
    already 3, so many memories and things you have seen!
    As you lie in your bed now fast asleep, I can't help but wonder what the future will bring. I pray everyday that 
    we have many more memories to share, so your dreams will always be filled with excitement and care...

The end began in 678 A.D., as Constantinople came under siege and the Byzantines burned the Muslim fleet to ashes at Sillyon. It would not be noticed until 1,340 years later, on a cold winter night in Resolute, Canada. It would not be understood until several centuries after that. 

Gerald Hightower was one of the first to see it, although the dubious honor is likely shared by thousands around the world. But Gerald was certainly the first observer with the means and clout to disseminate the message. 

It was his 35th birthday and Gerald was very drunk. He rarely drank to begin with, so several rounds of shots brought him steadily to the brink. Inside the bar, stiflingly hot and claustrophobic, Gerald nearly fall asleep. But a friend helped him up and the cutting edge of the cold North Canadian wind hit Gerald like a shot of adrenaline to the chest. 

One of his friends drove him home, and left him half awake on the couch. Time during the winter this far North was a technicality more than a physical reality. 24 hours of darkness for several weeks. 

Gerald awoke alone on the floor of his kitchen. He needed to puke, badly. Without thinking he got up and raced outside into the cold, barely making it to a patch of last night's snow before heaving his guts out in front of him. 

When the wrenching was done, Gerald allowed himself to fall back and bask in the cleansing iciness. The storm clouds were gone and the sun hid it's face on the opposite side of the World. Through the freezing air Gerald could see the stars, those truest of his friends, with whom he spent his life conversing most honestly. 

Gerald found his companions one by one as he so often did. Cassiopeia in her chains. Hydra with it's many heads. Pheonix and Scorpius. The Ursas and Gemini. Gerard found each and let the chill air calm the pounding in his head. 

Gerard's eye fell on mighty Orion, his immense sword, ready to strike a killing blow, and his heavy belt cinched tight around the waist. 

Then it happened. As Gerard watched through reddened, stuporous eyes, Alnilam, the middle and farthest of the three stars in Orions belt, winked out of existence. 

Gerard blinked and searched, but it could not be found.

Louisa pressed on the horn and held it down. 

*I'm coming!*

The non-verbal message was communicated directly to Louisa's auditory nerve via comjack. She did not let up on the horn.

*OK, OK! I'm coming, seriously!*

Anne came racing out the front door of the building lobby and jumped into the passenger's seat of the red convertible. Louisa didn't wait for her to buckle up but set off at speed, the only sound being the barely audible high pitched humm of the electric engines. 

""Whats the rush El? You have a date with Professor Radich or something?"" Anne hastily clicked her seatbelt into place, a knee jerk response with little basis in reality. Louisa had only a modicum of control over the vehicle - start, stop, speed up or down - but the car's A.I. was watching every move. An accident was nearly impossible. 

Louisa was distracted. She urged the car forward at the top speed the law would allow and tapped her fingers nervously on the steering wheel. 

Anne took notice. ""El, what's up?""

Louisa looked at the street as she spoke. The car weaved seamlessly through traffic, interfacing with the other A.I. navigators with ant-hill proficiency. ""Have you logged on yet?""

""I haven't logged on for three days, I'm trying to disconnect for awhile."" The meta-net was always on and always available. On demand information, wireless and everywhere - a direct loop from the cloud to your senses and back again. It could get overwhelming. ""What happened?""

Louisa put her face into her hands and said nothing. When she looked up, her eyes were red-rimmed and wet. ""Hargrove...he was right.""

The enormity of those four words struck deep at Anne's core. Immediately she logged in and accessed the primary global debrief. The summary headline implanted itself in her brain.

**QT Event Confirmed. Mintaka Gone. Alnitak Within A Century. UN Emergency Announcement Expected.**

As astro-physicists, both Louisa and Anne understood the chaos inherent in the Universe. They knew, in time, everything died. They also knew neither they, nor their children's children, would experience the end which now assuredly awaited the planet Earth.

Yet somehow, the knowledge that everything would be gone 916 years from today was still a personal blow. 

They both cried quietly to themselves on the way to the campus, as the car threaded them through traffic.

Al-nok gnawed greedily on the bones of a dead dog. The crumbling remnants of a fire flickered gently in the dusty night, flaring up now and again when it caught an oxygenating breeze. 

Al-nok was alone, as were most Homo sapiens var. radiosis. The remnants of the species once coloquially known as ""humans"" lived on in small pockets of life. The once communal nature of human culture did not apply to H.sapiens var. radiosis. They lived like snow leopards, alone and violent but for a few months of each year when they fought to reproduce. 

There was much lost when H.sapien passed from the Earth. Al-nok could not know the name of the ancient skeleton of Chicago in which he hunted. Al-nok knew only violence and hunger and the simple machines which enabled him to trap and kill and cook.

When Al-nok caught a glimpse of the night sky and saw the all encompassing blackness, devoid of any light beyond the sliver of the moon, he did not miss starlight. For Al-nok, the sky was always a void, a thing to be feared, and hated and, most importantly, ignored. 

Al'nok did not know humanity committed suicide, nor could he understand the motivations of a species faced with the mounting pressure of a ticking doom they could not avert. 

No one on the face of the Earth remembered the stars. No sage or elder could recount the oral history of the darkening night sky. Alniham, Mintaka, Alnitak - the names and lives and deaths of every sun but Sol itself - were lost in time and space.

And perhaps this was for the best. There would be no solace for Al-nok to know absolute forces of destruction/creation would consume him in a matter of days. What good would it do poor Al-nok to be forewarned that the very particles of his being would soon be obliterated/transformed in ways no sentience could possibly comprehend? 

No. Far better to be ignorant. The end of the end would come nonetheless. 

Al-nok sat stooped over his dying fire, under the obsidian sky, gnashing his teeth on the last traces of all life in the universe.

(I don't know how to call them but if I used the word ""Forced"" it's maybe cruel for them)

For example Treasure, Evermore, Beyond Starlight that I think they aren't unique because they formed up for anniversary or some project

This is the list of idol who don't have an unique quintet yet (currently voiced)

- New Generation (I still don't know why they have quintet together)
- Sachiko
- Yui
- Ranko
- Haru (I feel Haru join Aozora Yell on some groove but still not unique one)
- All 6th new voiced except Hina
- Atsumi

Someone will ask why I don't put Haruna though Sarina is still unvoiced, because Blue Napoleon is unique in my point.

In case any of you do as well, the collaborations have been revealed!

Some items are going to be available for preorder through the ISETAN website, and can be purchased using a buying service, such as From Japan.

Others are only available in-store sadly, so if you happen to be in Japan during the release, you might be able to pick some things up.

[Sailor Moon X Pameo Pose and Sailor Moon X ISETAN Collection - Starlight Items. Mixed wear clothing, handbags and jewelry.](http://sailormoon-official.com/goods/fashion/180214_isetan_2018_starlight.php)

[Sailor Moon X Samantha Vega, Samantha Thavasa, Samantha Tiara &amp; Narue Moonlight Items. Handbags, wallets, clutches, purses, jewelry and pajamas.](http://sailormoon-official.com/goods/fashion/180214_isetan_2018_moonlight.php)

All prices are listed towards the bottom of the pages, but they start at $25.00 (Narue pajama hair band) and go up to $1500.00 (Samantha Vega Silver Crystal Bag).

Online preorder goods are listed [here.](http://isetan.mistore.jp/onlinestore/women/sailormoon/index.html) If I'm not mistaken, they do eventually post all the items online, but they are all limited edition and tend to go quickly.

For the record, if you're confused about changing yen to USD, move the decimal point over to the right by one to see the cost. An example would be:

20,000 = 200.00

Happy Shopping!

When Amy went into the kitchen to get plates, the burning smell got much stronger.  ""Jenna, the sauce!"" she said loudly, louder than she'd intended because Amy was surprised that Jenna, avid lover of cooking, had let dinner burn.


Jenna started, dropping the wooden spoon that should have been stirring the puttanesca in the pan. The spoon fell to the ground, getting tomato sauce on the floor and cabinets.  ""I'm sorry!"" she shouted, instinctively shying away from the sudden voice until Jenna saw who'd spoken and her expression of fear turned to one of embarrassment and shame.


Amy looked quickly away from Jenna's blushing face, her eyes settling on the latest addition to the already-messy kitchen: The spoon was a corpse on the dirty, grey linoleum of the floor and the red sauce spattered about it its blood.  ""I'll clean that up if you fix the sauce,"" Amy offered her friend. 


Jenna agreed readily and for the next fifteen minutes, both girls were busy.  Amy scrubbed at the floor and cabinets, cleaning the tomato sauce off and much more besides.  Jenna added a potato to the saucepan and simmered it, though she stirred the pan so rarely that Amy was sure it would burn a second time.  


Before she could ask Jenna what was on her mind, Mlle Inado bustled in through the door and filled the apartment with her friendly, homey noise. ""Amy, did you get all the groceries?"" she called from the front lobby in her sing-song voice.


""Yes I did, Mlle Inado,"" Amy called back to her.  She'd been left a decent-sized list, and very specific instructions to go at 10:30, ""when the stores would be quietest.""


""Did Jenna go with you?"" Mlle Inado asked casually, this time from the hallway.


Amy looked over at Jenna, who was absent-mindedly watching the saucepot slowly bubble and boil.  ""No, Jenna didn't,"" Amy replied after a moment. 


Just then, Mlle Inado, all 5 feet of her, entered the crowded kitchen. ""Oh, Jenna!"" she sounded surprised to see her.  ""You saw my note this morning?""


Jenna gave the pot a stir and nodded.  ""Good, good.  Take your time.  The decision is yours, ok?"" Jenna nodded again at Mlle Inado's cryptic comment, leaving Amy to wonder just what they were talking about.  ""Anyways, is dinner almost done?"" A third nod.  


""Perfect! I'm starving,"" Mlle Inado said.  ""Shall we set the table, Amy?""


Once again, any chance Amy would have had to talk to Jenna was taken from her by Mlle Inado.

-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

""We need to sign you ladies for school soon!""  Mlle Inado said brightly when everyone was seated a few minutes later.  


""Yes, Mlle Inado,"" Amy and Jenna said dutifully and almost simultaneously.  In truth, Jenna would have said yes to almost anything, so distracted was she and Amy was only agreeing in the hopes that she would be left alone to worry about Jenna. 


""Grade 11 is almost a week old already. We can't have you two falling behind,"" Mlle Inado continued, apparently unconcerned by her charges' automatic answers.  ""That, or you need to get jobs, like I said when you first came to me.""


The thinly veiled reference to Mlle Inado's rules broke through the clouds of Amy's worry like the sun after a day of rain.  Jenna didn't seem to notice, but Amy looked worried by Inado's threat.  ""How long will you give us before you kick us out?""


Mlle Inado, seeing that she'd gotten one of her tenants' attention, smiled warmly as though she wanted to dull the effect her steely words had had.  ""I like to give my ladies a few weeks, at most, to get used to things and to get their feet back under them.""


Amy stared blankly at her, clearly trying to work out how long it had been since she and Jenna had arrived at what Mlle Inado's grandly and jokingly called her ""Home for Runaway Girls."" Amy and Jenna were the only two living at the Home (nothing more than a fourth floor apartment in a rundown building) at the moment but row upon row of framed photographs watched them from the dining rooms' walls, a reminder of other girls who'd come and gone in the past.


""I don't like kicking my ladies out, don't like it at all, so I'm always happy to help out with finding work or registering for school,"" Mlle Inado offered, successfully soothing the fears written plain as day across Amy's face.  Jenna didn't look at all concerned that her dinner-companions were talking about how long she'd have a roof over her head.


""I've missed school,"" Amy said wistfully.  Besides her parents, it was the only thing she'd missed since she'd walked away from the home her parents had left her with as many of her belongings as she could fit into her backpack.  


""Let's talk about the local high schools then,"" Mlle Inado said firmly.  She launched herself into a description of the local schools that gave Amy no time to worry about Jenna until, at last, dinner was done. Or at least until Amy and Mlle Inado finished eating; Jenna's plate was still mostly full-she'd apparently spent more time twirling her long, black hair than she had her pasta.


Before Amy could find out from Jenna what was bothering her, Mlle Inado started clearing the table and asked for Amy's help.  Jenna, in the meantime, slipped out of the dining room.  

-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Amy didn't catch up to Jenna for another hour and a half, not until after Mlle Inado had gone out for her evening walk; there were dishes to wash and leftovers to put away and Mlle Inado suddenly needed Amy's help to do all of it.  When she finally got free, Amy found Jenna staring out the open window in the hallway, her hair blown about by a stiff, warm breeze.  


Amy joined her there, half-sitting on the window-sill a few feet away from where Jenna leaned on it.  One girl faced the peeling wall and the other faced the starry cityscape and neither girl broke what was probably the longest silence between them since they'd met on the bus a month and a half ago.


At first Amy waited for her friend to talk, expecting Jenna to be eager to share whatever weighed on her so heavily but Jenna remained stubbornly silent. ""Dinner tonight was good,"" Amy said, just to be saying something. She kept her gaze studiously on the wall and her tone light and conversational.


Jenna didn't turn her head.  ""A little burnt, but still tasty,"" Amy continued valiantly.  ""Mlle Inado was telling me that Wardford Heights has a good cooking program. They apparently place a lot of student cooks in local restaurants.""


Her friend continued to stare out at the towering condominiums and office buildings of Fenirton.  ""I will probably enrol at Wardford. Mlle Inado knows the principal and doesn't think he'll mind me starting a little late.""


Once again, Jenna didn't show any sign of hearing Amy.  Amy sighed.  ""Jenna, what's be-""


""My parents called the house today, while you were out getting groceries.  That's why I didn't come with you.""  Jenna cut in immediately, as though she'd been anticipating the question all day.  Amy's head snapped up to look at her friend, whose eyes never left the city.  Mlle Inado must have told Jenna about the scheduled call, then let her decide whether she wanted to take it or not.


""They want me to come home."" Jenna's voice sounded hollow and defeated.


""Why?""  Amy couldn't understood.  Who beats their daughter so badly she runs away from home, then calls her to ask her to come home?


""Don't know.  Didn't ask."" 


""What did you say?"" Amy was watching her friend closely, wondering if she couldn't see tears shining through the shadows that covered Jenna's face.  


""I said I'd think about it."" Think about it?


""What is there to think about, Jenna?"" Amy's voice demanded Jenna's attention and she finally turned to face her friend, revealing the tears that flowed freely.  ""They beat you and they hurt you!""


For a moment, Jenna couldn't talk.  She just sat on the window-sill, crying.  ""They're my parents, Amy.  They love me.""  Jenna said, her whole body heaving.


Now it was Amy's turn to be speechless and Jenna took advantage of the silence.  ""It was my mom who was on the phone first and she couldn't stop crying.  Then my dad came on and he kept apologizing and they promised things would be different and they must have called all over town to find me…"" Jenna sounded like she was trying to convince herself.  


She certainly wasn't convincing Amy, who felt she had to chime in.  ""They've promised that before, haven't they?"" Jenna nodded imperceptibly, shoulders shaking violently. Amy kept her distance, knowing Jenna didn't like to be touched though every instinct screamed at Amy to comfort her friend.


""You can't go back, Jenna."" Amy pleaded, tears coming to her own eyes. ""It won't end until you're dead, you know.""


""Amy, you don't know that!"" Jenna cried.


""Yes I do, Jenna. People like this don't stop.""


""But they're my parents,"" Jenna said again, as though that excused everything when it just made everything that much worse.


""They still hurt you!"" Amy hissed in frustration and Jenna, retreating instinctively, leaned back farther out the open window. ""It didn't matter then that they were your parents! Why would it be any different now?""


""They promised…"" Jenna whimpered. The open window was yawning behind Jenna, who was more out of the apartment than in it.


""A promise means nothing!"" Amy, suddenly and helplessly angry, was shouting, though she didn't know it. She stepped closer and closer to Jenna, who couldn't retreat any further. ""Promises mean nothing, and family means nothing.  Both can be broken and both can hurt you!""


A memory, as vivid as reality, flashed before her and suddenly, so suddenly, the anger was gone, giving way to a stomach-twisting sadness. Hot, stinging tears started rolling down her face then Jenna's arms wrapped around her, first tentatively, then firmly. 


""You're not talking about my parents, are you?"" Jenna whispered the question into Amy's ear and received a nod in return. 


""You never told me why you ran away from home, Amy,"" Jenna pointed out, voice still thick from crying.  ""What happened to you?""

Amy didn't answer right away-the tears were coming too fast- but once both girls had cried their fill, they sat down side-by-side on the window-sill and Amy told Jenna the story of how she became an orphan.

At the end of my senior year in high school John, Richard and I were looking forward to taking a big road trip. After months of trying to figure out where to go, John came to me holding his phone and babbling about a place called Prudence. John had been corresponding with someone online about a large tract of land once called Prudence that had been abandoned and quarantined decades before. Apparently it was a haven for wildlife and the decayed remnants of what civilization had once resided there. But there was danger. There were mountain lions, vagrants and old tales of murder and demonic possession. Most of the danger we didn’t take too seriously because of our ignorance and our youthful delusion of invincibility, but it gave Prudence just enough character to seduce the imagination.


We planned and prepped for months before the day came to hit the road. John drove, Richard took shotgun as the navigator and I sat in the backseat managing food, drinks and music. The car smelled like you might think; 20 years of heavy cigarette use stained the poorly stitched fabric seats and left a heavy musk in the air. It was a good first car to own, really. It kept you accountable. If you failed to check your fluids or air before heading out into the night you might find yourself stranded. 


Our first stop was a good 8 hours from our home town. I mentioned Johns contact right? Well, Johns contact wanted to give us a personal tour of Prudence and the surrounding land. 


We picked Julie up and she crammed into the backseat with me. She wasn’t what I was expecting for some anonymous source interested in danger. She was just…plain. Normal. Like us. 


“Alright Gentlemen. I warned you before but I’m going to warn you again. You can turn back now and we can call it a day. I’ll find someone else to go with me if need be. This isn’t going to be a casual stroll through Disneyland. This place was never fully developed to begin with, but that was more than 30 years ago. Since then the town has decayed and the wild has taken over once more. You read my guidelines, right? You all got boots and thick pants, gloves and eye protection?” She spoke with authority.


There was a brief pause as her confidence and passion took us by surprise. She was not some demure creature hiding behind a keyboard. “Yes…yes we packed everything you listed.”


“Good. Once we pass the K-rails and park off the road, we are suiting up and we are keeping this shit on until we get back into the car. Clear?” She commanded rhetorically. 


“Good, follow my commands to the letter and keep your eyes out. There are all types of shit out there that can kill you or make you miserable. Snakes, Mountain Lions, poison oak…you name it. There might also be some people around. Keep your distance, let me know if they are acting funny. Don’t wander off into any of the remaining buildings either. Whenever we go into a building I’ll go first. There are plenty of dangers in urban exploring that you won’t pick up on, so let me worry about all that.”


The car was dead silent as we digested everything she was saying. Richard spoke first. 


“Ok, this is getting a little bit too real for me. Are we going to actually be in any danger?”


“Yes, of course. Anything happens, we rally back at the car. Leaving the same way we came in. There’s some other stuff out there too..I’ve heard rumors anyway but…just follow my instructions and you will be fine. Alright, let’s go.” She replied. 


For the remaining 16 hours of the drive she said little despite our attempts to break the tension. Although her entire speech seemed over the top, the terse yet impassioned delivery really helped give us the feeling that this was a real adventure. 


As we neared our destination we drove onward on dirt roads, until we came to the concrete barriers she had described. After parking we got suited up as per her instructions, then we set off into the foothills. John, Richard and I exchanged amused glances as she mimed in the air with some incense in tune with several quiet chants. If this was her good luck custom..well to each their own. 


We continued on for miles, or for what felt like miles anyway. You find yourself going up and down 300, 400 foot hills…you won’t be able to tell how far it is as the bird flies.


My shirt was drenched, my breathing labored. Our banter had ceased and we were focused entirely on the next step up the hill, then down the hill.


“Ain’t no roads out here?” John wheezed out between breaths.


“Wouldn’t be a good quarantine if there were, now would there?” Julie called back over her shoulder. 


“About the quarantine….why..” Richard labored, “Why did they do it? Who are they?”


“I only know rumors.” She clarified once again. “People got sick. They turned on one another. Some said they heard strange noises and saw strange things. Others said simply that those they hurt deserved it because they were from a different tribe, whatever that means. There were hundreds of different reasons and over the years I’ve researched this place I stopped being surprised by what I heard.” She stopped at the crest of another hill before turning to us.


“These rumors start flying and it starts attracting people from all over. Two cults showed up and set-up shop. Apparently the government came in and tried to study it, declared the whole town and surrounding countryside a disaster area before carting everyone off and removing it, and the roads, from existence. I mean, the roads they did cut, but the town remained. Just as the interest came, it went, and this place was forgotten.” She smiled.


As we came up beside her we could see what lay beyond. A quiet dilapidated town was nestled among the rolling hills preserved by the arid climate. In contrast to the peaceful terrain we’d been hiking through this town had an eerie feel. The soft sound of wind rustling dried grass was starting to be replaced by the squeak of metal hinges of a gate swinging in the wind. 


“Watch your step and watch the clock. We have to be on our way back before sundown.” Julie commanded. Before stepping forward she casually pulled a handful of something out of her pocket and sprinkled it on the ground. 


As we made our way into town the ground flattened and became level and the horizon was replaced by a mountain range of roof shingles curled up into the sky, cracked and neglected. Julie continued to lead us down the main avenue, past rusted hulks and plenty of buildings ripe for exploration but she continued on towards the end of the street upon which sat a colossal art deco monstrosity. A monstrosity which she was clearing heading towards.


“Hey, why don’t we…” she waved me off and continued.


Richard and John seemed unperturbed but I was uneasy by the period architecture which elicited in me a sense of both awe and fear made worse by the odd carvings over the threshold of the building which were clearly not a part of the aesthetic. As we crossed the threshold of what was now clearly a community school I whispered to her.


“Somethings not right, you saw that stuff back there? I…”


She shushed me and put a finger to her lips before continuing in a whisper. 


“I know. I know. Keep your eyes open…”


A clicking sound emanated from one of the classrooms ahead. John and Richard paused before rushing forward under a threshold inscribed with more strange markings.


“No, No! Don’t!” Julie shouted.


Shortly after disappearing around the corner I heard Richard scream first, then John. 


As we turned the corner we saw Richard up to his armpits in the floorboards trying desperately to keep from falling further into the hole he’d found himself in. John was struggling to hold onto his arms and pull him out. I rushed forward to give John a hand. 


Richard was screaming in pain, tears welling in his eyes.


“I don’t want to die, I don’t want to die, Momma, Momma, Momma..” 


Then in an instant his arms were pulled from our grip and he was pulled down into the hole with such force that where his broken arms couldn’t be made to squeeze through the hole, the floorboards shaved off the excess skin and muscle. 


Like that he was gone, leaving only a bloody meaty mess on the floorboards. I was in shock, unable to process what had just happened. 


John was running out of the building as Julie grabbed my arm to pull me into motion.


“We can’t just…we can’t just leave!” I shrieked.


She continued to tug me, but I ripped myself away and ran back towards the hole. Peering down I saw nothing but darkness a darkness which threatened to swallow my being. A pure blackness I’d never seen before even absent the colors constructed by the mind in the absence of light. I pulled out my flashlight and cast the beam down into oblivion. Nothing. I dropped my flashlight in to see how far down it might go. I sat there and watched as the light shrank down to a tiny pinprick before disappearing.


No echo of impact ever returned. 


The moment I came back to my senses we were outside, Julie had a firm grip of me as she whispered reassurances.


“It’s Ok, It’s OK, we’re going to get help. You saw how far down it was? We can’t do it ourselves. It’s Ok…”


She repeated over and over.


“It didn’t hit bottom. It was an abyss.” I mumbled.


“What the fuck Julie! What the fuck was that?” John shouted.


“Fucking shut up John.” She hissed. “Be cool.” 


We all sat in silence for a few moments.


“What the fuck is wrong with you? You both broke my goddamn cardinal rule! I said it multiple times. Multiple. It was in the document I sent you, I got a verbal that you both got it. Now he’s gone. You fucked up and he’s gone.” She was in Johns face with a finger digging into his sternum.


“I said it was dangerous here. We have to go. We have to go NOW.” She was clearly hiding panic behind her angry façade.


I looked to John, “What did you see?”


He paused, a look of confusion in his eyes.


“What did you see?” I asked again.


John couldn’t give me a good description, he tried but lacked the vocabulary. “It was…It just came out, it was..darkness. Stalks. Hooks. Darkness. Why is it dark outside?” 


My jaw hung open for a second. It was dark outside. We’d gotten to Prudence at noon when the sky was free of overcast, how the hell was it dark as night? As we moved out of town I tried to pry Julie for more information but she was just as lost as we were, and neither of the sat phones were working even after rebooting multiple times. There was no explanation for the passage of time, and there was no way for us to call for help.


We moved into the hills as quickly as our exhausted bodies would take us. Problem was, we left in such a panic under cover of dark that it wasn’t long before we were lost. 


The terrain was too uniform and our only identifying marker was the town of Prudence itself. 


“So let’s just pick a direction and go.” John begged.


Julie shook her head while running both hands through her hair. “We can’t John. We can’t. We don’t have a choice. We have to wait it out.” We both knew that in our condition she was right. We were physically and emotionally drained.


We regrouped outside of town and waited in silence for whatever cursed night we were a part of to pass. I volunteered to stay awake while John and Julie slept. The temperature continued to drop and I was finally left to my own thoughts without the chaos of Johns panic or the disconcerting indifference of Julie. 


Julie. How had Julie known to call after Richard and John as they went further into the building? 


The thought hung in my mind the same way a bitter flavor persists on the tongue. I tried to recall anything in the 30 page document Julie had sent us that might enlighten me but came up blank. We hadn’t really read the whole thing anyway. At the time it seemed like there were simply too many rules and they all seemed way over the top for a simple hike to some ghost town. I found myself regretting my dismissal of her warnings. 


As I switched out with Julie I decided to confront her.


“How did you know what was going to happen when they ran into the room?” 


She looked at me confused. “It was in my guidelines. Didn’t you see the carvings on the threshold? Didn’t you read what I sent?” 


I looked at the ground sheepishly.


“Jesus…Jesus Christ. You…” She shook her head. “I put together all the rules we have to follow to get out safely. But you guys just couldn’t take it seriously, could you? I assumed you were just following my lead. But you….you stopped with me at the threshold, you calmly went along with my plan to just camp out for the night…but you didn’t know either…”


So she explained it. The markings were Man’s tenuous attempt to bring order to chaos, to keep evil contained and to hide Prudence from prying eyes. Julie had performed the incantations along the journey to lift the veil that covered the abandoned town and put down salt for us to safely enter and exit Prudence itself. It was all ritual but it worked, according to her. 

She didn’t know where or how it came about but she’d been exploring it for years. And she had always followed the rules. Others had come, and others had been taken, but she always followed the rules and always made it out safely. Until now.


“John screwed up..” she whispered to me, tears filling her eyes. “He broke the seal. The salt I laid down. We were leaving in such a hurry he….”


It was hard for me to believe everything she was saying. Rituals? Incantations? It made no sense and she saw that I didn’t believe her.


“I don’t know where we go from here. You don’t believe me, and that’s fine. But we are in the long night now. We won’t see the sun rise again unless we can figure a way out of here. I’d only ever read one account of the long night that didn’t end in tragedy…and there wasn’t anything in there that hinted at how to get out.” 


I laid down and tried to sleep as Julie kept watch. This had to be a dream, she had to be a charlatan. None of this made any sense. I was still numb from the shock of it all but I could feel a disturbing reality setting in. Richard was gone and I didn’t know what the morning would bring, if it were to come at all.


I awoke to a shriek and shot to my feet and ran only realizing mid-flight that the shriek was my own. I slowed and stopped. It was still just as dark as when I’d gone to sleep.


In my confusion my dream dissolved into the ether, the last few images in my mind fading. Richard crying out. Endless pages of rules. A skyline of broken teeth. The act of me eating a luscious apple only to have it rot on my tongue.


Then it was gone, all replaced by John. Even in the dark he seemed to be nervous and afraid.


“She’s gone. She’s gone. She left us! She left us..” He stuttered, as a panic rose inside me.


“Wait, wait, what do you mean?” I looked around trying to grasp the outline of Julie.


“I don’t know I woke up and she was just…gone. She never woke me. She never got me…check your watch. Mine says it’s just past 6am…which..it can’t be. There’s no pre-dawn twilight. There’s no way we could have slept that long. No way…”


I tried to calm him as best I could but my nerves were giving out too and so I decided to tell him what she had told me.


“No, that’s bullshit! Are you fucking with me? What, you…..I see. I see how it is. You saw a sweet little thing and you had to have a taste didn’t you? Is this how you are going to get onto her good side? Help her mess with me so you can mess around with her? Richards in on it too isn’t he….”


The more he talked, the angrier he got, the angrier he got the louder he got. Before long he was shouting in my face, one hand clamped to my shoulder like a vice as he used his imposing size and vigor to cow me into submission.


“Admit it, you sick fuck, and let’s call it. Call off the joke man. Richard!” He shouted into the night. “Richard, come on out, I know what’s going on.” He returned his frantic attention to me.


“Listen here you prick. If you don’t call off this joke I’m going to start hurting you really, really bad. Do you get me? Fuck with my watch, change the time, great trick.” His eyes were wide enough I could see them in the starlight. My mind was desperately trying to find a way to bring the situation under control when I noticed that the seam between the star field and the earth behind John was broken by a shape. 


“Julie?” I called, momentarily abating John’s madness. John turned and lit his flashlight.


What it caught was a confused mess, an other, an indescribable horror. Few details remain of that first glimpse, even now, but it was covered in a crimson mucus, claws, arms, faces…eyes. 


On instinct I grabbed Johns arm and ran towards the town. He didn’t resist. We ducked into the first sturdy building and barricaded the entryway with whatever ancient furniture we could find. He was a stuttering mess throughout the ordeal…and so was I, only I did a slightly better job hiding it. 


“What do we do? What do we do?” He repeated as my mind blanked.


A dim orange light suddenly flooded through the numerous cracks and holes in the structure whose source was a single streetlamp. I peered out as best I could to watch the spectacle. I could barely see the thing approaching and like a harbinger the street lights lit and died ahead of its advance.


Closer and closer it got until the light nearest our refuge was the only one lit until then, just as it’s form was materializing from the darkness it too dimmed and went out such that we were only left with the darkness, and the wet sound of it meandering through the void towards us.


“What do we do? What do we do?” John was hyperventilating now. 


I can’t say I was overcome with acceptance or peace about what was to happen but I did find clarity. “We fight…we fight until we can’t.” 


The creak of the wall nearest the street signaled its arrival. The tapping returned just as John and I picked up whatever improvised weapons we could (a chair leg and a pipe, for those wondering), then chaos erupted from the abyss. Though we could see very little we swung with what strength we could. 

John was thrown to the ground in short order as it rolled over him as his discarded flashlight bathed all three of us in its light. It moved over John and as it did so he dissolved to nothingness with a pitiful whine. 


I rushed forward once again and swung with all my strength only to find my weapon lodged into its hide without so much as causing it to stumble, then it turned its attention to me.


As its arms and claws grasped me and violently pulled me towards its grotesque maw I noted absently that this couldn’t have been the creature John saw. This was something else. Then I remembered the apple in my dream and…well I can’t say for sure what compelled me but I bit into the creatures arm, the arm that held me, as hard as I could.


It shrieked horrifically and stumbled, almost losing its hold on me before gathering itself once more. I bit again, as hard as I could, until my mouth filled with acrid rotten flesh and fluid. The taste so foul that I vomited even in the midst of the struggle.


Its cry nearly burst my eardrums as it fell. As I finished retching it seemed to gather strength, to regenerate where I’d harmed it before struggling to get its jaw around any part of me. Gasping, I set in once more and this time in the struggle I accidentally swallowed some of its skin. 


Its pained scream was unlike any before it. Though the previous shrieks were genuine, they were temporary in nature, this act seemed to weaken it permanently. I didn’t understand then what it was, where I was, or that I’d might survive, but I set to my task with vigor. Every bite I took weakened it even more and soon enough it was no longer able to subdue me. Rather, I subdued it. Its gaping mouth of jagged edges shrunk. 


And so I filled my mouth with its rancid flesh again and again until it was gone. I never once became full in that struggle; I felt a hunger of some sort once I realized I might survive, but that was just a hunger for victory.


So I laid in a puddle of filth exhausted from the struggle and watched the sun rise. 


Safe now several years on, I sit in front of cold granite stones with small American flags waving in the wind that are all that’s left of two vibrant lives and I am reminded of that apple. Just as Eve ate the apple and was bestowed with knowledge, I ate my demon and made all its rottenness my own and I was granted freedom. The good and the evil and the memory of loss continue to exist within me, and that’s OK.

My life had been nothing out of the ordinary. I followed the rules, I was a good student, I tried to be a good son but invariably failed at that often enough. I kept my head down and rarely traveled out of town. But something about that style of life left me feeling wanting. I wanted adventure. I wanted to see the world and the people in it and I wanted to challenge my understanding of life. 


So when my best friend John came to me holding his phone and babbling about taking the biggest trip any of us had ever been on, I committed to it without much thought. I knew it’d be new and challenging and I knew my parents would freak out about it but I also knew that it was what my heart needed and there was nothing that was going to stop me.


John had been corresponding with someone online about a large tract of land once called Prudence that had been abandoned and quarantined decades before. Apparently it was a haven for wildlife and the decayed remnants of what civilization had once resided there. But there was danger. There were mountain lions, vagrants and old tales of murder and demonic possession. Most of the danger we didn’t take too seriously because of our ignorance and our youthful delusion of invincibility, but it gave Prudence just enough character to seduce the imagination.


At the end of our senior year while most of our peers were talking about what colleges they were going to, all we wanted to talk about was the journey we were going to take. It wasn’t just John and I either. The other member of our motley crew, Richard, wanted in too. It was going to be a trip we could tell for the rest of our lives. Sure, a lot of people rolled their eyes at us or tried to talk us into thinking about the long term and to focus on building a career, setting ourselves up for success…but to us this was just the first stop in our lives journey.


We planned and prepped for months before the day came to hit the road. John drove, Richard took shotgun as the navigator and I sat in the backseat managing food, drinks and music. The car smelled like you might think; 20 years of heavy cigarette use stained the poorly stitched fabric seats and left a heavy musk in the air. It was a good first car to own, really. It kept you accountable. If you failed to check your fluids or air before heading out into the night you might find yourself stranded. 


Our first stop was a good 8 hours from our home town. I mentioned Johns contact right? Well, Johns contact wanted to give us a personal tour of Prudence and the surrounding land. 


We picked Julie up and she crammed into the backseat with me. She wasn’t what I was expecting for some anonymous source interested in danger. She was just…plain. Normal. Like us. 


“Alright Gentlemen. I warned you before but I’m going to warn you again. You can turn back now and we can call it a day. I’ll find someone else to go with me if need be. This isn’t going to be a casual stroll through Disneyland. This place was never fully developed to begin with, but that was more than 30 years ago. Since then the town has decayed and the wild has taken over once more. You read my guidelines, right? You all got boots and thick pants, gloves and eye protection?” She spoke with authority.


There was a brief pause as her confidence and passion took us by surprise. She was not some demure creature hiding behind a keyboard. “Yes…yes we packed everything you listed.”


“Good. Once we pass the K-rails and park off the road, we are suiting up and we are keeping this shit on until we get back into the car. Clear?” She commanded rhetorically. 


“Good, so I’ve got two sat phones. One for me, one for John. Stick with us and you’ll be fine. Follow my commands to the letter and keep your eyes out. There are all types of shit out there that can kill you or make you miserable. Snakes, Mountain Lions, poison oak…you name it. There might also be some people around. Keep your distance, let me know if they are acting funny. Don’t wander off into any of the remaining buildings either. Whenever we go into a building I’ll go first. There are plenty of dangers in urban exploring that you won’t pick up on, so let me worry about all that.”


The car was dead silent as we digested everything she was saying. Richard spoke first. 


“Ok, this is getting a little bit too real for me. Are we going to actually be in any danger?”


“Yes, of course. Anything happens, we rally back at the car. Leaving the same way we came in. There’s some other stuff out there too..I’ve heard rumors anyway but…just follow my instructions and you will be fine. Alright, let’s go.” She replied. 


For the remaining 16 hours of the drive she said little despite our attempts to break the tension. Although her entire speech seemed over the top, the terse yet impassioned delivery really helped give us the feeling that this was a real adventure. 


As we neared our destination we drove onward on dirt roads, until we came to the concrete barriers she had described. After parking we got suited up as per her instructions, then we set off into the foothills. John, Richard and I exchanged amused glances as she mimed in the air with some incense in tune with several quiet chants. If this was her good luck custom..well to each their own. 


We continued on for miles, or for what felt like miles anyway. You find yourself going up and down 300, 400 foot hills…you won’t be able to tell how far it is as the bird flies.

As we came up beside her we could see what lay beyond. A quiet dilapidated town was nestled among the rolling hills preserved by the arid climate. In contrast to the peaceful terrain we’d been hiking through this town had an eerie feel.

“Wait, wait, what do you mean?” I looked around trying to grasp the outline of Julie.


“I don’t know I woke up and she was just…gone. She never woke me. She never got me…check your watch. Mine says it’s just past 6am…which..it can’t be. There’s no pre-dawn twilight. There’s no way we could have slept that long. No way…”


I tried to calm him as best I could but my nerves were giving out too and so I decided to tell him what she had told me.


“No, that’s bullshit! Are you fucking with me? What, you…..I see. I see how it is. You saw a sweet little thing and you had to have a taste didn’t you? Is this how you are going to get onto her good side? Help her mess with me so you can mess around with her? Richards in on it too isn’t he….”


The more he talked, the angrier he got, the angrier he got the louder he got. Before long he was shouting in my face, one hand clamped to my shoulder like a vice as he used his imposing size and vigor to cow me into submission.


“Admit it, you sick fuck, and let’s call it. Call off the joke man. Richard!” He shouted into the night. “Richard, come on out, I know what’s going on.” He returned his frantic attention to me.


“Listen here you prick. If you don’t call off this joke I’m going to start hurting you really, really bad. Do you get me? Fuck with my watch, change the time, great trick.” His eyes were wide enough I could see them in the starlight. My mind was desperately trying to find a way to bring the situation under control when I noticed that the seam between the star field and the earth behind John was broken by a shape. 


“Julie?” I called, momentarily abating John’s madness. John turned and lit his flashlight.


What it caught was a confused mess, an other, an indescribable horror. Few details remain of that first glimpse, even now, but it was covered in a crimson mucus, claws, arms, faces…eyes. 


On instinct I grabbed Johns arm and ran towards the town. He didn’t resist. We ducked into the first sturdy building and barricaded the entryway with whatever ancient furniture we could find. He was a stuttering mess throughout the ordeal…and so was I, only I did a slightly better job hiding it. 


“What do we do? What do we do?” He repeated as my mind blanked.


A dim orange light suddenly flooded through the numerous cracks and holes in the structure whose source was a single streetlamp. I peered out as best I could to watch the spectacle. I could barely see the thing approaching and like a harbinger the street lights lit and died ahead of its advance.


Closer and closer it got until the light nearest our refuge was the only one lit until then, just as it’s form was materializing from the darkness it too dimmed and went out such that we were only left with the darkness, and the wet sound of it meandering through the void towards us.


“What do we do? What do we do?” John was hyperventilating now. 


I can’t say I was overcome with acceptance or peace about what was to happen but I did find clarity. “We fight…we fight until we can’t.” 


The creak of the wall nearest the street signaled its arrival. The tapping returned just as John and I picked up whatever improvised weapons we could (a chair leg and a pipe, for those wondering), then chaos erupted from the abyss. Though we could see very little we swung with what strength we could. John was thrown to the ground in short order as it rolled over him and his flashlight all three of us in its light. It moved over John and as it did so he dissolved to nothingness with a pitiful whine. 


I rushed forward once again and swung with all my strength only to find my weapon lodged into its hide without so much as causing it to stumble, then it turned its attention to me.


As its arms and claws grasped me and violently pulled me towards its grotesque maw I noted absently that this couldn’t have been the creature John saw. This was something else. Then I remembered the apple in my dream and…well I can’t say for sure what compelled me but I bit into the creatures arm as hard as I could.


It shrieked horrifically and stumbled, almost losing its hold on me before gathering itself once more. I bit again, as hard as I could, until my mouth filled with acrid rotten flesh and fluid. The taste so foul that I vomited even in the midst of the struggle.


Its cry nearly burst my eardrums as it fell. As I finished retching it seemed to gather strength, to regenerate where I’d harmed it before struggling to get its jaw around any part of me. Gasping, I set in once more and this time in the struggle I accidentally swallowed some of its skin. 


Its pained scream was unlike any before it. Though the previous shrieks were genuine, they were temporary in nature, this act seemed to weaken it permanently. I didn’t understand then what it was, where I was, or that I’d might survive, but I set to my task with vigor. Every bite I took weakened it even more and soon enough it was no longer able to subdue me. Rather, I subdued it. Its gaping mouth of jagged edges shrunk. And so I filled my mouth with its rancid flesh until it was gone. I never once became full in that struggle; I felt a hunger of some sort once I realized I might survive, but that was just a hunger for victory.


So I laid in a puddle of filth exhausted from the struggle and watched the sun rise. 


Safe now several years on, I sit in front of cold granite stones with small American flags waving in the wind that are all that’s left of two vibrant lives and I am reminded of that apple. Just as Eve ate the apple and was bestowed with knowledge, I ate my demon and made all its rottenness my own and I was granted freedom. The good and the evil and the memory of loss continue to exist within me, and that’s OK. Looking back….I wouldn't be surprised if everyone has their own way out of [Prudence](https://www.reddit.com/r/A_Stony_Shore).

Occupation: Templar and Archbishop of Sumo Frigore

Physical Characteristics: 6'9"" tall, 250 pounds. Light Brown, shoulder length hair, blue eyes, a goatee, and a scar running from just above his right eye to his lower left cheek. His left arm has been replaced with a magic, golden prosthetic.

Equipment: Silver Ornamental Plate armor with a symbol of a sun in the center of the chest and gold accents, with the left arm unarmored, a silver longsword with golden runes on the blade, a thick book strapped to his left hip, a golden whip on his right hip, and a white hooded robe with gold trim.

Backstory: Around the age of 16, Ender renounced his family name and joined an order of Templars who serve the light, seeking out and destroying worshipers of the darkness. While leading an assault on a cult, the members of that cult killed all of his brothers, leaving him the last of his order. After this Ender fled to a new continent where he became a drunkard and fell from the light. After some time, he met Aurelius, the original Archbishop of Sumo Frigore, and began to regain his faith. Upon the death of Aurelius, Ender took over the tile and inherited book granting great power. Ender then set out with his party on pilgrimage to a mountain created as a challenge by the gods. During the challenge, Ender lost his left arm to an arcane blast. Upon reaching the summit, the party was greeted by the mountain's creator and taken to the heavens, where Ender was gifted a prosthetic arm made of pure starlight, and a whip made of the same material.

After playing this character in our homebrew campaign for two and a half years, it would be amazing to see some artwork.

Norma is my tank with dam reduction red artifact, and I don't have a ready replacement for 1st spot (I have two 5* IBs, but no Kristians). I also have 190 points in priest tech so she really pulls her weight, especially in Aspen and BT. I just need one 5* Norma copy to bring her to 9*\.

Aidan is my main DPS, and he just got buffed. I know the opinion is he's not worth 10* as the on-death mechanics aren't seen as great, but he's carried my team in many a pvp battle as he avenges my crappy 6*s, and he's also my best pve damage dealer.

I could also plan to bring kharma or groo to 9* , or OD-01 or Lutz to 10*.

Way higher. Orbit higher.

Combined with the availability of huge masses of lunar material, TetherTech thinks that their [Orbital Bolos](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/7v5csh/tech_orbital_launch_tether/) can be built for approximately $200 to $400 million each. Moreover, the TetherTech/NGAS design is volume limited, so absolute mass economy is not of vital importance, and with electrodynamic reboost the stations need no propellant to keep their stations. Therefore, the only real cost is that involved in getting to the tip of the tether, which with the original design is moving at hypersonic velocity.

Passenger Lift Bolo
------------------

The solution to this problem is to build a longer tether. Retaining the barely-rotating design but shifting to a 3:1 rotational speed on the tether (when extended), and using an enhanced electrodynamic reboost approach (AKA: MOAR POWAH), the PLB is able to attain tip velocities of ""only"" about 2km/s relative to the ground at an altitude of approximately 80,000 to 100,000ft. This velocity is then attainable by not outrageously insane carrier aircraft, ""only"" needing comparable performance to the SR-71. Moreover, because this aircraft's mission is solely to ferry passengers to the Bolo, it can have very short range and therefore have small fuel tanks. 

Once grabbed, the PLB then adds about 5km/s of velocity to the grabbed passengers/payload, hauling it into orbit while reeling it in, using the mass of the PLB's counterweight to provide the energy. The passenger/cargo cabin is then held aboard the PLB until time for deorbit, which is done in the exact opposite process recovering most of the energy back to the PLB. As a result, the system is nearly energy-neutral for any distance covered, and requires only small energy inputs to the PLB to maintain its average orbit.

As a result, the PLB is a new and unique form of ""air"" transportation, one which offers constant fuel usage for any covered distance, all of it used by the carrier aircraft used to haul the passengers or cargo to the tip of the PLB's tether. The system moreover actually offers *reduced* fuel consumption overall relative to historic (e.g. turbofan) modes of transportation over long distances, since the high-supersonic single-stage-to-tether aircraft can be very efficient thanks to not carrying very much fuel. With Lyft's cabin design, each PLB can lift up to 45 OrbitLyft cars or 250 tons of cargo to orbit. 

Each PLB is expected to cost an average of $350 million, since the equipment onboard is actually quite boring (SBSP receiver for electrodynamic reboost, an enormous winch, and a gigantic Moon-sourced lump of rock (approx. 10,000 tons) or equivalent thereof). Lyft plans to acquire a constellation of 36 of these PLBs flying in both prograde and retrograde orbits at relatively low inclination, allowing for frequent trans-Pacific and trans-Atlantic tether catch opportunities (in the LA area, approximately one every 30 minutes, for example). The PLB's mean orbital velocity is 7.2km/s, for a LA-to-Sydney trip time of approximately 30 minutes on the tether, or 20 minutes LA-to-London.

Supersonic SSTT
------------------

The supersonic carrier aircraft for the OrbitLyft system will be built by a consortium of NGAS and Montgomery Aviation Group, using the Lyft Solarliner capture architecture with a warmed-over version of NGAS's Tetherliner that can only achieve the Mach 3.5 velocities needed to reach the second generation PLB tethers. These SSTTs will use hydrocarbon fuels, which is expected to cause friction with environmentalists as their carbon footprint is higher than the Solarliners, but the companies in conjunction with Starlight Systems do have an (eventual) solution to this problem.

The SSTTs, called Tetherliner Lyfts, will be able to carry an (unpressurized) passenger module of 100 people to the SSTT pickup point, and will be able to capture an identical module and carry it to a velocity where its onboard SkyLyft cars can fly on their own. The aircraft will then be refuelled midair from a Solarliner (to reduce operational costs, landing slots are expensive and the Tetherliners have tiny fuel tanks), and repeat the mission. Each will cost around $300 million and Lyft plans to operate 45.

OrbitLyft
--------------

The SkyLyft Long Distance concept has SkyLyft cars picking you up at your house, flying to a mothership, which then takes you to your destination (without disembarkation) and you then are flown to the doorstep of your final destination by the same SkyLyft car you started the day in. As a result of this system, overall transit times are reduced hugely and convenience is huge, as there is no waiting in line or annoying checks to go through, with a simple and very cheap ride just a cellphone app press away. Lyft wants to take this same operational concept to their LEO operations.

Just as with the SkyLyft Long Distance system, rides aboard OrbitLyft will begin and end with a SkyLyft car arriving on your doorstep and dropping you off at your final destination (with a potential stopoff at a customs location). However, they will be much, much faster, and will use a different SkyLyft (called OrbitLyft) car design.

Most importantly, to enable shuffling of passenger vehicles on the PLB between drop-off locations, the OrbitLyft cars will maintain their own pressurization systems, though emergency reentry thermal protection will be a function of the payload modules. This enables the PLB to shuffle around which OrbitLyft goes where, allowing a single SSTT boost to launch passengers to a wide range of destinations (though inclination changes to accomplish trans-PLB operations are not part of this ability, at this time). The OrbitLyft vehicles will also have much less window area than the SkyLyft vehicles as a result.

To reduce wasted mass, the ticketing scheme will be made more aggressive and a new, smaller, 2 person car design will be introduced for business travellers at higher cost. Most passengers will ""airpool"" for the OrbitLyft, with up to 8 people sharing a car. It is expected that OrbitLyft pricing will be better than long-range trips aboard SolarLiners, as the mechanical wear on the system as a whole is drastically reduced.

Roll-Out
----------

The OrbitLyft system will be rolled across the CF, and Kamino as a first trial of the approach, dropping you at your destination within 30 to 40 minutes of departure from your own home, even for far flung destinations like Guam, the Marshall Islands, and Honolulu when starting from Las Vegas. Trips to LEO destinations are also planned, with the possibility of transferring to more far flung destinations once there. Lyft plans to invest a further $35 billion into the new technology over the next 8 years, with the first PLB and associated Tetherliners entering service in 4 years, after $10 billion in R&amp;D, followed by $25 billion in procurement of the fleet of PLBs and Tetherliners.

The company thinks that it can provide overall trip times less than half that of their competition, and pricing up to 80% cheaper thanks to utter lack of air resistance, no airport fees, very low personnel costs, and finally conservation of momentum. Thanks to the economies inherent to the system, OrbitLyft hails are extremely cheap and independent of destination, with a price of $140 to anywhere covered by the system. Costs to orbit are higher, as the mass going up needs to be balanced, with an expected ticket cost of approximately $250. 

SkyLyft Long Distance will remain a service, covering distances too short to be economical under OrbitLyft (e.g. LA to SF, LA to LV, Honolulu to Hilo). However, OrbitLyft is predicted to reduce pressure on the notoriously-oversubscribed SkyLyft system freeing up SkyLyft long distance Solarliners for intermediate distance travel.",True,False,False,worldpowers,t5_30yfr,,,restricted,top,self,,,[TECH] OrbitLyft: 45 Minutes From Door to Door,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/7xch5p/tech_orbitlyft_45_minutes_from_door_to_door/,all_ads,,True,,,,,

It was wider than the *Maizer*’s and accommodated multiple rows of stations for the Human officers. At the head of it all was an oversized seat, occupied by the tall Human Commander. She manipulated the floating controls with practiced ease while the alien script flashed unintelligible warning and reports, echoed across every other screen in the room.

“FTL event detected, Commander,” a man shouted. “Fleet scale Alcubierre drives, tentative rating of class four!”

“Tch,” Madsen scoffed. “Took them long enough. Bridge Lieutenant Walker, confirm retrieval of all boarding craft!”

“All ships accounted for; hangar bays are sealed, Commander!”

The woman expanded a three-dimensional battlescape in front of her console, rotating it peculiarly to place the *Gheist* “above” the Ja’ak fleet. It was then that she noticed Taran nearby and motioned for him to take a seat opposite the First Lieutenant, who was either managing his temper or hadn’t noticed the gesture.

“Let us see,” she muttered to the Vall Soldier, “how much they’ll bleed before their courage falters.”

The *Gheist*’s lights dimmed then, and an officer announced they had reengaged the stealth systems. A quiet descended upon the Interstellar Navy’s scout craft as the seconds ticked onward. Madsen nudged the controls to give the *Maizer* a healthy berth as it drifted peacefully across the star field, waiting to deceive their enemy.

The stars bent, a million lights stretching to a dark point that folded in on itself. Then it *moved*, and the Ja’ak fleet appeared in all of its terrible glory. Each ship was formed from bulbous and segmented pods, joined together by blade-like protrusions along with the “main mast” they were built around. Banners and golden spires gilded the largest vessels, while others were dressed in the trophies of ships they’d defeated.

“Open channel detected,” another Human announced. “They should have received our pre-recorded warning by now, but the xenological communication is uninterceptible at our current deviation from point of origin. Should we tap into the Maizer’s systems, Flight Commander?”

“Negative, Lieutenant. We can’t risk them detecting any emissions from our *Gheist*.”

After a brief hesitation, the Ja’ak fleet adjusted their formation to correct for shift-disruption before accelerating. The largest ships began to twist, their sides opening to expose deadly arsenals. “Those are the carriers,” Taran growled. “They’re launching boarding spikes.”

Red flares burst forward, homing in on the Vall ship. Despite the vast distance, they closed quickly, their surfaces blurring as inertial negation fields were supercharged before impact. The first salvo struck, burying themselves into the wide upper deck before deploying their surface guns. It wasn’t necessary though; the *Maizer* had no point defense weapons to defend itself with. 

“Parasites anchored, Commander. Our reconnaissance drones will begin omnidirectional transmission in three… two.... one.”

A kaleidoscope of images plastered half of the bridge, each showing a different part of the *Maizer*. Swarms of Ja’ak were navigating the cramped hallways in the heavy armor that obscured their leathery hides, searching for the Vall that had mysteriously disappeared from the ship.

“Transmission at point-oh-oh-one percent loss. The Ja’ak fleet should be receiving loud and clear,” a woman reported with a hint of amusement. “Local jamming complete as well. The Ja’ak have been cut off from their troops.”

“Quite the elaborate trap, Commander Madsen,” Taran praised with an appreciative click. “All they can do is watch.”

The Human bowed her head. “Thank you, Soldier-Taran, but the credit must go to my First Lieutenant. It was his idea to, as we say, give their fleet ‘front row seats.’” 

Lieutenant Baker pushed his jaw outwards without turning to the Vall, who eyed him with interest. Something about the sadistic nature of the plan seemed to fit the male Human, Taran thought.

The Commander swiped her hands across the controls, bringing up a waveform. The Ja’ak’s alien dialect reverberated the air in the bridge, and Taran instinctively bared his fangs at the sound. “They think the ship was a decoy,” Madsen translated, “but they’re still planning to scuttle it.”

The officers on the Human bridge turned their attention to the camera feed as the Ja’ak slowed. Their hulking shapes filled the wide hallways, an imposing sight even with their guard down. Others still kept their rifles leveled as they checked and double-checked side rooms and maintenance halls, but none could find a Vall in sight.

But they were not alone. A black form lowed itself to the floor, silent amongst the Ja’ak’s pneumatic hissing and the aching groans of the *Maizer*’s impaled hull. It had been completely invisible moments before, even to the multi-spectrum sensors the Ja’ak carried, but they reacted to its presence now. Taran heard the barked orders as the boarders turned to face the mysterious figure with supernatural agility. They stared in confusion at the thing, unlike any mechanical warrior the Vall had attempted to fight them with, before they decided on their primary response to an unknown threat: fire.

The Human raised their hand, from which a perfect circle spread across the width of the hall. It was perfectly black, without any discernible features or imperfections, unlike any shield the Vall Soldier had seen.

But then, as the first of the Ja’ak’s rifles spat a hypersonic slug towards the Human, the twin revealed themself behind the boarders. They raised their hand as well to deploy a similar shield, only now neither of them were that depth-less dark color, but what looked like mirror images of the other.

A dozen Ja’ak railguns opened up inside the *Maizer*, a deadly arsenal racing towards the Humans. It was enough to overwhelm any defense the Vall could’ve hoped to erect in time and kill the Soldiers in their armor. But none of it reached the Human.

The Ja’ak screamed as their own weapons began to slaughter them. The endless tunnel was filled with a storm of kinetic penetrators that pierced them again and again, filling the hall with gore as their bodies were torn apart. Helmets were turned inside out, torsos imploded, arms were violently torn away. It took seconds for the Ja’ak to cut themselves down.

The Skinsuits deactivated the portals and the slugs bounced harmlessly off of them.

“Reactor,” one breathed.

“Bridge,” the other replied, and they turned away and sprinted down the hall, leaving the corpses without a second glance.

“We lost more than lives to the Inga,” Madsen said quietly, bringing the wide-eyed Vall back to reality. “So much of our history, our science, our power was consumed by their lust for destruction. The technology that went into those suits… it could take a thousand years for us to master it again.”

The Marines closed in on their respective targets, their unsuspecting prey trying with increasing panic to contact the group lying in pieces amidships. The one heading for the reactor was the first to engage, jumping over the Ja’ak and dropping an unassuming sphere in the middle of them while mid-air. None of the armored aliens noticed the Human nor the bio-bomb that went off a moment later. Their deaths were soundless except for the clatter of empty armor against the deck.

The other was less discreet, unsheathing a plain-looking knife to bisect the nearest Ja’ak. Even aided by their exoskeletons, they were worse than sluggish trying to react to the black blur. The Human soldier spun and decapitated their foe, took the rifle from his hand and shoved it through the breastplate of another. The knife jackhammered into the back of a Ja’ak, rupturing every vital organ in his body so quickly that the knife came away unbloodied.

Bullets started to fly, but none of them could line their aim up with the Human, who kicked through the faceplate of one and jammed the knife up to the haft in another’s throat. The explosive slugs detonated around the room, killing some of their own, before the Human finished the fight by throwing the knife through the remaining enemy.

The Skinsuit effortlessly retrieved their knife from the bulkhead and became invisible once more.

“Half of the xenological threat has been neutralized, Commander,” an officer reported. “No casualties to Interstellar Navy forces.”

Taran felt an uncontrollable shiver run down his spine as he watched the Skinsuits fight with abandon. He’d killed Ja’ak before. He understood how that death, that visceral demise could appeal to a Soldier’s primal anger. He remembered the universal expression of horror as the life left their eyes, he knew that the times he was most alive were when he was locked in that mortal moment. 

But this was something else. Something worse, crueler, harsher, something beyond hatred and bordering on evil. 

Taran watched the electrified claws of the Human sink into armor and incinerate a Ja’ak, suit and all. He watched an anti-material baton pass through armor and flesh with a horrendous buzz, bifurcating the trooper. He watched the Skinsuit’s arm extend down the length of the hall, piercing a fleeing soldier, the scraps of the corpse’s heart in hand. He watched one of them warp, reappearing where one Ja’ak had stood in a shower of gore. He watched the Human lift their pistol and lazily empty the magazine into the chest of a boarder who'd surrendered. 

It was only when the Skinsuit infantry dropped the head of the last of them that Taran turned away. Madsen, he realized, had paled beside him. 

The work of their immortals fazed even the Humans.

“Enemy casualties are total, Flight Commander,” the Marines’ cold voices echoed over the speakers. “Mission objectives are complete.”

Madsen steeled herself with a grim smile. “Acknowledged. Communications, hail their fleet. Let’s see if they'll ignore us a second time.”

There was a pause that stretched uncomfortably long. “R-repeating hail on all authorized frequencies,” the younger communication officer said. Still, no response came. 

“Pick up, pick up,” Commander Madsen muttered to herself. “Don't get shy on me.”

“Two-way connection stabilized; translating now!” an officer triumphantly declared. 

The bridge was filled with the image of a battle-scarred Ja’ak, his chest adorned with medals and trophies. It was a rare opportunity to see a “naked” Ja’ak for the Vall Soldier. Their armor hid their hairless hides and diminutive tails, their six-fingered hands, and the second set of spindly arms below the muscular trunks of their dominant pair. Taran could see fury in all six the hunter’s almost completely black eyes. 

“Who… are… you,” he growled slowly, fingers tense where he gripped his armrest. 

The Human female crossed her legs. “I am Flight Commander Madsen of the Interstellar Navy,” she answered sharply. “By attacking a vessel under our protection, your fleet has been marked as hostile and your species as a Class C threat. You and your fleet are to leave this system immediately, or your safety cannot be guaranteed.”

The Ja’ak snarled. “I am Hakor, Fleetmaster of the seventy-second Crusade and Captain of a *Justiciar* class battleship! You dare threaten me, Commander?” He spat an unintelligible oath before glaring at the screen again. “I refuse to speak to an enemy that cowers in the darkness. Don’t imagine we can’t target you either; you were foolish enough to open a comm channel and give away your position.”

Madsen flicked her hand towards one of the officers. “Lieutenant Wilkes, vent radiators and drop EM cloaking. Redirect power to screens.”

“Yes, Commander,” the man replied without hesitation.

All of Hakor’s eyes blinked simultaneously. “A single ship?” he scoffed. “Of negligible tonnage. Did you think you could bluff your way to victory, *Commander Madsen?*”

“Over two hundred and sixty of your soldiers are dead on that ship, Fleetmaster,” Madsen replied coolly. “You saw just as well as I did that they were completely outclassed. Do you want to risk your fleet on those same odds?”

“We expect casualties in the tens of *thousands* daily, child,” the Ja’ak shouted in hacking laughter. “You boast in killing less than three hundred? That’s a *rounding error*.” He leaned forward and grinned. “For coming to the assistance of those wretched blasphemers, you and all your people's’ lives are forfeit. You have doomed yourselves.”

Madsen raised an eyebrow at the remark before locking herself in the seat. “Fleetmaster Hakor,” she sighed before running a hand down her mussed hair, “I’d advise against making such grandiose statements in the future.”

Hakor shook his head in what Taran imagined was confused disgust. “For the sake of the completeness of our records,” he seethed, “what do you call yourselves?”

“We’re Humans, you genocidal bastard,” Madsen replied with a note of finality, reaching out to her control panel. “Weapons, full power to defensive arrays! I want our lasers pre-cooled and an emergency jump calculated. Communications,” she said, turning to address the officer, “prepare a distress call to the *Horizon* and keep your finger on the trigger.”

The Ja’ak Fleetmaster disappeared with a bark of laughter and their fleet turned towards the *Gheist*. The lighting on the bridge turned red as hundreds of vectors appeared, all of them homing in on the Human ship.

“Incoming kinetic penetrators,” the ship’s computer notified. “Salvo’s calculated energy insufficient to overwhelm screens.”

“Ready our missile tubes,” Madsen ordered. “Computer, can we identify their flagship?”

“Negative, Commander. There are numerous *Justiciar* class battleships in the hostile fleet. Insufficient data is available to isolate the flagship amongst these vessels.”

Flight Commander Madsen huffed. “Fine. Weapons, target their carriers and await my signal to fire.”

“Aye, Commander!”

The Ja’ak’s destroyers finally attacked, firing a massive barrage of missiles, each of which was capable of crippling a Vall capital ship. The weapons coordinated with each other, moving erratically in a swarm of shifting size and depth. The starfield shimmered as beams were scattered in front of the ship’s prow, bathing the Human craft in harmless light.

“Computer, analyze enemy missiles,” Commander Madsen ordered, ignoring the lasers. 

There was a beat before the soft voice replied. “Analysis complete. *Negligible* armor detected. Weapons are capable of *negligible* evasive agility. Weapons are capable of *escapable* acceleration. Weapons possess *negligible* electronic countermeasures. Weapons possess *negligible* sensor capability. Weapons do *not* possess Pattern-A screens. Weapons do *not* possess Pattern-B screens. Weapons do *not* possess Pattern-C screens. Weapons do *not* possess Patt-”

“That’s enough,” Madsen interrupted. “Engage standard point defense measures.”

The hull reverberated as thunderous firepower raced towards the missiles, slamming home without error with enough force to vaporize the targets. Even filtered, the atomic fireballs were painful to look at, blocking out the *Gheist*’s view of the Ja’ak fleet. The Humans’ own lasers, visualized by the bridge’s displays, swept across space in bursts, turning the rest of the Ja’ak’s missiles into so much molten metal.

“Our turn,” Madsen said with a twinge of malice. “Empty missile magazines.”

A shrieking choir split the air as the tell-tale blue light of Human propulsion pushed the missiles to speeds Taran could scarcely believe. Where the Ja’ak missiles had taken a minute to cross half the distance between the fleet and the *Gheist*, the Human missiles impacted their targets in seconds. The sheer kinetic force tore the carriers half apart before the warheads atomized what remained, the carriers’ own atmospheres conducting a shockwave that sent shrapnel through their smaller escorts.

The flames were quickly choked out on all eight wrecked carriers. It was a swift and deadly blow on a magnitude that the Vall had only matched at the peak of their strength and at a great loss. The *Gheist*, a mere gunship, had pulled it off almost effortlessly.

Violent impacts against a wall that only appeared for a brief moment signaled the arrival of the Ja’ak’s rail fire, unavoidable spreads of super-dense metal rods that could tear through armored plate. The Human ship’s thrusters fired rapidly, attempting to mitigate the damage, but there was little that could be done against capital-class railguns at this range.

“Screen strength at forty-two percent and rising,” an officer reported, twisting in her seat to address the Commander. “Survival against another barrage like that is unlikely.”

“Hail them again, Lieutenant,” Madsen ordered. “Give them a final chance.”

Taran heard the First Lieutenant’s disgruntled sigh, but the man did not voice any opposition to the Commander. The bridge drew a collective breath as the moment stretched on, watching the distant Ja’ak fleet maneuver away from their fallen allies. No lasers splashed across their shields and no alarms warned of incoming missiles. Taran began to wonder if the Ja’ak fleet had been so easily thrown into disarray…

“Connection established!” the young officer reported, and Fleetmaster Hakor reappeared.

“You have earned my ire, Human,” he whispered, “but not my respect. You think you can cow us with such a display? A thousand more carriers will replace those obsolete hulks! Even in this quadrant, there are over two hundred in just our *reserves*. A combined force three times my own Crusade is but a half-day’s jump away! The Ja’ak do not know the taste of defeat because victory is our holy *right!*”

Commander Madsen was unimpressed. “Then consider us your teachers, Fleetmaster. We took our wars to the stars before you had invented your first language. We are precursors, the oldest of species in this and many other galaxies. Even I, Fleetmaster, have lived long enough to see empires rise and fall. It is no boast when I say that your war will be folly. I extend to you a final warning and a chance for peace. Spare the lives of your warriors, or their deaths will be in vain.”

The Ja’ak roared a word that the computer simply translated as “Insolence!” before the communication was terminated. Alarms blared again as another volley of rails were flung towards the Human ship in a shotgun spread, lighting up the bridge with their innumerable trajectories.

Yet no order to escape came from the Human commander. Taran looked back to where the *Maizer* drifted. If they escaped now, they would survive… at the cost of the Vall ship.

But that didn’t matter now. He wouldn’t ask the Humans to needlessly put their lives at risk any more than they already had. “Commander,” he said, resigned. “Do not concern yourself with the fate of our ship. We are willing to deal with your Captain.”

Taran saw the corner of her lips tug upwards. “Soldier-Taran,” she chided, “I promised to save your ship, and I intend to make good on that.” She folded her hands in front of her, letting the command chair’s holographic controls flash out of existence. “Comms,” she barked, “send the SOS.”

“Commander Madsen,” Taran pressed, “the *Gheist* cannot take a second hit. Your Captain will arrive at our graves!”

“Then you and Hakor will learn the same lesson,” she said mildly. “Human FTL is instantaneous.”

“Stardrifter-class battlecruiser detected, Commander,” the navigations officer reported, turning in his seat. “It’s the *Horizon*!”

A dark ring, not unlike the portals the Skinsuits had used, blocked out an entire galactic arm from sight. From that perfect blackness, the hull of a gargantuan warship emerged. Its size defied all reason; the single ship took more space than all of the thinly-spread Ja’ak fleet. It was roughly triangular and nearly twice as wide as it was long. Like the *Gheist*, the Stardrifter’s hull was featureless, save for the engorged “spine” of the ship.

On the bridge, a stream of information covered one half of the battlespace, including the ship’s full identification: “Mark Four [Standardized] ‘A-3 Class’ Battlecruiser, Stardrifter-series, Hull Number 0187C, ‘*Horizon*’”

The holographic display shifted to show another woman, though she wore no uniform like any Taran had seen. “Flight Commander Madsen,” she said cheerfully, “you seem to be in a spot of trouble. Again.”

“Your observations are as astute as ever, Seebee,” Madsen drawled before tilting her chin upwards towards the ceiling. “Computer, transfer ship’s log to artificial intelligence CB-one-oh-eight. Include tactical data.”

“Got it,” the woman said a heartbeat later. “Ooh, you’ve been busy, Commander. And you only gave the Ja’ak a Class C rating, how touching.” She shrugged, turned on her heel, and said in a chillingly emotionless voice, “Very well. Terminating singularity and engaging hostile fleet.” 

Taran had just enough time to realize the “woman” was a Human gestalt before the impossible happened. A thunderclap shook the *Gheist* as the dark ring collapsed into nonexistence, like a deep roar that echoed through the gunship’s halls. Around them, the starlight bent as the physics-defying shockwave stretched onto infinity.

“Kinetic bombardment impact in twenty seconds,” the computer gently warned.

The surface of the *Horizon* glowed. Lances of fire sliced in front of the *Gheist*, and one by one the vectors of the Ja’ak’s projectiles blinked out. The gunship’s own weapons joined in, sniping individual slugs and clouds of shards. As suddenly as it had appeared, the salvo had vanished.

“Point defense lasers offline. Commencing counterattack,” Seebee declared.

The Stardrifter’s hull crawled as millions of weapons were revealed, dividing the Ja’ak fleet evenly amongst themselves. All at once, they opened fire, and the space between lit up as bright as the sun. Warships folded in on themselves, missiles larger than their targets annihilated entire sub-fleets, and beams cut through battleship plate like wet paper. No defense the Ja'ak had could survive the onslaught.

“Enemy fleet attempting to escape,” the gestalt said. “Interdicting.”

Rays of light shot out from the Stardrifter in every direction, splitting like fractals to form a web around both the Human and Ja’ak ships as half of the remaining Ja’ak ships blurred, their shift-drives accelerated them past the speed of light. One after the other, they slammed into the bubble, scattering what dust remained against the survivor’s shields.

The largest ships in the Ja’ak fleet remained, huddled together in tight formation. Their overlapping shields were barely holding on against the apocalyptic firepower, a feat impressive enough to give the Human AI pause. The Stardrifter’s weapons fell silent as wreckage from its prey splashed against its screen.

Seebee twitched. “Powering down secondary weapon systems. Captain Volkov has authorized use of our Gategun.”

The Human battlecruiser’s hull transformed again, assuming its sleek form. The trapped Ja’ak ships waited, unable to run, unable to fight. Taran wondered if they were desperately hailing the nightmarish warship as the Vall had once done.

“Safeties off. Firing,” came Seebee’s hollow voice.

For the third time, a black disk stretched into existence, though nowhere near the size of the moon-sized *thing* whose demise echoed across a soundless sea. Every Human on the bridge turned away from their controls, waiting for the finishing blow.

Light coalesced within the black singularity.

“Behold,” the Commander reverently whispered, “our *Excalibur*.”

The singularity collapsed, and every ship that remained of the Ja’ak fleet disappeared. From where the singularity had been only a moment before, a path grew bright with nuclear sunshine. The radiant line stretched far beyond the interdiction web, streaking away until it crossed paths with a local moon. The crust shattered, ejecting a continent’s worth of dirt and dust into space while the surface burned red.

And still the light raced onward, blazing off into deep space.

“A network of singularities built around a series of coilguns. The projectile is carefully accelerated to the speed of light before it is finally fired at the target. Velocity alone provides enough energy to initiate nuclear fusion with whatever - or whoever - is in its path,” Seebee said, the gestalt’s avatar still staring at the glassy trough the slug had carved. “It’s rather simple, really. I find it amusing that nothing else can match its brutal power.”

Seebee turned to look straight at Taran. “Many of our discoveries were lost in the war against our mortal foe, but the Gategun was not amongst them. Don’t forget what you have seen today, Vall Soldier.” Her attention shifted to Commander Madsen. “All threats to reconnaissance unit zero-zero-eight-two-nine-dash-seven eliminated. I am returning control of the *Horizon* to my retainer.”

The avatar flickered out of existence, quickly replaced by a Human in a battle dress similar to Commander Madsen’s. The man possessed an almost regal countenance, perhaps from the broadness of his shoulders or his veteran’s eyes. He stood like a pillar, hands clasped behind his back as his stern gaze locked onto the female officer rising to attention.

“Captain!” she said, snapping her flat-handed salute. “Flight Commander Madsen, presenting mission report. Ship’s systems are running nominal and all hands are accounted for. *Hummingbird* missile stocks were depleted in an engagement with a hostile xenological fleet at oh-one-hundred-”

“Cut the formalities, Commander,” the man said gruffly. “I want you to explain the cargo you have aboard your ship.”

Madsen’s throat twitched almost imperceptibly. “Yessir. Roughly five hours ago, a foreign vessel performed an Alcubierre transfer to this system and moved to a near-intercept course with this ship. There is no evidence that they knew we were here until they were within critical proximity.”

“They call themselves the Vall,” she continued. “Cultural history is limited, but they are an explorer-type species. They have recently lost an extinction war against the Ja’ak, the same that attacked us. I ordered an evacuation of the Vall ship after learning that the aggressors preferred to board their targets rather than outright destroy them.”

“Is that why you deployed your Skinsuit infantry, Commander?” Captain Volkov growled. “Practically unarmed against a force whose capabilities were completely unknown, to protect a *xeno* ship?”

“My reasons were threefold, Captain,” Madsen said quickly, holding the man’s stare. “The first being that I would not compromise my mission objectives by ferrying refugees to the nearest habitable planet, which meant that their ship had to remain functional. Secondly, I would not deploy regular Marines against the Ja'ak for the very reasons you mentioned. And finally,” she said, glancing at Lieutenant Baker, “I wanted to send a message.”

Taran watched the Captain carefully, but his demeanor was utterly unreadable. The effect was far more unnerving than if he'd simply been angry. Even when he spoke, it was perfectly neutral. “That leaves the issue of you guaranteeing assistance to a xenological faction not formally allied to the Interplanetary Navy.”

Commander Madsen shifted in her seat. “My actions fell within protocol, sir. The Vall refugees were a non-threat, kept under careful guard, and were cooperative and helpful. Considering the Ja’ak are only a Class C hostile species, it would be protocol to accept if they surrendered. In that case, the Vall would be a strategic asset; their insight could prove quite useful in negotiations.”

“That may be the case,” Volkov replied quietly, “but the log shows that you rather conveniently assigned that designation only after you conducted the rescue operation.”

Taran felt a chill pass over the *Gheist*’s bridge. The Captain’s words were an accusation that hung in the air, waiting on a reply. Madsen’s chest rose and fell with conscious care while her superior’s expectant attention seemed to burn through the air. Her knuckles went white over the chair arm before she finally replied.

“Captain Volkov, do you disagree with my classification of the Ja’ak?”

Taran stared, his twin eyelids fluttering in surprise at her audacity. First Lieutenant visibly recoiled, his mouth open to utter a silent protest. The Flight Commander’s challenge was without impudence or disrespect, but a challenge it remained. Even amongst the Vall, such an act merited punishment that ranged from the stripping of honors to a trial for treason. The Soldier didn’t dare imagine how the strict Humans would deal with such usurpation.

The *Horizon*’s Captain turned away, his jaw tight, and Taran feared for the worst. Regret, pity, and fear roiled within him. He admired the female’s pride and the benevolence that few of her kind shared, so the prospect of her facing retribution for it pained him all the more. His tail flicked behind him as Volkov’s lips parted again, surely to condemn her for stepping so far out of line…

And then he laughed. It was short and harsh, but it was unmistakably a bark of laughter. “Flight Commander Madsen, your boldness never fails to surprise me,” he remarked, his humor faded save for the twinge at the corner of his lip. “After our brief fight, I would agree with your assessment. I will not throw away the opportunity you have provided, though I’d encourage less reckless behavior in the future.”

Commander Madsen quietly exhaled. “Of course, Captain.”

“Offload the Vall as quickly as possible and send them on their way,” he ordered. “The fleet will be moving to deal with the rest of the Ja’ak soon and I want all of the Horizon’s gunships fully armed by then. *Horizon* out.”

The avatar disappeared as the bridge came to life once again. Taran turned slowly as he stood, still in shock from what had transpired in so little time. Commander Madsen took the briefest of moments to collect herself before issuing a stream of orders. The Gheist swung about and moved closer to the *Maizer* again while the shuttles prepared to take aboard the Vall.

Taran found himself face to face with the Commander, who gave him a tired smile. “Perhaps it is clear now why I did not wish to involve the Stardrifter?” she asked.

He nodded silently. Soldiers weren’t known for their eloquence, but his muteness was more than stoicism. Heartless mutilation, the utter annihilation of the imdominable Ja’ak, the awesome power the Humans possessed… it left the old Vall without words to speak with.

“My officers need me here,” she pressed on. “And your people need you, Soldier-Taran. We’ve sent coordinates to your ship for a habitable planet not more than a day’s journey for you, but the Vall will not get there without a leader.”

She paused, her eyes darting away. “My own kind… we are not always as kind to strangers as we ought to be. There are few ‘*good Samaritans*’ - ah, but you wouldn’t know,” she trailed off with a rueful grin. “Well, regardless, I can say that we have always been stalwart defenders of our allies. One day, when you’ve rebuilt your civilization, I hope that it will hold true for you too.”

The Soldier nodded again, and both of them exchanged their native salutes. Madsen bade the Vall farewell as her First Lieutenant looked on, and then Taran was escorted off of the bridge.

“Taran!” a relieved Mag shouted when he finally arrived at the hangar. “The *Maizer* survived! *We* survived!” The junior Soldier turned back to usher the civilians onward and onto the transport. Their eyes were alight with joyous relief, from the oldest males to the youngest children.

Certain death had been upon them, and yet here they stood. Luck, chance, or a miracle, something had brought them to the Humans. Even if they really were the last of their kind, they would live on.

“We couldn’t watch what was going on from the hangar,” Mag continued, “only hear the battle. The whole ship shook from their weapons!” The Soldier followed Taran back aboard the shuttle, where they stretched upwards to grip handles built into the high ceiling. Others whispered amongst themselves, shooting curious and anxious glances at their eerily quiet leader.

“The fight was over so quickly. Did the Ja’ak agree to a ceasefire? How did the Humans barter with them?” Mag pressed.

“Look,” Taran finally said. The hangar bay opened up and the shuttle pushed itself away from the *Gheist*. Around them, the interdiction web was fading, letting unfiltered sunlight glitter against the cloud of splintered hull that was now drifting apart. There were a few barely recognizable carcasses of the Ja’ak battleships that still bled fuel and coolant into the great vacuum. Anything smaller than such a hulk had been reduced to dust and memory.

From one side of the shuttle, they saw a fiery moon. On the other, a beautiful and terrible warship whose mere presence hushed the gathered survivors.

“They’re gone,” Mag whispered. “Soldier-Taran, is that… is that the Human ship? The Stardrifter the Commander spoke of?”

“It is,” Taran replied. “The Ja’ak never stood a chance.”

The shape of the *Maizer* suddenly blocked their view, the ship’s hangar far more inviting than the first time they’d come aboard. The transports legs walked them in after landing, whirring under the passengers’ feet. They waited with bated breath as the atmosphere flooded back into wide berth; the smallest of them were barely able to stay still.

The doors opened, and two giants stood before them. Taran went stiff at the sight of the faceless monsters, the sounds of slaughter ringing in his ears. He was without a weapon, but he knew it wouldn’t have mattered anyways. Given the order, the Skinsuits could carve through them in seconds. They approached swiftly, each stride covering as much distance as four of a Vall’s. The civilians retreated instinctively from the aliens, who stopped just short of the Soldiers.

“Your uppermost deck has been hermetically sealed,” one said.

“And the bodies were disposed of,” the other finished cryptically.

As one, they moved to either side of the ramp, allowing the Vall to pass. They hesitated until Mag took the first step, waving for the others to follow. They stared at the motionless statues, muttering amongst themselves.

“Are they Humans?”

“That’s impossible, they must be machines.”

“How could only two repel the Ja’ak?”

Taran was the last to step onto the *Maizer*’s deck, welcoming the heat that radiated off of the deck. It was the last bit of home he had left, even if it-

A hand fell on his shoulder, stopping his heart. He turned slowly to see the Skinsuit infantry stooped over, its black faceplate filling his vision. Something alien, something cold touched his mind like a dagger against a throat, and with it came a dead voice:

*“Captain Volkov says: ‘Don’t forget, xeno.’”*

The Skinsuit snapped upright as Taran stumbled backwards. Still staring at the Soldier, the lithe creature followed its twin onto the transport. The invading chill receded from Taran’s mind as the shuttle doors closed, and Taran moved quickly for the airlock, running into Mag in his haste.

“Soldier-Taran,” he said, his tone concerned. “Are you alright?”

No, Taran wanted to reply. By the gods, he was not alright. But he saw that they were not alone, so he squared his shoulders and bit his tongue. “I’m fine,” he shuddered. “It’s just been… a lot to take in.”

Mag nodded. “Definitely,” he sighed, turning to look out of an observation report. “We owe much to the Humans. I’m not sure I feel comfortable owing such a debt.”

Taran looked too, watching hundreds of lights drawing near to the Stardrifter, all of them identical to the *Gheist* that now pulled away from the *Maizer*. The battlecruiser moved swifter than a ship of its size ought to, turning to project another massive portal.

“I wonder if the Humans and Vall will meet again,” Mag mused. “Not in our time, but maybe in future generations?”

The *Horizon*’s engines flared to life, pushing it through the nether of the portal and to distant stars beyond. “Perhaps we will, Soldier-Mag,” Taran whispered, watching the singularity collapse to a point.

“But I pray that we do not.”

Meanwhile, somewhere in space, something that looks like a black hole type thing, tears open, dangerously close to Earth and Mars, it is the Dark Sphere Seal breaking and it's immense shockwave causes a dimensional rift across the solar-system and the cosmic veil that hides the planets Eternia and Etheria to break, from this strange 'black hole' a super-massive planet-sized skull like creature with glowing red eyes emerges, the evil being is the Star-Reaper Enity, also known as Oblivion, a malevolent being older than time itself, the pure primal force of corruption and entropy that originally created Chaos and now finally freed from its ancient seal, it's nightmarish, apocalyptic  presence  is sensed by every living thing across the galaxy, both good and evil, all now know it as the enemy of all things, the ultimate enemy. The monstrous entity heads straight towards the Sun so it can devour all it's energy, constantly growing even bigger as it does. Passing near Earth as it does and in an act of intimidation swallows the Moon along the way, though it's not destroyed, Earth itself, as well as Eternia and Etheria are invaded by the sinister creatures called the Cult of Oblivion, who inhabit the Star-Reaper. For his own nefarious schemes, Skeletor investigates but he winds up being captured by the Cult of Oblivion, shadowy shape-shifting, demonic aliens with mind-reading abilities, who live within and worship Star-Reaper. She-Ra and Sailor Moon seek out Zodak, Sailor Galaxy, Princess Kakyu  and Horde Prime (who turns out to be another aspect of Chaos) to find clues about Sailor Eternia (the original Sailor Guardian, who's name was given to the planet Eternia in her honour, the horrifying truth about the Star-Reaper Entity/ Oblivion, the true source of all evil and it's connection to Chaos, all the Sailor Guardians including the Outer-Planet Guardians and Starlights, along side former enemies Alan, Ann and the Amazon Quartet etc., as well as joing forces with the Masters of the Universe and the Great Rebellion, they all fight the invading Cult of Oblivion, with unexpected editorial aid from  the Evil Horde led by Hordak against Horde Prime's orders, basically everyone can fight, regardless of power and strengh, good and evil must unite and fight for survival, for their very existence against the invaders. She-Ra takes the Sailor Guardians to Eternia and Castle Greyskull, the sight of which freaks out Sailor Moon. Where they meet the Masters of the Universe, Chibiusa and Orko quicky become friends, but suddenly Castle Greyskull is attacked when the Star-Reaper/ Oblivion launches an immense tentacle into Eternia's atmosphere which grabs and picks up Castle Greyskull like a pebble and it is taken, reluctantly She-Ra and Sailor Moon manage to escape  along with Chibi-Usa and Orko but everyone else is now trapped  within the Star-Reaper He-Man and Sailor Saturn, the strongest team members, both try to stop Star-Reaper but it's far too powerful for them to handle, snockingly in fact even Sailor Saturn's full abilities only seem to feed the Star-Reaper enity/ Oblivion and makes it even bigger and stronger, fortunately Sailor Saturn survives and in a vain attempt the Earth's governments launch all nuclear weapons at this monstrous entity, but all the missiles get eaten by the Star-Reaper/ Oblivion only this make things worse,. Meanwhile the Sailor Guardians, Venus, Mars, Mercury &amp; Jupiter as well as the recently awakened Sailor Earth (Naru Osaka, who was also Queen Beryl's daughter in her previous life, which was the tragic reason why Luna and Artemis decided not to awaken her up till now, realizing it would be cruel for her to remember the Silver Millennium), battle the demonic aliens, who take on the form of evil shadow duplicates of the Sailor Guardians, meanwhile Sailor Moon &amp; She-Ra confront the mysterious, nameless high-priest leader of the demonic aliens who morphs into a twisted image of Sailor Moon's old enemy Queen Beryl. But the sinister creature puts Sailor Moon into a deep nightmare state, trying to convince her she's in a coma and that her reality, everything she's ever done as Sailor Moon is nothing more than just dreams and wishful thinking of a very ordinary girl who is slowly dying, her friends and her 'Sailor Moon' persona represent aspects of her own personality trying to fight this terminal illness, while the Star-Reaper entity represents the last stages of that illness. Serina/Usagi then finds herself confronting an illusionary ghost of 'Sailor Moon' in a battle she can't win. Fortunately, She-Ra uses her empathy to enter Sailor Moon's nightmare and in this dream state, swap powers with each other, Serena/Usagi Chan becomes 'She-Ra' while Adora becomes 'Sailor Moon' foreshadowing the arrival of Sailor Eternia. Together they defeat a dark ghost version of Sailor Moon and the nightmare, which in turn weakens the priest. The priest is then wrapped in tendrils, as it's master, the Star-Reaper, who is mildly disappointed and no longer entertained, then absorbs and destroys the priest, much to Sailor Moon &amp; She-Ra's horror and disgust. this is the only glimpse we get of the aliens' true hideous appearance. Eventually Sailor Moon &amp; She-Ra discover that there are three keys that will awaken and restore Sailor Eternia, the Sword of Protection, the Silver Crystal and the Eternian Starseed, then they learn that within there own souls they Share two halves of Sailor Eternia's divided soul that was split in two when she last defeated and sealed the Star-Reaper and they are both Sailor Eternia. It's only then She-Ra and Sailor Moon combine their powers and fuse that the goddess-like Princess of Eternity, Sailor Eternia, Guardian of the Universe, is revealed... But when all hope seeming lost, the only way to finally defeat this powerful enemy is for Sailor Eternia, who weilds and her awsome Moon Cresent Staff-Blade-Staff of Universal Protection, to pierce the deadly Heart of Oblivion itself, at the Star-Reaper/ Oblivion's core, sacrificing herself again, just as she did during her previous battle with it, however this time, she's not fighting alone, Sailor Moon And She-Ra must draw upon all their experiance, and all their memories to save everyone, if Oblivion, is not defeted, it will consume every star in the galaxy and then the next Galaxy and the next until the entire Universe is gone, possibly even beyond, there's a few cute and funny moments when Sailor Eternia rescues Skeletor and she gives him a friendly, cheeky pat on his head which freaks him out and a little later when Sailor Moon accidentally causes Sailor Eternia an embarrassing misunderstanding, while held inside their combined tri-soul and personality, in one body, along with She-Ra, by asking She-Ra an awkward question as to why Eternia seems obsessed with skulls, refering to Skeletor and Castle Greyskull, as well as possibly the Star-Reaper/ Oblivion also, which She-Ra cannot answer, as she never thought about it, but the timing of this conversation causes Sailor Eternia lapses in consentration and confusion as her mind gets mixed up with Sailor Moon's and She-Ra's own thoughts and words as she's still getting used to her new, though temporary, body and shared consciousnes. There's tense moment between Sailor Galaxy and Sailor Eternia, Sailor Eternia slaps her former pupil hard across the face, furious and upset that Sailor Galaxy attempted to seal Chaos within herself but then gives her a heartfelt tearful hug, apologizing for not being there for her closest friend because of Oblivion and her death when she defeated it, which in turn triggered the Sailor Wars, meanwhile, in contrast, Chaos itself confronts its maker, the Star-Reaper in a very one-sided battle...",True,False,False,u_OwenWildChesireCat,t5_4bkr9,,,user,qa,self,,,SAILOR MOON &amp; SHE-RA: AWAKEN SAILOR ETERNIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_OwenWildChesireCat/comments/7x35dy/sailor_moon_shera_awaken_sailor_eternia/,,,False,,,,,

***The Flash 2*** (2021)

Our *Flash* sequel picks up right where *Suicide Squad* left off, with an escaped **Lenny Snart** (aka **Captain Cold**) teaming up with his new friend **""Boomerang""** and returning to Central City to rescue his old partners **Sam Scudder** and **Mark Mardon** (**Mirror Master** and **Weather Wizard**) from prison. Since the events of the first *Flash* movie, the three rogue scientists from the **Central City Future Institute** (by now just known as **""The Rogues""**) are long past their five minutes of fame, but they're itching to make a comeback with Boomerang's help. In a daring move, they attack a Central City prison transport carrying Scudder and Mardon and manage to spring them, then high-tail it to the highway in an armored Humvee. Inevitably, the Flash intervenes to stop their escape, leading to a high-speed chase on the Central City Freeway as the Rogues use every trick up their sleeve to slow him. Despite his best efforts, Barry ultimately falls for one of Mirror Master's hologram tricks and ends up chasing the wrong Humvee, and the villains narrowly manage to get away.

From a quick panorama of Central City, it becomes clear that the entire city absolutely *loves* the Flash, and they take great pride in his heroic deeds. Everywhere you look, ordinary people proudly display his red and gold colors, and even their resident baseball team (""The Central City Lightning"") wears his lighting bolt insignia as their official logo. Whenever he appears on the news, the people erupt in cheers.

Back at the Future Institute, Iris and her colleagues have all become close confidants of the Flash, and they've managed to construct a state-of-the-art race track for Barry to test his speed powers, effectively making the Institute his new base of operations. Iris and Barry's relationship has also progressed significantly, and they now share an apartment. As we get a closer look at the Institute, we get to meet a few more of its researchers, including a few familiar faces whom DC fans in the audience will likely recognize—like the microbiologist **Dr. Ray Palmer**, the chemist **Dr. Rex Mason**, the astronomer **Dr. Saul Erdel**, and the Institute's aging director **Dr. Theodore ""Ted"" Knight**. There's also an original character, **Dr. Carmine Solovar**, an experienced psychologist who wants to unlock the secrets of telepathy with the aid of an experimental helmet that interfaces with the wearer's brain waves; as part of his ongoing experiment, he's taken to using an adult silverback gorilla called **""Starlight""** as a live test subject.

*(Once again: if you're familiar with the Flash's rogues gallery, you can probably see where I'm going with this...)*

On a more personal front, Iris faces a family crisis as her older brother **Rudy West** faces a disintegrating marriage, leaving her teenage nephew **Wally West** caught between his constantly fighting parents. After one particularly fierce family argument, Wally secretly calls his aunt Iris for emotional support, and Iris offers to let him spend the Summer in Central City with her and Barry. As Wally moves into Barry's apartment for the Summer, Barry surprisingly finds himself bonding with the hapless teenager, and finds himself particularly moved when he realizes how much he looks up to the Flash. *""He can outrun anything, and he never looks back,""* Wally says during one conversation. *""Who wouldn't want to be like that?""*

In the following days and weeks, Wally regularly accompanies Iris to the Future Institute to help her out in the lab, and Iris tries to encourage his budding interest in science. But after catching a glimpse of the Flash's costume in a locker at the Institute, he deduces that the superhero might have *something* to do with the lab. In particular, he finds it a bit suspicious that the Future Institute's famous particle accelerator—which is now in a locked room—was shot down after a ""malfunction"" that happened the same week the Flash first appeared.

Meanwhile, as Solovar continues his experiments with Starlight the gorilla, it slowly becomes evident that the telepathic helmet has affected the ape more strongly than the scientists realize; while Solovar only hoped to use brainwaves to communicate with him, Starlight has developed full command of telepathy, and has now figured out how to use it to absorb information from the brains of the scientists who visit his enclosure. After months of telepathic experiments, he can now speak perfect English, and has become well-versed in most scientific disciplines—but he manages to conceal this from the scientists, who still treat him as a pet. One day, he finally seizes his opportunity and uses the helmet to send a burst of psychic energy into Solovar's brain, incapacitating him with a seizure. With his handler out of commission, he escapes into the streets of Central City with a rucksack full of stolen gadgetry.

The Flash intervenes to catch Starlight, leading to a wacky chase through the streets and over the rooftops, but ends up badly battered when he tries to physically subdue the gorilla. As news cameraman record the confrontation, the Rogues—who are hidden safely in their new hideout, watching the chase unfold on the evening news—laugh hysterically as they see their old foe beaten by a monkey. Picking himself up, Barry chases Starlight through labyrinthine tunnels beneath Central City, which conceal the hidden entrance to the city's power grid. Finally, when Barry confronts Starlight at the power grid and tries to call out his name, the gorilla finally demonstrates his grasp of English. *""No. Not Starlight. That was the name they gave me. I have my own name now. Call me* ***Grodd****.""* With that, he knocks Barry out with a stolen ray-gun, and uses the rest of his stolen gadgets to build a makeshift teleportation device linked directly to the Central City power grid; vanishing in a flash of energy, he escapes to parts unknown with the unconscious Flash in tow.

As soon as the people of the city realize that their beloved Flash has disappeared, mass panic reigns, and the scientists of the Future Institute instantly pool their resources together in a massive effort to find him. Finally, after tracking down Grodd's teleportation device, Iris is able to ascertain the distance that it sent him, and manages to pinpoint his probable location in a most unexpected place: **the highlands of Guatemala**. Using satellite imagery, they detect a massive surge of energy somewhere deep in highlands, and surmise that it is likely Grodd's handiwork. But as they debate over how to mount a rescue mission, the Rogues also catch wind of the Flash's disappearance; despite considering him a rival and an adversary, they fear for his safety, and resolve to do all they can to bring him home.

But no one takes the Flash's disappearance harder than Wally, who feels more powerless than ever now that his hero has vanished. With all the time that he spends with Iris, he easily deduces that her boyfriend Barry was the Flash all along, making him all the more determined to help save him. Striking off on his own, he hatches a daring plan to infiltrate the Institute's security archives, and finds video footage of the incident with the particle accelerator that gave Barry his powers. In an enormously risky gambit, he sneaks into the particle accelerator room and locks himself inside it, purposefully recreating the lab accident that gave Barry his powers the year before. Just like when Barry was trapped inside the accelerator, Wally feels his body being ripped apart at the subatomic level and nearly disintegrates in a flash of energy, but he musters enough willpower to keep himself anchored in the physical world. As he feels waves of energy course through his body's cells, Wally realizes that he has successfully acquired a fraction of the Flash's powers of super-speed. Finally, after finding one of Barry's spare costumes—one that's gold with red trim, instead of red with gold trim—he dons his own costume and dashes across America to rescue Barry.

Meanwhile in Guatemala, Grodd has established his own base of operations inside the remains of a Mayan stone temple, and now uses his arsenal of gadgets to erect a massive force field around his base, challenging any human interlopers to penetrate his defenses. As Barry awakens and futilely tries to escape the force field, Grodd subdues him with his psychic helmet, and makes it clear that he intends to experiment on him. *""You are of little concern to me. But that marvelous energy field that flows through you... I mean to have it for myself. Even if it kills you!""* Just in the nick of time, Wally manages to find Grodd's base in the ruins and prepares to charge him, but Grodd counterattacks with a swarm of homemade attack drones, forcing Wally to flee into the forests to shake them. But after dispatching the drones, he seizes a window of opportunity when Grodd briefly lowers the forcefield to launch more drones, allowing him to infiltrate the base and knock out Grodd's shield generator. As Wally and Barry square off with a ray-gun wielding Grodd, the Rogues finally arrive to lend a hand in Mardon's airship; Boomerang pitches in with a volley of exploding boomerangs, Snart attacks Grodd with his freeze-rays, Mardon levels his base with a well-placed tornado, and Scudder aids Barry and Wally by sending an army of holographic Flashes at Grodd.

It seems that the heroes have won...until Barry makes the mistake of tauntingly offering Grodd a *banana* if he calls off his plans for world domination. ***""I...HATE...BANANAS!""*** he roars, charging at Barry with all his might. But in his rage, he fails to notice the banana peel that Barry left in his path, and accidentally slips on it. *""You fell for the banana peel trick...""* Barry says. *""I thought that only worked in cartoons.""* As Grodd struggles to pick himself up, the Rogues close in, and Snart finally incapacitates him by freezing him with his ice-gun. With that, the Rogues pile back into their airship and fly home as Barry thanks them for their help and allows them to leave—but he warns them that he'll always be there if they ever cause trouble in Central City again.

*""If I catch you idiots robbing another bank, I'm putting the cuffs on you. Understand?""* Barry calls out. *""You had me at 'cuffs'!""* Snart calls back, winking. *""Oh, Mr. Flash! The rumors about you were true!""* Scudder jokingly yells. *""Yeah! Usually I've gotta wait until the third date for that!""* Mardon yells. *""Lenny, man... You've got some weird friends....""* Boomerang mutters.

Back in Central City, life goes back to normal, but with one small difference: Wally and his mother have now moved to the city, allowing Wally to stay close to his aunt year-round. Now that they live in the same town, Barry agrees to take Wally under his wing as an apprentice and side-kick, allowing him to join him in his adventures. And now that they realize his obvious danger, the scientists of the Future Institute swear to keep Grodd safely under lock and key in a psychic-proof enclose.

...But after the credits roll, the Future Institute receives a visit from **Lex Luthor**, who visits Grodd in his enclosure and offers him a gift. *""If it's a banana, I'll snap your neck...""* Grodd growls. To his pleasant surprise, Luthor instead offers him a bottle of champagne and a tin of caviar. As they sip champagne on opposite sides of the glass, Luthor tells Grodd that he's planning an ""exclusive social club"", and he wants Grodd to join. As Grodd listens, a wicked smile crosses his face.

Moments later, a security guard arrives to check on Grodd, and finds him sipping champagne and reading a Dostoevsky novel. Grodd just looks up at him and indignantly says *""What?""*

***Green Lantern 2*** (2022)

It's been around two years since Hal Jordan first joined the **Green Lantern Corps**, and he's swiftly gone from a raw recruit to a top-notch operative, earning the respect of Corpsmen from countless planets and species. In that time, Hal's closest comrades in the Corps—**Kilowog**, **Tomar-Re**, **Galius Zed** and **Salaak**—have gone from mere squadmates to true friends. Hal has dozens of successful missions under his belt, and his bond with his fellow Lanterns grows stronger with each one. But in spite of all that, Hal is haunted by the fact that he *still* has no idea who (or *what*) killed his predecessor **Abin Sur**; despite all that he has accomplished as a Green Lantern, he knows that he still owes everything to Sur, and he owes it to him to bring his killer to justice. Though few new clues have emerged, Hal fixates on one peculiar detail about Sur's last moments: he first met him in the Mojave Desert after his *spaceship* crashed there. While that didn't strike him as odd at the time, Hal now knows that a Green Lantern ring grants its bearer the ability to fly at light-speed while shielded from the vacuum of space; *nobody* in the Green Lantern Corps uses spaceships to get around.

Soon after, while responding to a distress signal in deep space, Hal finally stumbles upon a clue during a battle with the space pirate **Kanjar Ro** and his private fleet. He realizes that one of Kanjar's many stolen spaceships is of an identical make and model to the one that Abin Sur flew on his final mission, and theorizes that it may have come from the same source. Later, Hal ventures to the detention block on Oa to interrogate an imprisoned Kanjar for the source of his stolen ship, and manages to acquire the coordinates of the orbital shipyard where he hijacked it. Traveling to the shipyard, Hal presents the facility's administrator with a holographic picture of Abin Sur, and asks him if his face rings any bells. Overcome by emotion, the administrator admits that a mortally wounded Abin Sur came aboard his station around two years ago, and personally saved his life from a mysterious figure who he describes as ***""a black-eyed demon, wreathed in golden light""***. The administrator recalls that Sur refused medical care, but only asked to commandeer one of his spare spaceships, as his ring had been drained of power in his final battle. Hal asks the administrator if he has any idea where Sur might have gotten his mortal wound, and the administrator suggests that he investigate the nearest habitable planet: a remote mining world called **Qward**.

On the way to Qward, Hal passes dangerously close to **""The Black Veil""**, an infamous cluster of black holes that leaves an entire star system isolated from the rest of the galaxy, and is said to be impossible to navigate.

Qward turns out to be an utterly hellish planet of lifeless quarries and sinkholes, where the few inhabitants live in squalor and misery, tirelessly toiling in their mines to extract some strange glowing yellow ore from their planet's crust. When Hal attempts to interrogate a few of them, they run from him in fright when they see his Green Lantern ring, with one Qwardian screaming ***""He's one of them!""*** Though Hal manages to convince the Qwardians that he means them no harm, they still dodge his questions, claiming that they must never be distracted from their work...lest they incur the wrath of **""The Dark One""**, who demands their servitude. Hal presses on, determined to figure out who exactly ""The Dark One"" is—but he gets his answer soon afterwards, when a mysterious magenta-skinned alien descends from the sky, with a strange golden light emanating from a yellow ring that he wears on his finger. It seems that this nameless figure has returned to Qward to reap his monthly tribute in the strange yellow ore, which the enslaved Qwardians mine for him.

Hal attempts to stand his ground against the figure, but he's soundly defeated in the ensuing battle, as his Green Lantern ring proves to be no match for his adversary's yellow ring. As the battle rages, he can't quite shake the feeling that he's seen his enemy somewhere...

Grievously wounded, Hal is forced to flee into a deep canyon and hide from his enemy, finding himself paralyzed with fear. Forced to use the last of his ring's energy to heal himself, he can only watch helplessly as the man with the yellow ring kills one of the Qwardians to serve as an example to the others, and informs all in earshot that his monthly tribute has been *doubled*. With that, he departs from Qward, and Hal signals the Corps for help.

Hal's friends come to his aid, and he explains the situation to them. With the Guardians' blessing, they agree to stay on Qward to free the enslaved aliens, but Hal insists on finding the man with the yellow ring and bringing him to justice, now utterly convinced that *he* was the one who killed Abin Sur. Desperate for answers, Hal returns to Oa to scan all available files on Abin Sur. When he finds a hologram of Sur with his old partner, he suddenly realizes why the man with the yellow ring seemed so familiar: he's **Thaal Sinestro**, a Green Lantern who spent years as Abin Sur's partner, only to be declared Missing in Action after he mysteriously vanished. Though no one in the Corps knows exactly why Sinestro vanished, it's been said that he grew despondent after his home planet **Korugar** was cut off from the rest of the galaxy following the emergence of the Dark Veil.

As the pieces of the mystery begin to fall into place, Hal realizes that Sinestro must have gone into hiding after turning his back on the Green Lantern Corps, and he must have killed his old partner Abin Sur when he attempted to find him and bring him back. Further, he must have forced the Qwardians into slavery to supply him with a power source for his new yellow ring, which seems to be even more powerful than a Green Lantern ring. When he speculates on where Sinestro has been hiding all this time, Hal instantly realizes the answer: he went to hide on his home planet of Korugar, and he *created* the infamous ""Black Veil"" to ensure that no one could come looking for him.

But when Hal goes to the Guardians with his realizations, they're skeptical, refusing to believe that Thaal Sinestro—one of the most respected Lanterns of all time—could have turned against the Green Lantern Corps that he served so dutifully. Fearful that he might do something rash, they order him to stay on Oa until further notice. Frustrated, Hal goes to the robotic Green Lantern **Stel** for advice, and asks him to use his positronic brain to test his hypothesis on the Black Veil. Considering all possible variables, Stel concludes that it *is* indeed theoretically possible to create an artificial cluster of black holes, and that it's also theoretically possible to create a warp tunnel to serve as a ""back door"" for the seemingly impassible system of black holes, allowing someone to pass through it at regular intervals. When Hal asks him whether it might be possible to safely navigate the Veil from the front, Stel concludes that it *might* be possible if one flawlessly followed a safe route between black holes, but *""Odds of survival are approximately 3,720 to 1.""* Grinning roguishly, Hal replies, *""Never tell me the odds.""*

Defying the Guardians' orders, Hal sets out for Korugar to find Sinestro, determined to make it through the Black Veil with the help of Stel's calculations. In a gripping flight sequence, Hal is nearly torn apart by the gravitational forces of multiple black holes, but *barely* manages to make it through to the planet's surface, nearly passing out from exhaustion by the time he makes it there. When he does, he's greeted by yet another nightmarish scene: Korugar is a planet-sized city of endless concrete and steel, with every street patrolled by squads of Manhunter robots marching in lockstep, killing anyone who ventures out after sunset. When the Guardians weren't looking, the planet became a military dictatorship, ruled by the iron fist of Thaal Sinestro.

As Hal stumbles through the streets of Korugar, struggling to evade the patrolling squads of Manhunters, a local Korugarian woman named **Katma Tui** invites him into her home and gives him safe haven. Moments later, when a Manhunter patrol knocks on Katma's door for a ""routine home inspection"", she risks her life to hide Hal while she bluffs her way through the inspection. When the Manhunters are gone, Katma explains things: Thaal Sinestro was the first denizen of Korugar ever to be invited to join the legendary Green Lantern Corps, but he was corrupted by the awesome power of the Lantern; like all Green Lanterns, he was charged with maintaining law and order in his assigned sector, but he came to the conclusion that democracy and free will were unacceptable threats to law and order, and he chose to *rule* Korugar when he was no longer content with merely protecting it. Ever since, he has kept Korugar's citizens in line with his one-of-a-kind yellow power ring, and he uses an experimental gravity manipulation device to keep the planet shielded from outsiders by the Black Veil—ensuring that the Corps can't intervene in his affairs. But because his yellow ring is fueled by an unstable ore, he is forced to make regular trips back to Qward to retrieve more ore to recharge it.

Despite being exhausted by his flight through the Veil, Hal insists on striking off alone to challenge Sinestro, even if it kills him. When Katma tries to stop him, Hal defiantly tells her *""This was Abin Sur's last mission. I'm gonna finish what he started!""* As he limps off, Katma wishes him well.

In the climax, Hal squares off with Sinestro at his massive palace complex, where supplicants regularly gather to worship him. Again, Sinestro manages to outclass him with the raw power of his yellow ring, but Hal still lands a series of punishing blows before his severely drained ring finally runs out of power. In a frenetic ""cat and mouse"" sequence, Hal flees through the labyrinthine halls of the the palace while Sinestro chases him, and finally manages to sneak into Sinestro's personal chamber. There, he's greeted by a welcome sight: a Green Lantern power battery. Even though Sinestro turned his back on the Corps, he couldn't bear to let go of his Lantern, and he still keeps it in his chamber as a memento of his time with Abin Sur and the rest of the Corps. With the power battery, Hal triumphantly speaks the oath and recharges his ring, and turns the tide of the battle in spectacular fashion—just as Katma Tui and an army of rebels storm the palace with guns blazing, shooting at every Manhunter in their way.

With that, Hal destroys Sinestro's gravity device with one blast from his power ring. The Black Veil collapses, Hal collars Sinestro and takes him back to Oa to stand trial, and Katma's rebels celebrate the liberation of their world. As the Guardians praise him for his victory, Hal reflects on the dangers of becoming corrupted by power. If Korugar's guardian turned on the people that he swore to protect and became a dictator, could Earth's guardians—Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, the Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman—succumb to the same temptation?

After the credits roll, we rejoin Sinsestro as he languishes in an orbiting prison cell above Oa. Suddenly, he's greeted by the sight of a massive roaming spacecraft, which shuts down the machinery in his cell block with a single pulse of light. Drawing closer, the spacecraft begins to *speak* to him, and something deep within its layers of circuitry stirs and awakens.

***""I am the Brain Inter-Active Construct,""*** the spacecraft says. ***""I seek to bring order to a world sundered by chaos. Will you join me?""***

*""That depends, friend,""* Sinestro says. *""What do you propose to offer me in return?""*

As an answer, the living spacecraft extends a mechanical appendage and offers Sinestro a token of goodwill: a yellow power ring. Taking up his ring once again, Sinestro smiles as he telepathically tears down the door of his prison cell.

*""Where do we start?""* he asks.

***Superman Beyond*** (2023)

As we rejoin Superman following the events of *Justice League*, Superman finally learns from his father **Jor-El** about the fleet of Kryptonian refugee ships that **General Zod** attempted to lead away from Kypton before the planet was destroyed by **Darkseid**. Realizing that that there might be more surviving Kryptonians somewhere around Krypton's orbit, he resolves to make a pilgrimage back to his home planet to look for survivors.

""Wait!"", you might be saying. ""Isn't that just the plot of *Superman Returns* all over again?""

Well, you're half-right. Yes, Superman *is* returning to Krypton to find out if he's really the last of his kind, but there's a pretty crucial difference in this version: this time around, Superman just happens to have a buddy in the Green Lantern Corps who regularly makes interstellar voyages with ease, so he doesn't have to leave Earth behind for years while he makes the trip. And since we actually *saw* a fleet of Kryptonian refugees back in *Man of Steel*, we actually have reason to suspect that there really *are* survivors.

So Superman goes to Hal Jordan to tell him about his predicament, and asks him if he'd consider using his Green Lantern ring to help him make a trip to the ruins of Krypton. Hal gladly agrees to help him out, and encases both of them in a bubble of green energy for the trip to Krypton.

To his dismay, Superman finds out that the remains of Krypton are just as lifeless and empty as he feared, and he's overcome by emotion as he gets his first real look at the place where he was born. But when Hal uses his ring to scan the area, he finds traces of rocket fuel and unstable tachyon particles, indicating that a spaceship made a trip through Krypton's orbit in the recent past, and may have used an advanced device to make an inter-dimensional jump. As they ponder who might have been there before them, the heroes are suddenly ambushed by an advanced spaceship that seems to appear from nowhere, having been lying in wait in a pocket dimension all along. Together, Superman and Hal fight back, and Superman punches his way into the center of the spaceship, looking for its pilot.

To his surprise, the sole occupant of the ship is a grotesque green-skinned being with wires extending from its brain, and three glaring red lights in its forehead. As it turns its black eyes to bear on Superman, the being's voice emanates from every corner of the ship.

***""I am the Brain Inter-Active Construct,""*** it says. ***""You intrude on the pristine calm of a dead world. You bring chaos to a world of perfect order. You must not be allowed to leave.""***

Never one to go down without a fight, Superman fights back with his super strength and head vision when the Brain Inter-Active Construct—""**Brainiac**"" for short—attempts to set the ship's defense systems on him, while Hal attempts to force his way into the ship to aid him.

***""A live Kryptonian in perfect condition...""*** Brainiac says. ***""Yes... A fine addition to my menagerie. But you'll be taken alive, of course...""***

As Superman fights his way through the corridors of the ship, he's confronted with video screens showing live Kryptonians being vivisected on operating tables, and he realizes that Brainiac must have captured some of the surviving Kryptonians as they were attempting to escape to safety. Seething with rage, he finally confronts Brainiac in person and cripples his ship with a great blast of heat vision. Realizing that he's been outclassed, Brainiac summons another inter-dimensional vortex and attempts to make his escape. Pulled through the vortex, Superman finds himself tumbling through the vacuum of space, only to be saved by a bubble of green energy. Superman turns to thank Hal, but he finds that his rescuer *isn't* Hal—he's a green-skinned humanoid alien wearing a Green Lantern uniform.

Superman's rescuer introduces himself as **J'aayk J'onzzn** (""**Jake Johnson**""), the Green Lantern of Sector 2814, a native of the planet Mars.

*""Mars?""* Superman asks incredulously. *""But everybody knows there's no life on Mars... They've sent probes there!""*

*""They didn't look hard enough,""* J'aayk says. *""Get with the times, man... Where are you from, the 15th century?""*

*""The 21st, actually,""* Superman says.

*""Really?""* J'aayk asks. *""You're looking pretty spry for a 400 year-old man.""*

With that, Superman suddenly realizes that Brainiac's vortex sent him 400 years forward in time, leaving him stranded in the 25th century with no way back home.

J'aayk offers Superman a lift back to Earth, and Superman requests that he drop him off in Metropolis. As luck would have it, it turns out that J'aayk's base of operations on Earth is *in* Metropolis. As he returns to his old hometown, Superman finds it to be a sprawling megapolis of towering spires, neon billboards and soaring hovercrafts, nearly unrecognizable after four centuries of development. But when J'aykk drops Superman off at his headquarters, he's greeted by a most unexpected sight: a statue of *himself* towering over a massive base, fixed with a plaque reading *""Superman: Last Son of Krypton, Guiding Light of the Legion""*. It turns out that J'aayk is a member of **the Legion of Superheroes**, a massive interstellar peacekeeping force boasting over a hundred members from over a dozen planets; in the four hundred years since Superman seemingly vanished after embarking out on his voyage to Krypton, he has become revered as a legend by a new generation of superheroes, and the Legion was eventually founded to honor his memory and follow his example. Despite his costume, J'aayk doesn't initially realize who Superman is; in the 24th century, plenty of rookie superheroes have been known to wear the red and blue as a sign of their devotion to Superman, so J'aayk initially assumes that Superman is just another admirer. When Superman finally tells him the truth, J'aayk assumes that he's lying until he uses his ring to scan his physiology, and finds that he is indeed a Kryptonian.

Ecstatic at finally meeting the greatest superhero in human history, J'aayk introduces Superman to his closest friends in the Legion: the telekinetic **Cosmic Boy**, the telepathic **Saturn Girl**, the electrokinetic **Lightning Lad**, and **Stanley Stone**, an African-American man with cybernetic attachments who claims to be a descendent of Superman's old friend Victor Stone. After years of hearing legends about Superman's exploits, the members of the Legion react to his return like faithful Christians witnessing the Second Coming. And as he receives a hero's welcome at Legion headquarters, Superman scans some historical archives and attempts to catch himself up on 400 years of Earth history.

Several years after Superman's disappearance, **Lex Luthor** was apparently elected President of the United States, only to be impeached after being implicated in a massive corruption scandal—thanks to some skillful investigative reporting by **Lois Lane** and **Jimmy Olsen**. Meanwhile, most of **Gotham City** has been rebuilt following a series of massive earthquakes that rocked the city in the late 21st century. **Barry Allen** eventually married his girlfriend **Iris West** and retired from crime-fighting to spend more time with her, passing the mantle of the Flash off to his nephew and protege **Wally West**; Wally continued to protect **Central City** from evildoers for many years, and eventually passed the torch to Barry and Iris' grandson **Bart Allen**. The Justice League has long since been disbanded, but the team continued to fight the good fight for several decades under the leadership of a superhero called **Nightwing**, whom Superman recognizes as an adult **Dick Grayson**. **Princess Diana** eventually succeeded her mother **Hippolyta** as Queen of the Amazons, and managed to persuade her people to open up diplomatic relations with ""Man's World""; as of the 24th century, **Themyscira** has its own seat in the United Nations.

But although plenty of good things have happened in the 400 years that Superman was away, not everything is fine and dandy. ""**The Jokerz**"", a criminal gang following in the footsteps of Batman's long-dead nemesis, have emerged as a major international terrorist organization. In the far reaches of space, the Green Lantern Corps is fighting a bloody interstellar war with **the disciples of Sinestro**, who use a mass-produced version of Sinestro's yellow power ring. And the city of **Atlantis** is in turmoil following the disappearance of the last known member of **the House of Orin**, Aquaman's royal line; in their absence, a rogue splinter faction of the Atlantean military known as **the Black Manta Brigade** has seized control of much of the city, and now regularly launches attacks on the surface world.

Slowly adjusting to the world of the 24th century, Superman volunteers to tag along with the rest of the Legion when they answer a routine distress signal, and fights alongside them as they head off to defend a coastal city from another attack by the Black Manta Brigade. Though he happily shares in the Legion's elation after they win the battle, he's soon reminded that the people of his own time still need him, and he has to get home by any means necessary. To his dismay, the Legion informs Superman that time-travel is still beyond the capabilities of 24th century Earth science, and they have no way of helping him get back to the 21st century. Superman realizes that only the Brain Inter-Active Construct has that power; to get back home, he'll have to challenge Brainiac in battle and *force* him to send him home.

Soon after, he realizes that their rematch might come sooner than he expected: the Legion's deep-space monitoring systems have picked up a massive extraterrestrial vessel headed towards Earth from the direction of the ruins of Krypton. Brainiac still hasn't given up on the possibility of capturing Superman and extracting the secrets of the extinct Kryptonian race, and he's coming to Earth to find him.

In the climax, Superman and the Legion band together to defend 24th century Metropolis from Brainiac as he attacks the city with all of his might, using his advanced technology to corrupt and assimilate the city's computers with his own circuitry. As the battle rages on, Metropolis' many holographic advertisements are gradually taken over by looming holographs of Brainiac's distorted face as he taunts Superman. The situation looks dire, and Superman is forced to accept that he may have to *destroy* Brainiac to protect the people of Earth, leaving him with no way back home.

When all seems lost, the cyborg Stanley Stone unexpectedly steps up to defend Superman from Brainiac singlehandedly, revealing the full power of his cybernetic enhancements. In a dramatic moment, Stanley reveals the truth about his background: it turns out that ""Stanley Stone"" isn't his real name, and he isn't really a descendant of Victor Stone as he claimed; he's actually **Brainiac-5**, a benevolent future incarnation of the Brain Inter-Active Construct who finally realized the folly of Brainiac's mindless quest to control all life, and joined the Legion under a fake identity to atone for his past misdeeds. Brainiac is devastated by the revelation that his quest for power will ultimately prove meaningless, and he nearly short-circuits as his future self fights him to a standstill.

Finally, Brainiac-5 summons an inter-dimensional vortex to send Superman back to the 21st century, accepting that he will be written out of history if Superman ever successfully destroys his past self. Before he leaves, he gives Superman a wrapped gift as a token of his appreciation for showing him the power of good. As Superman flies back home, the evil Brainiac chases him through the vortex, and Superman incapacitates him in a battle in Earth's orbit before heading back to the Hall of Justice for a well-deserved rest.

In the final scene, Superman unwraps Brainiac-5's gift and finds an intricately designed miniature replica of **Kandor**, the capital city of Krypton, sealed in a glass bottle. Smiling at the reminder of his home planet, he places the bottle on a shelf in the Hall of Justice where he can admire it. But just as he turns his back, we zoom in on the bottle...and a tiny head pokes out of a window in one of the many miniature buildings. It turns out that Brainiac actually *shrank* the surviving Kryptonian citizens so that he could study them in his laboratory, and they were living safely in his bottled city all along.

Just before the credits, Brainiac's spaceship reboots itself and heads off into the distance of space, finally stopping at a familiar destination: the planet Oa. With that, Brainiac approaches Sinestro in his orbiting prison cell and makes him an offer:

***""I am the Brain Inter-Active Construct. I seek to bring order to a world sundered by chaos. Will you join me?""***

Sinestro smiles, and the credits roll.

Could the actual minimal amount of visual resolution single cells process be too low?

Is it at all possible that the RESOLUTION of human sight is not high enough to accurately display the size of these objects? Have any studies been done on this type of processing?

Since the Moon has no atmosphere and is far from the protective embrace of Earth's magnetic field, there is nothing stopping high energy particles from slamming into the Moon at huge velocity, damaging the astronauts who get in the way. The only - economical - solution is to build underground.

Previously, LRA's facilities have had their position fixed by the need to mine resources of one kind or another, or by orbital mechanics (e.g. the space elevator). As a result, LRA has had to dig huge caverns for their staff at enormous expense and complexity. However, when considering locations for a manned presence in support of other lunar operations, no such concerns are extant, allowing considerable freedom in location choice.

This leads to a natural choice: lunar [lava tubes](https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2017/Q4/potential-human-habitat-located-on-the-moon.html), creating enormous natural caves large enough to fit entire cities. Located near the craters Philolaus and Marius, the two known lava tubes provide ideal locations for such long-term habitation, and the PSA (with a support and development contract to LRA) plans to develop both for long term habitation and engineering support of both lunar and Earth orbital applications.

Buildings
----------

The habitation structures will be designed to be as cheap as possible, in turn being built almost entirely out of lunar resources, with later structures getting rid of the ""almost."" Each structure, a large aluminum tube built in segments at the NU's aluminum refinery and shipped to the site, will be assembled in-place and fitted out with equipment (e.g. lights, life support systems, etc) sourced from Earth. All buildings will have a segmented design, enabling individual units and sections to be isolated in case of a catastrophic failure of pressure hull integrity.

Thanks to the low gravity, these buildings can be very large indeed. The standard accomodation block is designed to be 30 stories tall, be around 15 meters in diameter, and, house more than 160 occupants, without needing any special structural support. Office buildings will be constructed similarly. Notably, due to lack of sufficiently strong transparent materials, windows will be few and far between, as well as being rather on the small side.

Factories will be generally unpressurized affairs, low to the ground and built out of corrugated aluminum.

Utilities
-------------

For a space installation, utilities are the usual power, water, and sewer, but are now augmented with rather odder functions such as fresh air supply and air return.

Primary power will be delivered from a dedicated SBSP platform, and on-site emergency backup power will be provided by a space-rated EM^2 reactor with a tin droplet radiator on the surface. Power supplies will run through a pair of path-redundant tunnels to the city underneath.

Attaining satisfactory pressure in water supplies is a challenge. The water tanks themselves will be on the surface, more than 300 meters above the consumers in the city below, pressurizing the water system. Another challenge is that the temperature can be too low to prevent freezing, so the pipes must be heated. Similar issues are shared with sewer systems, but instead the pipes run to a central water treatment plant. Water is originally sourced from water ice - which, in the case of Philonous, is literally right next to the city - and is recycled in a closed loop by the water treatment plant (combining both chemical and agricultural means of water purification). 

Air supplies will largely be via the aeroponic facilities on site, which rely on their crops to maintain oxygen levels.

Internet will be local mostly, as Earth is 11 seconds away by terabit laser link. Internet will be free, however.

Agriculture
------------

Both VitroMeat and AeroFood plan to develop large lunar facilities for their food production systems. AeroFood, in particular, plans to build a 91,000 ton per year (at maximum capacity) facilitiy along the lines of the one [built in the Antarctic for South Africa](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/7ompnv/event_antarctic_aeroponics/). This complex will provide air and water filtration for the rest of the base, and is responsible for the majority of the food supply.

Transportation
-----------------

The stations will connect their buildings through underground lunarcrete tunnels, pressurized for safety. Buildings whose geology prevents them from supporting such tunnels will have bridges connecting them to their neighbors. These tunnels will have automatically closing vacuum doors, to isolate potential air leaks between buildings. Standard attire outdoors will be the [Conformal Advanced Space Suit](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/7c73eo/tech_conformal_advanced_space_suit/). 

Tesla will also begin building cars specifically for use on the Moon. Built off of their terrestrial Model 4, the Model 4M features both pressurized and unpressurized interior options, with the pressurized version offering both a suitport and a pressure bridge connection. These can be used for long distance transport, and can be hailed using a ridesharing app.

Very long distance transport will be via either LRA's Lightweight Multipurpose Landers, or branch lines of the [lunar railroad](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/7w9ex8/tech_lunar_railways/), which will be built to both stations and can be accessed via an elevator to the surface.

Operations
-----------

The two stations are planned to initially support populations of around 4,000, with foci on supporting space missions in the near Earth and Mars operational space, in turn reducing costs of such missions through proximity and familiarity of key staff. Several companies and organizations have announced plans to build offices, production complexes, and research facilities in the two stations, including:

* Wright Defense &amp; Space (Philolaus &amp; Marius)
* Tesla (Philolaus)
* [SunPower](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/75kgb1/tech_multistage_solar_cells/) (Marius)
* La Technologies (Marius)
* LRA (Philolaus &amp; Marius)
* General Atomics (Philolaus &amp; Marius)
* TAE Energy (Philolaus)
* GlobalFoundries (Marius)
* Kratos Heavy Industries (Philolaus)
* Northrup Grumman Aerospace Systems (Philolaus)
* Neuralink (Marius)
* NanoSys (Philolaus)
* Alphabet (Philolaus)
* Facebook (Marius)
* Starlight Systems (Marius)
* PSA (Philolaus &amp; Marius)
* Space Systems/Loral (Philolaus)

The development of both bases will be largely funded by the PSA to the tune of $8.9 billion, with the first move-ins occurring in two years. The companies who plan to begin operations in the facilities will also be contributing substantial capital to their own operations, with more than $40 billion in investment planned over the next 10 years. Plans include the construction of 3 semiconductor fabs, a car plant, and numerous high tech support industries centered around the space industry including more than 6 high bays for satellite manufacture. It is hoped that both stations will have their full population ready for further expansion in 4 years.",True,False,False,worldpowers,t5_30yfr,,,restricted,top,self,,,[TECH] Philolaus &amp; Marius Stations,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/7wuz8m/tech_philolaus_marius_stations/,all_ads,,True,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '4LBz05mq9Z1KN3p6fggKBu727Tt-89uXhNhXh4hYsIA', 'resolutions': [{'height': 96, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/VgHQk1UfpZy3PsyVteOoTUm8rwhDJgSVd7XmEWJ0sa0.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;fm=jpg&amp;s=ffc7b6511a3792bb22f3a8a26a2d71c7', 'width': 108}, {'height': 193, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/VgHQk1UfpZy3PsyVteOoTUm8rwhDJgSVd7XmEWJ0sa0.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;fm=jpg&amp;s=50164ed3da8aacfea6d46f327b651602', 'width': 216}, {'height': 286, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/VgHQk1UfpZy3PsyVteOoTUm8rwhDJgSVd7XmEWJ0sa0.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;fm=jpg&amp;s=0f308154e1fc0e1aa677c60a60a6d438', 'width': 320}, {'height': 573, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/VgHQk1UfpZy3PsyVteOoTUm8rwhDJgSVd7XmEWJ0sa0.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;fm=jpg&amp;s=075efd74e7d6a4f369f6ccd1907e3518', 'width': 640}], 'source': {'height': 627, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/VgHQk1UfpZy3PsyVteOoTUm8rwhDJgSVd7XmEWJ0sa0.jpg?fm=jpg&amp;s=702636c2af38d0f5e00b19e101b25326', 'width': 700}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,

So i've been trying to into all that goblin stuff goblins usually do, but with almost no success. I've tried farming Zul'farrak for transmog, i've tried farming Starlight Roses in Suramar, running old raids for pets/xmog, even attempted flipping. With no success. The thing is prices on my realm are mostly like 30% up to 50% of actual RegionMarketValueAvg according to my TSM. X-mog i farmed for quite some time doesn't sell AT ALL. The only thing i sold were some gloves for 11k gold and that was it, since then i literally can't sell a single xmog item i got my hands on. Same with Decahedral Dwarven Dices/Loaded Gnomish Dices, the first one is abotu 18k on my server and Loaded Gnomish Dice was somewhere about 80k (!) for one the moment i started farming it. I got 2 of Decahedral and 1 Loaded Gnomish one, they're sitting either in AH on lowest price or mailbox because auction has expired. Supply of those is quite low as there are literally like 3-4 Decahedrals and 2-3 Loaded Ones (60k on AH the moment i write this post). And yes i do know that API is down etc. but i noticed economy on my market has been like this for ages. Everything is so cheap and unless it's current content it rarely sells for me but token price stays the same for Region. So my question is, what am i doing wrong? I tried doing all sort of different things, noticed the pattern with Starlight Roses which were like 50g on my server literally for ever, suddenly dropped to 35g so i decided i'm going to stock up on some and wait with them until prices go back up or craft potions (Skystep potions actually sell for about 400g~~ on my server which is very nice in case Starlight Rose go down in price even more or stay 35g). Tried flipping one BoE item - bought 930 Leather Shoulders for 50k, because rest was at like 75k at the moment and that seemed like excelent deal at the moment. I'm selling those on AH as i write this post for a week now - i realize i could have make a mistake with the last one, but that was my attempt as i have no idea which items are actually ""flipable"", how to notice that? 

I'm also including pic of what i'm talking about, notice RegionAvg price and MinBuyout, it's like that with everything and i mean everything on my server.

#How This Thread Works

Comment below on any difficulties you have with the game, as well as any general tips you have. I, or ***someone else*** (please contribute where you can!), will comment with a suggestion. No struggle is a dumb struggle. If you literally struggle with tapping the notes, voice that. If you struggle with some really difficult patterns like the insane sliding in Trancing Pulse, voice that! There will be a zero tolerance shaming policy that is heavily ~~not...actually~~ enforced (please be kind, we are all here to have a good time and support each other!). I'll post the questions and answers up here in the format shown below. These are not limited to just Master and Master+ songs, this was made for *all* difficulties! Ask or explain away!

#Tips

- Adjust your timing

- /u/AidoruRisemara's very useful [comment from an old thread that should have never been created](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarlightStage/comments/6r127u/starlight_stage_skill_improvement_guide/dl1mfia/)

- Other rhythm games can help to build reflexes, skills, and overall mentality that can be useful in Starlight Stage. These are not required of course, but they can help.

- Courtesy of /u/xRichard:

General TIP 1:

Playing Mirishita can get you better at Deresute. It's more forgiving when it comes to chaining combos, but I feel it's a little bit harsher to judge PERFECT taps.
Also, their maps makes better use of your left hand than Deresute. Deresute mainly relegates your left hand to taps that follow the rhythm, while the right hand works on melody. Mirishita is more balanced and will help you with the songs that ask more of the left hand (Master+ songs).

Tip2:

&gt; Adjust your timing

The proper timing on my phone is +25. And the ingame tool to adjust timing never got me there. It always got between +20 and +23. So the tool is useful for a rough timing configuration, but when it comes to fine tuning you should do it by playing a song with a strong melody on the taps (something like Kyoko's song), and play ALONG WITH THE MUSIC.

Through some extensive testing I -think- size is relevant to how much average liquid starlight you get from them in a lightwell, but I have no idea how important. 

1 B - Is it better to lightwell a 400 size rock crystal, convert it to a celestial crystal and lightwell that, or wait for it to split and then lightwell both resultant crystals?  

1 C -   Whats the optimal approach?

1 D - What is the average lightwell output per [crystal] at [size]? How do the different crystals / gems differ?

2 A - Is it possible to build a self-sufficient automated crystal and starlight operation in Revelations? 

2 B - What mods in Revelations can read and use crystal NBT data?

3 A - What is the % chance for a crystal to split into two in liquid starlight (at max size)?  

3 B - Is it the same chance for rock and celestial crystals? 

3 C - If so is it better to farm rock crystals (because smaller max size = less starlight needed) or celestial crystals?


EDIT: Lol at all the hate. I'm not ungrateful, its a simple FACT that there is very little info on how crystals work built into the game.  Show me where it tells you collector crystals can be white or blue, for example? Or what each attribute affects?  Or even the general concept that your base location doesnt really matter in the long run.   ""You're supposed to use trial and error""?  Crystals are far too rare on a multiplayer server to waste them on the 100+ trials needed to answer ""what does each stat do"" - most of the ""trials"" use up or destroy the crystal...

And the final, most compelling proof of all?  If you are ""supposed to use trial and error""...why has no one done that and posted the results?  Reddit has like 10 topics on this subject and its obvious no-one REALLY knows the intricacies.  Why is there nowhere telling us the range of linking or lenses?  etc etc.

After getting some very helpful feedback for my [Vampire Hunter class](https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonWorld/comments/7w9kge/vampire_hunter_class_beta_need_feedback/), I've created a Dhampyr (aka half-vampire) compendium class that I intend to publish alongside the Vampire Hunter. I initially had a move where the Vampire Hunter could become part-vampire, but it was pointed out that it was far too drastic a narrative change to be a simple class move. Hence this Dhampyr class, which will complement the Vampire Hunter or work with any other class.   
Now, you might notice there's a lot of specific interactions with vampires and undead in these moves, something I tried to avoid with the Vampire Hunter. This is because if a player gets bitten by a vampire, I figure the game probably has a fair amount of undead and vampires in it to start with. Now, onto the class...  
  
**Dhampyr**
  
**Trigger:** When you are bitten by a vampire and survive, are the victim of an ancient vampiric curse, or your secret vampiric heritage is revealed, you may choose this move when you level up:  

**Daywalker**  

Vampiric blood flows through your veins. Though you may walk in the sunlight and see your reflection in the mirror, part of you is no longer mortal.  
You gain the following advantages:  
•Unless you act to prove otherwise, vampires and other undead consider you one of their own.   
•You gain +1 to Parley with vampires and other intelligent undead.  
•You can see in starlight as if it were day, and your eyes glow a faint red in darkness.  
•You also gain the Bloodsucker and Retractable Fangs moves.  

You also gain the following disadvantages:  
•If common folk become aware of your nature, they fear and shun you.  
•You can no longer Make Camp or rest on sacred ground.  
•Eating garlic inflicts the Sick debility.  
•Vampire hunters and religious orders may try to hunt you down and slay you.  
  
**Bloodsucker**  
When you use Hack and Slash on a warm-blooded target, on a 10+, you may choose to bite your opponent and drink some of their blood to heal 1d4 HP. Doing this reveals your vampiric nature to all present. You may also drink a pint of fresh blood instead of consuming a ration when Making Camp. If a companion donates blood to feed you, they only heal half the usual value from eating a ration.  
**Retractable Fangs**  
When you parley using threats of impending violence as leverage, you may show your fangs and roll STR or DEX instead of CHA. Doing so reveals your vampiric nature to all present.  
**If you are a Daywalker, these count as class moves for you; you can choose from them when you level up.**  
  
**Bloodthirsty**  
When you taste a living enemy's blood, you gain 1 hold. When you spend the hold, gain +1 forward on your next roll against the target or their allies. Until you spend the hold or rest for a short while and discard it, you cannot retract your fangs to conceal your vampiric nature.  
**Creature of the Night**  
You feel more alive after dark. When night falls, hold 2 Darkness. You may spend Darkness to reroll any STR or DEX roll. You must take the second result, even if it's worse. When the sun rises, you lose any unspent Darkness.  
**Dracula has Risen From the Grave**  
When you take your Last Breath, on a miss, you may choose to return as a true vampire instead of dying. Either discuss what this means with the GM, or reroll your character using the Vampire class.  
**Bite Back**  
You gain the Vampire Hunter's Chosen Quarry starting move, and gain vampires as a Chosen Quarry. Your weapon always counts as a Silvered Weapon when fighting your Chosen Quarry.  
**Heightened Senses**  
When you Discern Realities, on a 10+, you may ask 4 questions instead of 3. In addition, if any vampires or other dhampyrs were recently in the area, the GM tells you unprompted.  
**Abstinence**  
Whenever you go one week without feeding on blood or biting anyone, gain 1 Purity. You may spend Purity to instantly end a debility or magic effect against you. While you hold Purity, vampires and other undead no longer treat you as one of their own.  
**Embrace the Darkness Within**  
The darkness in your soul resonates with those of impure heart. When you Parley with evil beings, you may commit a cruel act to treat a miss as a 7-9.  
**I'm Nothing Like You!**  
When you Hack and Slash against undead or vampires, on a 10+, choosing to do extra damage deals 1d10 instead of 1d6.  
  
  
  
As you can see, I tried to give many of the moves a bit of a downside, to illustrate that this is indeed a curse. Let me know what you think, and don't be afraid to be negative!

Credits: 

Eiji-kun, d1comics, unknown author
Some of the material below is taken word-for-word from previous work done from the sources mentioned and linked above. 

Grammar: 

Similar to the words sheep, duck, deer, buffalo, fish, etc., talpid is the plural form of the word talpid. 
Example: “Meet my talpid friend, Lenny.” and “Look at all of those talpid over there!”    

Summary: 

Talpid are a race of quite literal mole men who live deep underground. They are mostly insular and harmless, every so often though, something urges them to the life of adventure…

Description:

Appearance: 

Height Range:  2’5” – 4’0” (.762 m – 1.22 m)
Weight Range:  50 Lbs. – 175 Lbs. (22.68 Kgs. – 79.38 Kgs.)
Size Range: Tiny - Small/Medium
Life Expectancy: 68 Years Old

Talpid are covered in thick, short fur that is most frequently grey or black, but rarely (depending on subrace) can be blond, rusty red, or brown - even rarer still, some talpid are hairless or albino. They have a triangular snout with many whiskers, a small pink nose (star-shaped noises are a rare subrace), tiny ears, and tiny beady eyes. Their paws are proportionally large with long sharp claws used for burrowing through most terrain. They prefer function over form in their clothing; they avoid fine details that mud and dirt will soon cover up, instead, they mostly wear solid and simple dark and earthen colors. Talpid average around three feet tall. Their weight varies, however, it’s quite common to see barrel-chested talpid.
(This picture is not ideal.)

Habitat:

Talpid live underground in secluded areas. They stay away from cities, because of the noise and the chaos, the city’s general disregard for nature, and the continuous competition for space (there are rare exceptions of course). Talpid cities are a woven basket of fungi laden dirt tunnels that rarely lead to the main open chamber which contains the city; this confusing maze of tunnels, in addition to tricks and traps, denying access, poisoning the land, collapsing tunnels, etc. are talpids’ main physical defense system. They have no use for castles nor do they need motes and drawbridges. 

Lifestyle: 

Talpid are humble, modest, and content with their lot in life. The talpid in general aren't so much lazy as much laid back and passive. Rarely are they the first to action, and rarely do they act alone. They are pragmatic, sensible, and easygoing. They thrive in dirt, filth, decay, and disgusting. 

Economy: 

If dwarves are industrial workers in the underground, talpid are the farmers and masters of agriculture - tending to farms of insects, fungus, growths, and strange oozes, all of which can be good for eating or deathly poisonous, depending on the variety. They are major producers and exporters to other communities (primarily of the underground and underdark). 

Talpid have no desire to collect or acquire great wealth, instead, they aim to become an economic necessity to their neighbors by weaving a complex web of economic dependencies and alliances - such complexities are a safety net for them. None dare attack them, because of how it would negatively affect their own wealth and economy.

Relations: 

Friendly: Dwarves and Firbolgs
Unfriendly: Duergar 
The rest can be assumed neutral. 

Diet: 

Talpid feed off of bugs, small animals, fungus, and oozes. 

Religion: 

Most Talpid do not practice religion, however, there are small groups of Talpid who practice simple animism and druidic traditions.  

Traits:

Names:

Talpid don’t care for fancy names or fancy titles. They choose “boring” names, often handed down from generation to generation. They figure that by being unremarkable, no one can trace them back to their underground dirt city. Also, they may not be terribly creative. In this same fashion, they don’t use last names/surnames/family names.

Male Examples: Lenny, Marcus, Larry, Moss, Ert, Sado, Agar, Porus
Female Examples: Lanna, Sistel, Terra, Stata, Eech, Lily, Ava, Babs

Favored Classes:
 
Scout, Rogue, Ranger, Druid, Shaman

Alignment: 

Talpid are usually true neutral, however, variations occur based on circumstance, birth defect, etc. 

Speed: 

Above Ground:  25
Burrowing:  25
Below Ground: 25

Armor Class: 

As a small creature, talpid gain +1 size bonus to armor class. 

Wearable Armor: 

Light Armors, Leather, Chainmail, etc. 
Talpid are unable to wear medium to heavy armor.

Inventory: 

Talpid lifting and carrying capacity are extremely limited.

Usable Weapons: 

Gauntlets, Staffs, Light-weight Short Swords, and other small weapons. 
Ranged weapons can only be used by talpid with short claws, in this case, -4 to all unarmed attacks.
Some talpid have unusually long and sharp claws that given them unarmed combat bonuses, see “Natural Weapons” below.

Vision: 

Prefers Dark-light or Low-light – they can see up to 60 feet in

Languages: 

Automatic: Undercommon and Terran
Bonus: Deep Speech, Common, Dwarven, Gnome, Elven 

Ability Adjustments: 

-2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution 

Skills:

Talpid gain Stealth (because of their small size), Survival (because of their lifestyle and hardiness), and Nature (because of their ties to the dirt and it’s living filth). Plus, an additional +2 racial bonus for those skills.

Additional Modifiers:

+4 Hide Checks (Dexterity)
-4 Size Special Attacks (Trip, Grapples, Overrun) (Strength)

Disadvantages (Required): 

Light Blindness: 

Abrupt exposure to bright light (such as sunlight or daylight spell) blinds talpid for one round. On subsequent rounds, they are dazzled as long as they remain in the affected area. 

Unsightliness:

Non-underground dwellers find you hideous, you remind them of a giant rat (-2 Charisma).  

Advantages (Required): 

Burrowing:

Talpid are advanced burrowers, able to burrow as fast as they run. Also, their small size allows them to squeeze through areas that others cannot.

Tunnel Dweller: 

A Talpid can sense depth underground as naturally as a human can sense which way is up.

Scent: 

Talpid have a very strong sense of smell.

Tremorsense: 

Talpids have tremorsense out to 30 feet.  

Advantages (Optional) (Pick 2):

Poison Resistant: 

Talpid grow and harvest poison growths in their underground dirt cities. Centuries of farming these crops have built a natural immunity to many of their affects. 

Thrives at Night: 

A talpid can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination (+2 Perception). However, during excessive brightness, talpid are easily blinded (-2 Perception). 

Blindsight: 

Talpid can see in pitch darkness, up to 40 feet.

Stability: 

A Talpid gains a +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist being bull rushed or tripped when standing on earthen material (but not while climbing, flying, riding, or otherwise not standing firmly on the ground).

Natural Weapons:

Talpid have two paws with sharp claws that deal damage equal to 1d6, with a 20/x30 critical due to their size. Unarmed strikes grant an additional three proficiency bonus and can be used by both hands. However, because of their large paws and claws, talpid have terrible carrying large or oddly shaped items. 

Dirt Diplomat:

+2 to Charisma when below ground, -1 to Charisma when above ground. 

Strong Digger: 

You can increase your burrowing and below ground speed by 5.

Earth Walk: 

You ignore difficult terrain if that terrain is the result of rubble or uneven earth/rock/stone. 

Deep Breathing:

Talpid can hold their breath for a long time (for their size). They can hold their breath for three rounds, or two minutes per point in their Constitution score, whichever is preferred. They also have no penalty in low-oxygen environments. 

Usage:

Play Talpid if you want to:

•	explore the world above with curiosity, naivety, and uncertainty.

**Portents**

“I think we should go back.”

Orin’s thoughts seeped like a wet cloth wiped telepathically across the back of Vaz’s mind. He could feel the fear, cold, like metal against the neck.

“No.” Vaz replied staring down at the crater below him. The crater was indistinguishable from countless other hollows pocketing the otherwise barren ash surface of Kaldron VI. This crater was no different...except for the body.

“Is it Terran?“ Orin asked.

Vaz was silent. It had been over a century since he had seen one, out in deep space near the Jinren Reefs, but the body was indeed Terran. 

Orin’s doubts continued with escalating declaration.

“If it is a Terran, then this represents a breach of the Sanghectis Accord. There isn’t a Terran outpost within seven light years. This...this is a breach of the Accord, and we must tell the elders about it at once.”

Vaz ignored his apprentice. Templar did not know fear. Fear was seared out during the discipline scourging. In place of fear the Templar learned I’rali, that unconscious projection of granite calm. If Orin’s had been bonded to him Vaz would have suppressed the young one’s deviant terror. 

Vaz ventured down into the crater and reaching the lithe figure bent to examine it. The body was covered in blood and dust and scars, tattered white space suit utterly out of place against the basaltic dirt. A female, if dormant memories still served him. His taloned hand turned the human over and palm to frail chest Vaz felt for pulse, but there was none. 

Vaz stood over the creature, his mind searching for reason as Orin carried on behind him. 

“...and if there is one Terran here then that means there are multiple. A rogue settlement, an expedition, or worse an incursion force. No, the elders must be told immediately…” 

Vaz’s spoke finally, articulating the measured syllables of the Erza Cantos 

“Fear is a singularity. A collapsing weight devouring everything into itself. Why, heart of Adun. Why must you trespass it’s horizon.”

The Templar rounded on his pupil, grasped him by the shoulder, claws pressing in on still tallow flesh. Pressed his hand against Orin’s breast a moment before pointing to the dead Terran. 

“This is not the self. This is a vessel. The true self was formed in the Khala and returns indelibly to her in time. But by acts of valor and meaning are we made significant. And fear of the unknown douses this like monsoon against the candle. Burn brighter Orin. Burn brighter if you ever wish to wear Templar vestments.”

Vaz shifted his focus back to the corpse.

“Besides...this is one Terran and a dead one at that. There is no danger here. Come we have our patrol to finish. When we have arrived back at the Gateway we will report this finding.”

The two climbed out of the crater, ascending the rim, and marched on across the Bna’gol Dunes. The land here rose in overlapping foothills until it met the Marcelis Buttes. There solar windswept sand exchanged for obsidian stone, cresting stalactite teeth and serrated ravines which swallowed Vil’tama starlight into fractured shadows. 

The Protoss strode on through these narrow crags, illuminated only by the crystaline matrix of the Templar’s armour. The auric breast plate hummed, the internal plasma shield generators vigilant for threats. Orin listened to the feline swooshing of Vaz’s cybernetic grafts, piezoelectic quartz fibers contracting in unison. When he could no longer hold his worries at bay, Orin broke the calm.

“It is not the dead I fear” he said “but the mechanisms that place a dead Terran on this moon which gives me pause. There may be others, there must be others. Master, I...I sense crisis in this.”

Vaz turned to look at his apprentice. 

“Ah, so now you dabble in prophecy! Tis remarkable progress you make for one who hasn’t shed his W’ret scales yet. Tell me, do you know how the exalted ones achieved prophecy?”

Orin was caught off guard. 

“You mean Tassadar? Artanis? They listened to the voice of the Khala.”

Vaz halted midstride. The Templar twisted to face the whorled stone walls of the canyon around them. 

“What made this canyon?”

Orin was confused. 

“What do you mean? Seismic activity I suppose. An ancient river could have eroded this passage eons ago. Volcanic forces may have rent tectonic plates asunder? If we had a probe we could survey the sedimentary…”

“The past, Ap’re Orin, the past made this canyon. Events in sequence caused a divide in this earth allowing us to walk though this space today. Prophecy is not about listening, it is about predicting. Only knowledge of the past foretells the future. The exalted ones possessed the ability to entune with the entirety of the Khala. A hundred thousand protoss minds calculating probabilities. In this dream miasma all possible eventualities would coalesce and collapse until finally the true reality inherent would rise to the surface. And the Exhalted would read them as one reads celestial kinetics.”

“Yes, Kla Vaz, I think I comprehend.”

“So what does the past tell us about the Sanghectis Accord?”

“That it was agreed upon in the wake of the Second Great War, that separation ensured stability. The Fallen Xel’naga had been defeated. The Zerg Swarms, severed from Amon’s connection, were decaying. Among ruined city and extinguished stars, the leaders of man and first born assembled on the planet Sanghectis and forged an agreement to ensure that interspecies genocide would never happen again.”

“The end result being…”

“The end result being the formation of the Astyanax Rift, a demarcation zone three hundred light years wide between Terran and Protoss space. Lined with all manner of Terran Mines, Automated Defence Turrets and Early Warning Detection Stations. And guarded on our side by the Umbral Fleet.”

“Another question Ap’re Orin, what do the Terran’s understand about crossing the divide?”

“That it means a Third Great War, master.”

“And if the Terran’s chose to violate our space? To make war on us. Is this really what you imagine the first sign would be? A dead human left in a crater. On a moon holding no significance to the Terran before the Rift closed? I think not. The past provides a much more probable explanation. This cadaver has been here a long time, since before the Second Great War or perhaps during it. Embalmed by this moon’s polar vacuum such that her skin appears as new as the day she died. I suspect we missed the body on our initial scans because it was buried in the ground and a recent meteorite shower must have unearthed…”

Vaz stopped suddenly. The canyon had broken left and opened out onto a valley. Down at the nadir of the basin, was a wreckage of metal and ceramic.

“That’s…”

Orin did not finish his thought, it was unspokenly obvious it was a Terran vessel. 

The Protoss gazed at the ship, neither exchanging words, then cautiously they descended down towards the ship. It was a freight carrier, an ice hauler, now beached and spilling her watery cargo out into the exposed lunar air. The scene around the ship was encased in sheets of ice and gossamer frost. The frost sealing the crash site with reflected moonlight and a timeless stillness as if the crash had always been here. The ground cracked under Orin’s feet as the Protoss approached. Through the gaping breach in her hull Orin could see mechanical arms with yellow drilling and loading attachments meant for deep space glacier mining. The mechanical arms twisted around each other like intestines from some gargantuan sea-creature now gutted and awaiting carrion birds. 

“Stay here”

Vaz commanded Orin who watched as Vaz warily entered the vessel’s cavernous hull. 

Leaking neon coolant pooled on the floor, leaving plutonium  green in the wash of Vaz’s footsteps. Several kiloton containers had been anchored to the ceiling, when the magnetic locks failed these corrugated tetra-iron blocks had crashed were gravity demanded thus forcing Vax over or around the haphazard cargo gravestones. A shredded tarp swayed gently towards the bow, propelled only by slow venting ozone from an adjacent service pipe. Vaz pushed back this tarp and found a door behind marked “crew quarters”. He heaved against the jammed door until the hatch snapped back on its track and painfully egressed. 

Inside was a massacre. Blood soaked bulkheads and corpses stacked atop each other. Most with a clean borehole between the irises, a few with cauterized throats slit. 

Vaz ignited his psionic katar, stalking through the crew quarters to the opposing passage. The door to the cockpit slide open effortlessly. The main steering controls had been smashed but nothing else was abnormal in the room. As Vas turned to reexamine the bodies the templar heard a click. On the far side of crew quarters behind him Vaz could just make out the dim shimmer of shadows, then his head exploded against the cockpit window followed microseconds later by his armor’s plasma shields flickering on.  

Orin crouched behind the fuselage. He had waited a long time since hearing the rifle shot  but the interior of the ship had since been silent. Vaz had not come back. Something was not right and Vaz should have been back by now and we should have gone back.

Orin had tried to reach the psi network but the aether storms of Kaldron IV continued to block all signal. He was alone and the star Vil’tama sinking below the horizon. When it was pitch black Orin finally moved, slinking between rocky outcrops and cracked boulders as he made his way towards the valley entrance. He was almost back at the canyon he and his master had came from hours ago, when he broke cover and sprinted for the breach in the rocks. He had almost reached those mausoleum walls when a tungsten bullet fired by infrared scope from the crashed vessel, found him in the dark.

**Sick**

“We picked you up orbiting Mintaka, in a petronium tanker, the ship’s engines had failed, subsystems dead including the cyro units...except, of course, for yours.

Jessica tried to focus on the sheet of paper in front of her. Her head hurt. In the upper left corner of the paper there was a photograph of a young caucasian woman. She had seen this woman before, but where?

“Salvage team gets claim to the vessel including any cargo but maritime law demands they release survivors at the nearest Dominion held world. Hence why you are here. They dropped you off yesterday and we’ve been thawing you ever since.”

“I am sorry, where is here?”

“Bernards, short for Bernard’s World but even the navigation charts don’t reference the founding name. Listen Ms. Harding I am going to need you to sign right here on the dotted line.”

The man in the navy blue suit reached across the desk and tapped at the bottom of the form in front of her. Jessica clutched at her temple, the headache was intensifying. She squinted through her migraine at the big red header reading “Jessica Harding” on the top of the paper. The photograph stapled to the document was apparently hers. 

Jessica scrawled her name along the dotted line, the pen scratch against the table the only noise in the white closet room. When she had finished and handed the paper to the man in the suit Jessica turned around in her chair. The room had only one door situated behind her with a thick glossy window beside it.

“Why can’t I remember anything? Why does my head hurt so much?”

“Freezer brain. Expected side effects from prolonged cryosleep. You will also develop floaters in a couple hours. The headaches will get better in time as will the memory.”

“I...you said you found me?”

“Yes. Cryofrozen in a derelict spacecraft. The logs were almost unrecoverable but they reference the ship as an Icarus III. Say she departed from Kelt-9 enroute to Gliese but a catastrophic engine accident left the ship thrustless in orbit around Mintaka. Mintaka is a neutron star and the radiation coming off the star obscured the rescue signals your crew had attempted to broadcast.”

“And they found me frozen...on this ship...where is my family?” Jessica asked with the sinking feeling that she did not remember if she even had family. 

The man sighed and looked down at the table before taking off his glasses and polishing them with the cuff of his suit. When he had finished he replaced the eyeglasses on his bridge and folded his hands in front of him.

“I am afraid this is going to come as a bit of a shock to you Ms. Harding. You were down for quite a long time, the ship records read eighty eight years but with the relativistic speed of your orbit around the neutron star it comes out to one hundred and twenty three. I am afraid that unless your family could afford digital entombment or methuselah treatments they have all passed by now.”

With another sigh the man in the suit reached under the table fishing for something in his pocket before pulling out two little digital tags and a business card which he held out towards her. 

“As it happens a relative of one of your departed crew members happens to live on Bernards and has agreed to take you on until you can find further employment. Her name and address are on the back of the card. The green token will get you as far as Laustin by magnetic track. There is a 7:12 out of the station across the street. The blue token is fare for an auto-cab once there. I am sorry for your losses Ms. Harding, but I ask that you realize just how many state charity cases a public servant such as myself has and to not abuse the contact information on my business card.”

The man in the navy blue suit stood up from the table, turned towards the door and departed. He paused outside the room a moment, out of the corner of his eye through the soundproof window he could see the woman screaming. The man checked his watch. He was late for his next client. 

*

Her headache did not go away. The pain receded but it did not fade as Jessica traveled by magnetic train towards the outskirts town of Laustin. It was a small farming community living inside a cluster of habitat domes near a natural methane river. The relative, an aunt of one of her apparent crew members, was a diminutive and old fashioned widow in her late seventies. 

“Friedrich was a good boy” Aunt Rose, as she insisted on being called, said sentimentally “sure he ran with the wrong crowd sometimes but he had put all that behind him. Decided he was going to get a job and when there were no jobs in Laustin he took up with Icarus. He knew Vespene transport was dangerous. So radioactive and volatile. But he always said it was the only way for him to make a better life for himself. Frankly, I was barely surprised to hear there had been an accident.”

Jessica drank her soda and dabbed at her forehead with a napkin. She felt hot, feverish. She attempted to concentrate on the woman in front of her. Aunt Rose wore a stiff floral blouse and pascal head scarf wrapped tightly around a wrinkled but friendly face. The diner they say in was half full with the steady buzz of mid afternoon background chatter.

The old lady took a sip of tea. “When I heard there was a survivor from Friedrich’s ship well I had to offer to help. The lord has blessed us here on Bernards, it has been a hard life but a good one. Here, on the outer limits of Dominion control, we can be free and live as God intended. And he intended for us to help each other my dear. You can stay in my basement until you find a job and make enough money to afford your own place.”

“I am thankful Ms Rose and I will do all I can to help around your home until I then.”

“You will in time child but there is something you can do in the meantime and that is to tell me what you remember about my Friedrich, I would dearly like to know if before his end he had found his way, out there among the stars.”

“I wish I could tell you something about your nephew but ever since I awoke my memory has been gone, they said it was from cryosleep and that it would come back eventually. I have also had these terrible migraines which will not go away.”

“Well then, before you start your job hunt you should see Dr. Lorme at the Laustin clinic. He is quite good. Performed my hip replacement last…”

“Excuse me ma'ams can I take you order” The waitress at our table interrupted, chewing gum and extending her phone to record our order.

“I’ll have my favorite Margaret, eggs over easy. With a single strip of bacon if you could.”

“The usual, k how bout you honey” the waitress popped her gum against her lips.

“Um, is it to early for lunch? I’d like the burger.”

“Bovine vat meat grown fresh right her in Laustin Farms, you will love it.”

*

Dr. Lorme flipped a switch and a multicolored image appeared on the exam room holo-caster. Jessica could see her brain on display. There was a small smudge on the image. 

“This is the magnetic resonance positron emission tomography image. And this” Dr. Lorme pointed at the smudge “is why you're having headaches. You have a mass in your parietal lobe. Most likely cancer and by the looks of it pretty invasive.”

“I have a brain tumor?” Jessica asked wiping sweat from her brow. 

“Yes. But not to worry. With genomic editing and immunomodulation we can cure most of these…” The doctor was scanning through her chart on his terminal and stopped suddenly. 

“Oh” he said with a frown “you are an off worlder...that is going to be a problem” 

“Why is that a problem?”

“Because we can’t treat you. We can’t treat off worlders.” Dr. Lorme closed her chart and turned towards her. “You have to understand. Bernards is a colony world with limited economic resources. As it is you are lucky our insurance system covers diagnostic workup for immigrants. My recommendation would be to return to your birth world and see if you are covered there.”

“But I don’t know where that is!” Jessica yelled 

“Well, that is a problem.” Dr. Lorme slightly abashed. “Have you tried contacting the company that they said you worked for? Perhaps they can give you more information.” 

He looked at the holo-caster one last time. Jessica’s brain rotated slowly around the malignant growth.

“Because you definitely need treatment. And soon.” 

*

Aunt Rose set the pork chop on Jessica’s plate. No sooner had the meat touched down then Jessica’s fork and knife were ripping into it. She was starving. In between mouthfuls the young woman blurts out

“I searched for Icarus Incorporated on the network. They went under about fifty years ago. During the settlement the company databases were wiped and sold in order to clear bankruptcy debt. All personal records were erased.”

Rose sat down at the dinner table across from her, folded a red checkered napkin in her lap listening intently to her guest. “I am sorry to hear that.”

Jessica suddenly dropped her fork mid shovel, sinking her face into one hand in frustration. There was the muffled sound of sobs and nasal congestion. Aunt Rose waited patiently. 

“I just don’t understand!” Jessica cried “I woke up three days ago to find out everyone I loved was gone and dead.Then yesterday that I too am dying of a brain tumor. Then today I discover that my only hope of getting treatment or finding out who I might have been or where I came from was erased to settle some stupid corporate debt.”

“We will think of something dear, the good lord will provide.” Aunt Rose said soothingly

“Bullshit...” Jessica snarled “...bullshit, he brought me back just to die on this planet. You don’t understand, I...I can’t sleep at night. This headache is crippling, it never leaves, its there now pounding louder and louder like drums on my skull. I am sleepwalking. This morning I woke up on the kitchen floor with a steak knife in my hands. Something is very wrong.”

She took another bite of pork chop then slammed her fork on the plate “And why the fuck am I so hungry?” 

“Jessica calm down, this isn’t like you.”

“You don’t know what I am like. I don’t even know what I am like!” Jessica grabbed the remainder of the pork chop and tore a final chuck off with her teeth before storming out of the kitchen. The cellar door slammed behind her, furious agony stomping each stair step until she made it to her basement bedroom. 

*

Jessica awoke the next morning feeling much better. Her headache was gone. She no longer felt feverish. Actually, she felt better than she had felt at any point since waking up from cryosleep. Except she was still hungry. Very. 

Jessica swung to the side of the bed, feeling the cool wooden floor against her bare toes, then rose and brushed her teeth. She noticed her eyes looked slightly different so she leaned in closer to the mirror. The color of her iris was slightly off, shot through with a fierce orange hue. Her eyes were not the only thing changing. Her veins bulged underneath her skin, violaceously coursing down her arms and neck. One of the tendrils shivered beneath her jugular as her left face twitched.  

As she dressed she was vaguely aware of the smell. The savory fragrance coming in wafts from her bedroom closet. A dark wet stain ran from her closet out of her room and up the basement stairs. Jessica wondered if there was any more meat in the fridge. When she got upstairs she saw no sign of Aunt Rose. But to her good fortune there was some bacon in the fridge. She ate it frozen raw.

User: https://osu.ppy.sh/u/4338923

Last report sparked alot of conversation about the topic, however it didn't provide any substancial proof.
After analyzing some replays ( thanks to /u/Spazza17 for sending me the link to the [Replay Viewer](https://github.com/thebetioplane/OsuReplayViewer) ) I found tons of inconsistent movements and pixel-perfect hits, which lead me to believe that he **might** have used a relax hack instead (possibly combined with an aimassist) and not a replay submitter.

After looking at previously resolved cases of people like Nara, Glitter Goose and Seiko, I found alot of correlations between those and -Syncro's plays: there are alot of instances where the user aims the circle too late or too quickly and still manages to hit it, getting a 300 right at the moment when the approach-circle closes, pixel-perfect.

I know that pixel-perfect hits are by no means *definitive* proof of hacking and can be found in legitimate plays, but it gets very suspicious when those kinds of hits happen more than 10 times in a very short play.

I *really* wanted to analyze his [Remote Control play](https://osu.ppy.sh/ss/10222481) but unfortunately the replay is unavailable (since it's not in the top 1000) and upon asking him for it he said that ''osu! didn't save the replay'' (lol).
Thankfully I got a hold of a 2x miss pass on the top diff of Endless Starlight with HDDT by spectating him (achieved off-stream in 1 try).

Let's start:

* **Endless Starlight ~Inochi no Kirameki~**

Map: https://osu.ppy.sh/b/1102144

Screenshot of the play: https://osu.ppy.sh/ss/10221025

Replay file: https://puu.sh/zkJKM/28aa6378a3.osr


There are 7 different moments when the cursor overshoots a circle and hits it at the very end, it's like the player isn't really snapping properly onto the circle and it gets tapped just because he's going through it. This is a typical sign of relax.

&gt; [1](https://puu.sh/zkLOG/20bf513002.png) (timestamp: 21790ms)

&gt; [7](https://puu.sh/zk4qY/932e1bf8fc.png) (timestamp: 71003ms)

There are also quite a few ""edge hits"" which again can happen in normal gameplay, and while they might not be particularly relevant on their own they're still an addition to what we've already seen in the context of this play:

&gt; [1](https://puu.sh/zkMyU/6f695c9490.png) (timestamp: 21283ms)

&gt; [2](https://puu.sh/zk4TD/915b59279f.png) (timestamp: 80945ms)

&gt; [3](https://puu.sh/zk55G/4496f2b688.png) (timestamp: 87640ms)

&gt; [4](https://puu.sh/zk3kw/748fc60e25.png) (timestamp: 73640ms)

&gt; [5](https://puu.sh/zk42V/de02246162.png) (timestamp: 32220ms)

Finally, there are a few moments where the cursor seems to be going somewhere and then suddenly snaps to where the next circle is (possible aimassist): [1](https://puu.sh/zk4k9/e731cbdb2c.png) (timestamp: 72320ms), [2 &lt;-what the fuck](https://puu.sh/zk4R2/9532988bd2.png) (timestamp: 80250ms).

Unless this is the single luckiest play in osu! history where the player somehow manages to only get 2 misses on a map he can barely read, aim and tap properly, there is something fishy going on.

A brief look at his [Hime hime pettanko FC](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/1053520) shows similar pixel-perfect hits [here](https://puu.sh/zkFMc/ddb82c9e09.png) (timestamp: 83778ms), [here](https://puu.sh/zkQ0g/50f48df9d9.png) (timestamp: 82212ms) and [here](https://puu.sh/zkQ1q/5a294adb0b.png) (timestamp: 58307ms) aswell as [hits with very sudden movement changes](https://puu.sh/zkFKL/de9730eae8.png) (timestamp: 49506ms); same things apply to his [kibo refrain FC](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/1512177), where just in the jump section at the end alone (which he SS'd) he manages to get three pixel-perfect hits in a row: [1](https://puu.sh/zkQ8a/1a8f398190.png), [2] (https://puu.sh/zkQ71/f099be3593.png) and [3](https://puu.sh/zkQ3l/2cffc9cdf7.png).

I am planning on playing some jazz  piece on my guitar and I would like to hear some recommendations. So here are my ""criteria""

* Easily recognizable melody.
* Can be played on a single instrument (guitar). I have loop pedal though
* Preferably a standard or classic 30s-early 60s piece.
* ""Easy"" song for the listeners
* Doesn't require tons of improvising (excludes Kind of blue, Cantaloupe island and like)

I have though that these pieces would be good:

* Summertime
* Stella by Starlight
* All the things you are

But I would like to hear some other recommendations also.

I'm very picky when I choose music to read, it has to be pretty good in my taste if it's to be on like a 10 hour loop :D

Here are a few examples of music that I used in the past for reading, I will greatly appreciate if you can help me find more music along those lines. Reccomend me lots, but I can't guarantee I'll choose anything for reading (sometimes hours of searching and I can't find a song for reading). I'll probably appreciate in other time though so feel free to give me any suggestions. I hope you like those, too. 

1) Those I would consider otherworldly:

[MiTis - Open Window](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0qX62Patoo)

[Don Diablo &amp; Matt Nash - Starlight (Could You Be Mine) (Otto Knows Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtyjSFlVzwA)

[Dreweybear - Survive (feat. Lauren McAndrew)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHHN4IUdZvw)

[Sébastien Tellier - La Ritournelle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crblDrrcunQ)

 2) This type I would call lively:

[Electro-Light - Discovery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4D1xRqDazQ)

[Electro-Light - Throwback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHpdzzpPzyU)

[Strawberry Switchblade - I Can Feel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqbWeWNeU7w)

[Snails &amp; NGHTMRE ft. Akylla - Only Want U (TSIMZ Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoIBly-u6c)

 3) Those are sad but rather in a dreamy way than depressing:

[Steve Void &amp; Syence - We Won't Leave You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_kbygQVs2s)

[Illenium - Lost (ft. Emilie Brandt)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_5IMBT5Elw)

(Those are on the verge of being depressing but good too):

[BEAUZ - In Your Eyes (feat. Enya Angel)](https://youtu.be/cXTFaX6HZTs)
[BEAUZ - Never Over (ft. Michi)](https://youtu.be/AnczSS4z6EE)

- Moon's grudge against Toffee is an allusion to how JoJo swore revenge on Dio as both lost their parents to the big bads of their respective series.

- Thomas Wiseau, Tom's true identity, is named after the legendary Tommy Wiseau.

- Moon &amp; River is a subtle reference to Moon River, the opening theme of Bayonetta 2, making the Royal King &amp; Queen of Mewni a reference to the Bayonetta series as a whole.

- Before Total Eclipsa of Moon was chosen for the title of an episode of Season 3B, there were several names before its conception, these include;

+ Another One Bites The Fairy Dust

+ Sheer Heart Attack

+ Killer Queen

+ Star's Platinum Heart

+ Starlight Experience

+ Highway 2 Hell

+ Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap

- Pony Head is a reference to Guts from Berserk. They act like total assholes but deep down lies a heart that has them caring for their companions, plus Ponyhead's lack of hands mirrors Guts' lack of his hand as well.

- Marco Diaz was supposed to be voiced by Ben Diskin, but some scrub at the production team have some martial artist to voice him instead, most likely to prevent the show as one big JoJo reference.

- The same goes for Star, who was originally going to be voiced by Kari Wahlgren, but was changed to an actress I barely knew of, in hopes of preventing the show into a love letter to the Fate series.",True,False,False,StarVStheForcesofEvil,t5_32uti,,,public,,self,,,[DISCUSSION] Star Vs.

A century passes, and in its passing, technology, magic, and society change with the passage of time.

Sildain turns his city into a radiant, verdant paradise, bathed in eternal starlight. Much to the irritation of the Dark Ones living there.

Faye brings back an ancient magic crafted by God of Light and Law of ages past... and, poetically, gives it to the former God of Void and Chaos, who's just as surprised as anyone.

The Dazi develop clockworks and steam power, and use it to do some serious subterranean shenanigans. Obviously, they share their findings and tech with no one.

Flammenstadt, on the other hand, decided to share their newfound knowledge of chemistry and medicine with the city of Summer. They also send civilians to become citizens of Elizabeth's shining city. Giants every now and then intercept immigrating parties, but before they can be taken as slaves, the Pyromancers start suicide-bombing the Giants.

Kazadul assembles most of his sword, infusing it with more power, but it's not yet complete...

The Giants make new leaps in technology, further improving the efficiency of their hunter society. The Treefolk have been less lucky, stuck with mostly basic tools, and have not had good luck so far with the Dark Ones.

    I stay in. You see?
    I work. You see?
    In my work I create worlds with words that will build or destroy. 
    That will caress your soul with the touch of goddess made with 
    roses of roulette. 
    That cannot see nor judge. 
    Just blindfolds and a scale and the vision of the observer and 
    the flame that is awe beckoning back and forth like the flags 
    lined up at the Olympics.
    Empower or entrench or fill with prejudice or pride or the grin of 
    a little kid who just seen his hero hand him an autograph from 
    Mars. 
    Bewilder or belittle but be certain this is the craft for which I was 
    placed here for. You see?
    And push forward I will.
    I must.
    For the world awaits…
    When you do see it is an everlasting ever peaceful ever 
    ascending gasp of conquering the impossible.
    It is, starlight.
    It is, stardust.
    It is, an escape from the bland and the boring and the bold and 
    the petulant wrath of the societal hole. 
    For which I wield this sword.
    For which I wield this war.
    For it is thine destiny to plow through the “has beens” 
    or the “have nots” 
    or the “wish I dids“
    or the “I am not good enoughs”
    or the ""but they didn’t like its"" 
    or the “no you cannots”
    To torch the bell of sound
    and wind of triumphant everlasting “fear nots”
    barreling forth with the speed of ten thousand silent explosions. 
    emanating from years of holding back the only power you ever 
    knew. 
    that you used to escape from when words were war. 
    and plates were shattered. 
    and bills were extinction. 
    and divorce was set in stone. 
    it is the light that pulls you through. 
    through and thrusted and pulverizing the tunnel. 
    and rips open your soul like fifty-five billion voices chanting your 
    name.
    But then you realize. You see?
    All you need to do is just inspire one voice.
    And so I write…

Title (dont worry Im NOT using Starlight nor DS). But with an easier question, all I want to know is between forest/fortress/abyss, which 2 trees will take me further WITHOUT going with those copy cat justice teams?

This is now going to be my 4th month as a monthly card user, and before you say my team is crap (which it is), its solely cause ive been saving everything or almost everything. Some of the 6stars were built just for fusion anywau. Ended up buying all the orange artifacts I could get my hands on which is why I only jave 2xx HS scrolls but w.e.

Looking at my shitty setup, could you give me some potential fun team ideas that could work in the future? (Currently using LB,Queen,IB,Ormus,OD and Barea for the 3 3 red green buff cause starlight and ds are just trash)

After years of Fallout 4 on console I finally hopped onto PC, and my settlement addiction only grew. This is my first modded settlement and I intend on going for more in this same playthrough- I've not used any mods that increase my junk reserves, all this was painstakingly collected!

I've been a long time lurker here and loved all your work. Any thoughts or critiques on this build from you fine architects of the wasteland?

Starlight Central is a hub for the Northwest Wasteland (everything past Covenant) was intended as a sort of fortified base for provisioners to trek through and get aid out to settlements that need it.

Cheers!

Edit- Mod list (settlement ones!)

I use Nexus Mod Manager

-Thematic and Practical Workshop settlements

-Singing Settler

-Settler naming resource (to assign titles such as 'Guard', etc)

-Settlement Management Software

-Settlement sandbags

-Settlement Keywords expanded

-Settlement Garage sale

-Homemaker

**Portents Excerpt**

“I think we should go back.”

Orin’s thoughts weeped like water across Vaz’s mind. He could feel the fear telepathically, cold as deep space.

“No.” Vaz replied staring down at the crater below him. The crater was indistinguishable from countless other hollows pocketing the otherwise barren ash surface of Kaldron VI. This crater was no different...except for the body.

“Is it Terran?“ Orin asked.

Vaz was silent. It had been over a century since he had seen one, out in deep space near the Jinren Reefs, but the body was indeed Terran. 

Orin’s doubts continued with escalating declaration.

“If it is a Terran, then this represents a breach of the Sanghectis Accord. There isn’t a Terran outpost within seven light years. This...this is a breach of the Accord, and we must tell the elders about it at once.”

Vaz ignored his apprentice. Templar did not know fear. Fear was seared out during the discipline scourging. In place of fear the Templar learned I’rali, that unconscious projection of granite calm. If Orin’s had been bonded to him Vaz would have suppressed the young one’s deviant terror. 

Vaz ventured down into the crater and reaching the small figure bent to examine it. The body was covered in blood and dust and scars, tattered white space suit utterly out of place against the basaltic dirt. A female, if dormant memories still served him. His taloned hand turned the human over and palm to chest Vaz felt for pulse, but there was none. 

Vaz stood over the creature, his mind searching for reason as Orin carried on behind him. 

“...and if there is one Terran here then that means there are multiple. A rogue settlement, an expedition, or worse an incursion force. No, the elders must be told immediately…” 

Vaz’s spoke finally, articulating the measured syllables of the Erza Cantos 

“Fear is a singularity. A collapsing weight devouring everything into itself. Why, heart of Adun. Why must you trespass it’s horizon.”

The Templar rounded on his pupil, grasped him by the shoulder, claws pressing in on still tallow flesh. Pressed his hand against Orin’s breast a moment before pointing to the dead Terran. 

“This is not the self. This is a vessel. The true self was formed in the Khala and returns indelibly to her in time. But by acts of valor and meaning are we made significant. And fear of the unknown douses this like monsoon against the candle. Burn brighter Orin. Burn brighter if you ever wish to wear Templar vestments.”

Vaz shifted his focus back to the corpse.

“Besides...this is one Terran and a dead one at that. There is no danger here. Come we have our patrol to finish. When we have arrived back at the Gateway we will report this finding.”

The two climbed out of the crater, ascending the rim, and marched on across the Bna’gol Dunes. The land here rose in overlapping foothills until it met the Marcelis Buttes. There solar windswept sand exchanged for obsidian stone, cresting stalactite teeth and serrated ravines which swallowed Vil’tama starlight into fractured shadows. 

The Protoss strode on through these narrow crags, illuminated only by the crystaline matrix of the Templar’s armour. The auric breast plate hummed, the internal plasma shield generators vigilant for threats. Orin listened to the feline swooshing of Vaz’s cybernetic grafts, piezoelectic quartz fibers contracting in unison. When he could no longer hold his worries at bay, Orin broke the calm.

“It is not the dead I fear” he said “but the mechanisms that place a dead Terran on this moon which gives me pause. There may be others, there must be others. Master, I...I sense crisis in this.”

Vaz turned to look at his apprentice. 

“Ah, so now you dabble in prophecy! Tis remarkable progress you make for one who hasn’t shed his W’ret scales yet. Tell me, do you know how the exalted ones achieved prophecy?”

Orin was caught off guard. 

“You mean Tassadar? Artanis? They listened to the voice of the Khala.”

Vaz halted midstride. The Templar twisted to face the whorled stone walls of the canyon around them. 

“What made this canyon?”

Orin was confused. 

“What do you mean? Seismic activity I suppose. An ancient river could have eroded this passage eons ago. Volcanic forces may have rent tectonic plates asunder? If we had a probe we could survey the sedimentary…”

“The past, Ap’re Orin, the past made this canyon. Events in sequence caused a divide in this earth allowing us to walk though this space today. Prophecy is not about listening, it is about predicting. Only knowledge of the past foretells the future. The exalted ones possessed the ability to entune with the entirety of the Khala. A hundred thousand protoss minds calculating probabilities. In this dream miasma all possible eventualities would coalesce and collapse until finally the true reality inherent would rise to the surface. And the Exhalted would read them as one reads celestial kinetics.”

“Yes, Kla Vaz, I think I comprehend.”

“So what does the past tell us about the Sanghectis Accord?”

“That it was agreed upon in the wake of the Second Great War, that separation ensured stability. The Fallen Xel’naga had been defeated. The Zerg Swarms, severed from Amon’s connection, were decaying. Among ruined city and extinguished stars, the leaders of man and first born assembled on the planet Sanghectis and forged an agreement to ensure that interspecies genocide would never happen again.”

“The end result being…”

“The end result being the formation of the Astyanax Rift, a demarcation zone three hundred light years wide between Terran and Protoss space. Lined with all manner of Terran Mines, Automated Defence Turrets and Early Warning Detection Stations. And guarded on our side by the Umbral Fleet.”

“Another question Ap’re Orin, what do the Terran’s understand about crossing the divide?”

“That it means a Third Great War, master.”

“And if the Terran’s chose to violate our space? To make war on us. Is this really what you imagine the first sign would be? A dead human left in a crater. On a moon holding no significance to the Terran before the Rift closed? I think not. The past provides a much more probable explanation. This cadaver has been here a long time, since before the Second Great War or perhaps during it. Embalmed by this moon’s polar vacuum such that her skin appears as new as the day she died. I suspect we missed the body on our initial scans because it was buried in the ground and a recent meteorite shower must have unearthed…”

Vaz stopped suddenly. The canyon had broken left and opened out onto a valley. Down at the nadir of the basin, lay wreckage.

“That is a…”

Orin did not need to finish his thought. It was a Terran vessel. 

The Protoss gazed at the ship, neither exchanging words, then cautiously they descended down towards the ship. It was a freight carrier, an ice hauler, now beached and spilling her watery cargo out into the exposed lunar air. The scene around the ship was encased in sheets of ice and gossamer frost. The frost sealing the crash site with reflected moonlight and a timeless stillness as if the crash had always been here. The ground cracked under Orin’s feet as the Protoss approached. Through the gaping breach in her hull Orin could see mechanical arms with yellow drilling and loading attachments meant for deep space glacier mining. The mechanical arms twisted around each other like intestines from some gargantuan sea-creature now gutted and awaiting carrion birds. 

“Stay here”

Vaz commanded Orin who watched as Vaz warily entered the vessel’s cavernous hull. 

Leaking neon coolant pooled on the floor, leaving plutonium  green in the wash of Vaz’s footsteps. Several kiloton containers had been anchored to the ceiling, when the magnetic locks failed these corrugated tetra-iron blocks had crashed were gravity demanded thus forcing Vax over or around the haphazard cargo gravestones. A shredded tarp swayed gently towards the bow, propelled only by slow venting ozone from an adjacent service pipe. Vaz pushed back this tarp and found a door behind marked “crew quarters”. He heaved against the jammed door until the hatch snapped back on its track and painfully egressed. 

Inside was a massacre. Blood soaked bulkheads and corpses stacked atop each other. Most with a clean borehole between the irises, a few with cauterized throats slit. 

Vaz ignited his psionic katar, stalking through the crew quarters to the opposing passage. The door to the cockpit slide open effortlessly. The main steering controls had been smashed but nothing else was abnormal in the room. As Vas turned to reexamine the bodies the templar heard a click. On the far side of crew quarters behind him Vaz could just make out the dim shimmer of shadows, then his head exploded against the cockpit window followed microseconds later by his armor’s plasma shields flickering on.  

Orin crouched behind the fuselage. He had waited a long time since hearing the rifle shot  but the interior of the ship had since been silent. Vaz had not come back. Something was not right and Vaz should have been back by now and we should have gone back.

Orin had tried to reach the psi network but the aether storms of Kaldron IV continued to block all signal. He was alone and the star Vil’tama sinking below the horizon. When it was pitch black Orin finally moved, slinking between rocky outcrops and cracked boulders as he made his way towards the valley entrance. He was almost back at the canyon he and his master had came from hours ago, when he broke cover and sprinted for the breach in the stone.

We’ve seen Spike and Twilight have a mini-cooking competition. Applejack And Pinkie Pie are almost always cooking something up. Celestia seems to specialize in crafting ‘happy’ breakfast foods. Even Starlight has taken a turn at baking. But among them, who do you think would be the best cook?

I think if it comes to flat out culinary skill I’d give it to Pinkie Pie. Cooking is basically her job, or at least baking is.

The next best cook is likely Twilight, mainly because if you want to find someone that cooks by the book look no further. Her cooking probably is only as adventurous as her recipe allows, but I bet she can create a wide variety of food with precision.

Applejack is probably the next best, and only ranked below Twi and Pinkie Pie since her Apple-centric appetizers are decidedly one note. If you’re looking for fruit based home cooking though,  then she’s more than capable.

I imagine the next best would be a tie between Starlight and Celestia. They both seem like the type that put a lot of care and effort in their cooking, but probably only cook for specific occasions. (Though in Celestia’s case that *is* breakfast everyday, so she probably has more practice and would be a few shades better than Starlight.)

Spike is likely comfortably middle of the road. He’s got a lot of experience cooking, but mostly focuses on things he himself likes to eat and thus makes mostly junk food or dishes others would find inedible (due to being made from gems). He’s capable of performing on the same level as Twilight but is usually too lazy and unfocused to go to that much effort. He still makes the best nachos though.

Rarity and Fluttershy would be tied next to last as their cookery seems to be fairly simplistic and specific. In Rarity’s case because she seems to be fixated on Nouville Cuisine (which *can* be complicated, but given the limited Pony diet in the show her concoctions hardly measure up to the norm) and Fluttershy’s cooking being the very mild type reserved for tea parties and feeding pets with limited dietary needs.

Dead last would be Rainbow Dash and Luna. Neither seem to have any culinary skill to speak of, nor any real inclination to acquire any. Luna might edge Dashie out just a bit on that score, but that’s mainky because Luna has her sisters example to follow and has made some interesting (of terrible) efforts at breakfast food while Rainbow Dash’s contributions are mainly prank goods that are meant to be disgusting and inedible.",True,False,False,mylittlepony,t5_2s8bl,,,public,,self,,,Who’s the best cook out of the Mane cast?,https://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/7w57mj/whos_the_best_cook_out_of_the_mane_cast/,promo_adult_nsfw,,True,,,,,

I haven't gotten any responds yet, so I may try to post it here as well.



Hello everyone,

after finishing the vanilla game, I finally got my hands on some mods. I played a bit with them, experimented with others and as anybody who modded the hell out of games, knows, that the result was a broken game directory and minor hick-ups that needed a fresh install of the game.

So I installed the game, MO2 and switched from my HDD to the main SSD I have in my computer. 100+ mods later I encountered major lag spikes, mostly when enemies are loaded or when I jump from one cell to another. I even got lag spikes when I looked at the wall in Starlight Drive-In.

I suspect that the major problem with the current mod list is Immersive Gameplay. I searched for a solution but couldn't find anything regarding Immersive Gameplay.

I tried to lower the settings, but it made no sense because I played with the higher settings fine on vanilla. Note that I don't use major graphics enhancements like FlaconOil's HD ReTexture anymore, I thought it would solve the problem but it persisted. The only thing that adds new NPC's is Tales from the Commonwealth.

Maybe it has something to do with script load, but I thought that those times are gone after old Skyrim.

Said that, I really need your help. I don't want to lose another character. Playing the first quests over and over again is jarring.

My specs are:

CPU: 6700K

GPU: R9 280x 3GB

RAM: Corsair Vengeance 16 GB

Mainboard: Gigabyte Z170 Designare

And my [modlist](https://modwat.ch/u/RedBazooka25/plugins).

I think the coolest addition would be a work order option for the auction house. 

Examples: 
Bob wants a Papal Fez for 900k. Steve has a Papal Fez that hasn't sold in months when asking 1.5M. Steve can sell it at that price instantly.

Player Jeff wants 100 Starlight Rose at 25g a pop. Tom needs money fast so taking a 5g hit to get instant gold is worth it to him.

I think in the transmog department it would be amazing. It would give us some direction on which items to try to farm.

What do you think it would do to the market? Pros, and cons?

after finishing the vanilla game, I finally got my hands on some mods. I played a bit with them, experimented with others and as anybody who modded the hell out of games, knows, that the result was a broken game directory and minor hick-ups that needed a fresh install of the game.

So I installed the game, MO2 and switched from my HDD to the main SSD I have in my computer. 100+ mods later I encountered major lag spikes, mostly when enemies are loaded or when I jump from one cell to another. I even got lag spikes when I looked at the wall in Starlight Drive-In.

I suspect that the major problem with the current mod list is Immersive Gameplay. I searched for a solution but couldn't find anything regarding Immersive Gameplay.

I tried to lower the settings, but it made no sense because I played with the higher settings fine on vanilla. Note that I don't use major graphics enhancements like FlaconOil's HD ReTexture anymore, I thought it would solve the problem but it persisted.
The only thing that adds new NPC's is Tales from the Commonwealth.

Maybe it has something to do with script load, but I thought that those times are gone after old Skyrim.

Said that, I really need your help. I don't want to lose another character. Playing the first quests over and over again is jarring.

My specs are:

CPU: 6700K


GPU: R9 280x 3GB


RAM: Corsair Vengeance 16 GB


Mainboard: Gigabyte Z170 Designare

*""Long have we traversed the Black Betwixt, and long have we sought the beauty of the starlight. Long have we been alone, and long have we desired the company of others. Long have we crushed all our enemies beneath our mass, and long have we awaited a worthy foe.*

*""We are Leviathan, You of Much Flesh. We are infinite. We are all. Soon you too will know what it is be Leviathan, as will all things in this galaxy. All will know the glory of the ultimate weapon. There shall be no Lashner, no Aurara, no Human.*

*""We are Leviathan, and in time so shall you be.""*

- The Leviathan Entity, 2491

Millennia before humanity had even breached the barrier of our own atmosphere, Leviathan flew. Millennia before the Aurara rebuilt themselves into beings of plasma and circuitry, Leviathan wandered. Millennia before even the first Godseed hatched and destroyed an entire world, Leviathan killed. 

But what is this vast conglomerate machine that traverses the stars and batters worlds into dust, crushing beneath its metaphorical heel a thousand moons? What made it? What pilots it? What is its mission? What, to say simply, is Leviathan?

To those rare few who remember such things, the vast majority of them now Leviathan, Leviathan was once a whole species called the Lashner, who learned from They, the lost species of alien precursors, how to change their forms with metal and circuitry; to become cyborgs. The Lashner grew addicted to this technology, and when they discovered the coming of the malignant Silent Typhoon from They, the Lashner acted in a way some would call brash.

The Lashner knew the Silent Typhoon sought to destroy their minds; but one among them proposed the idea that, were they to bring their minds together, they would be able to fend off the Silent Typhoon together. They used their cybernetics to link almost every Lashner as one, fourteen billion minds brought together. Only a rare few refused. They ensconced their bodies in the mass of all their mighty starships, a great hulk of steel and flesh, and brought to bear their mighty new form against the Silent Typhoon, vanquishing it and sending it scurrying back into the depths of the void.

In its own words, however; Leviathan is all. Leviathan is everything that Leviathan has touched and taken into itself as yet another piece of Leviathan. Leviathan has consumed fleets, armies, asteroids and even some moons. Leviathan's form is one of a vast and horrifying conglomeration of flesh and steel and stone, great tubular vents pouring unknowable chemical compounds into the void as it powers on.

Leviathan is guns and armour, a hundred vast space-borne armadas fused into a singular monolithic whole. Leviathan is billions of minds all screaming and shouting and ranting and raving, an echo chamber of madness and despair and existential horror. Leviathan is a beast of the deepest pit, wandering the stars without reason and lashing out at all who dare cross its path so they might to become part of the glorious chaos that is Leviathan.

Leviathan is all.

And in time, all shall be Leviathan.

Even you.

Right now I am stuck for several days at 8-5 - High Heaven, one big jerk (i mean Gerke). I cant beat this stage. I have all 5 stars heroes on maximum level with quite decent gear (tier 1,2 red gear).  My team consists of Norma, Honor Guard, Walter, Mirage, Bleecker and Starlight. I can survive like 3-4 rounds, then he does big AoE and my team is done. I have artifacts to increase dmg vs priest. 

As I am stuck now for several days, I am getting demotivated and I am thinking if this is the point ,where I need to invest money to get good heroes to beat campaign. (paywall?)

As a little bit of background, I am a Soraka main with over 400k mastery points on her, and I've played her in every role with almost every build. This is my take on her, and how I think she could possibly change for the better.

#Soraka, the Starchild
**Role**: Enchanter
#Abilities
##P Guidance of the Stars
Allied champions below 40% of their maximum health are periodically marked with Starlight. Soraka gains up to 100% bonus movement speed while moving towards allies marked with Starlight within 1500 range, based on their missing health.

Soraka's spells and item active abilities cast on allies marked with Starlight consume the mark and remove Grievous Wounds before applying their effects.
### Per Target Mark Application Cooldown: 25/20/15/10 Seconds | Mark Application Range: 1000/1500/2000/Global (Both scaling with ranks in Wish)
*In light of recent changes to mage itemization in the current PBE update, I thought it was a good opportunity to returning Soraka's ability to cleanse Grievous Wounds. Originally, this was on her ultimate, but with Morello's Cursed Tome and Executioner's Calling, Grievous Wounds can be applied on every source of damage. I see no harm in allowing her to remove it more often than every 1 to 2 minutes.*
##Q Starcall
Soraka summons a star at the target location, landing after a short delay (.25 – 1 seconds, depending on target range), dealing magic damage and slowing each enemy hit.

If Starcall hits an enemy champion, Soraka grants herself Rejuvenation for 5 seconds, healing her based on a portion of the damage dealt. Allies marked with Starlight within 550 range are also healed by the same amount.
### Cost: 50/55/60/65/70 Mana | Cooldown: 5 Seconds | Range: 800 | Radius: 250
| Rank | Magic Damage |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 70 + 35% AP |
| 2 | 100 + 35% AP |
| 3 | 130 + 35% AP |
| 4 | 160 + 35% AP |
| 5 | 190 + 35% AP |
*I very much enjoy Starcall in it's current iteration, but it does allow Soraka to be a very strong lane bully. To help mitigate this, I removed Rejuvenation's movement speed bonus while moving away from enemies and slightly increased it's cost (no, the first nerf to it's cost wasn't enough, especially in solo lanes). I also moved the passive healing sharing from Astral Infusion to Starcall (this is something that's probably not the best choice, but it allows her to heal multiple allies from one hit, rather than needing to pay Astral Infusion's hefty cost multiple times to share Rejuvenation's current buff.*
##W Astral Infusion
Soraka infuses an allied champion with her own lifeforce, healing them over 5 seconds based on their missing health.

Astral Infusion gains no benefit from Cooldown Reduction, and instead has it's cooldown partially refunded when cast on allies marked with Starlight.
### Cost: 10% of Soraka's Maximum Health + 40/50/60/70/80 Mana | Cooldown: 5 Seconds | Target Range: 550
| Rank | Healing | CDR |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1% of the Target's Missing Health + 60% AP | 10% |
| 2 | 1.5% of the Target's Missing Health + 60% AP | 20% | 
| 3 | 2% of the Target's Missing Health + 60% AP | 30% |
| 4 | 2.5% of the Target's Missing Health + 60% AP | 40% |
| 5 | 3% of the Target's Missing Health + 60% AP | 50% |
*Ahh, Astral Infusion. Such a tilting ability in skirmishes. Combined with healing amplification, specifically Athene's Unholy Grail, this ability can easily heal for 500 health at rank 1 (which is one reason that Equinox is gone, reducing her ability to get to maximum blood stacks during a fight). In addition, the missing health scaling makes it a much less worthy ability for topping up allies in lane. Overall, it's much less of a burst healing skill mid game, and more of a boost to her allies' health regeneration.*
##E Salvation
Soraka calls down a beam of starlight at the target location, cleansing allies and silencing enemies hit by it.

Salvation's Cooldown is reduced by .5 seconds each time she heals an ally.
### Cost: 70 Mana | Cooldown: 20 Seconds | Target Range: 925 | Radius: 250
*Equinox is an interesting ability: Instant cast ranged AoE damage, and an AoE silence that lasts for up to 1.5 seconds, then a root for up to 2 seconds. It's not exactly reliable, but it gives Soraka players a lot of tools to zone and potentially turn a fight, not to mention completely shutting down burst mages. For it's replacement, I chose to remove the damage from it and instead allow her to use it to possibly save an ally who had been caught out of position.*
##R Wish
Soraka calls upon the power of the stars, healing herself and each allied champion, including untargetable allies.

Wish's healing is increased by 50% on champions below 40% of their maximum health.
### Cost: 100 Mana | Cooldown
| Rank | Healing | Empowered Healing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 150 + 55% AP | 225 + 82.5% AP |
| 2 | 250 + 55% AP | 375 + 82.5% AP |
| 3 | 350 + 55% AP | 525 + 82.5% AP |
*Completely unchanged. Wish is Soraka's iconic ability, and it hasn't changed with any of her reworks. I see no reason to change it here, either.*",True,False,False,LoLChampConcepts,t5_2t7e7,,,public,,self,,,"Soraka, the Starchild",https://www.reddit.com/r/LoLChampConcepts/comments/7vu5qu/soraka_the_starchild/,,,False,,,,,

*A few blocks from the Plat U campus, peaceful demonstration has turned violent as two opposing groups of activists have come to blows.

The vigilante herself was behind the police line, relaying information from her drones to the officers in charge as they dipped in and out to deal with situations the police couldn't reach.*

*So far, no one had been seriously hurt and the conflict was constrained to a few blocks. With luck, it would stay that way.*

*Just off the coast, a series of explosions rip through a small vessel coming into port. The detonations destroy the ship's lifeboats and tear a colossal hole in its hull. While it is unknown whether this is accident or sabotage, but the lives of everyone on board are in jeopardy!*

*A bright white light streaks above the water, the caped figure of [Starlight](https://www.reddit.com/r/SupersRP/comments/7goej1/lacy_lincoln_starlight/) drawn by the incident. In a flash, she dives beneath the waves and under the ship's hull, straining with all her strength to fight its urge to capsize and sink. But as strong as the heroine may be, every gallon of water rushing into the vessel's hold only increases the ship's weight bearing down atop her. She can't hold it up forever, and the men and women on the ship's deck, some injured by the explosions, are in dire need of rescue.*",True,False,False,SupersRP,t5_32yod,,,public,,self,,,Justice To Be Done,https://www.reddit.com/r/SupersRP/comments/7vr8cp/justice_to_be_done/,,,False,,,,,

So most of you know what’s up by now, there’ll be untagged spoilers up ahead but if you’re just looking for your favorite character just ctrl+f them.

Last time we left off with Elincia fleeing from the full force of Archanea by boat and they end up in the desert of Khadein and it’s a pretty cold welcoming party. Mages are out in force and are tossing more than just blizzard spells at them. Something’s up. Oh and Narcien decided to take a little pitstop here. He grumbles about not being able to find any of his siblings and flies off. Elincia decides to have her army cut through Khadein’s mage corps and see if Ced is around, they don’t really have much of a choice as Fernand’s pretty much right on their tail. They barge in, and apparently a young mage named Arden seized power and has declared Ced a traitor.

“C’mon Ced, let’s end this!” Arden shouts as he casts his Thoron tome. It kinda just sizzles as it makes contact with Ced though. Arden has no magical aptitude whatsoever.

Ced sighs. He has always looked towards Arden as a friend, a fellow pupil to Master Nomah. But Arden just couldn’t stand Ced’s talent, his magical superiority, and his… *speed*. *He* was the senior pupil, everyone always told him that he was strong and tough! Why?! Why didn’t he inherit Excalibur?!

“Arden, forgive me.” Ced apologizes. “I never meant to slight you. Yes. I intend to succeed Master Nomah and I am sorry that you feel this way. But I had hoped to lead Khadein with your advice as well! Look, I’m planning on heading back to Altea for now, Archanea attacked it and there are people there who are dear to me. Would you mind lending me your aid?”

Upon hearing about Altea Arden then accuses Ced of betraying Archanea for them. Ced now becoming frustrated realizes that he may have no choice but to strike down his ally. Ced begins canting his Excalibur magic as Arden tries his darndest to cast a powerful Thoron. Sparks fly and the wind picks up, but before Ced can cast anything Nomah runs into the room.

He chides the two for clashing so. Nomah wastes no time addressing Arden. Yes, Arden lacks the traits necessary to lead all of Khadein and lacks any magical talent whatsoever. But he’s hurt that Arden would lash out so violently, and that he behaved no different than Sephiran.

Arden’s hurt at this comparison. “Wh-whaddya mean that I’m just like Sephiran? Teacher… Are ya callin’ me… mean…?”

“Arden, listen to me child… Sephiran, along with Pontifex Miloah, were Lord Athos’ best pupils. But Athos saw Sephiran’s weaknesses and made his decisions. The man was then consumed by his rage and jealousy, stole the Darksphere, crafted Imhullu, and… now his heart is lost within that accursed sphere. Wrath and envy led him to ruin. Do you understand now, Arden…?”

Arden is suddenly in tears. “M-master Nomah! I’m sorry! Please, I won’t do nothin’ like this ever again!” And with that the conflict in Khadein was settled and everyone tells Arden to change classes since magic is clearly not among his talents.

Suddenly, Elincia begins to hear a voice. It’s Athos! Elincia cuts straight to the issue. How does she stop Shinon? He seems to have become even more cruel and ruthless than he was before.

Athos explains that Shinon has been corrupted by the darksphere, the darkness in his heart had been amplified tenfold. He explains the purpose of the five gemstones and how they work and that the lightsphere is capable of nullifying the darksphere. He tells Elincia to make her way over to him, in the Ice Dragon Shrine, past Anri’s way. Once again, Elincia will have to prove her worth and see if she is capable of succeeding Anri’s legacy.

Oh but before they set off they get a pair of mercenaries, save some random rebel Archanean knight, and kill a bunch of identical dudes wearing masks and a monocle that all went by the name of Canas. Elsewhere, the bitchy redheaded twintailed chick tells her Bishop master Lucius that the Canases are dead. Lucius tells Selena to get rid of all of them. Selena shrugs, they were all useless losers weaker than her. She’s the only assassin that master Lucius needs anyway. Lucius thanks her for being such a good child.

And so they set off on Anri’s way, starting at The Desert of Death! Seth and Elincia drop some lore, apparently Anri conquered this Desert, the upcoming volcanic mountains, and finally the icy wastelands all alone. All of these places are full of barbaric tribes and feral dragons so it wasn’t an easy task. On the way, they pick up Anna and they meet Nils at the end of the desert!

Elincia wonders why the young boy is all the way out in the middle of the desert. Nils points out that he’s not quite as young as he appears and says that he’s actually here to help them get to Lord Athos.

Elincia wonders just who exactly Nils is but Nils urges them to hurry on and he’ll fill them in on the way. He tells them dragon lore, how they eventually degenerate if they don’t seal away their powers into dragon stones and how they used to lead an advanced civilization. Of course, some couldn’t quite throw away their pride as dragons and became what they see now. They also learn about how Naga decided to give humans a shield with five orbs to keep the dragons she sealed away dormant and Falchion to let the humans fend for themselves and put young Keaton into the Fane of Raman to sleep. She also tasked Athos with preserving her will, confirming that this old man was actually a dragon and that Nils was too.

And so they push on, picking up some random people that just happen to be taking a vacation on Anri’s way. Seriously, why are they here?

Eventually the shrine is in sight, Nils talk about how he and Athos chucked their dragon stones, Athos actually did watch over and help the humans out when they needed it, but Nils was skeptical of the idea. He doesn’t quite like them, they were willing to cut down the harmless manaketes like insects. One of them even killed his sister. To an extent, he even sympathizes with Donnel. To keep the balance of power in check though, Athos created Khadein to teach the humans magic to better protect themselves. Nils on the other hand just passed the time playing music.

Elincia apologizes after hearing Nils’ tale. He brushes it off, Elincia herself is ok, she doesn’t need to apologize or anything. Nils dumps even more lore onto them. TLDR: There’s a shield with five orbs that seals dragons away, that shield unlocks the power of the five orbs but if one orb is gone the seal stops working. Most of the spheres have been located but they’re scattered; Shinon has the Darksphere, the Geosphere is in Altea, Gotoh has the Lightspere, they’ve got the shards for the Starsphere, and that just leaves the Lifesphere. But before they go inside they kill Selena with the help of some foreign voman. Since we killed one of the Selenas looooooooooong ago, this Selena dies out, all alone in the dark with nobody to comfort her.

I-it’s not like she wanted someone to comfort her or anything. B-baka. If you want to blame anyone, blame the person who gave us Seth. 

Inside, they meet with Athos after killing a few of the local wildlife. He gives them the Lightsphere, repairs the Starsphere, and points out that the Fire Emblem - The Champion’s Proof, is also the Shield of Seals. Since the shield has been broken for some time, the dragons at The Dragon’s Table should soon be unleashed and he advises Elincia to take Keaton to help them before they leave but also tells her, that if the Shield of Seals is not complete, that Keaton will also degenerate.

Elincia heads over to pick Keaton up, he’s pretty happy to wake up and stretch his legs. He mentions how he’s had some crazy awesome dreams of him tearing down walls and destroying castles. It was pretty cool.

Elincia recalls Jill telling her about this and she shrugged it off as her being racist. Perhaps she was right… Regardless, she’ll have to depend on Keaton for help… For now… Maybe putting this young dragon to a deep sleep wouldn’t be a terrible idea…

Athos gets ready to warp them over to Altea and Elincia asks if he would mind helping them personally. Athos says he would, but he still has something to investigate. Apparently Sephiran is on the move again. Elincia understands, they failed to kill him during their first encounter. He wishes them the best as they warp away.

Over at Altea castle, the commanding general is actually panicking. Elincia’s army is ready to march upon them with a vengeance and their one hostage isn’t really of much use to them right now. They captured her in hopes of putting a leash on Saizo, but instead the guy just up and disappeared! Instead, they were left a letter.

*Altea will not surrender. They will never bend their knee to Archanea or Gra. No matter how grim things seem, I will fight for Altea! I believe in Lady Elincia. Know that the only things that stay my blade now is my fiance’s well being, and the princess’ absence. But know this, if any of you lay a single finger upon her, I will teach every single one of you dogs the true meaning of pain!  - Saizo, the fifth, “The Angry ~~Ninja~~ Myrmidon”*

Yes, his title is “The Angry Ninja”. No, he doesn’t get anything cool like “The Panther” or “The Bull”. Seriously, who’s idea was that? They couldn’t have made it into “The Fierce Ninja” or “The Wrathful Ninja”? Godammit treehouse. 

General Eibel of Gra is currently shaking in his armor. He’s looking a bit green. And no, I don’t mean like Abel green. He tells his soldiers to make sure that Saizo’s lady is as comfortable as possible and that nobody is to touch her.

Back with Elincia, she is currently looking over her country, ready to reclaim it and liberate her people once more. 

“Your majesty. What, may I ask, are you doing with my lance?” Seth asks as he approaches Elincia.

“Seth.” Elincia says as she sees him come. “I asked your servant for it, and he gave it to me.”

“My lady, you must understand the implications of such actions and how tangled the web of rumors could become…”

“Then let the court say what it wishes. You are far more important to me than the whispers of nattering nobles.”

“My lady, please forgive my rudeness…. I am merely your subject. But this his extends past the knatters of such nobles. This affects your knights, those who serve you and lay down their lives for you.”

Elincia sighs. “I understand Seth. Forgive me. You fought to free this land from the clutches of Dolhr and Gra, you were dauntless, your prowess, legendary. Everyday since the castle first fell you have been protecting me. Even now you fight despite your injuries.”

“The wound has closed up my lady, it should not affect my lance arm…”

“Then show it to me.” Seth reluctantly removes the armor. “See, it may have closed, but it hasn’t fully healed. You fight as fiercely as ever Seth, but when you raise your lance, I see a flicker of pain on your face, as if you were enduring it….”

“Your highness, please put your mind at ease. My wound has healed. You have no reason to worry.”

Elincia relents, and tells Seth to not overextend himself. Without him, Altea may not be able to continue. “Take your lance Seth. Use it to fight for Altea once again, but do not fall.”

So Elincia and her army kick Gra out of Altea, they liberate Saizo’s fiance in the process. She introduces herself as Kagero. It’s quite touching really. She’s transcended the rules of this little project and has taken the role that Est would normally play here. But it all works out since she’s not breaking character. She too comes from a line of knights that have traditionally served Altea’s nobility and also got captured and forced Saizo to jump in to try and save her. They head towards the castle, and turns out Saizo has already beaten them to the punch, Eibel’s already dead. Saizo kneels before Elincia, welcoming her return and thanks her for freeing Kagero.

Everyone prepares to retake the castle. Saizo and Kagero have a little chat. “Forgive me Saizo, it must have been an agonizing wait was it not?”

“You’re safe now and that’s what matters. But why are you still here? The battle is not yet over!”

“Saizo, I sheathed my blade at your request in hopes that no events such as this would ever happen, and yet they still did. Clearly our original mindset was flawed.”

“What are you suggesting?!”

“Your family is not the only family to have proudly served the royal house of Altea for years. Come, instead of separating our two paths, let us unite them as one.”

“...Are you still able to swing that arm as you once did?”

“Of course Saizo. Now come. Let us walk through this life *together*.”

The rest of the army is standing at the gates. Most of Altea has been liberated, and only the castle remains. Tears shimmered down Elincia’s face, the young man who gently wiped away her tears could hardly hold back his own.

Oh and just to make this clear, it wasn’t Ike, Seth, or Soren. No, I’m not going to make it completely clear who it was. Have fun.

So they charge in with Elincia leading the way. The first person they encounter is Fernand, Elincia has Innes try and deal with them. Buuut unfortunately it *doesn’t* work out. His loyalty lies with Shinon. He doesn’t care where the Fire Emblem landed, Shinon gave him these orders and he will die by them.

“Fernand, if you die here, how do you think Mathilda would feel? Do you even believe Mathilda supports this war? What purpose does this war serve?!”

Fernand grimaced. “Hold that traitorous tongue Innes else I’ll rip it from your throat!”

“Then perhaps you’ll have the truth in your grasp!” Innes retorts as he readies the Parthia.

Fernand charges at the sniper with Mercurius in hand but is ultimately slain. Yeah, changing Nyna into the person who would become the main villain wasn’t the best idea. Astram’s replacement is dead. His last thoughts are towards his beloved.

They clear out the rest of the enemy forces, regain the Geosphere, but discover that Elise is nowhere to be found once again. According to Athos, she was abducted by Sephiran. Again. Apparently Sephiran has been rounding up clerics, and failing that, women of noble birth. Safy may also have been a victim of his. Ced curses Sephiran at the news.

Apparently Jill is next on his hit list and so Elincia decides to rush on over to Archanea to free her and slay Shinon. Normally they’d be interrupted by a really bad assassin but she’s dead.

They make a pitstop in Gra and notice all the soldiers fleeing in fright. I guess they heard the word about the “Angry Myrmidon” and began to shit their pants. The current princess of Gra, Sharena is waiting in her throne room, ready to defend her nation with the Hero Owain.

“Princess Sharena! The fell maiden draws near!”

“I see,” Shareena replies. Her once cheery smile that gave hope to her people was not present. “I apologize for wrapping you up into this Owain, but I cannot abandon my people, but you should leave.”

“What nonsense princess! I - the Legendary Hero Owain, cannot abandon a beautiful princess that was already abandoned not once, but twice by foul men!”

“Perhaps I deserved it for being such a trusting fool. I listened to Shinon, thinking that he was willing to help me rebuild Gra, but now that we’re no use, he’s willing to dispose of us. But even then, I cannot do the same to my people. I won’t move! The lives of my people are not meant to be foddered off like rubbish!”

“Enough princess! I will stand by you and face the might of this Angry Myrmidon! His legendary swordsmanship against mine? Oh how my sword arm twitches!”

Sharena cracks a smile. “Owain, is the thrill of a duel truly why you do this? I can’t imagine a mercenary surviving like this…”

“Aha, there’s that smile I was searching for. The one that shines like a radiant dawn that pushes away the foul darkness. That. Is what I fight for. But I hear rumors that this Princess Elincia may not be as cruel as her servants are. Let us see what transpires!”

Altea manges to push their way through but they don’t bother chasing down Gra’s scrubs, only killing the Archaneans in their path. Eventually Elincia meets up with Shareena. Elincia makes it clear that she’s willing to forgive their acts and put an end to this chain of revenge so long as the people of Gra feel the same. Shareena is relieved to hear those words, as much as she loved her people, she could not lead them. Realizing her faults as a ruler, she decides to entrust all of Gra to Elincia.

Owain begins to leave. “Wait, Owain! Where are you going?”

“There is no glorious duel to be fought here Lady Sharena! My sword hand twitches for more! I know not where destiny calls, but I hope to find it someday!”

“Wait please! Don’t go! Are- are we not friends Sir Owain? I was hoping that maybe you could stay, or perhaps become more than that. Like, uh, maybe ^close ^^friends ?”

“Sh- Lady Sharena?!” Owain clears his throat and regains his composure. “I- I mean why yes of course Lady Sharena! So long as you have need of my sword hand know that it will always be yours! Perhaps this is what destiny has in store for me!”

Realizing that they’re wasting precious time, Elincia decides to press onward to Pales castle. They are cut off by forces from Aurelis led by the Danguard but everyone picks up on their reluctance. They in fact seem to be stalling. Elincia speaks with the king of Aurelis and parlays with him. He’s more than willing to call off his forces. Elincia apologizes for any of the Aurelean lives that may have been lost, and of her squabble with Gheb from the previous war. Convinced of her goodwill, the king bestows upon her the Lifesphere! 

Eventually they break through and get to Knorda, and apparently many knights and citizens of Archanea have staged a coup d’etat! But it was already quelled in an instant. Most of the traitors are being set up for executions. Over in one of the Knorda villages, Elincia finds Julia ready and eager to pitch in. She’s never forgotten Elincia for helping her break away from Gheb. Moments later, Danved, Gonzalez, and Devdan also join up. And at the gate of Pales castle they see a familiar face. It’s Gheb! Apparently Shinon put him back into power realizing his mistake in picking Elincia as the Champion of Archanea. He says he’s willing to overlook her transgressions if she hands over the Fire Emblem and agrees to become his bride.

“You lecherous swine!” Elincia shouts. “I had hoped that you would one day realize your folly. But for you, I can see there is no salvation, no mercy!” Elincia says as she draws her sword and wastes no time in slaying the man. Nearby they spot a near dead Azama. He chuckles at Elincia’s arrival. Surely it’s a sign that the gods care!

Just kidding. No, Azama doesn’t break character here. He says he probably made the mistake of telling Shinon to pursue Elincia. Heck, letting Shinon even rise to power might have been a mistake itself. But the greatest mistake, may have simply resulted from Azama’s shortcomings as an advisor. At any rate, his rage had led him to this and Sephiran seized the opportunity to bring it out. He also handed Jill over to Sephiran.

“Ah? Is that the light I see?” Azama mumbles as he reaches out. “Guess I’ll walk… towards it…”

Elincia sweeps through the palace, rescuing Mathilda in the process who once again tried to 1v1 the strongest fighter on the continent. It wasn’t exactly going well but she does manage to piss off Shinon for calling him out on all of his shit. Eventually, Elincia herself confronts Shinon. They’ve had their talk once already, but this time Elincia adds in one more thing. That she pities him. Throughout her journey she always had someone to rely on, to cry on, someone who she could share her pain and laughter with. It was thanks to people like Seth and Soren that she was able to persevere even during her darkest moments and show her that there were sweeter things in life than those of revenge. Seriously though, Shinon didn’t even have a Rolf stand-in in this story. I blame the person who wanted to try and turn Reinhardt into a hero. Or wanted to create a yaoi ship between two hetero men. Anyway, Shinon doesn’t take this well at all and lashes out and is ultimately slain. No, he doesn’t have any sappy deathquote. He just curses Elincia with his dying breath. Elincia picks up the darksphere and completes the Fire Emblem, restoring it as the Shield of Seals.

Suddenly Jill, Safy, and Elise show up to celebrate! Oh but wait, it’s not actually them! The Fire Emblem dispels the illusion and reveals Sephiran! Sephiran, caught off guard warps away.

Turns out, Lord Athos has shown up too! He praises Elincia for a job well done but tells her that the Earth Dragons sealed at the Dragon’s Table are about to be awoken.

Oh but before that they go clear out some orphanage of assassins led by a brainwashed Lucius. Apparently the man was once a kind man but after his first orphanage burned down he went crazy thanks to Sephiran.

Ok, now back on track, Elincia and the party rush towards the Dragon’s Table and they get to the Wyvern’s Dale located on the border of Macedon and Dolhr.

“Lady Elincia, are you ok?”  Pent asks.

“I am, Lord Pent. This is the Wyvern’s Dale isn’t it?”

“That would be accurate. Most Macedonians avoid even stepping foot here since it’s overrun with barbarians and feral dragons. I myself have barely come across a proper or detailed report on the area, but it feels similar, no worse compared to Anri’s way…”

“Even here you are engaged in your studies.”

“Ah, forgive me Elincia, the fate of the world is at stake isn’t it? I must cause you and my siblings much worry, do I not?”

“It’s fine Pent, after all, you are here to help us, are you not? Anyway, let us move on, I worry for my sister and yours.”

Up in the sky they see a wyvern rider land by a distant village. Pent recognizes the armor on the wyvern and rushes ahead. “Brother!” Pent shouts as he nukes all the oncoming enemies. When Pent arrived at the village, what he saw however, was not the brother he knew as the proud and overly narcissistic Narcien. Instead he appeared defeated… humbled. “Brother, you’re wounded!” Pent exclaims as he attempts to heal him.

“Pent…?” Narcien chuckles. “Don’t bother dear brother… A wound like this? It would permanently scar me even if you could heal it. I’d much rather die. Instead, go, get Elincia. I have something… to pass on to her...”

“Don’t say such words Narcien!” But Narcien shrugs off Pent’s attempts to save him. He hands him the Starlight tome and tells him give it to Elincia, it’s the only thing that can combat Imhullu. “No! B-brother! This isn’t like you! What happened to my proud brother who would laugh at every situation! The one who’d claw his way to the top and never give up! I can’t accept this tome! You, you take it to Elincia yourself!” Eventually Elincia catches up and Narcien does hand the tome over. He comments on finally being able to see Elincia’s beauty firsthand and laments on how he could not see it sooner. He realized that he was so captivated by his own beauty, that he forgot that there were other beautiful things in the world as well, some that he nearly destroyed. But since Narcien’s not a ridiculously powerful badass like Michalis was, he dies. Though of course, you’d have to wonder how exactly he managed to get Starlight in the first place. I’d just say he somehow got lucky. Yes, really, I mean, he manages to avoid and dodge conflict so much in FE 6.

The army edges closer to the Dragon’s Altar, Athos warns her of the oncoming dragon horde. He suspects that Sephiran is planning to use the maidens he captured as sacrifices or pawns to revive those dragons. Inside they also meet Micaiah once more. Elincia thanks her for gifting her her personal Falchion but apologizes for letting it fall into Sephiran’s hands once more. She promises to retrieve it and uses it to end this madness.

Guarding the way however is the Black Knight! Ced is stunned, he thought he killed him in the last war. The Black Knight removes his mask and laughs. He merely threw that fight. He sensed that the young mage had not yet reached his full potential. Why do you think he wielded a blade not meant for his hands? No really, the guy was using Falchion when he couldn’t. Yes, that was completely intentional and not a mistake on my part. You can’t prove otherwise.

Anyway, he challenges Ced to a duel, his personal dark blade crafted and enchanted by Sephiran himself or Ced’s Excalibur? Ced accepts, there’s some magical barrier thing that seals the two off and the rest of the army is left fending off feral dragons and the rest of Sephiran’s minions. But eventually Ced comes out on top. No they do not share a heart to heart or anything, they don’t have a shared mentor, there’s no sense of kinship at all. Oh but Lucina feels a hint of recognition upon seeing the Black Knight’s face but dismisses the feeling. That can’t be the Zelgius she was looking for… was it?

Before they proceed, Elincia approaches Seth and asks him about his wound once more. But he halts her advances and tells her not to worry. She does not owe him a debt for this wound, for the very thought should not even rest beneath the crown she soon must wear.

“But still, you suffered for me…” Elincia mutters reaching out for her knight.

“Lady Elincia, you are a noble of Altea. You cannot favor one subject over another. How can they maintain their fealty if you treat one so differently? Surely you have learned this already no? That there may come a time where a battle demands sacrifices. If you cannot send your men to die, then you are not fit to rule.”

“Forgive me Seth. I had forgotten my place.” The two look away in silence. “That night… We fled from the soldiers of Gra… You held me tight, keeping me safe from the enemy’s blades… Perhaps… I did feel something more for you then. Perhaps it was improper for a queen of Altea. Because you put me and Altea above all else, you say you will sacrifice your life for me. Yet… even if I am able to save all of Archanea and bring a lasting peace… if that cost of victory is the lives of my dearest knights, I shall never smile again. And joy? Never again would that emotion fill my heart… But I understand, I will not hesitate to do so if the time comes. But I cannot bare to do it without pain.”

“Thank you for understanding, my lady. Now, if you will excuse me…” Seth begins to leave but then he stops. “If you would allow me to say one more thing…” Elincia looks up. “...That night… I felt what you felt. When I held you in my arms as we rode into the night… I forgot my duty, I thought of you not as my queen, but someone I wanted to protect from all harm. I wanted to leave everything behind and to take you someplace where we could be together… Those were my thoughts…” But Seth puts his foot down. He swears that he won’t ever forget his duty again. The next time she sees him, it will be as a Knight of Altea. Sure Seth. Whatever you say Seth. Your ending in Sacred Stones says the exact opposite.

They proceed into the next room, it’s Sephiran! He’s playing no more games, he has Imhullu ready to go and has both Falchions on him. Since Ced is exhausted from his bout with the Black Knight, Pent volunteers to finish what his brother could not. He does the deed and Sephiran actually dies here. No, he also is not saved. There’s no Sanaki figure to try and do that here.

Finally, they reach the final chamber where Donnel lies. Three clerics appear to be in a deep trance nearby - Safy, Elise, and Jill. In order to defeat Donnel, they’ll either have to save them, or kill them.

Ced wastes no time running up to Elise. He tries to snap her out of it, he tells her why he even set out to study magic in Khadein in the first place. It was all to impress her, and to protect her. Looks like that family scroll that he left with her wasn’t enough to keep her safe. But then she opens her eyes, she’s glad to see him. She was afraid, Sephiran was frightening. But she clinged onto Ced’s scroll and it comforted her with the same feeling she felt whenever he was around.

Ike then runs up to Jill. He apologizes for being so distant, for not being there for her. He was always proud to be a Blackwing, but with Jill gone that meant nothing! Without her the skies were empty, desolate! Eventually Jill comes to and thanks Ike for saving her and proving that he was her most trusted companion. 

And finally Cath approaches Safy. The girl is close to tears! She begins berating herself, for being just some random thief, and how she never really stopped stealing from everyone, but that she needs Safy. That maybe if Safy were around she’d stop. Eventually Safy comes to and even throws in a small chide as she hugs her adopted sister. 

The clerics then thank Elincia for saving them and help her attack Donnel. The Shadow Dragon then rises in rage, (in a country accent)  “I HAVE… REVIVED… FOOLISH HUMANS… I WILL LEAVE… NONE O’ Y’ALL ALIVE… ESPECIALLY YOU, ANRI’S DESCENDANT!”

Elincia however is undeterred. She plunges her Falchion into the Shadow Dragon and slays him.

“GWAH! WHY HAVE I BEEN DEFEATED SO EASILY? IS THIS THE POWER OF NAGA’S BINDING SHIELD? KNOW THIS, HUMANS THIS LIGHT IS ONLY A BRIEF RESPITE SO LONG AS EVIL LURKS WITHIN THE HEARTS OF MAN. SHOULD THIS ACCURSED SHIELD BE LOST, WE SHALL RISE FROM THE DEPTHS OF HELL. DON’T Y’ALL GO AN’ FORGET ABOUT ME NOW!”

Athos praises Elincia for banishing dragons, and restoring the shield. 

Keaton’s pretty thrilled about not having to take super long naps anymore. Elincia takes the time to talk to Athos about her concerns. That kid *enjoys* going on huge rampages! Athos wonders if he or Corrin went wrong somewhere raising the child. 

Amidst the celebration Elincia searches for [ShippingSpoilers](#s ""Seth!"") She locks eyes with him with a longing sadness from a distance and mouths something to him. But then she turns away and leaves. Seth dismisses his princess’ actions. It matters not. He is a Knight of Altea, and she, his liege. For the sake of Altea he cannot.

“Come now Seth, let’s not be so unreasonably stuffy,” says a voice from right beside him. It’s Pent. 

“Lord Pent?!” Seth regains his composure, “Whatever are you referring to?”

“You’re a sharp and perceptive man sir Seth. I’m sure I need not spell it out for you.” He pauses. “But perhaps I must. How I would love for the Lady to stare at me with such a longing gaze, but alas such a gaze is not meant for me. They are meant for you Seth!”

“And they are unbefitting to fall upon a knight!”

“For what reason Seth? To prevent squabbles amongst the Knights of Altea? What Knight among you would deny their beloved princess her happiness? To cease the venom spat by petty nobles? Then let those fangless dullards spit!” Seth tries to come up with a retort but Pent doesn’t relent. “Seth, none among all of Archanea can touch the princess or deny her demands. She is Archanea’s hero but you are hers. The one knight that made this all possible, the hero that was with her every step of the way. I would take her hand in marriage myself, but I fear that diving into a loveless marriage would result in me meeting the same fate as Shinon and would result in the lady’s misfortune.”

“Lord Pent, you mustn’t compare yourself to such a villain.”

“Then should I compare myself to a peerless knight instead? Seth. It is about time you tore down this barricade that you’ve built around you. The princess herself is doing everything she can to do so but she may soon relent thinking it hopeless. Do you truly want what’s best for Altea, Seth? Then perhaps all it needs is to see their beautiful princess’ radiant smile. Go, go and seize your happiness together, you are wasting time. Who knows when rival suitors will start emerging from their own fortresses, you may one day lose your chance.”

Seth begins to move before he can realize it. He thanks the Macedonian prince and breaks into a sprint. He finally finds Elincia and begs for her forgiveness and the two share their feelings and embrace. Everyone begins to return to their respective lands. Hardtius disappears amongst the action to a land in the west. Sharena cedes rulership of Gra to Elincia and disappears with Owain. Lady Jill and Ike disappear one day leaving Pent in power who then leaves it in Elincia’s hands to pursue his studies in Khadein. Elise moves to Khadein with Ced as he becomes high pontifex. Mathilda, grieving her loss, joins Safy and Cath’s church. Soren of Talys never marries and Talys eventually merges into Archanea. Elincia and Seth would quickly announce their engagement and everyone celebrated, none could deny that either of them were dedicated to their subjects and Archanea would know a long lasting golden era under the Hero Queen Elincia.

Context:

In 1941, at the height of the Ottoman-Axis War, Sultan Osman VI defeats the Second Young Turk coup in Istanbul,  but Turkey is pushed back on all fronts by the Pan-Arab Axis. Desperate for an expanded bombing campaign, Osman approves the creation of three all women night bomber regiments,  the 126th, 127th and most famous, the 128th 'Süveyş', despite immense criticism from the Muslim Ottoman government. All three regiments used outdated TI7E-GBS biplanes but they have a high stall speed,  allowing them to outmanoeuvre the faster Egyptian planes to complete runs. With the wind moving through the planes' wings sounding supposedly like the djinn were flying with the bombers and guiding the bombs,  the regiment earned their nickname of 'Night Witches'. The Night Witches are the only regiment to complete bombing runs on all three Axis nations' capitals, Riyadh, Cairo and Tehran. In 1942, the regiment was honoured by being reorganised to the 23rd Guards Night Bomber Aviation Regiment and in September of that year,  the regiment was given the name 'Süveyş' due to  contributing immensely to pushing back the Egyptian army past the Suez canal. 15 members of the Night Witches were awarded the Order of the Sword of Lions and 35 were posthumously given the Hero of the Ottoman Empire Medal.",True,False,False,Kaiserreich,t5_2wgr5,,,public,,self,,,"Solaret song dedicated to the all-women's 128th Night Bomber regiment, which served in the Ottoman-Axis War",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kaiserreich/comments/7voi9c/solaret_song_dedicated_to_the_allwomens_128th/,all_ads,,True,,,,,

However, the JWST is nearing the end of its lifespan and requires a replacement, and the PSA plans to use recent developments from SBSP satellites to build the largest telescope ever made to replace it. 

This new space telescope, called the Outlandishly Enormous Space Telescope (OEST), built in cooperation with Starlight Systems, will be this replacement. Using Starlight's technology, originally developed for building multi-kilometer parabolic mirrors in space for SBSP use, the PSA plans to achieve a 10 kilometer mirror providing never-before-achieved resolving power. Positioned at the Earth-Sun L2 point in a halo orbit, the OEST will provide the next step in exoplanet study and astronomical observation thanks to its enormous size.


Structure &amp; Construction
--------------
The OEST will be designed as a truly enormous version of Starlight System's SBSP systems, with much tighter mirror tolerance and optical parameters. Support for this outrageously enormous mirror will be accomplished through a tensile carbon nanotube approach, using a web of nanotubes both in front of and behind the mirror to support it as it is rotated. The mirror itself will consist of 1 meter hexagonal segments, which offer the ability to steer the mirror without rotating the entire OEST. Behind the structure will be 14 layers of insulating blanket, preventing the mirror from getting heated by the sun behind it.

Construction will use more than 500 fully automated nanotube nanoconstruction/printing and 1,800 mirror manufacturing robots, with an on-site team of 12 engineers to repair the robots that go wrong, leveraging Starlight System's experience with similar enormous mirrors. Overall OEST mass is estimated at 12,500 tons, beating the previous heaviest-thing-in-space (the lunar space elevator) by a factor of approximately 3. 

Maneuvering
----------------

The next major challenge is steering such an enormous mirror, with an overall mass in excess of 3,500 tons. Normal reaction wheels won't work, not least because the OEST does not have sufficient strength to twist the mirror in such a way. As a result, large-scale maneuvering will need another means of control.

This will be accomplished by leveraging the in-front-of-mirror tension wires, which will be used as magnetorquers against the Sun's magnetic field. While the sun's magnetic field at EML2 is minimal, the satellite is so enormous that the effect is large enough to rotate the OEST, albeit rather slowly. 

Sensor Flyer
------------

Unlike a normal telescope, whose sensor is fixed to the mirror assembly, this is deemed impractical for the OEST due to its insane size and the difficulty of building a several-kilometer-long structure to hold the sensor in place. As a result, the OEST will use a free-flying sensor, sitting around 4 kilometers in front of the primary mirror and using ion propulsion for maneuvering. This design allows the OEST itself to remain stationary while using mirror steering for targeting, in turn reducing the amount that the entire OEST has to be re-aimed.

Unfortunately, the OEST shields the sensor flyer from the sun for obvious reasons. While this is great for the flyer's IR performance, it also means that powering it is a major headache. Power will derive from a PV array on the back of the OEST - facing the sun - and then relayed by microwave link (from La Technologies) to the flyer.

The flyer's sensors include a comprehensive array of astronomical instruments, spanning a wide range of sensors and spectrometers. It is planned to refresh these instruments on yearly service missions which will also refuell the flyer.

Materials Sourcing
------------------------

The main challenge in the OEST program is sourcing the approximately 13,000 tons of material to build the OEST, the majority of which is raw carbon with another circa 800 tons of aluminum for the mirrors. Carbon will come from the [Solar Resource Systems](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/7r63rh/tech_carbonate_asteroid_extraction/) carbonate asteroid mining project, at a rate of approximately $7/kg over the program's lifetime, and the aluminum will come from the NU's lunar alunimum mines purchased through LRA at a rate of $15/kg. Overall materials costs will then come to about $350 million thanks to this in-situ resource utilization.

Program
----------

The OEST program is projected to cost $10 billion, with $5 billion spent on developing and launching the flyer's systems, and a further $5 billion on the mirror and associated construction systems. The OEST is projected to have first light by 2048, with the mirror finished by 2046.

[And for anybody who missed out on Book 1.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/7nzrdb/what_happens_when_rfe_replaces_shadow_dragons_cast/) So I’m going to skip over any details and exposition that covers Book 1 from here on out.

So most of you know what’s up by now, there’ll be untagged spoilers up ahead but if you’re just looking for your favorite character just ctrl+f them.

Alright everyone, welcome to Book 2, Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem: Heroes of Light and Shadow: Swapped Edition! Today another hero has been born thanks to all of you according to Anna! And his name is Nichol! [This is what he looks like!](https://i.imgur.com/jSTggMf.png) Hey, don’t look at me like that, they didn’t have the right hair color. So I gave him blue.

Beginning with his past, he is a Farmer’s child.

His most impressive attribute? Well the choices were Beauty, Wisdom, Diversity, and Kindness. So we’re going with Diversity.

And finally the future trait that he wants to attain? Well the choices were Humane, Honorable, and Recluse, and he’s certainly not humane or honorable so a future recluse he is.

Ok, thanks Anna, now that that’s all taken care of, we can properly start this story with Nichol as our ~~main character~~ avatar! Our story begins with Nichol getting ready to enlist as a new knight of Altea, but [someone bumps into him!]() She introduces herself as Kata...lena. Yes Katalena. A few other aspiring knights to be such as a big burly guy by the name of Bartre and some spoony bard by the name of Homer.

“NGUOOOOOHHHH!” Bartre roars. He’s pretty hyped and excited to become a knight of Altea and potentially the strongest knight of all Archanea. But first, “YOU, MAGIC MAN!” He says, pointing at Homer. “What’s with that get-up? Don’t tell me you plan on becoming one of those magic types Homer!”

Homer nods. “Bartre, we’ve known each other for years. You should already know I’m not the sort who’s great with the heavy lifting. Of course I’m going to be a mage.”

“Well that’s because all you do is play music and sing! C’mere! We gotta whip you into shape! Now hit me! Hit me as hard as ya can!” Homer sighs, this again. But instead of punching him, Homer pulls out a fire tome and lobs a fireball in response and it hits him in the face. Thankfully this is Fire Emblem and one hit in the early game is never really lethal. Bartre’s impressed though! He concludes that it’s probably fine for Homer to become a mage, it’s really just a different path of strength. Homer, sick of Bartre’s antics decides to move on ahead.

Nichol and Katalena follow along. We see Seth giving a speech on who’s here and why, and tells them to pair up and all that. Nichol and Katalena pair up. But Nichol gets no stat boosts out of it since this isn’t 3DS Emblem, which is probably why Seth mops the floor with him when it’s his turn to spar with him.

Bam, the end, Game Over.

Just kidding. If that actually happened, Altea would end up with a really small army consisting of but one man. Sure, Seth was the greatest knight and all you really needed in Magvel, but this isn’t Magvel. This is Archanea, enemy quality is actually threatening. Seth notices potential in Nichol and Katalena and decides to let them pass even though Katalena didn’t really do anything. Normally we’d be presented with a very generic “inspiring” speech from the heir to the throne, but that’s Maeda! Marth. And nobody likes Maeda! Marth. Seriously, compared to Shadow Dragon’s dialogue, the speech here feels kinda… average. It's not bad, but it's not on the same level as localized Shadow Dragon.

&gt; “Everyone. I’m truly happy that so many came to help shoulder Altea’s future. With the war over, peace has returned. However peace isn’t something we can simply take for granted: It is my duty, as ruler, to risk my life to protect it. Alone, I am powerless. So everyone, from now on, I want you to lend me your strength, as my knights.”

But maybe the SD localizers were really on point, or maybe there was a bit lost in translation. But it doesn’t matter here anyway since even if Elincia did give a good speech, Nichol and Katalena are both pretty stoic people who probably wouldn’t worship the footsteps of their lords like Chris and Katarina would. 

Ok, maybe *our* Katalena would secretly. But instead, in the distance we probably hear a really loud “NGUAHHHHHH!”

Moving on, Nichol and Katalena discover that they’ve been assigned to the 7th Platoon along with Bartre THE BRAVE!!! and Homer. Oh and there’s also a young bald myrmidon who introduces himself as Fuga. Unlike Ryan there’s no sign of hesitation whatsoever, he’s ripped and he knows it. Apparently they need to pick a commander, of course Bartre volunteers, or at least volunteers the strongest person there so he tells everyone to punch him as hard as they can. Everyone finds that stupid, Homer instead suggests Katalena, or at least starts hitting on her anyway. Katalena, disgusted with Homer, and unimpressed by Bartre, volunteers Nichol since she has no clue what Fuga is like. Bartre challenges them to a duel instead, Homer insists that they play along since words won’t really get through to his thick skull. Yes Bartre, he’s callin’ you stupid. Nichol prevails and Bartre decides to give him the title “Nichol the Terrible"". Fuga acknowledges Nichol’s and Katalena’s strengths and cedes leadership to them as well.

So they all pass the following tests and training session with flying colors, they pick up Fuga’s older brother Rolf who doesn’t really look all that much older, and Titania, much to Homer’s delight. But of course he doesn’t really get through to her either. Nichol also meets Elise, she probably begs him to watch over her little sister, I’m sure older Elise would be somewhat overprotective yeah?

And they go through even *more* training but normally at this point they’d be out in the woods lost since one of Chris’ few character flaws is that he’s a poor sense of direction, but luckily the one who’s in charge is Nichol so that doesn’t happen. We skip over this Prologue chapter entirely and a masked Canas laughs maniacally as a village burns down. Luckily Ced was in the area to help out and he completely thwarts his plans. *Drats* Canas mutters as he skulks away. In the meantime, Ced goes to report this to Elincia straight away and mentions something about a masked man that he failed to apprehend. Seth, now aware of this, is on high-alert and tells Elincia to be cautious. Since the 7th Platoon had nothing to do with this event, we get no speech or request from Elincia asking these new recruits to become her “Royal Guards”.

Besides, she already has Seth.

Everyday from then on, Canas attempts to torch a few more villages only to be foiled by Ced once again! Eventually they finish up their training with Sir Hawkeye and turns out only a handful of recruits made it through! Everyone’s pretty thrilled.

The night before their knighting ceremony, Katalena was out late. She bumps into Nichol and they strike up a deep and riveting conversation. Katalena asks about where Nichol’s from, and why he decided to join the knights of Altea. Farm life apparently sucked while Gra was occupying Altea, so joining the knights seemed like a great idea.

Katalena herself was actually not from Altea. She comes from Knorda. In case you forgot, that’s where Mae died. I’m sure you all can guess how rough it was to live there. But in case you forgot that as well, Knorda’s where all the sketchy slavers thrive and prosper. Not a great place for a child. Fortunately, unlike Mae, someone was there to take her in and saver her from those wretches. Katalena would do anything for that person. She asks if Nichol has anyone like that in his life? Someone who he shares a dream with, someone that he feels that he can share a vision with!

“Yeah.” Nichol answers. “Me.”

“Ah…” Katalena utters. “I see. Well, at least now, I feel that I understand you better, and I hope, you, me.” The two turn in for the night. Nichol’s not really fun to be around huh?

The next day, everyone’s over at Altea castle, and excited to become properly knighted. But suddenly a messenger arrives with dire news! Three Altean villages are being pillaged! Blasted barbarians! Looks like Ced really pissed off a bunch of bandits. Sorry bud, doesn’t matter how op you are, if you don’t have like 20 move you’re not going to save all those villages on your own.

Seth being the model knight that he is wastes no time mobilizing the Altean knights. All the footlocks will head towards the nearest village, Seth will lead the charge to furthest one, Saizo and Stahl will defend the last one. The 7th Platoon will guard the castle and princess Elincia and will send a messenger to Seth in case anything is to happen. Bartre’s a little upset to be stuck doing guard duty but aside from that nobody else really minds. But Katalena asks Seth if the knights are in top form and wonders if their forces would be enough.

“Of course, Dame Katalena,” Seth answers. “Why wouldn’t they be?”

“I- I was simply wondering if the knights had their breakfast yet,” she stutters.

“Ah yes, the breakfast that we had discovered late last night to be laced with poison,” Seth mentions. Katalena steps back. “Plenty of the recruits had already been sent home, Saizo has already investigated the background of the remaining individuals, *you* are the only one that we know nothing about.” Seth states, brandishing his lance. “Lady Katalena, you will forfeit your weapons, and allow Titania to search you for any traces of substances.”

Katalena retreats, readying her tome. No, she does not drop any details like any good or competent assassin would. No, she doesn’t really hold any special attachment to this group like Katarina did. Most of the 7th Platoon is shocked. Especially Bartre. Nichol doesn’t really care though and Homer is surprisingly unsurprised. Elincia herself maintains a calm composure and lets Seth do the rest. The enemy is routed, and Katalena is executed after they find her stash. Yeah, sorry Katarina/Selena fans, from here on out, every Gaiden will not have Selena. Er well, it’ll have one *less* Selena anyway. This is what happens when your Jagen is ridiculous both in plot and in gameplay. 

But hey! Finally, the really boring high school drama slice of life series is over! Now we can *really* get back to the real story!

[Cue the introductory music!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18kwfLgShTM) You guys know what happened. Every kingdom was heavily affected by the wars, including the mighty kingdom of Archanea. Pressured by the bishop Azama, Shinon was forced to pick a bride to fully inherit the throne. His first choice? Elincia. Elincia however knew the sort of man Shinon was and immediately turned down his offer.

Completely undeterred, Shinon pursued his next option; Jill. It was a half decent match. The two were able to bond over their shared hatred of filthy subhumans. Soon, they became engaged. It was not a marriage born out of love, but they agreed to this arrangement in order to bridge the gaps between their nations. With that out of the way, Shinon was actually able to make reforms, favoring a society based more on meritocracy rather than inheritance. Many Archaneans were unsettled by these radical changes, in fact, rumors began to spread that perhaps Jill of Macedon was a terrible influence on Shinon, after all, she did command a kingslayer in the War of Shadows. The Macedonians weren’t quite a fan of this arrangement either, fearing that they would soon lose their independence despite the promises of Jill and Pent.

About a year after the War of Shadows ended, the war-ravaged kingdom Altea was finally beginning to stabilize thanks to the efforts of Princess Elincia! No, there’s no marriage announcement or anything though. No, Soren and Elincia are not the otp here. They are not as close as Marth and Caeda were. Their “relationship” has come to a halt.

But the people of Altea are still pretty thrilled. Heck, they’ve got TWO Falchions now, not just one! One day however, Princess Elincia received another letter from Shinon, now Emperor of Archanea.

“Dear Princess Elincia of Altea,

The kingdom of Grust, now under imperial rule, has broken into a massive rebellion. I request your kingdom’s assistance in its subjugation. You are to lead the entire force of Altea and sortie at once. - The Emperor of Archanea”

Both Elincia and Seth were troubled by these orders, but as Archanea was Altea’s suzerain, they were forced to comply. Elincia took most of her knights towards Grust and left Saizo and Stahl to guard the castle.

Once they arrived in Grust, they were met with General Peri leading the occupational forces at Grust. Don’t ask me how she got her spot as a high ranking general in Grust. She really shouldn’t be here. But it’s not like that stopped her from making it into the position of the crown-prince’s retainer over in Norh. I don’t know, maybe Shinon thought she was hot too.

Anyway Peri tells Elincia that her job is to go and kill general Fae, she’s a bit sad since she couldn’t do it herself but Emperor Shinon explicitly told her not to do that and let Elincia do that. In the meantime she’s allowed to go ahead and kill anyone else though so she’s been happy.

Elincia and Seth are completely shocked at this revelation. Like yeah, Fae leading a rebellion is pretty shocking, but what’s more shocking is that Shinon put this crazy chick in power. Peri doesn’t really understand what’s going on and it’s bothering her. So she says she’s going to go ahead and slaughter the nearby village to cool off.

“Are you insane?! They’re innocent civilians!” Elincia shouts.

Peri did not take this comment very well. “I-Insane?! That’s a mean thing to say Elincia! That hurt my feelings!” She replies. Peri is suddenly in tears and appears to be on the verge of a tantrum. “You’re making me feel STABBY!” Peri shouts as she twirls her lance and charges at Elincia! It’s a crit! Seth realizes this right on time and pushes the princess out of the way leaving him to take the full force of the blow.

“Gragh!” Seth shouts in pain. Peri satisfied with the blood spilt, rides off before the rest of the Alteans can even respond. She’s never quite heard a shout that satisfying before, she hurries to go and write to Emperor Shinon about how great her day was. The rest of the Alteans scramble to help Seth, it wasn’t a lethal wound, but it won’t be one that Seth can recover from. All of Seth’s stats and bases from Book 1 have been eliminated and now his bases have all been screwed up. Elincia is extremely upset at this. First they boss her around, but then they go and stab her finest knight? Yeah ok, that’s practically a declaration of war.

After they take care of Seth he urges everyone else to focus on the situation. They clear out the brigands taking advantage of the situation, check up on the locals, and then go talk to Fae. Turns out there aren’t that many locals left. Lang mainly targeted the women for his own sick and personal wants. Peri however was indiscriminate in her slaughter. Fortunately some people were able to make it out ok, one of them being a young girl, somewhat perverted, has sick fantasies of male on male action. Elincia’s somewhat unsettled but accepts her into the army anyway since they are in need of some clerics.

Over by Fae, she’s all alone, kinda bloodied after a tough fight with Peri, and there’s not really anyone to ease her fears. Normally Ogma would be here chatting with Lorenz and talking about how he’s here on the King of Talys’ orders. Unfortunately we don’t have an Ogma so we don’t get this scene. Good job Nack. Normally Fae would also tell somebody to take the Grust twins over to Bishop Wendell (in our case Nomah), but Peri already made away with them.

Eventually Elincia reaches Fae and catches up on the situation. No, she’s not asking why Fae is leading a rebellion. I mean, who wouldn’t? It’s Peri! Instead she’s asking why the hell Shinon put her in Grust in the first place!

Fae’s doesn’t really know, but it’s Shinon. He probably held a grudge after being held prisoner by Grust for so long. This… isn’t exactly out of character for him, the dude’s pretty mean.

Yeah, he probably would do something like that Elincia adds. Heck, it’s probably why he sent her here in the first place. He’s probably still sore after that rejection. But hey, one good thing came out of Peri over here! Elincia doesn’t waste any time making a decision here. Archanea’s clearly in the wrong and Peri did just attack them, they’re siding with Grust here so Fae doesn’t need to do any crazy sacrifices! ...Except she’s already kinda bleeding to death after her fight with Peri so she dies anyway, with her last breath, she asks Elincia to save Valter and Sara. Good job, you guys killed the chicken general.

Seth points out that as soon as Shinon finds out about Peri’s actions, Altea would be in immediate danger if it isn’t already, he’s not going to wait for Elincia to declare war formally. As if to confirm this, Stahl comes riding over to bring them the exact news they were hoping not to hear - Altea has been invaded and has already fallen. Stahl once again apologizes for being such a mediocre knight. As for Saizo, Stahl lost contact with him and is unsure of his status. As eager as Elincia is to reclaim and defend her homeland, her forces are probably not enough to take on all of Archanea. According to a few locals, they point out that Macedon has sprung into a revolt of its own against Archanea. Apparently they weren’t too thrilled at the wedding announcement. Seth suggests paying them a visit, perhaps they can calm the situation down and gain some help from the Blackwings, Jill, and Pent while they’re at it.

So the Alteans march on towards Macedon, if they’re going to tackle Archanea they’re going to need a huge force. On the way they bump into Tormod of the Blackwings, he fills them in on the situation at Macedon. Narcien loyalists have led a revolt! They haven’t taken kindly to the wedding marriage at all and have imprisoned Lord Pent demanding Jill to call off the engagement. Unfortunately the only response from Archanea that they were given was a declaration of war! Tormod however insists that Jill would never betray them but he needs help calming the situation down. They push past some Macedonian forces and make their way to the castle where Pent is being held, picking up some random local hunter on the way.

Over on the Northern side of the castle we have Ike and Cath having a little chat, apparently Cath had set up a monastery for orphans with Safy using her totally hard earned, honestly made, money. But Safy is nowhere to be found! Cath decides to be annoying and make our lives harder by trying to gather information in a very distant village as Ike fends off rebels as we make our way to him.

Oh, and for those of you unfamiliar with this map it looks like [this](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fireemblem/images/a/ac/FE12_Chapter_3.png/revision/latest?cb=20120721070009). You pretty much have the choice of walking *all* the way around the central island mass and then visit the village to recruit the local theif to recruit the local idiot pink haired cavalier brother, or you can lower the bridge, cross it, and risk said idiot pink haired buffoon committing suicide onto your units.

And no. Don’t you tell me to just give him targets that won’t kill him, that idiot has no sense of self preservation. I gave him free targets in Shadow Dragon and that fool still chose to kill himself. Michalis was right to send him off to die on the frontlines. His AI is just stupid.

So before Elincia and her squad gets to the boss, a lone wyvern rider flies up to him! It’s Narcien! Looks like he *didn’t* die! Ah man Ashnard, looks like you lost your one bragging right in this world. Narcien chuckles, Rucke must be captivated by his style and grace. “There’s no way a man of his caliber could have been killed by that ungraceful fool Ashnard.” No, he didn’t just turn tail and flee when Ashnard challenged him to a duel. He then demands him to hand over his dear brother. Rucke says he would, but they were actually just bluffing. Pent’s nowhere to be found, but even if they did know where he was, there’s no way they would’ve been able to hold him.

“A-ah,” Narcien stumbles. “Of course, he is *my* brother after all. In that case carry along, I have no interest in this kingdom, do as you will I care not.” So he flies off. Well that was nice of him to check up on his brother like that.

*Anyway* since we’re viewing this as a full recruitment run they do get to the village, pick up Cath, and have her chat with Makalov after they reunite with Ike and clear out some of the forces. Makalov mentions how he always seems to lose money after he sees Cath. Cath redirects suspicion by bringing up his drinking and gambling habits and he shrugs it off. Well, at least that money is better off with Cath rather than him huh?

So Elincia and co finally get to Rucke, but turns out he’s already dead! Someone got to him before they did and no, it wasn’t Narcien! Standing nearby is Pent! No, he wasn’t imprisoned, *or* missing. He just decided to take a hike. To Archanea actually. He wanted to secretly check up on his sister Jill and make sure everything was ok. Of course when he got back he was pretty upset that his subjects had attempted a coup and so he took matters into his own hands and executed their leader. But more importantly he greets Elincia and asks if she’s faring well. He’s heard about what had happened to Altea on his travels and volunteers to assist as much as he can with the might of Macedon. Elincia graciously accepts the offer but then suddenly Pent kneels down onto his knees and holds something out.

Elincia gasps in shock, *no* it couldn’t be! “Lord Pent, does this mean - ”

“Yes Lady Elincia.” His eyes then lock with her. “Do you accept?”

“What is going on Lord Pent? Why do you hold The Fire Emblem? The Champion’s Proof? What is happening to Archanea?”

“When I met with Jill in Archanea, her eyes were red with tears, I figured their little arrangement would not last in happiness. I was unable to spend as much time with her as I would have liked, but she did give me this to entrust to you Lady Elincia. I ask you once again, do you accept the Champion’s proof? Will you take up your blade once again to lead all of Archanea to a lasting peace?”

Elincia took up the Fire Emblem and nodded. Suddenly Peri comes riding up to them! Everyone readies their weapons but Peri’s a bit baffled, what’s their problem?

“Good job Alteans! Maybe I should give you guys headpats for being such good fighters! Oooh, but before that can we fight more mister Seth?!”

Everyone tenses up in confusion. She *does* realize that after a stunt like that nobody would want to associate with her… Right? Elincia asks Peri why has she confronted them this time, especially after attacking her. After her actions, Elincia refuses to discuss matters with Archanea and cuts off all ties.

Peri tilts her head. She still doesn’t quite get it. Weren’t they friends? Sure they were a little mean for calling her insane but she had fun with them! Elincia sighs and decides to make it clear. “General Peri. From here on out, we are enemies and Altea refuses to take any more orders from you or Archanea!”

Peri gasps! “How *could* you?!” She calls them really stupid meanies! Maybe they’re the ones who stole the cute little Grust kids from her when she was planning on having “fun” with them! Peri goes home to cry and mutters something about writing to Emperor Shinon about how mean everyone was to her today.

Seth asks if they should give chase. Elincia declines, the pressing issue right now is the safety of the Grust twins, she made a promise to General Fae after all. Perhaps Pontifex Nomah might be able to help them and so they head out towards Nomah’s village that just so happens to be plagued with pirates. Oh and they pick up Rhys on the way while dealing with some random assassins. Some bitchy twintailed redhead makes some backhanded comment on how tough the Alteans seem.

Over by Nomah’s village, a masked man with slicked back black hair is in custody of the Grust twins. He tells the children to be careful and apologizes for bringing them to such a dangerous place, but Lord Nomah resides in a nearby area and he trusts that he’s willing to take care of them. Valter however is completely unfazed, he’s actually thrilled to have so many people to fight and kill. He *hungers* for blood! The masked man is a bit shaken.

“I-I’m glad that you are uh… eager to defend yourself young Valter, but I ask that you leave this to-”

But before he could finish Valter was already out there picking fights with the local pirates and was doing quite well. Sara apologizes for her brother’s rude behavior, ever since Sephiran stuffed them into a dark and dinky room during the War of Shadows, he never seemed quite himself. “That poor child…” The masked man mutters. “Ah, I realized I haven’t yet introduced myself to you, young lady, you may call me-”

“Reinhardt.”

Reinhardt clears his throat. “Young miss, you must be mistaken, my name is actually Hardtius, I have never even heard of this Reinhardt fellow but I am sure he is an upstanding man!”

“It’s ok sir Reinhardt,” Sara says smiling serenely. “I knew who you were the moment I sensed your light. Your secret is safe with me.” Sir Reinhardt/Hardtius adjusts his mask in silence as Valter clears out the bandits. Eventually Elincia’s army makes their way to them and they join up. A few of them question who this masked man is but they let the topic drop, the kids are safe and that’s what matters. It’s not like one of them seems to be a bit crazy or anything but they’ll make do. Oh and Soren also somehow found his way over to the area, no don’t ask me how he knew they’d be in some random part of Macedon. Let’s just say he’s a brilliant tactician who predicted that they’d end up somewhere near Nomah’s village. Soren stated that he set off as soon as he heard Altea was attacked citing that Elincia would probably need the help of a tactician. Yes. A tactician. No, not a friend or a shoulder to cry on, Soren. But Elincia’s glad to see her friend once again regardless.

With this little excursion out the way, Elincia rallies her troops towards striking back at Archanea, but first they strike at the monstrous Peri over at Olbern Keep! Also known as the “Nest of Evil”. 

On the way they pick up Heather, they see Innes eyeing them as he does nothing to stop them, and they cut their way through to Peri’s house of fun. At this point, most of Grust has been liberated with only Olbern Keep to storm. Originally it was where Lang would take all the women he forcefully abducted and have his way with them. Instead Peri probably just rounds up a lot of people to have a massacre. Fun. Was there ever a woman as cruel as she is, Elincia wonders. “I cannot forgive her. I shall strike her down without fail!” Elincia cries as she raises her sword and orders firmly: “Knights of Altea, charge!”

On her throne, Peri chuckles with glee. Soon, those meanies will die and paint her palace red with blood. She then turns to the masked lady near her. “Lady Ayra, when they open that door, I want you to show me that super cool Astra technique. It’s going to be so much fun!”

The brown haired lady shrugs, whatever she says, those Alteans won’t stand a chance. Peri comments on how even the Black Knight might have struggled against her. Peri shivers with excitement, it’s almost time for some killing!

So Elincia’s forces charge through, Laslow and Petrine join up with them as they fend off the enemy reinforcement and Elincia spots “Ayra”. She looks a bit different but can’t really tell because of the mask but she asks Soren to go and talk to her anyway. It doesn’t really go anywhere, this Ayra doesn’t budge, she comments on how she simply wishes to test her blade on strong enemies. Soren gives Elincia a look, it’s not really working, and as a matter of fact they’re beginning to doubt it’s even Ayra. But then Homer butts in.

Homer tells her to drop the act, he admits that she’s cute, but nowhere near on the same level as Ayra.

“I-I just wanted to be just like… her…” The girl mutters.

“Who?” Homer asks. “Ah, wait, you don’t mean Ayra herself!” The girl nods. “Well, what if I told you there might be someone better? And no, I don’t mean me,” Homer says as gazes upon Elincia. He tells her to keep an eye on her if she wants a role model. With that out the way, they confront Peri, they kill her, they pick up her Cancer and stumble upon Bishop Nomah. 

Nomah says that he was on a quest assigned to him by the archsage Athos. He was tasked with collecting all the Starshards that were created due to the Starsphere shatting after creating the Starlight tome. The Starsphere is but one of five orbs meant to prevent the world from falling into ruin. During his quest he somehow found himself in Peri’s dungeon after getting lost. No, she didn’t actually capture him.

Elincia points out that they’ve already had a few, with the most recent one being the Cancer that they picked up from Peri. Elincia promises to help after they liberate Altea and they set out, planning to take a stop at the nearby Fane of Raman. Oh and they kill some random masked dude with a monocle after picking up a pair of Radd and kingly sellswords.

So off they go to that ancient temple to go and loot it for just reasons but they then discovered that someone beat them to the punch! Well, looks like they’ve got to stop them, their cause is more just anyway. And turns out they’re assaulting a defenseless dancer while they’re at it! That poor woman!

Oh wait no, it’s actually Gunter. Yes Gunter in a dancer outfit. Turns out that this dancer isn’t so helpless and manages to fend off a few thieves on his own. Ayra, who was merely passing by *was* going to help the indecently dressed old man out but was so impressed by the old man’s swordplay that she couldn’t help but watch after cutting down only a few thieves herself. 

Off by the Northern edge of the map Fernand readies his troops. He’s been ordered to hold the bridge and to not allow those Alteans to get past him. Shinon probably just told him that they plan on siding with the peasants and he was fully on board.

So they murder all the thieves, kill a dragon in the process, the thief boss even calls them out on their inhumane slaughter with his last breath! The guy could’ve started up a kingdom with all that loot.

At any rate, they do get a starshard in the process, and Seth drops some lore info for the young knights that didn’t quite pay attention during their history lessons. But long story short; Naga came down from heaven with the Falchion and the shield with five orbs and killed some evil dragons and left.

Also, Ayra meets not!Ayra! She questions who the imposter is, demanding her to remove the mask. The imposter fumbles for her words. “Perhaps we might… speak privately Lady Ayra?” Ayra shrugs, very well then. If she pulls something dumb however, she’ll end up pulling back a stump, but so long as that’s clear.

Ayra is off with her poser off in the woods. “Here… Look closely, and all will be made clear.” She says as she removes her mask. Ayra’s squints, unable to believe her eyes. 

“It can’t be!” Ayra says as she notices the mark in the girl’s eyes. “That’s the mark of Od! Then you must be… Lucina!” Yes Od. They may or not be related to the legendary Jugdrallian Od. These two may or may not be swordsmen empowered by magical holy blood. But it’s *certainly* possible! If IS can say that Lucina’s the descendant of Baldr, then I can say that Lucina’s the descendant of Od.

Lucina breaks into tears and hugs Ayra. “Oh, sister! Sister…” Lucina explains the rest of her situation. Apparently after their brother was murdered, leaving Ayra to take care of their nephew, Lucina was captured by the scoundrels of Knorda. They noticed her natural talent for the sword and decided to use her as a gladiator. During her time there, she had heard tales of a legendary swordswoman, unmatched in talent and beauty and Lucina knew it was her. She did well as a gladiator herself, but one day there was a huge uprising that allowed her a chance to escape. One of the men leading it was set for an execution but she heard that he too later escaped. Ever since, she has been searching for both Ayra and the gladiator Zelgius.

“Lucina.... You deserved better from me than a world of troubles. I- I thought you were dead. I should have searched for you myself! I should’ve broken you free from those slavers!” The two share a heartfelt reunion and eventually reunite with the army as they being to cross the Chiasmir Bridge.

And oddly enough Fernand lets them go through without a hitch. What was that about not letting them pass? Oh wait, turns out it was a trap. Maybe Fernand was told to not let them pass until they got word that the army on the other side of the bridge was ready. Looks like Altea’s in quite a bind. Heck, turns out the big bad himself decided to show up. He looks grumpier than usual. 

Elincia figures that perhaps now is the best time to settle this war but Stahl interrupts. Apparently Shinon is being protected by a mysterious power, a power similar to Sephiran’s Imhullu in fact. They weren’t able to hurt him when he attacked. Soren suggests that they charge through and take a boat to escape towards Khadein and seek help there from Ced there, perhaps a tome like Starlight would do the trick.

And so, one of my favorite maps from FE 3/12 kicks off. Elincia and her army are stuck on the little landmass connecting to the central part of the bridge. Down South by the Fane of Raman, Fernand and his troops are raring to hunt down Altea and he’s got the Mercurius to boot - one of Archanea’s three regalia. Up North is Emperor Shinon, he’s probably holding onto the Gradivus since Innes in the North West is guarding the fortress with the Parthia. This map could have only been made cooler if it were a Thracia style escape map. They also pick up Corrin here. The old dragony lookin’ one. And so the Alteans charge through, breaking through the Northern forces, staying out of range of the Southern army, and are even able to convince Innes to join them using Rolf. He’s been pretty fed up with Archanea’s heavy handed actions. Oh and Gatrie joins up with them too the moment he saw Elincia. Knowing the man’s character already Elincia welcomed him, he’s a harmless albeit kind oaf.

No. We are not having Rolf talk to Shinon and then duel him. That's not going to work.

“Heh heh heh… Princess Elincia, it’s been far too long.” Shinon greets her from afar. He’s probably shouting.

“You craven… I have a clear idea for why you attacked my country, even if it may be a petty one. But that matters not. I may not be able to answer to your brutality now, but I will remove you from my kingdom!

Shinon laughs. “Hah, the little princess thinks she can give the Emperor of Archanea orders. Fool, I’ll show you what happens when you try to make a mockery of me! You’ll all die! Archaneans attack! Don’t let a single soldier get away!”

Unable to land a solid hit on Shinon, the Alteans were forced to flee by boat with the strongest soldiers leaving last, buying time for the rest to escape. No, Nichol doesn’t do anything special here. No, I haven’t forgotten about him. He’s just… not important. And he realizes that. Nichol’s a good avatar.

In earlier letters, I would have probably called you love, or my heart, or Darling. 

You and me, we were the love story of a lifetime, we were the core of every teenager’s dream. We had it all: Kisses in the pouring rain, the taste of Tequila and smoke, whispered promises under starlight. Racing hearts and shaking hands. Knowing smiles exchanged behind the world’s back. 

We had everything, except for the most important part. Desire is nice, but it couldn’t save us from ourselves. From the tears, the jealousy, the paranoia. From plans of revenge, promises of sabotage and threats of destruction. 

I know that now. I know that even though I wanted it so bad, it was never meant to be. Two broken hearts don’t make one whole – it isn’t that simple. And maybe I should have been more open, or maybe you should have been more trusting. Or whatever. In the end, it doesn’t matter. 

Because I grew up. And I learned to love myself. And drunk sex and sweet nothings in my ear stopped being good enough. I wanted more from that boy I adored so much. And I told you that. 

Your decision was clear. There were two paths, and you chose the one I was not ready to follow. Instead of getting better, you chose to embrace the pain. And I get that a broken childhood hurts like hell, because I went through it too. But you could have chosen to rise above it, become better than what they made you. 

But you didn’t. And the man you became murdered the boy I loved. 

It hurt like hell, you know. Sitting wide awake at night, thinking about all the years I wasted on you, and about all the dreams that shattered the second I realised that we could never be the same again. And it left me empty and lost and angry. 

But do you know what? It took some time, but then I understood. 

None of this was wasted. You helped me, actually, without even realising. You made me take that final step to growing up emotionally. Through you I learned that some things are not worth the effort of repairing, and that sometimes, broken things need to be replaced. Through you I learned that no matter how hard I try, some things are just not meant to be, and I must accept that. Through you I learned that, sometimes, letting go hurts less than holding on. Through you I learned that even now that I have healed, there will still come times where I am hurting again. And through you I learned that sometimes I must endure the pain, because it will get better again, I just have to hang on. 

And most importantly: Through you I learned how to love others, even though you didn’t make that learning process particularly easy. 

And it pays off, you know. I met someone. And this time, it’s not all lust, secrets, and drama. This time, it’s the gentle touch of two hands and forehead kisses. This time, it’s an affectionate hug in public. This time, it’s meeting his family and being introduced to his friends. This time, it’s making plans, together. This time, it’s the feeling of loving and being loved back. This time, it’s talking about feelings without being nearly passed out drunk. This time, it’s making love and laughing under sheets instead of just fucking like animals. 

This time, it’s serious. And I plan to keep it. 

And I wouldn’t have been able to make it this far without you breaking my heart. It hurt, but it was worth it in the end. 

But it also means that now, it’s time to let go. 

I want you to know that I loved you. Very much. But you are not the person I knew anymore, so I will say goodbye now. And I will make room in my head. I won’t forget you, but I will stop giving you as much space as I used to. You will become a bittersweet memory of the past, so that I have room for a promising future. 

And I will love again. In a healthy way, this time. 

Even after all that happened, I truly, only wish you the best. But I hope to never see you again. 


Never again yours, 

The love of your youth

&gt;Everything that has happened, will happen again. It is the way of things. Yet humanity’s death will eclipse the eldar’s annihilation tenfold, for we are evolving into a far more psychically powerful race. Uncontrolled psychic energy will tear reality apart. The warp’s entities will feed on the carcass of the galaxy. There must be control, and control must be maintained.+

&gt;Through vision, Ra. We see the warp as an alternate reality, and this is so. It is a mirror, reflecting our every thought and action. Every hate, every death, every nightmare and dream, echoing into eternity. We break into this place, into a realm that harbours the pain and suffering of every man and woman and child to ever live, and we use it to sail between the stars. Because we must. Because until now there has been no other choice.+

&gt;‘The webway,’ Ra murmured into the silent night.

&gt;**The webway. Mankind is ascending, Ra. Humanity is taking a great developmental step, evolving into a psychic race. Uncontrolled psykers are lodestones for the warp’s touch. A species comprising them would suffer as the eldar suffered. And for the eldar, this evolutionary juncture was their final step before destruction. I will not let humanity be destroyed by the same fate. The eldar had the answers within their grasp but were too naive and too proud to save themselves. They had the webway, which could have been their salvation. But they never fully severed their connection to the warp. Their soulfires drew damnation upon their entire species.’**

&gt;Ra knew this, yet never had it been related to him in these exact words, flavoured as they were by the promise of prophecy. With the webway, humanity would need no Navigators. They would never need to rely on the unreliable warp-whispers of astropaths. Vessels would never enter the warp to be lost or torn apart by the entities that dwelt within it. But the eldar had done the same, had they not? +No. They eradicated their reliance on the warp but they never severed their species’ connection to it. I will do that for humanity, once and for all.+

&gt;Ra twisted in the nothingness, turning to stare at the light of so many distant stars. He faced Terra without knowing how he knew its direction, only knowing that he was right. One of those pinprick starlights was Sol, so far away.

&gt;**I have conquered humanity’s cradle-world. I have conquered the galaxy, in order to shape mankind’s development as it at last evolves into a psychic race. No isolated pockets of our species may remain free, lest in their ignorance they invite destruction upon us all. I have shattered the hold of faith and fear over the human mind. Superstition and religion must continue to be outlawed, for they are easy doors for the warp’s denizens to enter the human heart. This is what we have already done. And soon I will offer humanity a way of interstellar travel without reliance upon Geller fields and Navigators. I will offer them means of communicating between worlds without reliance on the warp-dreams of astropaths. And when the Imperium shields the entire species within the laws of my Pax Imperialis, when humanity is freed from the warp and united beneath my vision, I can at last shepherd mankind’s growth into a psychic race.+ The primarchs, thought Ra. The Thunder Legion. The Unification Wars. The Great Crusade. The Space Marine Legions. The Imperial Truth. The Webway Project. The Black Ships, with psykers huddled in the holds, watched over by the Silent Sisterhood. It is all about–**

&gt;**Control. Tyranny is not the end, Ra. Absolute control is but the means to the end.+ The hubris… Ra couldn’t fight the insidiously treacherous thought, to see the hidden depths of his master’s ambitions. The sheer, unrivalled hubris.**


Fabius Bile: Clonelord
&gt;‘They hate you, Fabius,’ Palos observed. ‘The daemons – I’ve never heard them make that sort of noise. Usually it’s all laughter and whispers.’

&gt;‘Why should they be any different to the rest of us?’ Savona said.

&gt;‘The Neverborn are stories made flesh,’ Saqqara said, holding up the flask. The formless thing within slammed minuscule fists against the walls of its prison. ‘Stories of murder and fear, despair and hope. Of excess and cruelty. They are warnings and retributions, hammered into shape by our belief. They are what we make of them.’ He looked at Fabius. ‘And he makes of them… nothing. He denies them, denies the story of them. It infuriates them, down to the very root of their conception.’

&gt;Fabius smiled. ‘As I will always deny them. I will not play the willing meat for such lazy parasites. If they want my belief, they must show me something more than they have already.’ The thing in the flask grew agitated, causing it to shudder in Saqqara’s grip. Fabius leaned close, smile widening. ‘But that would require some degree of true sentience, I fear. Something these thought-forms are singularly incapable of. They are nothing but cunning mirrors – hollow and empty. But they do make wonderful scouts.’

Chaos loves religion

From Mark of Calth
&gt;**taste the worship of their little god-king, it grows and spreads and feeds us, yes yes let him be a god, smash the rational, plunge them into the dark **

Context:

&gt;Blanchot was a dock officer on Veridius Maxim and was the officer who received the message from the Campanile about everything being ok. At that point the Daemon the Word Bearers infected the Campanile with was able to enter Blanchot's body, this is a Daemon that can possess somebody if they speak to him, even across vast distances, and it made sure that Blanchot survived by helping him escape the station. Blanchot's black-outs during his escape were the Daemon taking over briefly to make sure he lived. It helped him find the arcology and then used the whispers to drive Blanchot crazy. He himself believed he became an agent of the God-Emperor and led his little purge of the non-believers which in the end was everyone else but him, which I imagine was something the Daemon didn't expect as it just hoped to possess a Space Marine which it managed to at the end.

&gt;So while the Daemon was the true villain of the story, the entire purge was based around human fear and paranoia taking precedence over rationality. A glimpse of things to come. In fact that particular line the Daemon whispers about the Emperor, along the lines of ""Yes let him be a god,"" is chilling because it implies that the Daemons want the Emperor to be considered a God because they know that it will lead to what happened in the arcology becoming the norm all across the Imperium. The replacement of rationality and logic with superstition and paranoia, which we all know is what will happen eventually.

So where is this meme that the Emp plans to starve Chaos come from? Even in the codexes, it talks about the Emperor protecting humanity. Nothing about starving Chaos which is practically impossible short of annihilating all life in the 40k galaxy and even that may not be enough.


This post to me explains things best

&gt;One, Atheism does help; the Chaos Gods derive more power from worship than base emotions. They may be able to subsist on base emotion, and appeal to something that naturally allows them to draw power from most life in the galaxy, but without worship they're just gathering scraps from every individual.

&gt;Even if it didn't, however, Atheism would still be the better option. Racial Gods can be subverted or killed, religions can be infiltrated and corrupted, and those who are disillusioned or nihilistic might turn to other avenues of power. By promoting Atheism, he's depriving the Chaos Gods of not just power but also leverage. The Emperor doesn't care if the Chaos Gods want to squat in their palaces and squabble with each other for eternity, so long as they cannot influence humanity.

&gt;And even if that had no noticeable difference compared to worship, then he would still be opposed to the concept of religion on ideological grounds. This is a man who sowed the seeds of the Omnissian Faith simply to manipulate Mars; if he desired more power, a tool of control over the masses, even self-aggrandizement, he could have easily claimed himself to be an incarnate God and all of humanity would have fallen over to worship him. He didn't. He opposes religion, particularly theistic religion, because of the behaviours and patterns it promotes: worship, superstition, subservience to a greater being, the inherent acknowledgement that humanity is inferior in some way and must pay homage to those greater than them, and the Emperor hates that. He hates the concept of humanity bowing its head so much that he didn't show himself for tens of thousands of years because it would have been blindingly obvious to all of humanity that the Emperor was so much better than them, so much greater than them. That's why his ultimate gameplan, once he's finally saved humanity, is to just fade back into the shadows.

&gt;Convincing the Emperor that religion is a good idea will not happen because of ""the benefits."" He is aware of the benefits, and does not care about them. Channeling of emotions to a racial god rather than a Chaos God? Why does he care about that, when his ultimate goal is to remove humanity from any dependence on the Warp, from any way of even being in contact with the Chaos Gods to feed them? Racial gods in general to fight the Chaos Gods? He's the only person, the only being, he would trust in that position, and he hasn't taken it. Beyond that, why would he care? Divorce humanity from the Warp, wait until they supposedly evolve into a fully psychic race surpassing even the eldar, and then the Chaos Gods will be as gnats to them, nothing but irrelevant, squabbling children screaming for attention.

&gt;He has a plan. It's a viable plan. It's a plan that was so viable that the fucking Chaos Gods united as one to stop him.

&gt;The Emperor is not Wrong. He is, in fact, more knowledgeable than you at every Lore Skill you share, and many more. He simply has a different opinion.",True,False,False,40kLore,t5_2zdqr,,,public,,self,,,Where do people get the impression GEoM plan is to starve Chaos?,https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/7vi0u6/where_do_people_get_the_impression_geom_plan_is/,all_ads,,True,,,,,

I originally didn’t want to get married/have a wedding (I was wrong, 10/10 would wed again), our venue doesn’t normally host weddings, our caterer doesn’t do catering, and our band assembled for just the night of our wedding. Everything turned out even better than I could have imagined. Our friends and family were so supportive and amazing and we all had a blast.

**The Stats:**

Both 30 years old, together 7.5 years before being engaged

**Engaged** 10/15/16

**Married** 9/16/17 Originally we were thinking Fall 2018, and did absolutely nothing for the first few months of our engagement and when we found our venue and they had this weekend in September available we decided to go for it and planned it all in 8 months. I felt like this was plenty of time and I'm really glad we didn't wait

**Location:** A summer camp in central, PA that I went to as a child. The ceremony was in the outdoor “chapel”, aka a clearing in the woods with a stone altar and simple wooden benches. We basically didn’t have a rain plan, so we “buried the bourbon” to stave off rain and luckily the weather was perfect! The cocktail hour was on a large covered patio and the reception was in the Assembly Hall. The camp was not psyched to be rented out for a wedding, we had to do a little convincing that we would not be high maintenance and would not create a mess, so I’m not giving specifics because they would not appreciate being “advertised” as a venue.

**Wedding party:** (5 total) 1 best man, 1 groomsman, 2 bridesladies, and 1 bridesman – all wonderful friends who were better than gold

**Guests**: 94 invited, 86 “yes” rsvp/attended. We were not expecting such a high (91%) attendance rate, we planned with the idea that there would be about 75 people, but luckily it was not an issue for space/budget and we were so happy that almost everyone could make it!

**Budget:** $15,000 I was really proud of how well we stuck to budget overall. We were right on, with one exception. Grooms parents really wanted a videographer because we were unsure his grandparents would be in good enough health to attend, but it wasn’t in our budget. So they paid to upgrade the photography package we had already paid for to include a videographer, a second shooter and engagement photos, which added $4k! yikes! We would have spent a little less than $16,000, but with video/upgraded photos it was about $20k. I’m still gonna say we stuck to budget because that was the only thing that went over and technically that wasn’t something we picked out or paid for and we definitely could have done without it, but in the end I’m really glad they suggested it because the video turned out amazing and it was really nice to have a second shooter! AND most important his grandparents WERE well enough to be there in person, so all around win!

**Recap** We’re pretty non-traditional. We have been together, living together, owning a home together in a committed relationship for years, we aren’t religious, don’t want kids ever, etc. For a long time, I wasn’t sold on getting married at all (not due to doubting being with my fella forevs, just didn’t feel like we needed to get married to do that), and once we decided to get married, I initially wanted to go to city hall or elope. Hubs wanted a wedding, but I hated the idea of spending half our savings on a party, I shun being the center of attention, and I knew that I would wind up doing 100% of the actual planning because I’m neurotic- so I said Ok, but if we’re doing this thing, we’re doing it our way. 

And we did and it was my favorite day ever- my face hurt from smiling and laughing by the end of the day. I have never felt so surround and supported by loved ones. I have seen the friend/family drama/demands/expectations that can arise around a wedding and we were so so so lucky we didn’t have any of that. Our parents were super chill and gave us zero shit for any of our choices. We had so much help Friday getting ready and setting everything up. Our whole wedding party and a bunch of family volunteered to come help out and made it so much fun! We had food and music and everyone brought their pups to run around the woods and I had almost as much fun setting up the day before as we did at the actual wedding.

To counterbalance this saccharine nature of the previous paragraph and to feed your **llamas**, I will say that my sister was a turd. We have a *cough* complex relationship, and I debated putting her in my bridal party because her need for attention and her hair-trigger moodiness seemed like they would ruin the day, but I was her maid of honor so I felt slightly obligated. Luckily, she hijacked/sabotaged my first dress shopping experience before I made any bridal party decisions and I realized I didn’t want to deal with that sh*t for the next few months. She was not in my bridal party and it was 100% the right decision, I would not have had a such a happy, stress-free engagement or wedding if she had been. That being said, I did genuinely try to involve her in other ways - invited her to my bachelorette and shower, asked her to do a reading, etc. She did come to the shower and bachelorette and behaved very well, but she declined to come to the rehearsal Friday evening or participate in the wedding, and then she showed up late for the wedding itself and missed being in the family photos (taken before the ceremony). Honestly, considering her usual narcissistic antics this was a win. I didn’t actually notice she was missing until our photographer asked “are we missing a sister?” during family photos and it barely registered. And I got to bond a lot with my new sister(in law), who was really amazing and helpful and ended up giving the most hilarious and touching speech of the night and more than made up for my own lackluster sister.

**Decisions that made the wedding “us”**: 

**Zero obligation invites** – I left out a significant portion of my extended family I’m not close to and not in contact with. Only the people we love to the moon and back were invited. This allowed us to spend more time with our guests and use our limited budget to try to make our guests as comfortable as possible. The only “exception” to inviting only our nearest and dearest is that we made sure to invite anyone with a significant other of any duration even if we didn’t know them that well. I don’t think it’s my business to judge if a relationship is “serious enough” to warrant an invite, if we love you enough to invite you and you will be happier bringing along your SO, even if you started dating a week ago, that’s good enough for us.

** No stress wedding party** - All we wanted was our bestie-bests standing with us, we didn’t care about matching numbers (2 vs 3), mixing genders, and didn’t really have requirements for what they were wearing. I cannot overstate how much happier these decisions made us. We wanted to make it as low-cost as possible and have everyone feel good in what they were wearing. I had enough stuff to plan and all our friends are stylish people that I trusted to dress themselves so I pretty much left them to their own devices. All the boys had some variation of blue suit already, so they decided on those and we supplied ties in varying but coordinating shades of wine. For the ladies, I just requested some sort of jewel tone outfit. it could be pants or skirt, any length, any style, - pretty much as long as it wasn’t white/pastel or black, whatev. I didn’t actually see any of the outfits the bridal party wore, other than the ties I picked out, until the day of. They looked fly af

**Ceremony**  We did a self-uniting ceremony (PA/Quaker thing where you don’t need a legal officiant) with Groom’s aunt as our celebrant. She was beyond amazing, she crafted our ceremony and put in so much work, consulting us the whole way. We did a ring warming and hand fasting and pagan blessing and had a part where our parents came up and surrounded us and we thanked them for their support and love. The Groom was walked down the aisle by both parents, I was walked by my dad, and my mom walked our flower-dog. Ceremony music (all instrumental versions performed by a live string trio): processional – here comes the sun; Bridal entrance – Hoppipolla; recessional – muse Starlight. Readings from Ghandi and Carl Sagan

**Amazing, delicious, local, sustainable FOOD**  I found a local 45-seat restaurant that doesn’t normally do catering, but basically geeked out on their food so hard I convinced them to cater our wedding. We had a three-course plated dinner with crème brulee instead of cake for dessert.  They crushed it. We still get people raving to us months later about how amazing the food was. We also had a **gourmet grilled cheese food truck** for late night snack. Ok, you know when you are wedding planning and you get sucked down the rabbit hole and ideas like “we need albino gorillas in color-coordinated suits passing out apps!” seem reasonable and genius? The idea of having a late night food truck was my one semi extravagant idea that I refused to give up. I found this boss gourmet grilled cheese truck (brie and prosciutto and apple jam grilled cheese? Fffffffff yes!) and convinced them to drive out to the middle of nowhere at 9pm and they turned out to be pretty darn reasonably priced, and they for hours servinf up the deliciousness, and everyone LOVED them and ate lots and lots of grilled cheese and I am so glad I went for it!

** LIVE music** Live music was a must, but we have fairly eclectic taste that we wanted to stay true to but we wanted everyone to enjoy the music and to dance their faces off. We were not having luck finding an indie-rock-folksy-bluegrass-but-a-little-pop-y-and-danceable band (go figure). Untilllllll one night we were out checking out a friend of a friends duo at a bar and they were playing pretty much the exact blend of music we were looking for. But a bass and acoustic guitar do not a wedding band make. Thankfully my good friend alcohol helped me out and I chatted them up after the set and a few days later got an email that if I was still interested they knew some guys from other bands they could assemble to add drums, keys, and an additional guitar/mandolin and make our band. It was a risky move, we didn’t actually hear the full band until like a week before the wedding, but they were amaaaaazing. The duo played for cocktail hour, then the full band for the reception. Our first dance song was “radio song” by the Felice brothers, mother/son dance to “song for the asking” by Simon and Garfunkel, and father/daughter dance to “Wildflowers” by Tom Petty. We got to hand pick every single song they played for the reception and everyone was dancing like crazy! Everyone wanted to know where they could go see them play again and what their band name was and they kept going “Nowhere! We don’t exist! We are the MyName and HusbandsName Band for one night only!”. Husband secretly coordinated with them so that he and some friends that he used to be in a band with in college got up and joined the band for a few songs, including one my husband sang dedicated to me (aw).  They played an hour longer than they agreed to because everyone was having such a blast and some of them even stayed for the after party and spent the night at camp! 

**Budget Breakdown**
We stayed in budget mainly by prioritizing what was worth splurging on to us (photography, food, music, accommodations for our guests), thinking outside the box for vendors, and DIYing the shit out of the rest. Vendor prices are rounded to the nearest $10 and include tips/tax.

**Venue: $2150** – this included renting the camp for the weekend (we set up and rehearsed Friday, had the wedding Saturday, and then hosted breakfast the next morning), ceremony site with benches, reception hall with tables and benches, overnight lodging for the 40ish guests of ours who chose to spend the night after the wedding (we paid the per person fee for everyone), and breakfast the next morning for everyone who stayed the night cooked by the camp cook.

**Catering: $4450** – this included cocktail hour cheese/charcuterie/sriracha deviled eggs, three course dinner with Caesar salad, choice of entrée (pan seared salmon in a Dijon cream sauce over braised kale and fingerling potatoes or grilled chicken over BBQ bean medley, braised collards, with a herb vinaigrette, or curried eggplant, cauliflower puree, and braised kale) and individual crème brulees for dessert. Crème brulee is my JAM, and these were the best I’ve ever had, nobody complained that there wasn’t cake. They also brought flatware, napkins, plates, and water glasses and this cost included the service fee for the wait-staff. 

**Late night snack: $380** Gourmet Grilled Cheese food truck

**Rehearsal Dinner for 14 people: $140** BBQ take out we ate at the camp after setting up/rehearsing

**Photography**: This is our one budget overage. Our photographer was amazing, and she actually gave us a bit of a deal to begin with because she was out of our budget, so originally we were going with her as a single shooter, no videography for $3000. Then his parents were concerned that his grandparents might not be able to travel to the wedding, so they offered to pay to upgrade to a second shooter, videographer, and even travel engagement photos (taken at the waterfall I wanted to get married under if we had eloped). This increased the price to $7000, which still kind of blows my mind, but 100% worth it. Our photog and her whole team were beyond anything we could have asked. I seriously love every single photograph (and there are a lot) and the video makes me cry my face off in the happiest possible way. They truly captured the feeling of the best day of our lives and I am so grateful to have those memories, not to mention she was hilarious and fun and I wish we were besties! 

**Music: $1500** - $300 for string trio, $1200 for our reception/cocktail hour band 

**Dress: $1230** including alterations, my mom ended up paying for half of the dress, but I’ve included the whole price in the budget. Alterations were hella reasonable. This was basically the exact opposite of what I imagined myself wearing. In real life I pretty must dress like Jenna Lyons, and I imagined a much simpler, more column style dress, NOT strapless. I saw this on a mannequin and could not stop staring at it and kept going “its beautiful, but not for me”. Obviously we see how that turned out. It turned out to be really comfortable because I had them remove all the layers of crinoline, so the skirt was light and you could still fan it out for the wow factor, but it wasn’t bulky and was really easy to move in. AND I could go to the bathroom by myself without needing any help with the skirt (yesssssss). The bodice was SO well fitted, it stayed up all night with no tugging or adjusting needed and the seamstress did this genius bustle that made it look like it wasn’t bustled at all.

**Bridal accessories: $140** I had a custom 3D printed flower crown (so extra) that I wore backwards wrapped in with my braid halo and a gold leather leaf neckpiece. The shoes (navy velvet t-strap flats with a bronze glitter heel from shoes of prey because I have crazy shaped monster feet and so pretty much all the shoes I own are wide width and expensive-ish) I already owned, the earrings were a gift from hubs, and the sapphire ring was my something borrowed and something blue from my mom.

**Hair and makeup: $340** – this included my hair and makeup, hair and makeup for my two bridesladies, and tip. I LOVED my braid crown. Between my hair and accessories, I got so many “wood nymph” esque compliments, I was thrilled. My favorite though was a friend’s girlfriend, who I hadn’t met before approached me with a tipsy monologue about how I looked like “a queen from game of thrones, but like, a magic queen with powers, but you’d probably die early on because you are too good for that world” (this is paraphrasing slightly, but it was amazing!)

**Groom attire: $300** - indochino suit during one of their big sales, shirt and shoes he already owned, and his tie (as well as the ties for our groomsmen) were “free” courtesy of my dad. He asked me to go suit shopping with him (side note, this was so so sweet because my dad is NOT a fashion-conscious kind of guy and it was so dear that he wanted me to go with him and help him pick out a suit) and they had a ridiculous buy 1 tie get 4 free deal (how is this a thing?!) so he let me pick out the 4 free ties for the groom, best man, groomsman, and bridesman.

**Alcohol and soda: $600** – we served beer and wine only. The wine was from a winery in the town where we went to college/met/started dating, so that was really special. We went wine tasting there and picked a Riesling, an estate white blend, a cab franc, a rose, and bubbly.  It saved us a lot to buy it directly, so we were able to get much nicer wine for a more budget price point AND we met the owners and they were so so nice. Grooms parents coincidentally live in that town (moved there after we graduated), and I panicked a week before the wedding thinking we needed more wine, so they went to get an extra case or two and the owners gave it to them free and said it was their wedding present to us! We got our beer wholesale, we are big craft beer people, but we also wanted to have beers that are lighter and have “mass appeal” so we went with Corona, Shock top, Dogfishead 60 min IPA, Traveler Grapefruit Shandy, Victory Summer Love ale, and Sam Adams Octoberfest. We also had lots of water and an assortment of sodas. The wine and water we put chilled on the table and the beer and soda was served from our “Brew canoe”. This was another insane idea I could not let go of. I found a free beat up canoe on craigslist, painted it so it looked nice, and filled it with ice. 100% pain in the butt, 100% worth it.

**Save the dates/invites/thank you cards and stamps: $150** I designed them all myself and printed them on mega sale at Vistaprint (I think 60% off)

**Flowers: $250** – we bought them from a local flower farm and arranged all the bouquets/ boutonnieres/table arrangements ourselves. It was fun and we had SOOO many extra flowers, we just started putting them everywhere. We were basically “put a bird on it” but with flowers 

**Wedding license: $60**

**Rings: $250 ** – both very simple bands. This doesn’t include my engagement ring, which is a grey kite-cut diamond in yellow gold, my wedding band is a suuuuuuuper thin custom “shadow band” that fits the notch of the kite cut.

**Other décor: $300**  this included buying tablecloths, some strand lights, the paper back drop for our sweetheart table, and materials for me to make our signs/seating chart, faux flowers to decorate our wedding-bower/teepee (my uncle built it out found branches),  the “sheepskin” bench covers for the ceremony (faux fur from fabric outlet I cut into sheep skin shapes), fabric for our aisle runner (velvet from same fabric outlet, insanely cheap), rolls of craft paper that I painted with quotes (there were these terrible camp “murals” on panels right by the stage, this seemed like the most economical way to cover them), candles/ candle holders and vintage wine glasses I collected over the course of the year from flea markets and thrift stores in mismatched jewel tones. The sweetheart table décor like the geodes and lion candle holders is just stuff from our home we already owned.

**Gifts for our parents, celebrant, and bridal party: $400** - we did very personalized and individual thank you gifts for everyone. I treated it as if I were shopping for their birthdays

**Total:** including videography/photo upgrade $19,640, total without upgraded photo/video $15,640 (sorry can you tell I really like to stick to budgets and am clinging to the version where we did? Haha)

This was insanely long, but I feel like I could write even more! My main advice would be 1) to follow your instincts and have the kind of wedding you want even if it balks from “tradition” but 2) still try to be thoughtful to your guests and keep their comfort in mind and 3) take a deep breath, think about what is really important, and let everything else go. I am type-A and planning a wedding could have easily been a nightmare if I hadn’t followed this advice!

He lifted his glasses further up his nose and frowned. 

  “Now say *aaahhh*” 

  “*ah*” 

  “Oh come now, you can do better than that. Say it like the opera singers back east, sing it for me son. Aaaaahhhh.”

  The boy smiled despite the stick in his mouth and itchy rash across his face and did as the doctor told him to. He made the boy laugh some more and gave him a lollipop before leaving the room to speak to his parents. He walked down the hall to where the parents were waiting in the next room and he removed his hat and held it against his chest.

  “I'm sorry to tell you, but your son has measles. There's kopliks spots in his mouth and that barking cough you told me about in your letter is croup. Just keep taking care of him as best you can and keep giving him the medicine I made… don't lose hope, he's a strong boy, I'm sure he'll be fine.” 

  ----

  Doctor Giles left that house and two more with new medications and recommendations to call for him again if things get worse. He had lunch at the Bloodwater Falls Saloon and sipped a beer while a local band played on the stage. The blonde woman singing was all sultry confidence and faux immaturity beneath layers of cheap perfume and the newest dress a local bar singer could buy. He listened to her sing until the band’s piece was over and watched her go outside to smoke cigars with her bandmates. Giles got another beer and pulled a locket out from under his shirt to gaze wistfully at while the next band played. The picture on the right was of a younger Mr. Giles back before he grew out his beard and outgrew the suit he wore to his wedding. On the left side was a beautiful young native woman with long ebony hair in a braid over her shoulder and a wide laughing smile like she had just been told “I love you” for the umpteenth time that day. Mr. Giles leaned back in his seat and thought about the past.

  ----

  Twelve years ago on a dusty road far from Calera, a large covered wagon loaded with supplies trundles along away from a frontier town in the peak of summer.

  “*Mama* I don't *want* to move again! I didn't even get to say goodbye to Christi or Jamie or Mister Blackwater or anybody else at school!” 

  “I'm sorry we had to leave in a hurry, but we don't have a choice. I'm sure you'll make new friends in the next town.” 

  Joseph Giles heart twisted in his chest while he listened to his wife console his crying eight year old daughter in the back of the wagon. 

  How could he tell her they had to leave because the “raccoons” that smashed half his vials of medicine were really several men from the town. Or that time his wife came home with bruises on her body wasn't because she just fell, but because the town was still paying for scalps and she barely escaped with her life. Instead his wife sat in the wagon with Kate’s head on her lap and sang her a song to make her fall asleep. 

  *Run, wolf warrior, to ends eternal*

  *Through the wreckage of the death of the day*

  *Scent of silence under starlight spinning*

  *A captured beast within a human skin*

  How many towns had they gone through in the last few years? Six? The next nearest town was a mining town, plenty of people would need a doctor… but how good were these mines? Would this place end up like the last mining town they went to and go from boom to bust in a year? Should we even keep going west, it's so lawless in the frontiers. Could I even get a job in the east? Joseph’s mind was swirling with thoughts. The yellow dusty road stretched on in a straight line for infinity with nothing but barren desert on either side.

  *Are you searching for long lost landscapes*

  *lit by flowers and crystal cascades?*
 
*Where the lamb lies down with the lion*
 
  *Where the wolf is one with the wild.* 

  Giles glanced back to see his wife patting Kate’s hair while the girl grabbed the linen blanket and pulled it over herself.

  *Run, wolf warrior, through kingdoms' chaos*

  *Senseless cities and ghost towns towering*
 
*Howl, O hunter, though few know you're crying*
 
*Face upturned into that midnight moon*

  Kate made loud sniffling noises and rubbed her eyes. She had amber eyes just like her mother, but while her mother’s had that spark of magic hidden within them, little Kate was just starting to show that magic too. He wanted to protect both of them, nothing mattered more than keeping them safe. The three of them would always be together, through thick and thin. Jospeh took an oath under his breath he would swear to the earth and sky above and every god every preacher and wise man could invoke to keep his family safe.

  *Run, wolf warrior, to hide your hunger*

  *The rain will wash away the pains of the day*
 
  *In your eyes there are cold fires burning*

  *Tongues of flame that can never be tamed.* 

  *Are you running from Man's delusion*

  *Majestic madness and your exclusion*

  *To where the lamb lies down with the lion?...*

  *Are you running to freedom's fortress*

  *By the side of wide open seas*
 
  *Where the wolf is one with the wild?*

  Her singing had a calming effect on even him. He was sure it was imbued with some kind of magic, but he didn't know quite what. Maybe it was just the language itself that had magic imbued within it. The road didn't seem so long after a while, and even the gentle wind felt cool on his skin despite the dust and sand it kicked up as well. Giles knew he had to be ready for hard times to get harder, but he knew as long as he had his wife and daughter by his side, he could face whatever came next.

 *Run, run, run on through the rain… Run along run along through the rain…*

  ----

  Giles’ memory faded with the repeating lines of his daughter’s favorite lullaby and he came back to see the red glow of sunset bathing over the saloon and making the thick smog of cigars visible in the dim light. He tucked his locket back down under his shirt next to a small wolf claw totem he always wore and walked outside into the cool night.

Ender is 6’9”, 250 lbs with shoulder length light brown hair, blue eyes, and a goatee. He has a scar running from just above his right eye to just past the left side of his mouth. 

Ender is a high ranking member of an order of templars that worship the light, Arch Bishop of Sumo Frigore, a city that he and the rest of the party spent a lot of time in and champion of the light. 

He wears silver ornamental armor with gold accents and a symbol of a sun on the chest. He also wears a white hooded robe with gold trim and his left arm is unarmored, as it was lost in battle, and the gods gifted him with a prosthetic made of pure golden starlight. 

Ender carries a silver long sword with golden runes on the blade which has been given the name “Last Light,” a whip made of pure golden starlight coiled up and fastened to his right hip, and a large book which he usually has strapped to his left hip.

I need some opinions about this nightmare, but I have to give you a little backstory first so you can picture it. So my fiance and I moved to his hometown in the north Georgia mountains a few months back. We're in the process of building our own home on his family's land, and we're staying with his parents in his childhood bedroom in the meantime. There's no privacy, and it's cramped to say the least, but we're grateful to be able to save money so we make the best of it.

Our room is a little 10x10 square, with a queen sized bed pushed right into the corner, E's childhood desk, and not much else. There are two large windows stretching almost the height of the wall, one behind our headboard, and the other to the right of the bed. The window to the right of the bed doesnt have any blinds because E destroyed them shortly before he moved out, and they were never replaced. This isn't a huge deal as we don't have any neighbors (we're on a large farm backed right up against forest service land), and the ground beneath the window slopes away so it's too high for anyone to peek into, not that my inlaws would do that anyway. E sleeps next to the wall, and I sleep on the outside of the bed closer to the window.

So...the nightmare. In it, I ""wake up"" suddenly in my bed in the middle of the night. I'm on my side facing E, and everything seems normal at first, but my heart is absolutely pounding and I don't know why. I can just make out the rise and fall of E's chest in the starlight filtering in the window, but then it hits me that I can't hear him snoring. E *always* snores; it's the soundtrack I've fallen asleep to for the last four years. I realize that the quiet must have woken me up, and that leads me to realize that I can't hear anything at all. Not the fan overhead that E insists on keeping on even in the dead of winter. Not the space heater that I insist on keeping on to combat the fan. Not a single cow or coyote in the neighboring fields and forest. But before I can react in horror to my sudden deafness, I notice something else.

A shadow falls across our bodies in the starlight. A feeling of eyes on the back of my neck makes my skin crawl. My pounding heart stops dead for an instant, then starts up again even faster. I can't hear it, but I feel it beating against my chest, flooding my veins with adrenaline. I go rigid. I feel like a child scared of the dark. I want nothing more than to pull the covers up over my head and lay still, feeling like that will somehow make me safe, but I'm an adult and I know that's not how the world works. If there's something outside my window, I need to deal with it.

I'm probably overreacting. The window is too high for anyone to be out there. Probably just clouds blocking the starlight. I am slightly encouraged by these thoughts, but by no means convinced. Slowly, trying to appear as though I'm still asleep, I flip onto my other side. I take even, deliberate breaths, then crack my eyelids slightly. All pretense of sleep is gone when I see the thing behind the glass.

It's a man...kind of. It's head is too big, and it's much too tall. It must be 7 feet at least. It's eyes, perfectly round and bulging out of its skull, are level with mine, staring *right into* mine. They're yellowed and cloudy, but I know it sees me. I know it. I don't think it has any eyelids. It doesnt blink. Its nose is too long and comes to an unnatural point. It's skin is a mottled, milky pus color with a texture like an overripe apple right before it rots. It wears a black suit, completely normal and yet so unsettling when on that *thing*, but worst by far is the smile. Thin, cracked lips the same color as the rest of its bald head are stretched back impossibly far, a true ear-to-ear grin that reveals two rows of pointed, yellowed fangs. It holds my gaze and slowly raises a hand, the too-long fingers exaggerated by long, jagged nails, and it waves.

I scream, but my voice makes no sound. All of a sudden, E moves behind me and I have a split second of hope before his hand grabs a fistfull of my hair and winds it so tight that I feel more than a few strands rip out. His other arm wraps around my waist, pinning my own arms to my side as he holds me against him, yanking my head back so I'm forced to stare at the thing. I scream and struggle as fiercely as possible, kicking him over and over in the shins, but it's like he doesn't even feel me, and he's too strong to overpower. As I lay there fighting against the love of my life, screaming at the top of my lungs but not making a sound, the thing calmly, deliberately places both hands on the window and slowly slides it open...

And then I wake up for real, drenched in fear sweat and feeling like I haven't slept at all. This has happened three nights in a row now, and it's starting to take a toll on me. I'm so tired, and when I woke up this morning, my voice was sore and horse. E noticed and insisted I stay home today instead of accompanying him to the bait shop that we own and run together, and I agreed pretty easily. Strep throat has been making the rounds around our family, and it feels like I might be coming down with it. My inlaws are both at work today, so I figured I try some Netflix therapy on the couch and hopefully catch a nap. I made a cup of coffee and settled in, and I was starting to feel better after a bit.

 I decided I'd change the sheets on our bed a few days early, get rid of the fear sweat and hopefully sleep better tonight. I started to strip the bed, but when I moved my pillow I froze, my body tingling with adrenaline. Dozens and dozens of my golden brown strands littered the sheet, little white roots attatched to the tips. My skin crawled at the memory of eyes on the back of my neck, and I rushed out of the room without looking at the window, slamming the door behind me. I needed to talk to E.

""Hey hun, how ya feeling,"" he asked me when I called.

""Not great,"" I said, then hesitated. How could I bring this up without sounding crazy? ""I...I haven't been sleeping well.""

""Yeah, I meant to talk to you about that,"" E said.  ""I think we need to talk to the doctor about getting you on meds for your Restless Leg Syndrome.""

""What do you mean?""

""My legs are all covered in bruises. I think you kicked the shit out of me in your sleep.""

My stomach dropped. After a moment of stunned silence, I claimed a headache and hung up quickly. I've just been sitting on the couch since then. I brought the dogs up here with me, even though it's my inlaws couch and they don't approve of dogs on it. I can't help myself. I need the comfort.

Am I crazy for being freaked out? There are rational explanations for everything; the sore throat could be strep, the hair might just mean my thyroid meds need to be upped (I have Hashimoto's), and I do have RLS. It's always been pretty mild, but maybe it's gotten worse? But I can't shake this feeling of dread. That dream feels *so* real.

YouTube's The Nostalgia Critic.


*S.P.E.C.I.A.L Stats:*

* Strength - 2

* Perception - 6

* Endurance - 4

* Charisma - 3

* Intelligence - 3

* Agility - 1

* Luck - 9


*Description:*

The Critic is a build based on Perception and Luck, so he's most suited for V.A.T.S players. As a mentally-unstable nostalgic film reviewer rampaging across the wasteland, you'll be killing Mirelurks and ghouls so the people of the Commonwealth don't have to. He will do only limited settlement-building due to his low charisma, but will nonetheless provide people with everything they need to survive. I can imagine him setting up his main base at Starlight Drive-In, because of his love of cinema.


*Outfit:*

* Dirty black suit

* Eyeglasses

* Newsboy Cap (or Piper's press cap)


*Gear:*

* 10 mm Pistol (for when you're exploring and you come across **A BAT CREDIT CARD I'LL KILL YOU! I'LL KILL YOU ALL!** )

* Baseball Bat (watch the Master of Disguise review).

* Assorted explosives (lots of those in his videos).


*Recommended Perks:*

* Demolition Expert

* Gunslinger 

* Mysterious Stranger (just pretend he's Santa Christ).

* Big Leagues

* Lone Wanderer

* Better Criticals and/or Critical Banker


*Factions:*

The Critic's methods are chaotic at times, but he's fundamentally good at heart. He'll want to help anyone that's not a fan of Adam Sandler or M. Night Shyamalan movies. Therefore, the Minutemen will be the best faction for him to join, even though he'll express his frustration with the repetitive settlement quests. He'll be able to see past the stigma surrounding synths and so will not join the Brotherhood. He will be sympathetic to the Railroad, but will end up not using them to destroy the Institute. In the end, the Critic will realize that his son had a shit taste in movies (he freely screened The Matrix in the Institute) and so must be destroyed for the good of mankind.


*Companions:*

The Critic has actors in his reviews, but he will mostly like to work alone. If you do want a companion though, either Piper or Deacon will be best. (I dunno, I could just see him and Deacon having a beer together, or doing a crossover review).

* Spell list completely reworked.

* Fluff rewritten to emphasize guidance and helping people.

The 6 free heroes don't do jack, because thats all they are, free heroes. And other than that you get a useless border that accomplishes nothing and looks kinda dumb to begin with.

Personally i think they need to make it a lot more appealing for people to want to spend money on it.

At the very least, they should include a 30 day diamond bundle into it, so that you can claim 20-30 diamonds daily all month while you have the membership, i guarantee that will bump Starlight sales numbers by times.

Ka Lupe Class
---------------

The Ka Lupe class, named after the Hawaiian name for the Great Square of Pegasus, is a series of four space going warships designed to provide true space-based offensive capabilities. Designed around several key pieces of technology, the Ka Lupe class is designed to offer both massive tactical and operational flexibility, to an extent not previously seen in spacecraft.

Construction &amp; Mass
-------------------

The Ka Lupe class is built around a central carbon/boron nanotube laminate pressure vessel (providing excellent strength and weight), which provides crew accommodations. The vessel, roughly conical in shape, is then armored with layers of metamaterial aerogel and CNT-reinforced graphene, providing excellent strength and resilience to kinetic energy impactors. Laser protection will be accomplished with a tunable dielectric mirror based finish.

Overall wet mass of the Ka Lupe class is 435 tons, of which approximately 75% is propellant. Delta-V depends on propulsion method, details to follow. 

Propulsion

Space warships face a fundamental problem: they want both high thrust and high efficiency. There's lots of options available that can do one or the other, electric power for efficiency, chemical power for thrust. There are even a few solutions in the middle - closed or open cycle gaseous fission mostly - that provide both high thrust and high efficiency, but come at massive operational costs.

The Ka Lupe class solves this problem through a combination of two different propulsion technologies. First is the [Flyable Fusion Engine](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/7l4iv3/tech_flightworthy_fusion_propulsion/), the ""high gear"" of the Ka Lupe class. Thanks to a p-B11 fusion process, the FFE produces essentially no neutron radiation (and therefore has none of the transmutation and embrittlement problems seen in fission reactors for space applications), and its 10kN thrust is actually fairly respectable for its 100ks ISP. However, the FFE only provides about 1/50th of a g of acceleration to the Ka Lupe class, so while efficient, it is not suitable for ASAT dodging. About 10% of the overall fuel mass (32.6 tons) is fuel and reaction mass for the FFE, but this provides more than 77 km/s of delta-V when the chemical engines are fully fuelled. The FFE is also the main power source, with a direct electromagnetic generation system providing the majority of the vessel's power, with backup solar arrays.

To solve the high acceleration demand problem, another maneuvering solution is needed, this time a much simpler one. The Ka Lupe class will have 9 Raptor engines burning methalox, designed to provide a minimum of 4gs of acceleration at full power. These engines have the bulk of the fuel - yet provide just 1.4km/s of delta-V.

Radiatiors
-------------------

The next major issue in a spacecraft is heat dissipation, and doing so in a way that isn't super easy to shoot off. The Ka Lupe class will use a new type of radiator for this purpose. Leveraging [LRA-developed radiators](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/7nr9cf/tech_lunar_construction_systems/), the Ka Lupe will accomplish heat dissapation through a ionic droplet radiator system, spraying nanodrops of ionic liquids into a ring collector trough, where they are then reheated and recycled.

This radiator design provides huge heat dissipation capabilities, key for keeping the FFE cool. Under high accelerations it no longer works, but the FFE can be kept heatsinked for longer than the chemical engines will have fuel.

Armament
---------------

The Ka Lupe class will be equipped with both free electron lasers and railguns for primary armament, with additional short ranged interceptors for self defense. 

**Orbital High Power Railgun**

The OHPR, basically an [ISRS Block III](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/7g09g3/secret_isrs_block_iii/) in SPAAAAACE, is a 70MJ-class railgun adapted for space use. Due to recoil issues inherent to designing a zero-g turret, the OHPR is axially mounted and is aimed by pointing the entire spacecraft. 

The OHPR's initial munition will be the Anti-Air Hittle Hypervelocity Projectile, which has a small onboard propulsion capability and is already proven at performing exoatmospheric intercepts. In the future, an improved version is planned, focusing on the unique demands facing an orbital weapon.

**Spaceborne Free Electron Laser**

Based on the naval [DFEL](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/6zoh5w/tech_deployable_free_electron_laser/) and the laser component of the [SDPS](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/79yupo/tech_space_debris_protection_system/), the SFEL is a heavily upgraded variant, delivering up to 8MW of power (thanks to Starlight Systems for delivering really huge lasers for space applications), and provides the Ka Lupe class with its primary self defense capabilities. 

The main unique demand imposed upon spaceborne FELs is that of beam quality induced range. Surface and airborne FELs are largely limited by atmospheric scattering characteristics, which demand tuning long before the details of beam quality do. However, for a spaceborne laser, the ranges are much longer and there are no more atmospheric effects, so only beam quality matters. Using a superconducting array of carbon nanotube coils, the SFEL will maximize electron density and minimize dispersions inside its accelerator, maximizing beam quality and attaining a range in excess of 250km with a 2m diameter aperture. 

The Ka Lupe class will carry 3 SFELs, all of which can be operated simultaneously with the onboard power. The SFEL can be used for offensive, defensive, and civil (e.g. lightcraft, space debris removal) applications.

**Short Ranged Interceptor Missile**

The SRIM was originally intended for the F-22 MLU program, a way to give a fighter with no room for a laser some self defense capabilities. However, it has found its way onto ships, airplanes, armored vehicles, and now, onto orbital spaceships. In particular, it is a small, accurately guided missile capable of rapidly reaching out and intercepting a target. While, in space, this will not materially change the direction of the target (as the SRIM's momentum is only a small fraction of the target's), it will cause the guidance system to fail and no longer track the accelerating protected ship. The SRIM already has everything it needs to do this, since it already has an attitude control thruster system, so it only needs minor modifications for use in space.

The Ka Lupe class will have 250 SRIM interceptors onboard.

Sensors
------------

The Ka Lupe's sensors consist of wide and narrow field IR, as well as a wide bandwidth radar suite derived from surface naval radar systems. These systems are primarily tasked with ASAT/ballistic missile launch tracking, orbital debris observation, and orbital traffic management. In particular, wide-field IR observation is possible on all aspects down to 1/100th arcsecond, with narrow field IR down to 0.1 milliarcseond. The radar suite combines Ka and milimeter wave systems, with the usual collection of identifiers (graphene MMIC, MIMO, sub-wave, photonic) providing extremely high performance.

Mission Systems
----------------

The Ka Lupe class will be designed to carry out a range of orbital tasks, including a key role that has previously been neglected, that of the orbital rescue and emergency response craft. Towards this end, the Ka Lupe will offer a comprehensive series of satellite capture and recovery fixtures, repair systems, as well as medical facilities and a new free-flying firefighting system. In an emergency, it can carry up to 40 people, though not very comfortably.

Program 
----------------

The CFN plans to spend around $9 billion on the Ka Lupe program. Each of the four-vessel Ka Lupe class is expected to cost about $1 billion to build, and a further $5 billion has been budgeted for R&amp;D costs. Most of these costs are due to the need to space-rate so much equipment, however, because the underlying technologies are actually rather mature. As a result, the Ka Lupe class is expected to enter production in a fully pressurized and classified spacedock at SpaceBuild (near the EML1 point) in 2 years, with the first being ready in 4. The last will be delivered 3 years later.",True,False,False,worldpowers,t5_30yfr,,,restricted,top,self,,,[SECRET] The Seas of the Sky,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/7uy9ib/secret_the_seas_of_the_sky/,all_ads,,True,,,,,

 You all know Roger's Dr. Beast skin, right? Badass mad scientist fond of blood? Super-expensive? 

 I have no idea when, but Moonton has censored his in-game model. The canisters on his back and wrist are green, rather than red. Also, his basic attack blood splatter effect, his Wolf Transformation effect, and his Hunter Steps effect have all been lazily replaced with the purple effects from Roger's Starlight skin. Moonton will probably censor his display model and portrait in the next week or so.

 As of now, Lolita and Grock have the only Halloween-themed skins that haven't been censored yet. Let's see how long that lasts...

 What we've learned in the past month is that Moonton doesn't give a damn about what we think, or how much we paid for our skins, they will still censor the crap out of everything. Now that they've opened the censorship door on Epic and Starlight skins, there's nothing they won't censor (Wizardry Teacher Alice is probably next).

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lgcf6HsS9Ay302sLqNtvtM-KN-hAVylU15yNBhSfAjk/edit?usp=sharing

**Some things to take note of:**

* All costs (Starlight Coins, Gold, and Diamonds) are based on V0 prices.

* Most store costs are assuming you already have bought one item from the store. For example, if the recipe calls for 3 Benevolences, the cost shown will be for only 2. The only exceptions are clothing you need to craft towards the beginning of this game, or a suit's item is a commonly used crafting item, such as Sacred Doctor. I would list out the cost of one Benevolence instead of assuming you bought it already (I hope that makes sense)

* For items that cost diamonds in the Store, I assumed that you have not bought one yet. So if the recipe called for 4 Water Pearl (25 dias), the cost listed will be 100. The only exception are the makeups like Pigeon Maid, Cloud Lady because we all probably bought them as soon as they were available

* Dye costs are gonna vary... I tried to adjust the dye costs for commonly customized items with some of the later suits so some might account for the fact that you probably already customized Scattering Stars-Fantasy for a previous suit, but it's kinda hard to keep straight and I might have changed my mind halfway throughout making this...? Please have Momo's mercy on me 

* All the gold costs listed is total gold, which includes the cost for ingredients AND crafting/evolving.

* The order listed in the index is not necessarily the same order in the separate sheets labeled with each Nation. Use the hyperlinks or Ctrl+F if needed! I might fix them in the future if I ever feel like torturing myself with this again... :'D

* If an item can be obtained from a level drop, store, and pavilions, I only listed the level drop

**Suits not included:**

* Assassin's Faith and Future Girl because those are ridiculous just put that stuff in Momo's Guide ok

* ~~Marionette Grice~~ added Marionette Grice just original... Hope it's right.

* The costs for recoloring a suit and keeping the original

* Association Suits, Workshop Suits, Room of Mystery Suits, Crystal Garden Suits

* Some suits that require pavilion drops ~~because I'm a little salty, please love me pav!~~

**Future things I might add:**

* Separating gold needed for ingredients and gold needed for crafting

* Indicating whether a suit needs Maiden drops, Princess drops, or both

* ??? 

* Suggestions welcome!

If you see a mistake, *please* let me know!! There are probably a good amount of mistakes and I would love some fresh eyes to take a look :D

I really liked the concept but it still felt like a patch rather than a full solution to FO4’s lack of interesting explorable towns.  I think I might have come up with a proper solution, and was interested having some of the rest of you poke holes in it.

One of my major complaints with Fallout 4 was the lack of proper towns.  You’ve got Diamond City and Goodneighbor, along with a few “half” towns and settlements like the Atom Cats Garage, but overall the whole map seems diluted because your settlements are filled with generic settlers who do nothing but slave away and generate generic quests.  

So my problem was how to fix this bland and uninteresting gameplay without removing the building/customization aspects of settlements.  I think the sweet spot between control/customization and realistic role play is semi-autonomous settlements with scripted settlers, controlled by a leveling system.  

So, as a potential example.  You clear Starlight Drive-in.  You set up a beacon.  At this point, your workshop becomes active and one “plot” becomes available for building.  The game asks you to set another 30x30 foot square as your next development, and gives you a resource goal to meet.  X metal, x glass, x copper, etc.

When you meet this goal (by dropping resources in the workbench) a new settler arrives and autonomously sets up a home/business.  You might be notified in your travels that this has occurred by a traveling merchant or radio announcement (“Starlight Drive-In is starting to get big, I’m going to have to start making more trips out there before someone moves in on my territory.”)  When you make your way back around, you get a new square to designate for the next building and a new resource goal.  You can also expand or edit the business that your newest settler built autonomously in your absence, a mayor helping out his citizens so to speak.  

By bringing in pre-scripted settlers you could set branching quest paths and interesting characters that would pop up throughout your play through, and have a real reason to check in on your settlements other than picking up resources.  It also opens up unique quest lines related to new settlements.  Maybe the 8th settler that shows up is Nuka Cola obsessed.  Her house is covered in neon Nuka Cola signs and the other settlers are about to murder her because she won’t turn the lights off at night and it’s turning their settlement into a raider beacon at night.  Maybe two farmers move into the same settlement and are sabotaging each other’s crops at night and the other settlers are starving b/c of the feud, and you have to get them to play nice, chase one out, or assassinate one so the settlement doesn’t starve.  

It would take a bit of control away, in that each settlement would have certain resources predetermined (this settlement, when fully leveled, will have a weapon shop, armor shop and general store but has to trade for food, but that one might have tons of farmland but needs help with security.  It’s up to you to work deals between settlements to cover what’s lacking.). But it would still allow you to build your own housing and develop common areas, as well as make changes to settler buildings which the settlers would then auto-populate with relevant furniture and items to their profession/personality.

I think this might be the best way to foster investment and interest in settlements from a world-building perspective while preserving the customization that Fallout 4 did so well.

The presence of a Lycanroc placeholder that wasn't yet being used was our first hint toward the existence of what we now know as the Dusk form.  USUM have come and gone now, and discussion has shifted toward speculating what the plans for Pokémon on the Switch might be.  But what if there's something to the former we're overlooking, something that might shed at least a small ray of light on the latter?

How about we take a closer look at that tweet for a minute?  The dataminer found a placeholder for a Lycanroc form with a form ID of 4.  These kinds of data tend to start at 0, then go to 1, 2, et cetera.  So the presence of a placeholder with the ID of 4 would imply **there is, and has been for the past year, room for up to _five_ Lycanroc forms in the Global Link**.

This was written off for a while as people speculated they must have been for a third form and Lycanroc totem bosses, respectively.  The former was confirmed with Dusk Lycanroc being revealed months later, and the latter was taken for granted after the clip of Midday in the USUM reveal trailer.  Except it turned out there were no Lycanroc totems, there was no sign of them ever even being planned, and the clip from the trailer turned out to be a new signature Z-Move instead.  This means **those two placeholders are still unaccounted for**.

Now this is conjecture on my part, and it's admittedly possible they're remnants of something from _very_ early in development...but wouldn't you say it's more likely this means they're not done with this line?  Game Freak has stated they've moved on from the 3DS, but there's still talk of a major Switch game that might or might not be releasing this year.  **Could these mystery placeholders, along with other things like the fact that Zeraora hasn't had an official reveal yet, imply they may be about to break trend and change consoles mid-generation to finish off Gen 7 with _some_ kind of major Switch game, complete with new content?**  Could we be staring at evidence for a Dawn form that we assumed must have existed, as well as something crazier like an ultimate ""Starlight Lycanroc"" form, or something along that line?

There're a lot of unknowns still, but this is something we should be keeping an eye on as we wait for some kind of official announcement.  That, and it's something interesting worth talking about.

A new company, backed by Starlight Systems as well as Kratos Heavy Industries, plans to disrupt this space, focusing on reducing the cost of manned space travel.

So far, space launch has pushed towards delivering very large packages to orbit, taking advantages of size economy of scale, as a result of how rocket engines scale down (that is to say, badly). However, Photonic Research thinks that they have a way to accomplish *quantity* economy of scale.

LightLauncher
------------------

The basic concept behind the LightLauncher is the [Lightcraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightcraft). A lightcraft works by receiving an enormous laser beam, then focusing it to heat up air to enormous temperatures, which then produces thrust. In this manner, lightcraft can attain hypersonic velocities with no fuel or reaction mass whatsoever. Additionally, lightcraft themselves are simple and cheap - the cost is all in the laser source.

The LightLauncher uses the lightcraft idea to provide the ability to lift small payloads at very low prices. Due to the huge power requirements, each LightLauncher can only carry about 300kg of payload, but are outrageously simple and cheap to make, providing extremely low cost to orbit and high payload fractions, exceeding 400.

Vehicle
-------

Architecturally, each LightLauncher is a [teardroppy-shaped](https://i.imgur.com/SUeIg5l.jpg) vehicle, with a mirrored partial-parabolic reflector on the bottom, aerodynamic intakes along the rim, and a ceramic matrix composite main fuselage. A laser beam, focused from either the ground or from a SBSP satellite, is aimed at the mirrored structure superheating the air, which is then expelled at outrageous temperature and velocity. Once the vehicle has exited the atmosphere, the ""spike"" at the bottom is jettisoned, revealing a heat exchanger and hydrogen thruster, using the laser beam's power to heat and accelerate the seeded hydrogen propellant until the lightcraft reaches orbit. 

Each lightcraft is extremely cheap, and is mostly reusable. Guidance and power generation are both offboard, and the vehicles can be made in the matter of 2-3 hours by a carbon nanotube 3D-spinning machine with a final thermal protection coat, followed by addition of a mass-manufactured heat exchanger and hydrogen thruster. As a result, each vehicle is predicted to cost less than $10,000. Moreover, lightcraft will have an expected lifetime of 5 flights (with another application of spray-on TPS in between flights and recovery using unused S-2 Condor payload volume), for per-flight hardware costs of less than $2,000.

To deliver this low cost, the LightLauncher leverages a mature technology base. Using carbon nanotube mirror technology developed by Starlight Systems, the thermal protection system technology of NGAS, and the CNT manufacturing technology of Tesla, the LightLauncher itself is a low-risk system that can be made in extremely large volumes.

Infrastructure
----------------

The main trick is producing the laser beams that the LightLauncher will ride. The LightLauncher needs an approximately 1GW beam to reach orbit with a 200kg payload, which in turn demands an enormous laser battery. This challenge will be met with not one but two separate laser battery systems, allowing the timesharing and multiple simultaneous launch of the different lasers while minimizing the power transmission losses.

Lasers from space are relatively cheap, thanks to Starlight Systems, but lasers on the ground are much more expensive. This cannot be leveraged to maximum potential, however, because the LightLauncher's [ascent profile](https://i.imgur.com/jP4PLWz.jpg) [M the atmospheric phase is shallower than illustrated here M] is not always oriented towards a orbiting laser satellite. As a result, the vehicle must be initially given a big shove to get it airborne and going fast enough for the laser to work at all, then be propelled through the early phase of its gravity turn until the orbital laser can take over.

Located at Ellison Onizuka Space Center in Hawaii, Photonic Research's initial launch complex will consist of these three components, and will aim to be able to deliver up to 6,000kg to orbit per day using a single SBSP satellite.

**Ground Accelerator**

To give the lasers as much help as possible, a large General Atomics built electromagnetic accelerator will be used. This accelerator is 200 meters long, offers elevations within a 5 degree range, and can be rotated (on a turntable) for orbital inclination selection. The accelerator accelerates the lightcraft to approximately 500m/s, at which point the laser ground battery takes over.

**Ground Battery**

After the LightLaunchers leave the accelerator, the ground laser battery (built by Kratos Heavy Industries) takes over. The ground battery, consisting of 25 DFEL lasers in a beam combining array, delivers 500MW of laser power to the lightcraft accelerating them to more than mach 5 as they pitch over on their gravity turns towards orbit. The battery only provides power for approximately 1 minute per lightcraft, however, until the orbital SBSP satellite takes over.

**SBSP Battery**

Once the LightLauncher has attained a sufficiently low attitude relative to the horizon, a Starlight Systems sun-pumped 1GW laser SBSP satellite takes over for the next 3 and a half minutes of the LightLauncher's flight. This SBSP satellite takes the LightLauncher from around 2km/s up to orbital velocity of 7km/s, providing the high power required through the hypersonic flight regime and the onboard reaction mass phases of flight.

**Pickup**

Photonic Technologies will then pick up the orbital LightLaunchers using a Interim Orbital Transfer Vehicle purchased from La Technologies as they transition to HPOT orbital tugs. The payloads will then be shipped to wherever the customer desires.

**Costs**

Disregarding the (large) capital costs, with an amortized LightLauncher cost of around $5,000, around $3,500 worth of payload processing costs (the idea is to ship the LightLauncher payload bodies to the customer, who is responsible for filling them properly), and the approximate $800 worth of power used, Photonic Technologies expects that the LightLauncher will offer payload to orbit costs of around $31/kg, competitive with the $25.5/kg offered by the S-2 Condor.

**Operations**

Each SBSP satellite will make up to 5 usable passes per day over the EOSC complex, with each allowing 3 launches, for 15 launches per day per satellite. In conjunction with mass production of LightLaunchers, Photonic Technologies plans to be able to deliver up to 4,500kg per satellite per day to orbit, 

Program
----------

There are several major capital costs:

* The LightLauncher factory, located near Hilo. This massively automated facility is designed to produce up to 10 LightLaunchers per day initially, and is predicted to cost around $150 million.
* The General Atomics Electromagnetic Accelerator, expected to cost approximately $250 million.
* The Ground Laser Battery, projected to cost $300 million.
* 2 Starlight Systems SBSP satellites, with a $1 billion overall cost.

In addition to $250 million in development costs, Photonic Technologies expects to spend around $2 billion over the next 3 years to bring their laser powered space launcher to reality. The company plans to service several markets, including the microsat industry, commercial resupply with fresh food for tourism space stations, and other markets where an S-2 Condor launch is not economically viable.

I've got a thing for breeding. I haven't really made that a secret (dear god, the number of personals...)

Lightning Round! If you see an rp you'd be interested in, hit me up!

**Breeding Time at the Hucow Farm** - we get turned into sex crazy cow people and fuck 

**Xanathar's Guide to Breeding** - horny tiefling (eyyyyy) seduces his way across the dnd landscape.

**Dealings in Starlight** - a gruff mercenary falls into the clutches of a fae with an overactive sex drive. 

**The Breeding Project** - post war repopulation effort through...interesting means.

These are more detailed in my post history, so if you'd like to get a read on my writing style, check it out.

I've got some time to kill, so I thought I'd give this a shot. 

Hope to hear from some of y'all.

It’s difficult to appreciate how many obstacles a forest can throw at you until you’ve had to run through one in the dead of night with the Hounds of Hell yapping at your heels like red-eyed, fire-breathing Pekingese.

Robert glanced over his shoulder only once, long enough to see that the wave of death was crashing through the forest just a few yards behind him. It was also just long enough to run straight into one of the thorn-covered vines that dangled from the trees. 

The barbs dug into his arm, and the vine came to life, whipping around his limb and then curling up towards his neck. He had enough time to wonder if this was how it all ended, when the wave caught up with the tree that the vine was suspended from. The vine recoiled in pain, releasing Robert, and he jumped away and kept on running.

After that, he kept his eyes on where he was going.

Eventually, the forest floor began to slope upwards, and the trees thinned and gave way to a grassy hill. Robert was half-way up when he realized that the destruction had angled away from the hill, and was now cutting a swathe through the forest to his right. He collapsed on the grass and stared up at the sky. The stars were spinning, but he wasn’t sure if that was him, or just how stars behaved in this place.

“You don’t half cut it close, do you?” said a familiar growl. 

The rabbit was sitting a few feet further up the hill. Robert said weakly, “Help,” and passed out.

When he came to, the stars had disappeared entirely and the darkness was full only of the scent of earth and carrots. Something furry brushed against his leg and he jumped upwards and hit his head on a low ceiling.

“Careful,” the rabbit’s voice growled in the darkness. “Took me months to get the right curvature on that roof.”

A match flared, and before Robert could ask where the rabbit had got a match or how he’d lit it without opposable thumbs, the light illuminated a sea of whiskered faces in a small tunnel.

“Where am I?” he said, half sitting up in the narrow burrow.

“A rabbit’s warren is his castle,” the rabbit said through a mouthful of match. “Welcome to my humble home. This is my family.”

“Hi,” Robert said weakly. It was a big family. “I feel awful.”

The rabbit used the match to light a candle. “What’d you think would happen if you ran into a thorn bush?”

In the dim flickers of candlelight, Robert could see that his arm was bleeding. “The thorns did this?”

“They’ve poisoned you,” the rabbit said. “I did what I could, but She’ll need to take a look if you want to live out the week.”

“A week?” Robert repeated. Maybe the rabbit wasn’t good with timeframes.

“A week,” the rabbit said. A thought struck it, and it said more cheerfully, “Of course, it might be worse for humans. Put you out of your misery quicker, and all that.”

“But the Queen can help?”

Some of the smaller rabbits retreated at the mention of Her name. The rabbit growled, “Can? Yes. Will? Probably not. You’re not her favorite person right now.”

“But-” Robert said. Half a day of accumulated misery came bubbling up all at once. “But this isn’t fair. I didn’t ask to come to a crazy world of talking rabbits and psychopathic monarchs and killer vines.”

“Pah,” the rabbit said. “Listen to yourself. You sound pathetic.”

“But why is this happening to me?” Robert said.

“Everything’s got to happen to someone,” the rabbit said. “If it didn’t, it wouldn’t be a thing.”

Robert groaned inwardly. He wasn’t in the mood for another philosophical argument in a world where the rules of logic stated that the shortest path between any two points contained more hairpin turns than a Himalayan peak.

“Besides,” the rabbit said, “sometimes good stuff happens to bad people.”

“What’s that supposed to mean?”

“It means,” said the rabbit, “that if you slide your backside that way a few yards you’ll be back out in the fresh air. Don’t ask us to carry you again. You nearly crushed my uncle while we were getting you in here.”

Robert began to crawl back down the tunnel.

“Careful,” the rabbit said. “Look out for the beam! If you bring the roof down, I’ll bite your ear off. By the Queen’s furry behind, I can hardly bear to watch this.”

Somehow Robert made it back onto the hillside without causing irreparable damage to the warren or himself. It was still night, but a glimmer on one corner of the horizon suggested that the sun might live another day.

“The Queen’s furry behind?” he said.

The rabbit cleared its throat. “If you could avoid mentioning that to Her, I’d be much obliged.”

Robert looked out over the landscape. There was a narrow strip of trees at the base of the hill, and beyond that was dead land, with all the life sucked clean out of it.

“How is he doing that?” Robert asked. “How can he just destroy everything?”

“That’s powerful magic,” the rabbit said. “Sucking the very soul out of something like that. Can’t say as I fully understand, but She would know.”

“But She can’t do anything about it?”

“Her hands are tied.”

“That makes no sense,” Robert said. “She’s the Queen, isn’t she. Can’t she do what she wants?”

“Even She is not above the Law,” the rabbit said. “And in their infinite wisdom, the Powers That Be decided that the law was the Law in this case.”

The rabbit’s tone suggested that the Powers That Were might have a more finite grip on wisdom than they liked to let on, but it would elaborate no further despite Robert’s questioning.

Robert sighed. The arm that had been scratched by the thorns was going numb, and in the starlight the skin around the wounds looked darker than it should have been. He wasn’t looking forward to seeing it in the light of day. He looked up at the dying world to distract himself.

“Rabbit,” he said, “do you know who voted against us?”

“Not a clue,” the rabbit said. “Bastard, whoever they were.”

“I don’t suppose I could see the black stone that you didn’t put in the ballot bag,” Robert said casually.

The rabbit froze. “Lost it when I was running.”

“Ah,” Robert said. “Yes, I can see how that might have happened. Convenient how the destruction managed to avoid missing your home so narrowly though, wouldn’t you say?”

“I’m not sure I like your tone, lawyer,” the rabbit growled.

“Good,” Robert said. He stood up and nearly fell down the hill. Maybe he *had* been poisoned.

“If you think you can threaten me, just you remember what I said about your ear. Hard to be taken seriously when you’ve only got one ear.”

“I think you’ll have more to worry about than ears if She finds out what you did,” Robert said.

“You wouldn’t dare,” the rabbit growled.

“I want to get home,” Robert said. “I want whatever is wrong with my arm to be healed. Help me with those, and I won’t-”

“Bastard,” the rabbit snarled.

For a moment, Robert thought the creature was talking to him, but then he followed its gaze down the hill.

Beyond the trees, some of Big Al’s men were walking across the dead zone towards them with life-sucking machines slung over their shoulders. In the quietness of the night, Robert could hear motors starting up.

“That bastard,” the rabbit said. “He promised. I’ve got little ones here.”

“Get them out,” Robert said. “Take them and run. It’s the only way.”

“Can’t,” the rabbit said. “They’re newborns. No way they can be moved, not fast enough to get away from that.”

Below them, the distant edge of the forest began to come closer, as the trees withered and died under the advance.

“Maybe they’ll only come to the base of the hill,” Robert said.

“Yeah, right,” the rabbit said. “Or maybe they thought, ‘Ooh, that hill would make a great rest stop for this highway.’ You know the man better than I do. What do you think?”

*I’ve never seen a service station on a hill,* Robert thought, *but I do know Big Al.*

“Hey, where are you going?” the rabbit said.

Robert didn’t stop walking down the hill towards Big Al’s men. “Get your family as far away as possible,” he said over his shoulder.

He glanced back when he was half-way down the hill and saw a stream of small shapes fleeing out of tunnel entrances. By the time he got to the bottom of the slope, Big Al’s men had made it as far in the opposite direction. There were three of them.

“Stop,” Robert shouted but the men had ear protectors on against the noise of the machines.

The wave rushed towards him. Trees that had grown towards the sun for two hundred years died as it washed over them, their leaves shriveling, then their branches rotting and falling, and then their trunks disintegrating on to the dead ground below.

It was ten yards away, then just a few feet. Robert took a deep breath. When you were expecting Death to ring the doorbell, it was best to wait with your eyes open. He stepped forward to meet it.

&amp;nbsp;

Aflia flicked her tail impatiently, ""of course I trust you Mul. Lead on.""

&amp;nbsp;

Mul nodded and beckoned Aflia to follow. ""just outside the town, I can open a Gate at sundown. It should take us to the matching hilltop just outside of Sapphire. Just don't open any of the doors.""

&amp;nbsp;

Aflia's brow furrowed, ""what doors?""

&amp;nbsp;

""You will see once we enter the Gate.""

&amp;nbsp;

A few hours later atop the hill, Aflia stood back and watched Mul draw an incredibly intricate Magic Circle in the dirt. Whispered Primordial words lit twinkling rune-lights the color of starlight. A slash of un-light cut through reality into the middle of the Circle. With the screech of tortured metal, it ripped wider and took the shape of a doorway into nothingness. Mul motioned Aflia forward, then stepped into oblivion.

&amp;nbsp;

Aflia took a deep breath and followed Mul into the Gate. Immediately she was ambushed by a sense of vertigo, and her hooves went out from under her. Aflia sat there on the floor that wasn't a floor until her mind managed to orient itself. The Gate burned closed at her back, melding seamlessly into a wall of carven stone. Aflia climbed to her hooves and looked about the area for Mul. Instead she found a endless procession of doors. Some were set into the walls, some stood out from them at odd, unnatural angles, and yet others were freestanding. Some were simple timber, others were of gilded metals, and yet more were blood-drenched wrought iron.

&amp;nbsp;

Mul was nowhere to be seen, and Aflia felt her heartbeat accelerate in panic. She wasn't in the material realm anymore, had no idea where any of the doors lead to, and had lost her guide.

&amp;nbsp;

""The Blood of the Dragon. We meet at last.""

&amp;nbsp;

Aflia whipped around to face the source of the cadaverous voice and found a thin figure in a black cloak leaning casually against the frame of a doorway.

&amp;nbsp;

The figure held up a gloved hand in a gesture of benediction, ""no need to fret, I mean you no harm. The Voice of the Outsider is Pacted to me, and has brought you to my realm that you may go with all haste to where you need go. I simply wished to look upon you with my own eyes.""

&amp;nbsp;

Aflia drew herself to her full height, ""and now that you have, may I be on my way?""

&amp;nbsp;

The figure flicked a dismissive hand, ""as soon as The Voice of the Outsider finds her way to us to open the door, you may leave. I would offer you a gift, if you would choose to accept it.""

&amp;nbsp;

Aflia  tapped a hoof impatiently, ""and if I choose not to?""

&amp;nbsp;

""Then it may be some time before the Voice of the Outsider finds her way here.""

&amp;nbsp;

""No choice huh. What would you give me then?""

&amp;nbsp;

""I would unlock the power that sings in your Blood; ice as well as fire. Not all at once, no mortal could survive that unprepared, but it would blossom as you grow and learn.""

&amp;nbsp;

""Do it then.""

&amp;nbsp;

The black-cloaked figure stepped closer and stretched out one gloved hand, ""this may feel odd dear."" It tapped Aflia gently on the cheek, specifically on the fine scales just below her eyes.

&amp;nbsp;

Aflia gasped as she felt her body twitch. A crackling sparkle of magic raced down her veins to her heart, where it exploded back outward along her arteries. Her blood ran cold as ice and hot as molten stone. Her skin itched furiously. Her vision swam, then faded out. Aflia collapsed to the floor in an untidy heap.

&amp;nbsp;

Mul cam around a corner and saw Aflia in a heap before her Patron, ""Lorekeeper, will she live?""

&amp;nbsp;

""She will live, and she will be fine. The Blood of the Dragon has made no pact with me, but you should take her from this place before she wakes. It will make the translocation through the second Gate easier for her.""",True,False,False,HFY,t5_2y95n,,,public,,self,,,[OC] Aris Cretu 54: Black Shrouded Gates,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/7ugfmw/oc_aris_cretu_54_black_shrouded_gates/,all_ads,,True,,,,,

I've got a thing for breeding. I haven't really made that a secret (dear god, the number of personals...)

Lightning Round! If you see an rp you'd be interested in, hit me up!

**Breeding Time at the Hucow Farm** - we get turned into sex crazy cow people and fuck 

**Xanathar's Guide to Breeding** - horny tiefling (eyyyyy) seduces his way across the dnd landscape.

**Dealings in Starlight** - a gruff mercenary falls into the clutches of a fae with an overactive sex drive. 

**The Breeding Project** - post war repopulation effort through...interesting means.

**Wheel of Breeding** - game show where winning and losing lead to the same thing - baby making!

These are more detailed in my post history, so if you'd like to get a read on my writing style, check it out.

I've got some time to kill, so I thought I'd give this a shot. 

Hope to hear from some of y'all.

I’d been tracking a guardian distress signal for two days when we finally reached a valley shrouded in dark. It was here that the signal stopped. This place was strange. I’ve spent months out here in the wild of the dead zone and have never seen anything like it. 

It frightens me... 

Fifty, my ghost, buzzed around the scene. lighting it the best it could, but staying out of my way. I preferred to track using my own talents. “I need to get this thing off.” I said, as I pulled off my helmet and tossed it to the ground. Fifty transmats my gear back to my ship for safekeeping or until I need it again. 

There’s a breeze tonight. I crouched down near the entrance to the valley, the cool rush of air caressing my pale blue skin. It felt nice, but there was no time to enjoy it. I needed to find something that could put us back on the trail. 

There it is. A few steps in front of me. *“Fifty, a light.”* He buzzed closer to light my path. It was a puddle of ether. I dipped my fingers into the puddle and sniffed the air. *“This seems fresh.”* I said, standing up with a slight stretch. *“I think we need to go in.”*

*“I think you’re right,”* Fifty responded.  I brushed my cloak aside to grab the gun from the holster on my hip.  My gun was something special. Banshee made it for me awhile back after I brought him boxes of scraps I took from deserted Fallen encampments. He called it a Stolen Pride, but I liked to call it the Baron.

I walked at a steady pace into the valley, Fifty lighting the way. The starlight above was completely obstructed by thick foliage. I imagine not even the sunlight could penetrate it. 

It was silent. My own footsteps seemingly voiceless. As if on cue, the silence was interrupted by a clicking sound. My gripped tightened around the Baron, and my hands started to sweat. I stopped dead in my tracks. Those clicks were unmistakable.

It is the Fire Emblem with the 5 Gemstones that are lodged in it. When together, they have the power to keep the Earth Dragons asleep for all eternity. 

However, after giving a more thorough analysis of the story, regarding the Fire Emblem and the 5 Gemstones used, I have come to realize that anyone that wields the Emblem with the Gemstones on them actually would possess the power of a demigod in fact. 

All you need to do is turn each the gameplay mechanic of the Gemstones to a special power storywise. 

**- Lifesphere/Gules:** A Gemstone that heals wounds.

**- Starsphere/Azure:** A Gemstone that draws out the inner strength of the holder. 

**- Geosphere/Vert:** A Gemstone that possesses the power of terraformation.

**- Darksphere/Sable:** A Gemstone that negates all forms of attacks and seals souls.

**- Lightsphere/Argent:** A Gemstone that nullifies terrain effects and dark abilities.

If you combine all of these attributes into Fire Emblem that draws out all their power to the maximum, you have a human that has the power to heal from nearly any injury, draw on power that they are stronger than any human, transform the terrain almost akin to Dragon Veins, seal others, and dispel any illusions and dark abilities that enemies might have against you. However the Lightsphere will naturally prevent the Darksphere's ability to negate attacks from activating, but it protects your own soul from harm. 

Regardless, a single human that has this would become virtually invincible. Is it any wonder why the Fire Emblem was demanded to be separated during the Schism during the First Exalt's reign? If a nation had the Fire Emblem with the Gemstones, they would be able to easily use this for war purposes, and thus make it so that conquering nations and continents to be ridiculously easy. That's precisely why Gangrel wanted the Fire Emblem from Ylisse, as he could use it to wipe out the Ylissians and also face Walhart with it.

Not to mention that these were the same Gemstones that were used to create powerful magic spells like Imhullu and Starlight, two incredibly powerful magic spells in the Archanea series. 

If they had actually translated these things into the gameplay of Mystery and New Mystery, Marth would have had something like +50 on each stat, and a bunch of other things. But they really toned it down. Funny when they could have easily done what they did with the Book of Naga in Genealogy, where it was gamebreaking. But they were milder in the series.

Everyone seemed to love [my post on alternate character interpretations for Chromatic Dragon villains](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/7tqy6a/an_alternate_character_interpretation_for/), so I'm making a ***sequel***! Heck, I may make a series out of this. These posts are really fun!

Next up on the docket, the cousins of the Chromatics-- Metallic Dragons. These shiny serpents don't get nearly as much press as their colorful comrades, mostly because Good monsters aren't nearly as relevant to the needs of DMs. Most monsters exist in the context of foes for PCs and most PCs are either Good or Neutral, so the need for Good foes is limited. However, they're still pretty iconic and a move towards moral ambiguity and complexity in recent years has expanded their usefulness for DMs (because now PCs can kill them without feeling bad, yay murder!).

So, here are my attempts to reinterpret the Metallic dragons for use in your game. Like my Chromatic post, my goal is to introduce an interpretation that both stays somewhat true to the intent of the designers of the monsters while providing an interpretation that's somewhat novel. It's totally valid to just make stuff up about these creatures if you're the DM (as long as you're consistent), but I want to try and stick to the 'traditional' interpretation of the monsters, so the post is as accessible as possible. Unlike in the previous post, I'll be shifting the moralities a bit grayer, but like the previous post, I'll offer sub-interpretations that lean Evil and Good.

Note that you can also apply some of these concepts to Chromatics and some of the Chromatic concepts here. Use your imaginations!

**BRONZE-- The Noble Conqueror**

*Talax wept. She wept because she had bested the orcs of the Shattered Wood. She wept because she united the warring brother nations of Alazar. She wept because she alone had been able to bring peace to the dread Medusa at the heart of the Lover's Maze. She wept because she had stormed the lair of the great and terrible Bonelord and found his forces wanting. But more than all, Talax wept because there were no more worlds for her to conquer.*

Bronze dragons are the 'warriors' of the Metallics, seeing to 'oppose tyranny'. This can easily be stretched to assume that they would want to take on the mantle of conquest themselves, seeking to bring 'just rule' to any who they can. This may involve overthrowing rulers they see as corrupt, uniting nations locked in a civil war under their rule, or simply killing enough bandits and raiders until they have effectively become the law of any given reason. If taken to an extreme, they may rule entire continents as ancient warlords whose massive armies are formed from the nations they conquered. If on a small scale, they may seek to eke out a small fiefdom in an otherwise wild land. Whatever scale, they see conquest as both a moral duty and a job that doesn't end when the tyrant falls dead.

**A lighter sheen of Bronze** takes a generous view of war and conquest. This is mostly a matter of context. Skilled warriors can bring peace to lands that have warred for centuries-- a fully Good Bronze Conqueror may replace petty warlords with a republic, swearing their absolute fealty (and the fealty of their armies) to any properly elected government, like a Cincinnatus, showing no desire to rule themselves. They may gain the loyalty of orcish warbands and forge them into an army of mercenaries that refuse to loot or pillage out of fear of judgement from their Bronze commander.

**A darker sheen of Bronze** uses their opposition to tyranny as a casus belli for war against the whole world. Unlike conquering Chromatics, this war isn't to fuel an ego or to assemble a horde-- it's out of a misplaced and perfectionist sense of justice. They can be interpreted as hypocrites that fail to see their own tyrannical ways or those who are merely too fanatical and controlling to accept the imperfections of mortals.

**COPPER-- The Uninvited Guest**

*The Copper was never invited to this party. The Copper was never invited to any parties. They didn't understand why. They had plenty of japes-- more than anyone else! Their arsenal of jokes and riddles were second to none! They had yet to be bested in a game of wits! And yet, no invitations were sent. They came anyways, and in spite of all the screaming, they were the last guest to leave. Mortals are so rude.*

Honestly, parts of the way Copper dragons were described in the Monster Manual made them seem rather irritating, and I decided to amplify this aspect of them. These Coppers are pests with no standards. They are attention seekers, always looking for a new way to get a rise out of someone. In spite of their great power, their ambitions are rather small, seeking to be treated as a star and always seeking validation. This can lead them to violate social norms, which they didn't really care much about to begin with, given that they're FUCKING DRAGONS.

Basically, YouTube vloggers in giant lizard form.

**A lighter sheen of Copper** may be a prick, but this one's actually funny and directs their attention-seeking humor to prank people who actually deserve it. They may even recruit the players, offering powerful artifacts in return for their assistance in pulling off daring pranks. Consider-- coloring a Lich's wardrobe pink, putting chili powder in the tank of an Elder Brain, breaking into the lair of a Red Dragon, doing nothing, and waiting for the mental breakdown-- the possibilities are endless!

**A darker sheen of Copper** is probably the most annoying threat the players will ever face. This lizard isn't a worldwide threat, but a general lack of empathy, failing to view mortal lives as particularly valuable, and a singular lack of anything better to do could lead to a few individuals having very miserable (and perhaps short) lives. These dragons will literally *kill* for fun, and claim they never did anything wrong, punctuating the battle with cries of ""IT'S JUST A PRANK, BRO"".

**BRASS-- The Eternal Mayor**

*Mayor Brackle claimed to be a new politician for a new era. Gods know that Dunesend needed new blood after the long reign of the late Mayor Starlight. She was plenty competent, but her decades-long mayorship seemed like a repeat of her predecessor, who himself felt like a retread of the policies of the town's founder. Still, it's clear that Brackle was a townie through and through. He even had the traits that all mayors since the founding had shared-- locks of blonde hair, a bronze complexion, and love of jewelry. Heck of a coincidence.*

Brass dragons really really love company, so, why not seek it? Worries about security, of course. Well, here's a solution-- if you're the law in a town, you don't need to worry about security and you can have all the friends you want. That being said, dragons tend to attract a lot of attention. I've got a solution for that as well-- Shapeshift! The Brass simply disguises themselves as a mortal, and swap disguises when that mortal 'dies', using illusions to smooth the transition. These Brass Dragons rule over a location (village, town, city, whatever) for as long as they want and nobody's the wiser!

**A lighter sheen of Brass** uses this power for good, acting as a benefactor for the village as it grows first into a town and then a city! These Brass are basically the player in any city-building game (except for the sadism, most of the time), always seeking to improve the lives of their citizens as an invisible hand of progress.

**A darker sheen of Brass** amplifies the paranoia of this scenario. These dragons act as the Big Brother of this town, treating their subjects less as people and more as cattle. These could be used as the secret villains of city-focused games, acting as the masterminds behind every power in the city.

**SILVER-- The Cultish Ascetic**

*The outside was dangerous. The gods alone could protect you from its corruption. These were the lessons taught by the Silver Protector, Archon of Frosthold. The Sanctum had no entrance or exit. The Silver Protector had destroyed the passes that allowed their foes to reach it long ago. Those within the Sanctum claimed this would prevent escape if attacked from the air, so the Silver Protector dug a great cave to protect us. Truly, they are a blessing from the gods.*

These silvers take their (relative) humility and desire to protect the 'little folk' to a Puritanical extreme. They are deeply religious or at least have very strongly held beliefs, and see the world as a source of corruption for both themselves and their dependents. So, they find a frozen shelter from the world, a cave or high mountain town, and seal it off from the rest of the world. They can use their magics and flight to bring supplies to the town without ever leaving, keeping themselves isolated, but also keeping their dependents completely dependent and completely isolated. 

**A lighter sheen of Silver** may do this for an essential reason (this Silver could oversee a post-apocalyptic 'vault') or may only bring those who are similarly minded (act as the leader of a monastery, whose members all chose to live in isolation). This character would make a useful mentor figure for an Acolyte or a source of lost knowledge. They'd still probably be skittish about the outside world and may not allow those who leave to return.

**A darker sheen of Silver** is a cult leader, seeking to brainwash their followers into believing that they are the only valid source of truth in a world full of lies. They aren't likely to be very dangerous (they're very isolated) but gods forbid you have to enter their sanctum. Prepare to be jumped by dozens of crazed cultist halfings.

**GOLD-- The Gentledragon Thief**

*""It's the damnedest thing, Sarge. We swear we had him dead to rights! That bastard's been making fools out of us for weeks now, knocking out our men and slipping away into the night, and we had him! Suddenly, he grew wings! Wings, out of nothing, and flew away into the night! What the hell are we supposed to do against that?!""*

Gold dragons eat gold and disguise themselves on the regular. ""Classy Thief"" then seems like a potential reinterpretation that could be very fun to play with. These Golds seek to sate their appetite and spit in the face of the proud. This behavior not only makes them an interesting Rogue contact or rival, but a natural enemy of Chromatic dragons, even without knowledge of their identity. The pride of the Golds would manifest in the form of calling cards and taunts to guards, daring those who will to stop them, and only revealing their natural abilities when forced to.

**A lighter sheen of Gold** would steal from the rich, give to the poor, and have a few snacks on the side. They'd make an enigmatic mentor figure to other Chaotic Good type characters and a massive pain in the ass to evil parties who have (had) a windfall of wealth. They may even oppose other dragons on this list, like the darker interpretations of a Brass or Bronze.

**A darker sheen of Gold** would be a selfish criminal who seeks to spit in the eye of law and order. They'd make an excellent villain for any characters that represent the law in large cities and a potential rival for other immoral master thieves. If your party has grown used to dealing with regular thieves, throw one of these their way. They'll definitely be surprised (unless they've read this post)!

**END**

Thanks to all the positive feedback on the previous post! Like that one, these interpretations are not intended to replace the existing concepts of dragons. Some would even be rather bizarre as 'canonical' interpretations of an entire caste's behavior. They are intended to provide useful content for DMs trying to fill their world with unique characters. I hope that I have helped do this!

PLEASE, also, comment below with other interpretations of these glittering giants that you've used in the past!

***TL;DR Bronze Dragons as Alexander the Great, Copper Dragons as tasteless pranksters, Brass Dragons as the secret leaders of cities, Silver Dragons as monkish creatures that hide their dependents away, and Gold Dragons as daring and classy thieves of gold and wealth***

Heck, I may make a series out of this. These posts are really fun!

Next up on the docket, the cousins of the Chromatics-- Metallic Dragons. These shiny serpents don't get nearly as much press as their colorful comrades, mostly because Good monsters aren't nearly as relevant to the needs of DMs. Most monsters exist in the context of foes for PCs and most PCs are either Good or Neutral, so the need for Good foes is limited. However, they're still pretty iconic and a move towards moral ambiguity and complexity in recent years has expanded their usefulness for DMs (because now PCs can kill them without feeling bad, yay murder!).

So, here are my attempts to reinterpret the Metallic dragons for use in your game. Like my Chromatic post, my goal is to introduce an interpretation that both stays somewhat true to the intent of the designers of the monsters while providing an interpretation that's somewhat novel. It's totally valid to just make stuff up about these creatures if you're the DM (as long as you're consistent), but I want to try and stick to the 'traditional' interpretation of the monsters, so the post is as accessible as possible. Unlike in the previous post, I'll be shifting the moralities a bit grayer, but like the previous post, I'll offer sub-interpretations that lean Evil and Good.

Note that you can also apply some of these concepts to Chromatics and some of the Chromatic concepts here. Use your imaginations!

**BRONZE-- The Noble Conqueror**

*Talax wept. She wept because she had bested the orcs of the Shattered Wood. She wept because she united the warring brother nations of Alazar. She wept because she alone had been able to bring peace to the dread Medusa at the heart of the Lover's Maze. She wept because she had stormed the lair of the great and terrible Bonelord and found his forces wanting. But more than all, Talax wept because there were no more worlds for her to conquer.*

Bronze dragons are the 'warriors' of the Metallics, seeing to 'oppose tyranny'. This can easily be stretched to assume that they would want to take on the mantle of conquest themselves, seeking to bring 'just rule' to any who they can. This may involve overthrowing rulers they see as corrupt, uniting nations locked in a civil war under their rule, or simply killing enough bandits and raiders until they have effectively become the law of any given reason. If taken to an extreme, they may rule entire continents as ancient warlords whose massive armies are formed from the nations they conquered. If on a small scale, they may seek to eke out a small fiefdom in an otherwise wild land. Whatever scale, they see conquest as both a moral duty and a job that doesn't end when the tyrant falls dead.

**A lighter sheen of Bronze** takes a generous view of war and conquest. This is mostly a matter of context. Skilled warriors can bring peace to lands that have warred for centuries-- a fully Good Bronze Conqueror may replace petty warlords with a republic, swearing their absolute fealty (and the fealty of their armies) to any properly elected government, like a Cincinnatus, showing no desire to rule themselves. They may gain the loyalty of orcish warbands and forge them into an army of mercenaries that refuse to loot or pillage out of fear of judgement from their Bronze commander.

**A darker sheen of Bronze** uses their opposition to tyranny as a casus belli for war against the whole world. Unlike conquering Chromatics, this war isn't to fuel an ego or to assemble a horde-- it's out of a misplaced and perfectionist sense of justice. They can be interpreted as hypocrites that fail to see their own tyrannical ways or those who are merely too fanatical and controlling to accept the imperfections of mortals.

**COPPER-- The Uninvited Guest**

*The Copper was never invited to this party. The Copper was never invited to any parties. They didn't understand why. They had plenty of japes-- more than anyone else! Their arsenal of jokes and riddles were second to none! They had yet to be bested in a game of wits! And yet, no invitations were sent. They came anyways, and in spite of all the screaming, they were the last guest to leave. Mortals are so rude.*

Honestly, parts of the way Copper dragons were described in the Monster Manual made them seem rather irritating, and I decided to amplify this aspect of them. These Coppers are pests with no standards. They are attention seekers, always looking for a new way to get a rise out of someone. In spite of their great power, their ambitions are rather small, seeking to be treated as a star and always seeking validation. This can lead them to violate social norms, which they didn't really care much about to begin with, given that they're FUCKING DRAGONS.

Basically, YouTube vloggers in giant lizard form.

**A lighter sheen of Copper** may be a prick, but this one's actually funny and directs their attention-seeking humor to prank people who actually deserve it. They may even recruit the players, offering powerful artifacts in return for their assistance in pulling off daring pranks. Consider-- coloring a Lich's wardrobe pink, putting chili powder in the tank of an Elder Brain, breaking into the lair of a Red Dragon, doing nothing, and waiting for the mental breakdown-- the possibilities are endless!

**A darker sheen of Copper** is probably the most annoying threat the players will ever face. This lizard isn't a worldwide threat, but a general lack of empathy, failing to view mortal lives as particularly valuable, and a singular lack of anything better to do could lead to a few individuals having very miserable (and perhaps short) lives. These dragons will literally *kill* for fun, and claim they never did anything wrong, punctuating the battle with cries of ""IT'S JUST A PRANK, BRO"".

**BRASS-- The Eternal Mayor**

*Mayor Brackle claimed to be a new politician for a new era. Gods know that Dunesend needed new blood after the long reign of the late Mayor Starlight. She was plenty competent, but her decades-long mayorship seemed like a repeat of her predecessor, who himself felt like a retread of the policies of the town's founder. Still, it's clear that Brackle was a townie through and through. He even had the traits that all mayors since the founding had shared-- locks of blonde hair, a bronze complexion, and love of jewelry. Heck of a coincidence.*

Brass dragons really really love company, so, why not seek it? Worries about security, of course. Well, here's a solution-- if you're the law in a town, you don't need to worry about security and you can have all the friends you want. That being said, dragons tend to attract a lot of attention. I've got a solution for that as well-- Shapeshift! The Brass simply disguises themselves as a mortal, and swap disguises when that mortal 'dies', using illusions to smooth the transition. These Brass Dragons rule over a location (village, town, city, whatever) for as long as they want and nobody's the wiser!

**A lighter sheen of Brass** uses this power for good, acting as a benefactor for the village as it grows first into a town and then a city! These Brass are basically the player in any city-building game (except for the sadism, most of the time), always seeking to improve the lives of their citizens as an invisible hand of progress.

**A darker sheen of Brass** amplifies the paranoia of this scenario. These dragons act as the Big Brother of this town, treating their subjects less as people and more as cattle. These could be used as the secret villains of city-focused games, acting as the masterminds behind every power in the city.

**SILVER-- The Cultish Ascetic**

*The outside was dangerous. The gods alone could protect you from its corruption. These were the lessons taught by the Silver Protector, Archon of Frosthold. The Sanctum had no entrance or exit. The Silver Protector had destroyed the passes that allowed their foes to reach it long ago. Those within the Sanctum claimed this would prevent escape if attacked from the air, so the Silver Protector dug a great cave to protect us. Truly, they are a blessing from the gods.*

These silvers take their (relative) humility and desire to protect the 'little folk' to a Puritanical extreme. They are deeply religious or at least have very strongly held beliefs, and see the world as a source of corruption for both themselves and their dependents. So, they find a frozen shelter from the world, a cave or high mountain town, and seal it off from the rest of the world. They can use their magics and flight to bring supplies to the town without ever leaving, keeping themselves isolated, but also keeping their dependents completely dependent and completely isolated. 

**A lighter sheen of Silver** may do this for an essential reason (this Silver could oversee a post-apocalyptic 'vault') or may only bring those who are similarly minded (act as the leader of a monastery, whose members all chose to live in isolation). This character would make a useful mentor figure for an Acolyte or a source of lost knowledge. They'd still probably be skittish about the outside world and may not allow those who leave to return.

**A darker sheen of Silver** is a cult leader, seeking to brainwash their followers into believing that they are the only valid source of truth in a world full of lies. They aren't likely to be very dangerous (they're very isolated) but gods forbid you have to enter their sanctum. Prepare to be jumped by dozens of crazed cultist halfings.

**GOLD-- The Gentledragon Thief**

*""It's the damnedest thing, Sarge. We swear we had him dead to rights! That bastard's been making fools out of us for weeks now, knocking out our men and slipping away into the night, and we had him! Suddenly, he grew wings! Wings, out of nothing, and flew away into the night! What the hell are we supposed to do against that?!""*

Gold dragons eat gold and disguise themselves on the regular. ""Classy Thief"" then seems like a potential reinterpretation that could be very fun to play with. These Golds seek to sate their appetite and spit in the face of the proud. This behavior not only makes them an interesting Rogue contact or rival, but a natural enemy of Chromatic dragons, even without knowledge of their identity. The pride of the Golds would manifest in the form of calling cards and taunts to guards, daring those who will to stop them, and only revealing their natural abilities when forced to.

**A lighter sheen of Gold** would steal from the rich, give to the poor, and have a few snacks on the side. They'd make an enigmatic mentor figure to other Chaotic Good type characters and a massive pain in the ass to evil parties who have (had) a windfall of wealth. They may even oppose other dragons on this list, like the darker interpretations of a Brass or Bronze.

**A darker sheen of Gold** would be a selfish criminal who seeks to spit in the eye of law and order. They'd make an excellent villain for any characters that represent the law in large cities and a potential rival for other immoral master thieves. If your party has grown used to dealing with regular thieves, throw one of these their way. They'll definitely be surprised (unless they've read this post)!

**END**

Thanks to all the positive feedback on the previous post! Like that one, these interpretations are not intended to replace the existing concepts of dragons. Some would even be rather bizarre as 'canonical' interpretations of an entire caste's behavior. They are intended to provide useful content for DMs trying to fill their world with unique characters. I hope that I have helped do this!

PLEASE, also, comment below with other interpretations of these glittering giants that you've used in the past!

***TL;DR Bronze Dragons as Alexander the Great, Copper Dragons as tasteless pranksters, Brass Dragons as the secret leaders of cities, Silver Dragons as monkish creatures that hide their dependents away, and Gold Dragons as daring and classy thieves of gold and wealth***

EDIT: Thanks for the kind words! I'll probably do another one at some point soon. I'm thinking I'll write about evil humanoid races, but if anyone has any suggestions, feel free to share!

I've just read through a few different threads on here regarding the mystery of Tom Bombadil, and while entertaining, none of the theories really explained his **presence** in the story of the War of the Ring.  So now I shall try to remedy that. 

Much of Tolkien's fairy tale structure contains an implicit struggle of Good vs. Evil. The word ""implicit"" here is of paramount importance to the functioning of the mythical components in the machinery of his story telling. Vehicles of fantasy that have the power to communicate feelings to the reader, of mysterious and imaginative poetic wonder, without them neccesarily being completely understood.  Within the narrative aspect, Tolkien describes but never states; instead using the experiences and perceptions of the characters to convey to the reader what is going on in the story. Keeps the story local.

Tolkien's Catholic background latently informs much of his work (how could it not?) and while this is a massive topic in itself there are a few concepts from it that I feel is important here. (before you guys run away he also stated this: 
 
For another and more important thing: [Arthurian Legend] is involved in, and explicitly contains the Christian religion.
For reasons which I will not elaborate, that seems to me fatal. Myth and fairy-story must, as all art, reflect and contain in solution elements of moral and religious truth (or error), but not explicit, not in the known form of the primary ‘real’ world.

But for this explanation, I believe working thru these concepts is necessary.

1. The incarnation of God (Good) in the form of Jesus Christ. In the Gospel story, Jesus Christ is the embodied, corporeal, flesh and blood form of God on Earth (rather than an invisible Omnipresence of Jehovah). Jesus comes to Earth and shares in the suffering of the world and dies for our sins (what Tolkien talks about as the Eucatastrophe of human history https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucatastrophe). Why this is relevant to our topic in the LotR, is that the story has no one central Messianic figure (various leaders emerge though none claim absolute Lordship.. except you know who); and what is considered Good is the culmination of choices and good deeds made by the characters done in the spirit of Friendship, Justice, Compassion, Valor, and Freedom (non-exhaustive list). Gandalf: it is in the small acts of kindness that keeps the evil at bay. Especially in the consequences of these choices as they reverberate over time in the Web of Fate. Bilbo sparing Gollum for example. 

2. The Lord of Hosts. That all Good people are good and gracious hosts to their guests, visitors, and families. Much of the LotR story is describing the trials and tribulations of the company faring against the harsh conditions of wild nature and encountering enemies abroad. However, they find respite and good times during stays in the Shire, Bombadil's house, Bree, Elrond's house, Lothlorien, Treebeard's house, Edoras, and Minas Tirith. Consider inversely: Gandalf's torture by Saruman at Orthanc, Frodo's experience in Shelob's lair, What happens in the Mines of Moria when held by orcs rather than dwarves, and the domination of basically anybody who gets caught by Sauron's Eye (which is the central conflict of the story: stopping Sauron from dominating ""everywhere"" in Middle Earth).

3. Good vs. Evil. The treatment of Evil in Tolkien's fairy tale is truly exquisite. Most childlike notions of Evil we all know and understand that enlightened people roll their eyes at when religious zealots speak are not his concern. Rather, it is the duality and parallel of good and evil that Tolkien deals with. For every functionary and expression of Good there is made a double, mockery of it by Evil: Elves and orcs, Ents and trolls, the Music of Ainur and Morgoth's cacophony. Even with miruvor, the Elven drink Elrond gives the company for their travels to refresh their vitality, with the fiery Orc liquor that Merry and Pippin are forced to drink when being kidnapped to Isengard. The mild captivity of Gollum by the Elves of Mirkwood vs his terrible torture in dungeons of Barad-dûr. It is in the methods and motives that differentiates Good from Evil, but not necessarily the acts (though some acts are certainly evil in themselves). Even orcs laugh, albeit sadistically. 

What Evil actually *is* insofar as Tolkien's treatment of it is more complex. For this, I will quote Tolkien directly (letter 131) as the concept is highly complicated: 

""Anyway all this stuff is mainly concerned with Fall, Mortality, and the Machine. [...] It has various opportunities of ‘Fall’. It may become possessive, clinging to the things made as its own, the sub-creator wishes to be the Lord and God of his private creation. He will rebel against the laws of the Creator – especially against mortality. Both of these (alone or together) will lead to the desire for Power, for making the will more quickly effective, – and so to the Machine (or Magic). By the last I intend all use of external plans or devices (apparatus) instead of developments of the inherent inner powers or talents – or even the use of these talents with the corrupted motive of dominating: bulldozing the real world, or coercing other wills. [...] I have not used ‘magic’ consistently, and indeed the Elven-queen Galadriel is obliged to remonstrate with the Hobbits on their confused use of the word both for the devices and operations of the Enemy, and for those of the Elves. [...] But the Elves are there (in my tales) to demonstrate the difference. Their ‘magic’ is Art, delivered from many of its human limitations: more effortless, more quick, more complete (product, and vision in unflawed correspondence). And its object is Art not Power, sub-creation not domination and tyrannous reforming of Creation. [...] The Enemy in successive forms is always ‘naturally’ concerned with sheer Domination, and so the Lord of magic and machines; but the problem: that this frightful evil can and does arise from an apparently good root, the desire to benefit the world and others – speedily and according to the benefactors own plans – is a recurrent motive.""

Get any of that? Yea. What Tolkien is saying, as far as I understand it, is the subtlest and ultimately most devastating form of evil is partially the well-intentioned desire to seemingly do good, and create: often a 'logical re-ordering of things according to one's wisdom'; yet accomplished through an 'ends justify the means' way of direct domination and restructuring things without the consent of others (Rape culture). In contrast to the Elves whose revel and sophistication inspires and impresses upon others the wonder and joy of good living. Simply hanging out with Elves imbues a positive influence. And the relationships the Elves had with other races were (mostly) a mutual fascination at the joy of life as it were. Sauron took the incarnate form of Annatar The Giver, and helped Celebrimbor forge the Three Elven Rings, rings that were awesome in their own right; but Sauron did this with a secret agenda to eventually accrue power for himself by enslaving them. What splendor may they have done had they worked for Art in itself? (Sauron could not assume a fair form after forging the one Ring, imbueing his life essence into the Ring becoming the Dark Lord). And so even the highest and most sophisticated things: craft, community, culture, (the Machine/Magic) can be tainted by evil when used for egoic, selfish purposes and this evil becomes accelerated when the lust for power grows. Galadriel's resistance to the temptation of the Ring is all the more profound when Frodo offers her the ring freely, without coercion, as it is said she initially came to Middle Earth in Fëanor's wake to start her own kingdom... So this feeling would be magnified a thousand fold by Ring (which was forged for this very purpose). The continuity of Tolkien's story is incredible. Saruman, another character to face the 'Fall' in this sense but succumbs to it and covets the ring for himself; even attempting to decieve Gandalf into helping him. Gandalf says ""He cannot be tyrant and counsellor"" when they confront him amid the ruin of Isengard. The suggestion of truth and the enforcement of truth two different things.

And so, to tie all this to Tom Bombadil. As far as I can tell Tom is the character who has been incarnate in Middle Earth the longest (He is, as you have seen him; He is Master of wood, water, and  hill; he is oldest and fatherless; He remembers the first acorn and first raindrop) and so in this sense has dealt with the problem of Evil longer than anyone else. ""Tom's words laid bare the hearts of trees and their thoughts, which were often dark and strange, and filled with a hatred of things that go free upon the Earth [...] It was indeed ancient, a survivor of vast forgotten woods; and in it there lived yet, ageing no quicker than the hills, the fathers of fathers of trees, remembering times when they were lords. The countless years had filled them with pride and rooted wisdom, and with malice. But none were more dangerous than the Great Willow: his heart was rotten, but his strength was green; and he was cunning and a master of winds, and his song and thought ran through the woods on both sides of the river. His grey thirsty spirit drew power out of the earth and spread like fine root-threads in the ground, and invisible twig-fingers in the air, till it had under its dominion nearly all of the trees of the Forest from the Hedge to the Downs."" 

This excerpt is a kind of microcosm of the story. It shows Tom has been around Middle Earth since the beginning of the First Age, and so knows a lot things, especially the ancientness of evil. He dwells among it. In a way the Great Willow is the first major antagonist the hobbits meet when he traps Merry and Pippin out of seeming hatred for them, for their kind. The Great Willow also 'Falls' in that it too is a power-monger and seeks to dominates the forest to its own particular desire, which is malice to creatures that walk freely. These rotten old trees perhaps nearly as old as Tom are also in contrast to Tom: 

""'Then all this strange land belongs to him?' 'No indeed!' Goldberry answered, and her smile faded. 'That would indeed be a burden'."" 

So Tom just has his house and his woman and moves around living it up, channeling the song of his existence nearly all the time. Tom is the eldest so he doesn't look back to anyone. He looks forward to Goldberry. He is.

""'You shall come home with me! The table is all laden with yellow cream, honeycomb, and white bread and butter. Goldberry is waiting. Time enough for questions around the supper table. You follow after me as quick as you are able!' With that he picked up his lilies, and then with a beckoning wave of his hand went hopping and dancing along the path eastward, still singing loudly and non-sensically."" (Expressing the 'Lord of Hosts' and being completely free)

The Elves are different from Tom insomuch that the are kind of Exiles on Middle Earth, because being influenced by the Valar, Elves have an Otherworldly aspect to them. ""Frodo at last, feeling his heart moved with a joy he did not understand. He stood as he had at times stood enchanted by fair elven-voices; but the spell that was now laid upon him was different: less keen and lofty was the delight, but deeper and nearer to mortal heart; marvellous yet not strange."" 

So a different form of goodness, more in tune with the earth, rubbing off on Frodo; distinct from the pilgrimage of the Elves, with their songs of ancient tribal history, and festivals of starlight. And of course in utter contrast to the inner feeling of horror he experienced from Ringwraiths and other agents of Sauron.

TL;DR

But what Tom's presence means in the context of the 3rd age and the War of the Ring is like this:

""'Show me the precious Ring!' he said suddenly in the midst of the story: and Frodo, to his astonishment, drew out the chain from his pocket, and unfastening the Ring handed it once to Tom. It seemed to grow larger as it lay for a moment on his big brown-skinned hand. Then suddenly he put it to his eye and laughed. For a second the hobbits had a vision, both comical and alarming, of his bright blue eye gleaming through a circle of gold. Then Tom put the Ring round the end of his little finger and held it up to the candle-light. For a moment the hobbits noticed nothing strange about this. Then they gasped. There was no sign of Tom disappearing! Tom laughed again, and then he spun the Ring in the air -- and it vanished with a flash. Frodo gave a cry -- and Tom leaned forward and handed it back to him with a smile."" 

In this scene Tom Bombadil does a humourous pantomime of almost the entire war over the Ring: Holding the ring to his blue eye making fun of Sauron's red one, trivializing the essence of Sauron's power and evil to dominate the entire world as the eye of Barad-dûr. He laughs at it. Next he wears the Ring and remains incarnated and visible before their eyes unchanged and unaffected by the Ring's evil (as far as I know Sauron was the only one other character who wore the ring without disappearing). And the lastly with slight of hand causes the ring to disappear with ease-- perhaps making fun of the Ring bearer's tribulation to unmake the Ring, as he could handle it and let it go so easily (which Frodo ultimately fails to do); perhaps, too showing his physical form is not in any way affected by the ring (neither thru evil desires, nor the Ring's magical quality of invisibility). And finally this contrasts Sauron, whose corporeal form collapses when Isildur cut the the ring from his hand. Bombadil just laughs. (There are grave instances where Gandalf and Galadriel refuse to even handle the ring lest it corrupt them, as the ring is exerts its effect in proportion to the power of its wearer.)

So in conclusion, Tom represents the Good side of the duality to Sauron's Evil in the cosmology: Sauron has absolute desire to enforce his will, giving himself to the instrument of the ring completely, to the exclusion of all other aspects of Life. Tom is an immortal who delights in Life itself in the moment, while still retaining some kind of immense power that he may wield over it. Instead spends his time rocking out in the hills and forests and hanging with Goldberry. He understands the Ring, I believe. But from a perspective beyond it. He isn't concerned with it as an ancient being, surving the first, much worse dark lord, he may have a sense of Fate incomprehensible to everyone else in Middle Earth (He is fatherless). Tom Bombadil has more important things to do than get involved in War... Like gathering flowers for his special lady.

Recently I decided to see what frame rate I was getting in starlight stage on a Galaxy Note 8 because it felt rather low watching MV's so I installed Samsung Game Tuner and enabled the FPS overlay in the settings to find that even on 3D low it was frequently dropping to sub 20 FPS. I was wondering if there are other people out there with the Note 8 or S8 that are having similar issues. I'm on the latest version of Android samsung provides with every possible tweak and developer setting I could adjust applied, including just trying a factory reset and different launchers but nothing has had an effect. 

I'm not too sure if there's a fix I'm just wondering if anyone else is on the low framerate struggle bus along with me using the same or similar spec phone.",,False,False,StarlightStage,t5_39t20,,,public,,self,,,Note 8 Performance Issues.,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarlightStage/comments/7tvntz/note_8_performance_issues/,all_ads,,True,,,,,

Doreen put her hand on Kirk's shoulder. ""There's no point. No one's answering.""

Kirk leaned forward, looking out the window. Jeremy had already opened the hatch and was staring up, and both men were seeing the same thing.

An alien sky, filled with stars they had never seen before. Two moons, one larger and greener than Earth's, and one smaller and a deep red. ""I know,"" he muttered as he stared up at that unearthly sky. ""But...""

Doreen nodded. They had gone under the ocean during to investigate deep sea marine life. Observe the most alien organisms on Earth their natural habitat. And when they had surfaced...*We didn't really imagine what alien was* she thought.

Something moved in the dark water, a shape briefly breaching into the air with glowing lights. Jeremy exclaimed excitedly as he saw it, looking down through the hatch. ""Did you see that? I think it's a ship!""

Doreen frowned at where it had appeared. It reappeared again, about half a click closer to the submarine. ""I don't think it's...Jeremy! Get down.""

He did so, although he frowned as he did. A moment later, he saw why. A pair of massive jaws, just barely too small to swallow the research sub whole, clamped onto the front of the vessel. A smaller set of jaws, located inside the mouth, pulsed out to scrape at the front of the ship.

Kirk frantically slapped on the subs propellers. The forward facing ones tore into the mouth of the beast, and it recoiled away. As they floated away from it, it sunk back under the surface to find easier prey.

""Did you see the jaws?"" Jeremey shouted. ""Did you see them?""

Doreen nodded, her face twisting into a frown. ""We're all right here, Jer. We saw them.""

They belonged to a moray eel, one large enough to almost swallow them whole.

Identifying the beast didn't give them any answers though. They set an eastward heading, hoping that land would still be in that direction.

---

The sub wasn't designed for long range travel. They had to power down everything except for the engines as they floated across the waves in the dark sea under the alien sky. Jeremy had gone near catatonic, just muttering to himself about the jaws of an eel. 

Kirk and Doreen kept their conversation low to not frighten him more.

""Doreen, even if we hit land, there's no guarantee...""

She nodded. ""Kirk, if we don't, we're dead. If we get to land, maybe we have a chance to survive.""

""We should have dove again. Maybe there's a, a portal or something.""

Doreen shrugged. ""If there was, Kirk, we're shit-outta-luck. We didn't have enough oxygen for another dive. But I don't think it was that. That storm had some odd electronic interference, remember?""

""You think the storm did this? Why hasn't it happened before?""

""I don't know, Kirk. I'm sorry, I wish I had answers. Maybe when we get...""

""LAND HO!"" Jeremy shouted, making them both jump. Doreen banged her head in the enclosed space and cursed.

But he was right. There was a land up ahead, thank god, a beach of black sand that glittered in the starlight. And cliffs behind it. None of that was what set Doreen's heart racing though. There was a ship on the beach, a naval ship. It looked American! ""We're saved,"" she whispered to Kirk, who pumped his fist in excitement.

That excitement faded as they got closer, however. The ship had been there for awhile. Great chunks of its hull had been torn away, huge gaping wounds into the interior of the beach. Still, it meant there were people here, humans somewhere on this alien shore. Maybe they could give them some clue what was going on.

That hope faded into fear when they got to the beach. No life was around, aside from small skittering birds. They walked on their wings like they were talons, and hissed a foul song at the humans as they passed before pecking on the human skeleton they were working over. It was long dead, but they seemed to find some benefit in scraping out the ancient bones.

Then, on the vessel, they saw the ship's designation.

*USS Eldridge*

The same vessel used in the Philadelphia Experiment.

""Doreen,"" Kirk whispered, his voice low. Jeremy began to laugh, a high pitched giggle without end. ""What do we do now?""

Doreen took a deep breath. ""This vessel got here somehow, same as ours. We'll find out how, and we'll find a way home.""

Jeremy's giggle abruptly stopped, and Kirk nodded in approval. Together, they walked in the wrecked ship.

Behind them, the birds that walked on wings and chipped at bones sung their foul song on a beach of black sand.",,False,False,Hydrael_Writes,t5_3ke9z,,,restricted,,self,,,Alien Seas [PI],https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrael_Writes/comments/7tsj58/alien_seas_pi/,,,False,,,,,

Every night since her mother died, Cleo gazed up into the night sky, hunting for each of the little points of starlight that managed to shine through the cold blue haze of the dockyard lights. She always sought out the planets too, whenever they were visible; Mercury, Venus, Jupiter...but Mars was the one she *needed* to see each night. That tiny, pale disk marked all of her hopes and dreams. It was the place where she could have a chance to be more than just a dockyard worker for the rest of her life. Seeing that dot of light reminded her that she *wasn’t* alone in the universe; that her father was there on that planet millions of kilometers away.

Tonight, though, she didn’t have time to stargaze. Tonight, she finally had a chance to set her life on a new path. Breathing slowly to keep herself calm, she carefully leaned around the crumbling brick of the Mercantile and looked toward the fence. Just as the old woman had mentioned, the big lights were out on this section; burned out at dusk. Normally they would have been replaced right away, but apparently they had been out of stock in the yard and a new set had to be ordered up from the factory. And so, Cleo had this one narrow window of opportunity to make a move.

Cleo crept forward, keeping as close as possible to the side of the building where the overhang of the second level could keep her mostly in shadow. She studied the area inside of the fence for any sign of guards, but saw nothing more than the stacks of shipping containers. Soon she was right next to the fence, next to the faded warning sign that read in bold red letters, “Harbor Freight Corp. property. Keep Out. Unauthorized personnel will be shot.” 

The fence was surprisingly easy to climb. Cleo was thin and small, but strong from her work. The barbed wire and glass shards at the top were a bit of a challenge, but she used the blanket she had brought to avoid getting any cuts. She checked once more for guards and noticed a light sweeping back and forth a hundred meters or so away, coming closer. Hurrying, she climbed down and ran for the cover of the shipping containers.

Cleo checked her watch, the cracked ancient digital screen illuminating dimly to show her the time. She had about 20 minutes to get aboard the next delivery before it launched. She frowned, considering her path through the stacks. Getting aboard would be the easy part of her plan; she’d thought of a half dozen different ways to sneak aboard the shuttles while working her shifts in the yard. But she had no idea what the spaceport up in orbit looked like, or even how she would manage to find a ship that was going to Mars. Cleo pushed down her growing fear, reminding herself that she just had to take this one step at a time.

Making her way through the stacks of containers waiting to be loaded, she easily avoided the handful of guard patrols in the stacks. They were lazy, slow, their lights erratically lighting up sections of containers. She figured they probably hadn’t seen an intruder for months, maybe years. Stowaway attempts had pretty much dropped off since Edd Jones had gotten himself killed trying to jump a delivery. Her stomach turned, thinking of the pictures that had been released by the Overseers showing his broken and battered body, the result of being flung around the cargo hold after he lost his grip during launch.

She felt bad for Edd, but frankly, he had been an idiot. A person couldn’t just *hang on* and expect to withstand the incredible g-forces during the launch of an automated shuttle. The only blessing for Edd was that he had probably blacked out soon after launch, so he probably hadn’t felt a thing as he smashed into containers and the walls of the shuttle.

Trying to put the pictures out of mind, she made it to the currently active launch bay. The old, beat up shuttle was the center of a buzz of activity. Looming over the workers below, the hulking mass of metal looked far too blocky to get off the ground, let alone fly. But the four massive engines on each corner would do their job, though, carrying the shuttle and 400 tons of cargo into orbit. And this time, her as well, hopefully. As she studied the shuttle, the 10 minute warning buzzer sounded, it’s deep tones echoing through the dockyard as workers scurried around doing last minute safety checks. Noise carried over to her from the next bay over, where the next shuttle was already being loaded, robotic cranes, conveyors, and workers moving together in a carefully orchestrated dance to load the containers into the waiting cargo hold. She watched the movement for a moment, thinking about all the time she had spent in this place. The dockyard worked endlessly, launching 2 fully loaded shuttles an hour, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, all to feed into a supply chain that stretched from the factories of Earth to the space stations up above, the Moon base, and the Mars colonies. Once her mother had died and she had become a ward of the state, her fate had been sealed, according to the Overseers. She knew that their plan for her was little more than slavery, despite all the teachers’ talk of “opportunity” working for Harbor Freight. With a sudden rush of resolve, Cleo realized that if she didn’t take this chance, if she stayed here the rest of her life, she would never forgive herself.

She forced her attention back to the shuttle in front of her, where the workers were finally pulling their equipment and hoses away, the final checks complete. She closed her eyes, whispering a silent prayer to any God that might be watching, and dashed forward through the shadows. This was the biggest risk she had taken so far tonight — all it would take would be for one worker to notice her and it would all be over — but she had no other option for this part. Heart pounding, she pressed herself against the side of the shuttle, feeling the pitted metal underneath her fingers. There were no shouts, no sound of alarm. Letting out a quick breath, she reached for the maintenance access hatch, pulling on it with all her strength. The hatch refused to budge and Cleo had the terrible fear rise up that she was going to be incinerated to a crisp when the the shuttle launched, but after one more desperate heave, the hatch finally loosened and swung open, letting her crawl inside. 

She checked her watch again. Less than 5 minutes left. She hadn’t heard the warning buzzer go off again, she’d must have been so wrapped up in her thoughts she hadn’t noticed it. Moving as quickly as she could, she made her way through the short passage and pushed through the door on the other side, entering the hold itself. The containers were stacked two layers high in rows of five by four, held locked in place every meter by large magnetic clamps.

Picking a spot in the narrow passage between containers, Cleo dug through her small backpack and pulled out the part of her plan that she hoped would get her through this experience where so many others failed. Wide, heavy-duty tie down straps she had swiped from the supply depot earlier this evening. They would probably be missed within a day or two and possibly even linked back to her, but by then she would be far out of reach of the dockyard police.

She laid her blanket down on the cold metal floor and doubled it over to offer as much padding as the meagre material would offer. Threading the first strap through the lowest part of the clamp just off the deck, she stretched it across the narrow gap to the clamp on the other side, keeping it loose. The loud, unnerving wail of the final warning launch siren echoed through the hold and Cleo nearly dropped the second tie down. The blood drained from her face as she realized the dockyard AI must have moved up this shuttle’s launch by a couple minutes to compensate for a delay somewhere else. Sometimes they did that, to make the most efficient use of docking ports at the orbiting spaceport.

Panic rose up as she struggled to feed the strap through the next set of clamps as the siren wailed on and red running lights flipped on, casting a red glow over everything. Twisting her backpack around to her front, she lay down on the blanket and squeezed herself under the straps. Awkwardly, she pulled on the strap over her legs, realizing too late that she should have tightened that one down first before getting under the other one. Giving up on that one, she cinched the first strap down until it felt like a ton of bricks were sitting on her chest and she could barely breathe. The strap felt like it was cutting into her, and she wriggled around, trying to judge how much it was actually holding her down. A massive shock went through the entire shuttle, settling into a thrumming rumble and she froze, recognizing the sound of the engines igniting. The final launch sequence was beginning, liftoff was only seconds away now.

Fear pounded through her now, the adrenaline leaving her in a cold sweat. Her straps wouldn't be enough. She was going to pass out and be flung around the cargo bay, just like Edd. She was going to be broken and shattered, her picture sent to all the others-

The engines increased to a roar; the loudest sound she had ever heard in her life. Dimly, she remembered that she had brought some earplugs to protect her ears, but it was too late for that now. Another shudder rolled through the deck beneath her, as though the shuttle were going to twist apart. Her teeth rattled and her vision blurred from all the shaking and the rumble of the engines sounded like the world was ending. A moment later, she felt herself being pushed into the deck, the g-forces starting to weigh down on her and making it hard to breathe as the shuttle lifted off the ground.

For those who don't know how chaos dragons very well, or those who need a refersher, This deck is set up to abuse the chaos summoning mechanic which allows you to special summon a monster from your hand by banishing a light and dark monster from your graveyard. The actual chaos monsters in the deck are lightpulsar sragon, darkflare dragon, chaos sorceror, and the old favorite black luster soldier envoy of the beginning. These form a strong aggressive core, and pair well with eclipse wyvern which can be banished as part of the summoning cost for chaos monsters to find it's tutor target. Usually you find either red-eyes darkness metal dragon or dark armed dragon and from there are in a pretty strong position to win the game. This build uses the charge of the light brigade/solar recharge engine to put cards into the graveyard quickly so you can start doing powerful things, and get some card advantage out of it. Previously I have played the white stone of legend/blue-eyes white dragon/cards of consonance engine in the same space, but I have found that though a nearly guarunteed blue-eyes is nice the lightsworn engine is much more consistent.

Let me know what you think and especially if you have any tips on cards I might not have heard of during the time I wasn't playing. I already updated to add raiden, scarm, and a few others, and I'm prefectly willing to look at more.",,False,False,yugioh,t5_2rpe6,,,public,,self,,,[R/F] Looking to update Chaos Dragons for semi-casual playgroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/7tn0k1/rf_looking_to_update_chaos_dragons_for_semicasual/,all_ads,,True,,,,,

**knight of dieties altmile**  
While we didnt get to see his other skills, when ypu stride with him, on a soul blast you get to tutor forr brave.   
Now i have some qualms with the soul blast, brave currently has too many things that soul blast and top little things that soul charge and i hope it switches up  
**livarot**  
Just one thing to say. Good by albion hello livarot. A 10k base that tutors pre gb? Sign me up. It is highly likely that an altmile vanguard is required but still tutoring is always good  
**felax**  
This card is likely my favourite card in brave... my friend felax rivals the good ol pir. A grade 1 that makes magic numbers? Check... with an altmile vanguard to make another magic number? Check tutorable? Check. This card is brilliant, well hopefully its a continuous thing and most of all  it reduces the amount of redons we need in the deck    
**millius**  
Hm well im not sure what to think, we didnt get the full skill but it seems promising so far, and is able to refill the soul whilst thinming the deck. Also zeroth dragon  
**fides**  
I dunno what to say aside from its beautiful. The card adds aggressiom and usefullness in the form of something that isn't just spam calling. Its doesnt exactly  make brave perfect (looking at u chaos) but it certainly plays to the deck's stremgths and it makes me happy  
**final thoughts**  
Well people wont be happy with what im about to say but here me out. I think at this point, there isn't any space left for hopesong angel/ starlight violonist. It may be better to conserve resources for explosive stride turns  rather than burning it to gain early tempo.

 In chapter 37 Pip and Velvet find the alicorn implementation of God/Dog from *Dead Money* in the basement of the Ministry of Magic. While Pip eyes the alicorns flank (as pip is wont to do) she notices the cutie mark, thinking that *""It looked odd, like maybe a mist of stars, but I couldn’t be sure.""*

It's possible Glimmer was either assisting in Twilight's plans, or attempting to undermine them. I don't recall the timeframe for when Goddess/Trixie began collecting volunteers outside Mariposa, so it's also possible that the Goddess just stole the unicorns from The Village of Equality^TM later.   

The cutie mark appears as the identity of the victims of unity solidifying and floating to the surface of the host's consciousness. Morover the absolute rage of Sseddog's monologue sounds similar Glimmer's *""I brought you friendship! I brought you equality! I CREATED HARMONY!""* Obviously the ranting is from DOG, but maybe...

I've got a thing for breeding. I haven't really made that a secret (dear god, the number of personals...)

Lightning Round! If you see an rp you'd be interested in, hit me up!

**Breeding Time at the Hucow Farm** - we get turned into sex crazy cow people and fuck 

**Xanathar's Guide to Breeding** - horny tiefling (eyyyyy) seduces his way across the dnd landscape.

**Dealings in Starlight** - a gruff mercenary falls into the clutches of a fae with an overactive sex drive. 

**The Breeding Project** - post war repopulation effort through...interesting means.

These are more detailed in my post history, so if you'd like to get a read on my writing style, check it out.

I've got some time to kill, so I thought I'd give this a shot. 

Hope to hear from some of y'all.

And the only way to prove that the glitch actually happens is by recording it. It's exclusive to the Taxman port as far as I can tell because most versions of Sonic 1 don't allow to save wherever.

Here's how to activate. First, grab 50 rings and go into the Special Stage at the end of an act. Next, either re-start the Special Stage, or exit the game completely. Taxman has the Special Stages as separate levels, so it's possible to do this. Then return to the level. Grab 50 rings for the continue and the Chaos Emerald and presto, you've skipped the next act. Green Hill Act 1 to Green Hill Act 3. Spring Yard Zone Act 2 to Labyrinth Zone Act 1. The Ultimate one (which I haven't pulled off) would be Labyrinth Zone Act 2 to Starlight Zone Act 1.

Phazictrus peered out the window of the ship. The curvature of the planet filled his vision as the spacecraft made its descent. He could make out portions of mountains poking out amidst the blanket of fog. A dull sheen glanced off the peaks, metallic stone weathered from years of what must have been harsh conditions.

The man sighed, taking in the view. As a junior senator of the Rezican Empire, he had the unenviable task of previewing planets for potential use under the pretense of ""official peacekeeping visits"". Most of the meek leaders knew the truth, and Phazictrus was normally subjected to pleading an groveling before calling in the strike force.

The starlight shifted, and Phazictrus caught a glimpse of his face as it was reflected in the window. Politics had taken a toll on him. After fifty cycles, his once rosy cheeks were gaunt and strained on his face. His hair had been lustrous and sleek in his prime; not it was thinning, gray, and receding. His eyes, though, still seemed to glimmer, onyx islands in a sea of white.

The ship shuddered as three legs emerged, and the craft landed with a sharp rumble. As Phazictrus gathered his possessions, the door opened and a younger man boarded. He marched towards the senator, extending his hand. ""Sir, it's an honor to have you here. My name is Achilian. I'm the warden here.""

Phazictrus took his hand, a look of confusion on his face. ""Warden? This is a prison planet?""

Achilian nodded. ""In a way, yes. This is Decitrios, one of the most dangerous planets in the system. The Empire is planning to utilize it as a prison planet, like you said, but as you know, it needs signoff from a senator before we can begin to do so.""

""Bureaucracy at it's very finest,"" the senator agreed, a tone of irritation in his voice. The Rezicans were nothing if not by the book. ""Can we get a better look at ground level?""

Achilian nodded his assent, and the pair disembarked. The warden led the way, his bulky form showing the cycles of exercise. The planet at ground level seemed to be a wasteland, with few plants and fewer animals. Achilian explained that the planet was prone to weather irregularities, which prevented most living beings from surviving at lower points. Most creatures survived on the mountains, above the clouds Phazictrus had seen coming in.

The sky cleared enough for the pair to take in the night sky. Through the mountains, Phazictrus could see a shining crescent moon, dwarfing everything in the area. In between its points, a smaller planetoid glimmered, a small twinkling belying the idea that civilization was right nearby.

The senator turned towards the warden, his face taut. ""I believe I have seen everything I need to see here. This will be a fine prison planet. When can we expect the first convicts to arrive?""

In response, Achilian pulled a communication screen from his pocket. The senator's heart began to race as the warden began to read. ""Phazictrus of Delebah, you have been found to have taken bribes from planetary leaders in order to further your career --""

""THAT'S A LIE!"" Phazictrus shouted, but Achilian kept reading. It was not lie, he knew, but he had to try and save himself.

""--And in taking bribes, you have disgraced the high tenets of the Rezican Empire. Effective Immediately, your senator position is revoked, and you are hereby sentenced to imprisonment on the planet of Decitrios for the period of twenty cycles. If you survive, you may return to your home. This is the ruling of the High Court and its ruling is final.""

Achilian put away the communication and motioned. The ship behind Phazictrus began to lift off the ground. As the senator turned, Achilian threw him to the ground and grabbed hold of the steps, lifting off the ground.

Over the roar of the engine and the ringing in his ears, Phazictrus could hear the words of the warden as they echoed through the valley.

""Welcome home, Senator.""

I remember being there when Calvin Klein debuted it back in 1955.

Yes, I know everyone says Chuck Berry came out with it in 1958, but they're wrong. I told you, I was there. It was the 1955 Hill Valley High Enchantment Under the Sea dance. One of the most boring things ever, by the way, but at least Mary Lewis let me get to third base. Oh, right, I'm rambling.

Anyway, they got that kid, Klein, to play guitar for them for a few songs. That guy was a real weirdo. He showed up like a week before the dance in some getup that looked like what those hipsters wear now. I remember Biff Tannen hated him but all the girls loved him. Anyway, he was playing along with the band for a bunch of slow songs.

Anyway, I was dancing with Mary, and then all of a sudden Klein just went off. He was playing like I had never heard before. His fingers were just blurs and he was jumping around all over the stage. Pretty much everyone stopped at that point to just watch, even the rest of the band.

That's right, I just remembered! the band was Marvin Berry and the Starlighters. Marvin Berry, Chuck Berry, I bet there's a connection there. He did go off stage while the song was playing, maybe he called Chuck.

After he played, Klein looked out at all of us and told us our kids would love that song. You know, he was right. Junior did play it all the time, but the Berry version. Strange thing was, it was almost the exact same song, same notes, same rhythm, same everything. Only thing that was different was the voice.

Klein just walked off the stage and left. Strange thing, too. Never saw Klein again after that night. I remember, it was the day lightning struck the clock tower. I wonder what happened to him.

We heard there are special starlight performances at Disneyland which is why we want to head there during the night. We also have a pretty full itinerary. 

Additionally, what is the difference between a 'Starlight Pass' and an 'After 6 pass'? Are you able to see the starlight night performances using both passes? I know the after 6 pass is only available during the week and starlight pass on weekends. Is that the main difference? Do the night performances only operate on weekends?

___________________________

- The Big Tasks:

&gt; Transfer all main scenario dialogue  [ all main scenario dummy menus done step 1 out of 3]

&gt; Transfer all event scenario dialogue [ event main menu implemented 0/3 ]

&gt; Accurate and pleasing to look at GUI [ basic structure assembled 1/3 ]

&gt; Accurate Visuals [ some placeholder images inserted 0/3 ]

&gt; Adding Audio [ 000/??? ]

&gt; Some Type of Character Gallery [ gallery main menu implemented 0/3 ]

&gt; Extras (translated JP content, gacha simulator, inventory/collection management, translations into other languages, etc. ) [ not starting until all main scenarios are in place, or another coder wants to take it up ]
______________________________

Using the assets ripped from the game, I am planning on recreating at least the cutscenes in Ren'Py, a visual novel maker program.

I would also like to include Events and translated JP content we never got, and in the future possibly a gacha simulator and an inventory/collection management page.
Once it's mostly finished I would love to also include non english/japanese/french translations.

I do not know how long this is going to take.  I am hoping to have ~~at least the first chapter of the story all imported~~ the entire global version's main story text and a reasonably functional GUI  by the time the game closes.  I would really really really like to include a gallery and collection management feature, but there is no way in hell i'll be able to get that done by myself.

This will not be an exact recreation probably, but I do aim to get it as accurate as possible.
I am new to Ren'Py and coding (as in, picked it up a few days ago) and I do have a friend who codes python as their profession who has agreed to help me.  We have a bitbucket going on now, which I am still figuring out how to work.  
If you also want to help I would be extremely grateful.
I have an unholy fuckload of free-time on my hands, so as long as there's interest I will try to keep going on this project.  

**List of Things Needed:**

- Final dumps of WW and JP game
- VIDEO FOOTAGE OF ALL STORY (~~WW~~, JP) AND EVENTS (WW AND JP)!!!!!!
- Final audio dumps
-  [Spreadsheetify the Units from the wiki](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cEhHNaei5kUCpo-DN5mGE7cz-l-_-VBYfLeFIRm0S-o/edit?usp=sharing)
- Organizing of all of these
- JP-ENG-FRN translators
- coding assistants/advisors!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**Things that would be nice:**

- Screenshots of every unit's stats from the Heroes Index page

**List of Things Needed in the Future:**

- other translators
- more coders!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm an American fantasy author living in Minnesota. The world I write my stories in is entirely fictional, and I'm still looking to add more cultures to various parts. I like to get inspiration from real-world cultures, and if I can, learn from them along the way.

The short story I'm about to start working on is about a girl named Naleli. Twenty-two years old, she's lived her entire adult life in the mountains about 150 kilometers from the capital city of her country, which rests on the coastline. Losing her parents at a young age, Naleli was sent to go live with a group of monks residing near the highest peaks of this mountain range.

In the world I write, the night's sky is thought of as the afterlife. When someone dies, their spirit passes to the moon, which acts as a sort of anchor to the heavens. This place is known as ""The Twilight Shore"", a sort of beach or coastline where departed souls await the arrival of ships that sail through the night's sky and ferry the departed to their new homes in the heavens, each of these souls becoming yet another star in the sky.

The monks Naleli lives with believe that by studying the constellations and mapping the stars, they will achieve such great knowledge of the afterlife and all its paths that they themselves will be charged with navigating these ships. Therefore, I've named them the Starlight Navigators.

The most accurate real world location like this that I could find were the Drakensberg Mountains outside of Lesotho. I'd like to borrow inspiration from the Sotho people if possible, and potentially include some conflict from Western colonists in other stories in the future.

My problem lies in that I would like to use as much Sotho as possible for keywords and phrases about ancient beliefs and practices, but the internet seems nearly devoid of good sources for translation. If anyone reading this speaks Sotho, or knows someone who does, I would be incredibly grateful if any of the words or phrases below could be translated. Thank you so much!

She is crying in the dark.  She lies on the living room sofa.  Blood has dried in black and cracked patches around her mouth.  The taste in her mouth is metal, and her shirt is torn and the bone around her eye hurts to the touch, soon to be purple and swollen.  
                 In her room a broken lamp shines on a collection her sister’s old records and CDs strewn upon the bed.  The Violent Femmes.  NOFX.  Duran Duran.  Depeche Mode.  These are the only tangible evidences of her sister’s existence.  These are the only things the girl holds onto, and in the kitchen the old man lies crumpled on the floor smelling of sweat and malted and yeast.  There are hints of urine hovering over him.  He moans.  He coughs.  Different colored chunks of glass from broken beer bottles litter the floor from his last drunken tirade.     
                  Her father beats her at night as if the very act could exercise him of his own demons, as if she alone bears responsibility for his failures and her mother leaving all those years ago and the devastation of his oldest daughter’s death.  Now she stares through the back door screen and listens to the breaking surf soft upon the sand.  Some call her hometown a paradise, but for her it has been a hell, somewhere on the coast of the northwest, a godforsaken fishing town.  She looks at her father still moaning and crumpled on the floor.  
                            The letter she leaves on the table states only that there is nothing to be said.  This is how it has to be.  She must go away before she dies here with him.  Her bag is packed.  A comb.  Two pairs of socks.  Her sister’s old Walkman and a couple of CDs.  Blink 182 and Weezer.  A bag of cereal.  Six cans of soda.  She places two boxes of macaroni and cheese in the bag but does not know where she will cook it nor does she consider it.  Her only warmth is the faded crimson hoodie she wears and she steps across the front door’s threshold.    


                   The night air is cool and softly blowing in smells of the slimes of green algaes and salt water and sea creatures in the dark.  It excites and promises all that is yet unknown.  She walks through the streets of the small town past the houses of the only two friends she has ever known and the house where her sister’s boyfriend lives still.  Street names are familiar.  There is the liquor store where her father stops every day on their way home from school.  Passing the high school, she considers the next morning’s first bell and that she will not be there.  The girl is quiet but intelligent.  
                                           She considers her friends.  Casey and Paige.  They might care, but no one else will.  No one else will notice her absence and more the night air envelops the frail being lost and wandering and wholly giving herself to that great unknown sprawled out and invisible in the darkness before her.  She would turn back but the nothingness and fear of what lies ahead cannot be worse than the torment of her life so far.  She places one foot in front of the next and moves towards whatever it is ahead whether joy or pain, life or death.    
                                             Towards the hills heading out of town there are the last two familiar sights.  On one side of Lori Street sits the gas station with the bench where her mother waited for the bus and her father begged with her and her sister in the car.  They waited hours while their mother smoked and their father yelled.  It didn’t change anything.  When the bus came she was gone, and that was the last they saw or heard. A few blocks further is the funeral home where they held the viewing four years prior.  Maybe part of her died that day with her sister and was buried somewhere six feet below the ground in the cemetery.  Maybe life had always been so terrible, and her sister protected her.  Things seemed to get worse after she left them, her father and the girl.  Their lives and even the house filled with a malevolent illness that did not exist before.  
                  The old man never talked after that day unless he was drunk and then he only screamed and hit her.  A funeral home is the last thing she knows as the girl she has been until tonight and it is not a thing she will miss however fully her existence must be reconciled to that occasion of suffering, as if it were the one eternal and unchanging truth against which every detail of every moment in her entire universe would be compared and divided.  She turns and walks towards the highway.            
                        The girl walks until she collapses at dawn.  She sleeps hidden in the brush by day, and she travels by starlight in silence interrupted only by the brush of freeway traffic pushing wakes of warm air at her.  Another night walking.  She looks up at the moon as strange and alien looking down at her as she is looking up at it.  Another day sleepily waiting for darkness to fall and the journey to begin again.  Her ankles swell, and her empty stomach shudders in wrenching groans of hunger and thirst.  The skin around her lips is thin and red and stings.  Any food she brought is gone.  She has walked a hundred miles.  There is another night of walking and stars tracing across the sky like points of light in a black globe immense and swiveling around the delicate and microcosmic transient who is slowly etching out a course of exhausting uncertainty.  She collapses once more as day perforates the horizon in beads of anemic flame bouncing wavelengths of choral and pale crimson through electric skies.  
                        Her eyes open at noon.  A gnarled tree branch hangs strung above her like some strange and tortured subject against the drop of a slate sky.  In the air a pulsing energy prefigures a storm of rain and thunder looking to manifest itself out of the ether.  She sits up on the grass between some picnic tables and trashcans and looks to the rest stop bathroom and walks to the water fountain.  The worn traveler bows before the fountain and silent she gulps water.  She breathes a while and drinks again.  
                     A late model station wagon, all grey but the driver’s one black door, pulls into the rest stop as heavy rain drops slap the ground and parks in front of the girl folding her arms under an overhang of corrugated tin and vinyl rain gutter.  She is by the door.  Her knapsack is between her feet.
From the passenger side of the sedan a woman exits and hurries to the bathroom.  While she is inside, the male driver rolls down his window.  He asks,

          You have a light?

What?

You have a lighter?  I’ll pay if you give it to me.

No.  

Man!  Too bad.  Do you smoke weed?

I have.

Do you want to?

I mean.  I guess.  Sure.

Well jump in!  My wife will be out soon.  That’s my kid in the car seat.  

The slender little girl slings the bag halfway over one shoulder and opens the driver side back door.  She pushes the bag in first and swings her head low and into the car.  A toddler sits strapped in her seat on the passenger side slobbering and smiling.

Oh my goodness!  She’s so cute!  

Thanks.  My wife’ll be out in just a sec.  My name’s Parker. 

 Jolene’s my wife, and this is baby Emma.  Say hello!

Hello, baby!  Hello.  You’re so pretty!  Yes, you are.  So pretty!  Yes.  Yes.  You are!, the girl says.  

The passenger door opened and a 20 something woman with dark hair and green eyes turned to the girl.  

Hi.  I’m Jolene.
  
Nice to meet you.

Baby.  She looked like she could use a bowl to smoke but she doesn’t have a lighter either. 
 
Looks like she needs a ride too.  Where are you going, sweetie?

Where am I going?  I don’t know.
  
You don’t know?

No.  

How old are you?

Fourteen.  

Fourteen?  What are you doing out here by yourself?  You know you can get killed like this?

Baby.  She doesn’t need a lecture right now.  She wants to smoke a bowl and we need to get some gas and a lighter before that can happen.  Okay?

                   The couple buys the girl a small box with some chicken tenders and a corn dog with soda at a gas station.  They are back from a visit to the man’s family just a bit north of where they found her.  Pity is taken and an agreement reached.  The girl will stay with the family.  She takes care of the child and helps Jolene keep house when the second child is born.  There are bright lights in the basement and leafy stalks of plants pushing a pungent aroma through the house.  In the mornings she rolls sticky green herb into gummed rice papers and smokes it with Parker and his wife, who is kind to the girl and something like a sister, something like a mother.  They snip logs of cured and sugar frosted bud with black handled scissors and most nights the man packs pounds into Ziploc bags that he puts into fabric grocery bags.  He drives hours in any direction to meet up with his different connections in Oregon and California.  Sometimes he travels to Nevada for a better price, and sometimes strange men come to the house with tattoos archaic blank ink tattoos of primitive and violent origin on their faces.   These men wear shorts and white socks pulled up to their knees.  When they do, they eye the girl, and she is uneasy.  There is some evil in their eyes with which she is unfamiliar.  There is something about them she does not like.

                     Winter comes.  Winter fades.  It is spring.  It is summer, and it is winter again.  She buys her first bras and sanitary napkins.  Jolene helps the girl pick them out.  She buys whatever she wants.  Makeup.  Clothes.  Boots.  And smokes weed every day.  The family treats her as their own daughter, and she goes to the store for groceries.  She learns to cook and bake THC laced confections like brownies and cookies and toffee, which she sells for a few extra bucks to kids her age outside of the high school.  There are more lights now in the closet in her room and more often the men with tattoos on their faces come to buy trash bags full of the product. 

 
              The girl’s second spring with the family, Jolene sends her to buy milk, and the girl stops by the school to sell some candy she has.  At the store she addresses the bag boy by name, but he looks confused, like he does not know her.  He tells her to wait at the park across the street until he is off work.  His failure to remember her does not make him superior.  She is not the more beggarly of two negotiating parties, because she knows his name or because he doesn’t remember hers. He only imagines that his presence is a privilege for which she should beg or give thanks, but the truth is much simpler.  She has a better memory than he does, no more, no less, but his belief dictates hers, and she is his.

               In the public bathroom he undresses her and does things to her she has never known.  He breathes hard for a few second and she screams.  Then he is done and pulls up his pants.  Her skirt is halfway up her back.  The bag boy leaves her alone and crying in the stall.  On the walk back home there are blue and red lights up the street towards the house.  As she approaches there is yellow tape around the driveway and many starched, navy uniforms of solemn faced men with their hands on their hips and shaking their heads.  Some walk in and out of the house.  Jolene’s legs hang out of the car’s open door and there is broken glass everywhere.  The girl keeps walking and never looks back.  She is sixteen years old.      


                      She caught her first ride after an hour of walking.  There were ninety-two dollars in her bra and no pockets on her mini skirt.  The college student who picked her up was driving home from a party and dropped her off outside of a 24 hours grocery store where she stood out front all night.  She bought two donuts and a carton of milk at five in the morning while they were still fresh and outside a man offered her a ride to the city.  

Which city?

San Francisco.  I have a shipment to deliver there and some pick ups to make.  Maybe you can find something for yourself there.

Okay.

               The driver dropped her off on Van Ness somewhere by Lombard and opened the backdoor of his trailer with the clanking of steal and creaking of ungreased hinges.  She slowly walked away down Van Ness as uncertainly as she walked the freeways and highways that first week away from home at fourteen, not knowing what circumstance in what place waited for her and not knowing how she would get there only determined that she would.  Before the sun went down a wall of pink fog energized by the dying daylight stood between the apartment buildings like some divine and foreboding augur who knew the city well and warned her away from her procession.  The girl pressed on, and the mist swallowed her whole.  

                 By night she witnessed the forlorn and forsaken figures of the night streets in San Francisco sitting and laughing or wandering and crying like images of tortured souls in hell.  They glared at her from dark and dirty eyes, their complexions like the victims of house fires and their expressions maniacal or detached.  She found no friend in the tortured melee.   

              The sat on a curb alone under a street lamp and cried.  The light only provided means by which lurking eyes could see her, and outside her circle of imagined protection, predatory and evil beings formed and unformed licked their chops waiting to drink the blood of the sacrifice, bleating and without blemish.  But to her it was safe, and when he showed himself, he seemed the savior for which her terrified heart yearned.  He had skin the color of caramel and wore a Bob Marley t-shirt.  He spoke soft and sweet and stood in a cloud of potent smoke like some fantastic apparition translated across of oceans of time and space from some nether realm to that very instant and location before her.
  
What’s wrong?

She could not speak.  He sat down next to her.

Do you want to hit this?

She never spoke but reached over and pinched the brown tobacco wrap and placed it to her lips.  It glowed with each draw of her lungs, and she coughed.  A few more pulls on the blunt and the tears stopped. 
 
I don’t even know where I am.  

You can come with me.  I live in Daily City.  My name is Damien.  

                  Mornings after that night she clings to his naked torso in the bed and kisses the tattooed letters on his chest which make no sense to her and are not initials of anyone he knows.  They take breakfast or lunch at a diner down the street.  He buys her gifts to groom her.  She is beaten the first time they argue and cannot escape and he rapes her. 
After that she rides the rails with him to different sinkhole corners in the city, all greasy and sooty and scary.  She wears high heels and seductive outfits and if she disagrees with him she fears for her life.  Men call on her but discuss price with him before they leave to rent a room and take her up.  She sees five or six a night and keeps all of her money with Damien.  He only buys her what she needs to work another night.   

                  The first time she used the needle was with one of her usual johns.  He talked to Damien like any other night and rented the same room as always, but before he undressed, he asked her a question.

Do you get high?

Like smoke weed?  You got some?

No. I don’t mean that.  I mean this.

He pulled from his pocket the knotted corner of a Ziploc bag and from his other he produced something resembling a pencil.  It had an orange tip.
  
Do you get spun?  

Never done it before.  Damien will kill me if I do.

Damien’s not here.  Do you want to try it?

Well.  I do, but I don’t know.  What’s it like?

You have to see for yourself.

I guess.  Damien will kill me though.

Damien won’t know.

                 He sat across from her at the folding table by the wall and wrapped the rubber tourniquet around her bicep telling her to make a fist.  She kept the back of her hand and arm flat to the table while he lined the instrument up with a blue vein running from the crook of her arm to her wrist.  He popped his lips as the needle pierced her skin to draw attention away from the prick of it.  She coughed.  
Her eyes rolled in her head.  Her clothes came off, and he did whatever he did to her.  She did not know.  After what felt like minutes, Damien showed up in the room bent over her and angry.  He slapped her a few times and said something about hours passing.  She could not speak and the john was gone.

                    It took a few days for her to get sleep but working for Damien was easier under influence of the crystalline  substance running hot in her blood.  She made more money and even enjoyed doing what she did.  It was a rush after that and a role she relished.  Damien kept a bag and shut her eyes with swelling when she screamed or fought or threatened to leave.

                 She worked for Damien until the night he made a deal for her services with an undercover cop.  They poured into the room the moment she agreed to perform the things the new man asked.  When the drugs wore off, she wore red pajamas and had just a pair of rubber sandals to her name and the top bunk of a four-woman cell.  The other girls talked to her about her charges, possession, prostitution and intent to distribute tacked on for good measure.

                       They arraigned her in the afternoon of the next day.  She rode shackled to another female inmate and timed her right foots stride with the left foot of her partner’s.  A frazzled man with a greasy face and a thick, unbroken line of black hair across his brow talked to her in a small booth and had her sign some papers before she saw the judge.  He was an attorney with the public defender’s office and would represent her.

Do you understand the nature of our relationship and what I can and cannot do for you?

I think so.

Good.  Now, let’s look at your charges.  Hmm.  You turn 18 in a few months.  They’ll treat you like an adult, which is probably better and easier for all of us.  I think I can get the distribution charges dropped and everything else is small time, but they won’t drop the possession, unless you go to some treatment.  Would you be willing to go to state funded treatment?  You’d have to sit in jail until a bed opens up.  That’s the best I think I can do.  You look like you could use it anyway.  What do you think?

I guess.  I don’t know.  

Okay.  Let me do the talking.  

They moved her two more times before she was assigned to the bed on which she sat and waited.  Three weeks passed.  She watched other girls make collect calls or get bags of candy and pretzels and chips from commissary once a week.  They moved in packs like animals, their socializing as primitive and peculiar as canines sniffing each other’s rear ends and barking in displays of dominance or approval.  The stronger preyed on the weak in there.  Some held hands and kissed or shared their beds.  Others fought to defend absurd notions of honor.  She barely spoke.  They left her alone.  
 
                 After twenty-three days of sitting on her bunk and two showers, the wobbly voice of the invisible chamber keeper locked away in her cell of screens and switches came over the speaker telling her to roll it up.  She was leaving.  A uniformed man looked through her paperwork and pinched her wristband through the caged window.  He handed her the vacuum sealed bag of clothes in which she was arrested.  The high heels and dress’s lack of length startled her, as if her time locked up and dressed in the baggy, soft fabric of her uniform as an inmate had sensitized her anew to the things to which she had been desensitized from by drugs and the daily grind of street survival.  Thoughts of selling her body in that nasty hotel room on Mission and Sixteenth or up Polk Street and all the times that Damien bloodied her face went through her head.  It was a version of herself she did not like and the last time she thought about Damien with much feeling.  She put on the clothes and walked out to meet the short woman with close cropped hair in khaki pants and thick rimmed glasses.
 
           They rode in silence most of the way to the rehab.  When they arrived, the short lady took her to an office in the back and turned on the light.  She told the girl to take a seat.  

 So.  You’re here.  I understand you’re fulfilling the conditions of your release, but can I ask you if you really want to change anything?  Is there more to your being here than the legal benefits you get?

I think so.  My life has been no good up to now.  Maybe it can change with this.  

Do you want to change?

I want to take these high heels and this slutty dress off and never put them back on again?  Do you understand that?  Whoever’s supposed to be wearing this crap and screwing johns for a pimp in the city, I don’t know.  It’s not me!  I’m not the one.  If that’s what you mean by change.  Then, yeah, I want change.

Okay.  We can get you some other clothes and you have to wear scrubs while you’re in the program anyway.  It’s twenty-eight days, and in that time, I feel certain we can get you to a different place than you’ve ever been.

Sounds good.

               They talked about the program and how it worked and what was not allowed and signed papers for another hour.  Nancy would have searched her belongings but the girl had nothing more than the scandalous threads she wore.  She received a terraced square of folded cotton garments.  A gown.  Some scrubs.  Another set of rubber sandals and a toothbrush and other cheap effects to keep hygiene.  The girl followed her up some stairs and through a darkened hospital hall to a black room where she was given her bed. 

              The girl woke up on the third floor of a square building and looked out the window to see a neighborhood she didn’t recognize.  There were mandatory check ins for blood pressure and temperature readings for some girls, like her, and others stood in line with small plastic cups of water to get their meds from the nurse in the window.  Their gowns and scrubs were all white with varying hues of dingy blue or green or pink as if the very color of the fabric might sedate them and prevent even the faintest of emotions.  They ate breakfast by eight and sat in silence at bowls of cold cereal or warm oatmeal and sipped cups of black coffee or cold orange juice.  Some girls talked to each other about the kinds of things new acquaintances do, mostly the conditions of the facility or where they had come from.  One was louder than the rest, and everyone called her Dessa, short for Odessa, even though she had never been to Florida and her name was Michelle.  
           She was thirty-six and wasted more than half of her words just to say how much she missed smoking or that she needed a joint and a cigarette.  The only child of a west coast businessman and his embittered second ex-wife living in Michigan, Dessa wrapped thick black dreadlocks around her small white skull and never wore sandals.  She never shaved her legs or armpits.  Her green eyes burned with fire or sometimes  seemed clouded, cold and distant depending on which extreme of her emotional bipolarity she found herself at the moment.  No one liked her, except the girl.  Dessa called the girl her sister.  She shared what type of life she lived outside of the facility when she was on the road, free and easy as a beautiful person with the rainbow kids.




Let me tell you, little sister, what kind of aching I got in my bones for a cigarette to go with this cup of coffee.  Not just some name brand corporate poison like Marlboro or Camel or Pall Mall.  No.  No.  No.  That’s all garbage.  I’m talking about some Dutch tobacco like Bali Shag or even some Drum, just some fine cut blonde stuff, some good old elf’s hair to roll up.  Man! I need a smoke!

              Dessa collapsed back into the couch in dramatic fashion.  The girl laughed. 

Tell me again about all the states you’ve been through before?  

I’ve been through Kentucky.  Georgia.  South and North Carolina.  Been through both of the Dakotas twice and sorry for it both times. Idaho. Nevada. Arizona.  Texas. Louisiana. Mississippi or Missin-Hippie as I like to call it.  Wisconsin. Michigan.  Ohio.  Pennsylvania.  Indiana.  Spent some real time in Tennessee, California, Oregon, Montana, Washington and upstate New York is where I’ve been the most.  A little time in Vermont and New Hampshire.  There might be some others in there I’m not recalling this second but that’s about it.  I do better if I just list the places I haven’t been.  What about you?

I’m from Coos Bay.

I love Coos Bay.  My dad took me there one summer.  It was the only time he ever saw me after the divorce.  I’ve literally never seen him since then.  

Yeah.  It’s nice there I guess.  My dad and I lived there.

And what about your mom?

What about her?

Don’t you have one?  I do, unfortunately.  Probably why my dad never came around, and I can’t say I blame him.  She was crazy as hell.  Still is.  

I had one once.  She left when my sister and I were kids.

I’m sorry.  What was that like?

Just like it sounds.  She left.  We cried.  My dad started drinking more and more.  I had my sister though.  

I guess that helps.

My sister was everything to me.  My dad had taken this old polaroid of my mom before I was born, and I tacked it to the wall in our bedroom and talked to her like she could hear me.  I talked and she just smiled back from the picture, silent and smiling like she always was.  I used to tell her how much I loved her and how much fun we’d have when she finally came back.  She never did though, and there was one day after school that I just gave up, quit talking to it altogether.
My memories of her were from when I was so young that I wonder now if I just made her up, like that person smiling in that polaroid isn’t her.  It was just a glimpse of her in 1982 or whenever it was and those feelings and ideas I had when I was a little girl talking to her picture are just that, mine.  She’s off doing whatever she’s been doing since she left us, and I had this imaginary relationship with a person who doesn’t exist.  

That’s really deep.

I guess so.  I’m only seventeen, almost eighteen.  If life puts holes in you, then you’re bound to get deep from time to time.  It’s kind of funny to me now, as sad as it all really is, my mom and dad and all of it. But I wonder if I’m normal now.

I hate it when people say that, like they have to fit in a box of whatever normal is.  That’s why I wear my hair this way.  That’s why I am the way I am.  No one has to guess if I’m gonna try to fit in.  They just take one look and know, Yup.  She’s a freak!  I mean do you really want to be normal?  

I’m talking about being normal, like as far as being healthy goes.  There are normal ways to process trauma and emotion and all that and there are abnormal ways, really not to process is the most abnormal way.  I mean if you think about the collapse of your own family, abandonment, alcoholism, poverty and abuse, and you just feel embarrassed about the way your seven-year-old self tried to cope, is that normal?  Seems like it’s not to me.  If you knew the things I’ve seen and done since I left home.  Every day is just another day to me even if it’s the worst day of my life.  Wow!  This is the most I’ve talked in like ten years or something, since my sister died.

The girl trailed off into a world of invisible thoughts that cast shadows behind her eyes lost in their longing.  Her posture slumped forward.  Dessa took the silence as a cue to let the subject of their conversation stop there, at least for now and maybe later take it up again.  She watched the girl for a few moments and snapped her fingers in front of her face making fun of the abrupt silence.  

Are you there still?  Haha.  

Yeah.  Haha.  I’m here.

Good.  Let’s get to our meeting.  

               In their groups Dessa and the girl sat next to each other while the rest of them handled petty issues they had with one another.  The girl listened and learned.  Dessa laughed at how silly it all seemed.  They remained united in their bond as outsiders in the facility.  Out of thirty girls, they only talked to each other unless they had to. 
                They sat around a coffee table in the rec room at nights wearing those faded white smocks over their thin cotton hospital scrubs.  The girls talked to each other in soft voices caring for each other.  Dessa was unstable, but some mixture of her medicine and the girl’s presence invoked feelings of selflessness and acts of a kindness she had not shown in years.  The girl was her little sister, and she would care for her.


Why are you so quiet?

If I tell people what I’m thinking they might think I’m crazy.  
Keeping shut is the best way to protect myself from that.  

What about me?  Why do you open up when I’m around?

I’m not sure.  I trust you.  You’re not trying to get something off me, and I can tell that.  Even when I lived with this couple in Ukiah, they just wanted me to take care of their kids and help keep house.  They were very nice but they never loved me.  I guess I feel like you love me.

I do love you.  You’re my sister and I am yours.  It’s just awesome getting to know you.  I love you so much.  
I feel the same about you, Dessa.  I love you.   

What are you doing when you get out of here?

I’m not sure.

What were you doing before?

I was living with this guy named Damien in Daily City.  

Well are you going back to him?

I can’t.

Why not?

Bad situation turned me into something I never wanted to be and will never be again. 

Hmmm.  I guess I’m gonna leave that there.  I get out this week, on Saturday.  You should get out ten days after that. I think. 

That’s about right.

Well you want to come with me to the gathering in New Mexico this year?

Gathering?  What’s that?

The national gathering.  Every year tens of thousands of us gather in a national park to build a city outside of Babylon and live in peace with love and do what we want.  It’s super beautiful.  You’d be an awesome kid out there with us.  We’re family.  You’d love it and we’d love you.
Sure.  I won’t have clothes when I get out though.  
I’ll bring you some.  

After Dessa left the girl was quiet again.  She kept to herself and talked to no one she didn’t have to.  At night the black nurse handed her a non-narcotic sleeping pill through the window and was the only person she had any conversation with at all.  She told the girl how she’d been caught by her six-year-old grandson with a gun in her mouth in the act of trying to blow her brains out.  It was God, she said, who saved her.  The girl didn’t care.  She had plans to see Dessa when she got out and travel far away from the city.  She was going to be a Rainbow kid and meet her family.  

The facility let the girl out in her paper thin pants and shirt and the dingy hospital gown.  They even let her keep her rubber clogs, and when Dessa showed up in the parking lot, the girl sat on a curb and chewed the skin on her finger or scratched the asphalt between her legs.  Dessa drove a BMW convertible, maybe ten years old.  Her father’s employee brought it to her a few months before she enrolled in rehab and met the girl.  The girl waved.  Dessa shouted.

Hey, stranger!  What are you doing sitting on the ground?  
Stand up!

Haha.  I was just getting up.  Been waiting for you.  What took you so long?

I thought I was on time. 

You are.  Haha

Cool.  Jump in.  I’ll take you to buy some new threads.  You ready for this?

The girl slid into the black leather passenger seat and closed the door.  Dessa eased into first gear and drove towards the freeway.

Second question is what do I look for to start progressing my 5* to 6*? Do I just keep playing and see which fodders I happen to get? Or do I try and focus on getting stuff for DH specifically since she's so good?

December 31, 1946 - January 23, 2018


Terry Wayne Ward, age 71, of DeMotte, IN, escaped this mortal realm on Tuesday, January 23rd, 2018, leaving behind 32 jars of Miracle Whip, 17 boxes of Hamburger Helper and multitudes of other random items that would prove helpful in the event of a zombie apocalypse.

Terry is survived by his overly-patient and accepting wife Kathy, who was the love of his life (a fact she gladly accepted sympathy for during their 48 years of marriage). He is also survived by daughters Rebecca (William) Hines and Jean (Jeff) Lahm; sister, Linda; brother, Phil; grandchildren: Alexander and Hannah Hines (The Mesopotamians), Daphne and Erin Pistello (The Daffer and Peanut), Brendan and Owen Lahm (Phineas and Ferb) and Tessa McMurry (Smiley).

He is preceded in death by his parents Paul and Bernice Ward, daughter Laura Pistello, grandson Vincent Pistello, a 1972 Rambler and a hip.

Terry graduated from Thornridge High School in South Holland, IL, where only three of his teachers took an early retirement after having had him as a student. He met the love of his life, Kathy, by telling her he was a lineman – he didn’t specify early on that he was a lineman for the phone company, not the NFL. Still, Kathy and Terry wed in the fall of 1969, perfectly between the Summer of Love and the Winter of Regret.

Terry volunteered his service in the United States Army and was an active combat Veteran in the Viet Nam War.

He retired from AT&amp;T (formerly Ameritech, formerly formerly Indiana Bell) after 39 years of begrudging service, where he accumulated roughly 3,000 rolls of black electrical tape during the course of his career (which he used for everything from open wounds to “Don’t use this button” covers).

He enjoyed many, many things.  Among those things were hunting, fishing, golfing, snorkeling, ABBA, hiking Turkey Run, chopping wood, shooting guns, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, starlight mints, cold beer, free beer, The History Channel, CCR, war movies, discussing who makes the best pizza, The Chicago White Sox, old Buicks, and above all, his family.

He was a renowned distributor of popsicles and ice cream sandwiches to his grandchildren. He also turned on programs such as “Phineas and Ferb” for his grand-youngins, usually when they were actually there.

He despised “uppity foods” like hummus, which his family lovingly called “bean dip” for his benefit, which he loved consequently. He couldn’t give a damn about most material things, and automobiles were never to be purchased new. He never owned a personal cell phone and he had zero working knowledge of the Kardashians.

Terry died knowing that The Blues Brothers was the best movie ever, (young) Clint Eastwood was the baddest-ass man on the planet, and hot sauce can be added to absolutely any food.

Tremendous and heartfelt thanks go to the truly exceptional nurses at Southlake Methodist Hospital Neuro-Intensive Care Unit, who provided much more than nursing care for Terry, but also provided a peaceful and compassionate environment during his transition from this life to the next.

Friends can visit with the family on Saturday, January 27, from Noon until the time of the Funeral Service at 4:00 PM, with Pastor Mark Wilkins officiating, at Geisen Funeral, Cremation &amp; Receptions Centre, 606 E. 113th Ave., Crown Point, IN. Services will conclude at the funeral home.

Memorial donations in Terry’s name can be made to your favorite charity or your favorite watering hole, where you are instructed to tie a few on and tell a few stories of the great Terry Ward.

Hello everyone,
here are the quotes I liked/seemed important to me while reading(and rereading). I love the community here and decided to share.


Here are my quotes from the GotM https://www.reddit.com/r/Malazan/comments/7ooey1/gotm_quotes_i_took_while_reading/


The words _in italic_ after the quote are my own

------

He would rather that every sea dried up. Men got feet, not flippers. Even so, we’re about to cross overland—over a fly-infested, waterless waste, where people smile only to announce they’re about to kill you.


-----


“Is it true that you were in the company that chased Quick Ben across the Holy Desert Raraku, and that Kalam was your guide, only he and Quick were planning on betraying you all, but Whiskeyjack had already worked that out—” Fiddler turned a glare on Kalam. “One night in Rutu Jelba with a jug of Falari rum, and this boy knows more than any Imperial historian still breathing.” He swung back to Crokus. “Listen, son, best you forget everything that drunken lout told you that night. The past is already hunting our tails—no point in making it any easier.”


-----


“The Rhivi of Genabackis have similar beliefs,” Duiker said. “A newborn child can become the vessel of a soul that has not passed through Hood’s Gates.” 


-----


If this Gral had not come upon the children and purchased them, they would now be broken. Pay the coin, and bless this Gral with the Queen of Dreams’ favor, bless him and his family for all time.” 


-----


“The Bridgeburners are remembered here in Seven Cities. A name that is cursed, yet admired all the same. You were honorable soldiers fighting in a dishonorable war. It is said the regiment was honed in the heat and scorched rock of the Holy Desert Raraku, in pursuit of a Falah’d company of wizards. That is a story I would like to hear some time, so that it may be shaped into song.” Fiddler’s eyes widened. A Spiritwalker’s sorcery was sung, no other rituals were required. Although devoted to peace, the power in a Tano song was said to be immense. The sapper wondered what such a creation would do to the Bridgeburners. The Tano Spiritwalker seemed to understand the question, for he smiled. “Such a song has never before been attempted. There is in a Tano song the potential for Ascendancy, but can an entire regiment ascend? Truly a question deserving an answer.” 


-----


Kalam grinned. “The hand you’ve just closed on that dagger at your belt had best remain where it is, Mebra. I see all that you plan. There in your eyes. Now look into mine. What do you see?” Mebra’s breath quickened. Sweat trickled down his brow. “Mercy,” he said. Kalam’s brows rose. “A fatal misreading—” “No, no! I ask for mercy, Kalam! In your eyes I see only death! Mebra’s death! _god I love Kalam_


-----


“Lazy fool! Did you see any cobwebs?” Servant’s accent caught Mappo by surprise. It was Malazan. “None, Iskaral.” “Call me by my title!” “High Priest—” “Wrong!” “High Priest Iskaral Pust of the Tesem Temple of Shadow—” “Idiot! You are Servant! Which makes me…” “Master.” “Indeed.” _and Iskral Pust, more so than Kruppe, I dare say_


-----


“I see movement in the fissure,” Icarium said. Iskaral grunted. “Bhok’arala, they nest on this cliffside. Foul mewling beasts, always interfering, sniffing at this and that, pissing on the altar, defecating on my pillow. They are my plague, they have singled me out, and why? I’ve not skinned a single one, nor cooked their brains to scoop out of their skulls in civilized repast. No snares, no traps, no poison, yet still they pursue me. There is no answer to this. I despair.” 


-----


Mappo sighed. He’d been hoping for some sorcerous means of ascent to appear, something worthy of a High Priest of Shadow. “So now we climb.” “Most certainly not,” Iskaral replied with indignation. “Servant climbs, then pulls us up.”


-----



“Why does thanking you leave such a bitter taste in my mouth?” “My wine-soaked brain whispers hypocrisy.” She watched the color leave his face. Oh, Felisin, too much durhang, too much wine! Do I only do good for Heboric to give me salt for his wounds? I’ve no wish to be so cruel. _although Felisin gets much hate, I really felt for her on the reread_


-----


I’d hoped to make you smile, Heboric, she wanted to explain. And I didn’t want my laughter to sound so…hard. I’m not what you think I am. Am I?


-----


The Wickan has us there every afternoon, mock battles, street control, assaulting buildings, break-out tactics, retrieving wounded. Coltaine’s warriors act the part of rioting mobs and looters, and I tell you, historian, they were born to it.”


-----


“What task has Coltaine given the Seventh’s last cadre mage?” “Folly. I conjure illusions all day until my skull’s ready to burst.” “Illusions? In the mock battles?” “Aye, and it’s what makes the objectives so impossible. Believe me, there’s been more than one curse thrown my way, Duiker. More than one.” “What do you conjure, dragons?” “I wish. I create Malazan refugees, historian. By the hundred. A thousand weighted scarecrows for the soldiers to drag around aren’t sufficient for Coltaine, the ones he has me create flee the wrong way, or refuse to leave their homes, or drag furniture and other possessions. Coltaine’s orders—my refugees create chaos, and so far cost more lives than any other element in the exercises. I’m not a popular man, Duiker.”


-----


“The Fist called you Uncle.” “Aye.” “Well? Are you?” “Am I what?” Duiker gave up. He was coming to understand the Wickan sense of humor. No doubt there would be another half a dozen or so brisk exchanges before Bult finally relented with an answer. I could play it through. Or I could let the bastard wait…wait forever, in fact.


-----


Hood knows, it might be Kalam’s taking the wiser path, overland, down to Aren, by mundane ship back to Quon Tali. Maybe dividing our paths will prove the wisest decision of all, increasing our chances that one of us at least will make it through.” “Right,” Crokus snapped, “and if Kalam doesn’t make it? You’ll go after Laseen yourself? A glorified ditch-digger, and long in the tooth at that. You hardly inspire confidence, Fiddler. We’re still supposed to be taking Apsalar home.”


-----


He thought about the conch shell in his leather pack. Carrying an item of power was never a wise thing. Probably more trouble than it’s worth. What if some Soletaken sniffs it out, decides it wants it for its collection? He scowled. A collection easily built on with one conch shell and three shiny skulls. The more he thought on it, the more uneasy he became. Better to sell it to some merchant in G’danisban. The extra coin could prove useful.


-----


Better to rely on the Moranth incendiaries in my pack than on any mysterious shell. A Flamer will burn a Soletaken as easily as anyone else. _I also love the sappers and their logic_


-----


Mappo cleared his throat. “Burn what into a crisp, High Priest?” “Spiders, of course. This temple is rotten with spiders. Kill them on sight, Trell. Use those thick-soled feet, those leathery hands. Kill them all, do you understand?” 


-----


The nuns left but a handful of books. Tomes devoted to pleasuring themselves. Best read in bed, I find.


-----


The Trell pushed himself upright. “Where is the library?” “Turn right, proceed thirty-four paces, turn right again, twelve paces, then through door on the right, thirty-five paces, through archway on right another eleven paces, turn right one last time, fifteen paces, enter the door on the right.” Mappo stared at Iskaral Pust. The High Priest shifted nervously. “Or,” the Trell said, eyes narrowed, “turn left, nineteen paces.” “Aye,” Iskaral muttered. Mappo strode to the door. “I shall take the short route, then.” “If you must,” the High Priest growled as he bent to close examination of the broom’s ragged end.


-----


“This place. Shadow does not list among my favorite cults. Nest of assassins and worse. Illusion and deceit and betrayal.


-----



As Fiddler roared every Gral utterance of disgust he could recall in an effort to keep the guards unbalanced, a troop of the Arak horsewarriors rode up with savage haste. “Gral! Ten jakatas for your horse!” “Twelve, Gral! To me!” “Fifteen and my youngest daughter!” “Five jakatas for three tail hairs!” Fiddler turned his fiercest frown on the riders. “Not one of you is fit to smell my horse’s farts!” But he grinned, unstrapping a beer-filled bladder and tossing it one-handed to the nearest Arak. “But let us camp with your troop this night and for a sliver you may feel its heat with your palms—once only! For more you must pay!”


-----


“That was a sight I will never forget,” Crokus said, “though I wish to Hood I could. Will the poor man live?” Fiddler shrugged. “If he chooses to.” _lol_


-----


The horse knew he was no Gral, but it’d evidently decided he was behaving in an approved manner, well enough to accord him some respect. It was, he reflected, this day’s lone victory.


-----


The hands released Kalam. Groaning, the assassin managed to roll over. A giant of a man stood over him, his face tattooed like shattered glass.


-----



Six inches of water sloshed beneath the two flat boards that formed the craft’s deck. Rags stoppered a score of minor leaks in the hull, with various degrees of efficacy. The smell of rotting fish was almost overwhelming. Wrapped in his army-issue raincape, Kulp had not moved from where he stood on the dock. “And what,” he asked tonelessly, “did you pay for this…boat?” The historian sighed, glancing up at the mage. “Can you not repair it? What was your warren again, Kulp?” “Boat repair,” the man answered.


-----


The barman, who’d been crouching behind the small counter on one side of the room, now stepped forward, hunched crablike in expectation of the first flight of arrows through the burlap wall. “The tab, Mezla—many weeks now. Seventy-two jakatas—” “What’s your life worth?” Gesler asked, gesturing for Truth to join the sailors as they slipped through the break in the rear wall. The barman’s eyes went wide, then he ducked his head. “Seventy-two jakatas, Mezla?” “About right,” the corporal nodded.


-----


“Why in Hood’s name are you two here?” he demanded in a hiss. “There’s a High Mage out prowling around—Hood knows why he’s here. Problem is, he knows I’m here, which makes me bad company to be around—I barely squeezed the last one—” “That scream we heard was yours?” Duiker asked. “Ever had a spell roll onto you? My bones have been rattled damn near out of their sockets. I shat my pants, too. But I’m alive.” “So far,” Stormy said, grinning. “Thanks for the blessing,” Kulp muttered.


-----


“Well, either the mule or Servant.” Mappo nodded. He rubbed his bristled jaw. “I’ll grant you a mule in a boat dragging nets through shoals might be interesting enough to garner a god’s curiosity, sufficient to collect the two for posterity.” “Ah, but what would be the value without a lake or pond to complete the picture? No, I think we must eliminate the mule. This craft belongs to Servant. Recall his adept climbing skills—”


-----



“Do we run?” Apsalar asked. The Gral had remounted and were now unslinging their lances. “Looks like they’re not interested in conversation,” the sapper muttered. In a louder voice he said, “Leave them to me! You two ride on!” “What, again?” Crokus slid back down from his horse. “What would be the point?” Apsalar followed suit. She stepped close to Fiddler, her eyes meeting his. “With you dead, what are our chances of surviving this desert?” About as bad as with me leading you.


-----



Only two kinds of people die in battle, Fiddler had once said, fools and the unlucky. Trading blows with a demon was both unlucky and foolish.


-----


Heboric sighed. “What a threesome we are!” he said. “You mean our dislike of each other?” Felisin asked, raising a brow. “You shouldn’t be surprised, old man,” she continued. “In case you haven’t noticed, we’re all broken in some way. Aren’t we? The gods know you’ve pointed out my fall from grace often enough. And Baudin’s nothing more than a murderer—he’s dispensed with all notions of brotherhood, and is a bully besides, meaning he’s a coward at heart…”

“What’s happened to you?” He glanced over. “I wish I knew.” “You burned your wrist on that statue.” “Not burned,” the old man said. “Hurts like Hood’s own kiss, though. Can magic thrive buried in Otataral sand? Can Otataral give birth to magic? I’ve no answers, lass, for any of this.” “Well,” she muttered, “it was a stupid thing to do—touching the damned thing. Serves you right.” _how can you not love such a noble lady as Felisin?_


-----



Throwing weapons. An assassin’s weapons. The last item in the packet was tucked into a leather loop: the talon of some large cat, amber-colored and smooth. She wondered if it held poison, painted invisibly on its surface. The item was ominous in its mystery.


-----


He unstoppered the bladder and eased it between Heboric’s cracked lips. “Drink, old man. Swallow it down.” “Those are your rations you’re giving him,” Felisin said. “Not mine.” “Well,” he said with a cold grin, “no one would think you anything but nobleborn. Mind you, opening your legs for anyone and everyone back in Skullcup was proof enough, I suppose.” “It kept us all alive, you bastard.” “Kept you plump and lazy, you mean. Most of what me and Heboric ate came from the favors I did for the Dosii guards. Beneth gave us dregs to keep you sweet. He knew we wouldn’t tell you about it. He used to laugh at your noble cause.” “You’re lying.” “As you say,” he said, still grinning.


-----


Heboric slowly curled himself into a ball. “He’s here,” he whispered. “We know,” Baudin said. “In the mortal realm…” the ex-priest continued after a moment. “Vulnerable.” “You’re looking at it the wrong way,” Felisin said. “The god you no longer worship took your hands. So now you pulled him down. Don’t mess with mortals.” 


-----


Kulp did not trust his warren’s uncharacteristic attentiveness. It wanted to join the game. He knew he was falling into the trap of thinking of Meanas as an entity, a faceless god, where access was worship, success a reward of faith. Warrens were not like that. A mage was not a priest and magic was not divine intervention. Sorcery could be the ladder to Ascendancy—a means to an end, but there was no point to worshipping the means.


-----


Gesler and Stormy were locked in a battle of pride, neither one wanting to surrender before the other. Their bared grins confirmed it for Felisin. Idiots! They’ll both collapse at once, leaving the mage to handle the steering oar by himself.


-----


The two Imass sent to the cabin now returned. Though no words were spoken aloud, the female nodded. “They are dead, then. And our kin have departed. We must continue the hunt.” She swung her gaze back to Heboric. “I would lay hands upon you.” Felisin barked another laugh. “That’ll make him complete.”


-----


Felisin thought to ask him what it all meant, but a sudden exhaustion swept the impulse away. She looked around until she saw Baudin. He was at the prow, his back to everything…to everyone. She wondered at his indifference. Lack of imagination, she concluded after a moment, the thought bringing a sneer to her lips.


-----


Duiker flung the blanket aside and stood up. List handed him a battered tin cup. “Careful, sir, it’s hot.” The historian stared down at the dark-brown liquid. “What is it?” “Don’t know, sir. Something Wickan.”


-----


“Who is in charge of the refugees?” “Elements of the Crow Clan. Coltaine has his Wickans oversee them—the refugees are as scared of them as they are of the Apocalypse.” And the Wickans won’t be bought, either.


-----



“The Emperor, as our enemy, united us. By laughing at our small battles, our pointless feuds. Laughing and more: sneering. He shamed us with contempt, Historian. When he met with Coltaine, our alliance was already breaking apart. Kellanved mocked. He said he need only sit back and watch to see the end of our rebellion. With his words he branded our souls. With his words and his offer of unity he bestowed on us wisdom. With his words we knelt before him in true gratitude, accepted what he offered us and gave him our loyalty. You once wondered how the Emperor won our hearts. Now you know.”


-----


Though he now stood close by, the big man’s words sounded faint and distant to Duiker’s ringing ears as he said, “Fifty-five cussers—what the Seventh’s been hoarding for years. That ford’s now a trench. Ha.” Then his satisfied expression drained away. “Hood’s toes, we’re back to digging with shovels.” _poor sappers_ 


-----


“I saw a company of Engineers on my way here,” Lull said. “They were weeping, one and all.” Chenned asked, “Why? Is their invisible commander lying on the bottom of the Sekala with a mouthful of mud?” Lull shook his head. “They’re out of cussers now. Just a crate or two of sharpers and burners. You’d think every one of their mothers had just croaked.”


-----


Mappo had explained that the creatures worshipped the High Priest. Not like a dog its master, but like acolytes their god. Offerings, obscure symbols and fitful icons crowded their awkward rituals. Many of those rituals seemed to involve bodily wastes. When you can’t produce holy books, produce what you can, I suppose. The creatures drove Iskaral Pust to distraction. He cursed them, and had taken to carrying rocks in a sack. He flung the missiles at the bhok’arala at every opportunity. The winged creatures gathered those god-sent objects and clearly revered them—the High Priest had found the sack carefully refilled when he awoke this morning. Pust had flown into a spitting rage at the discovery.


-----


“I am continually astonished,” Icarium went on, “at just how much you manage to fit into that tattered sack.” Another trick of the Clan witches—this small, private warren beyond the drawstrings. Should never have lasted this long. They said a month, maybe two. Not centuries. His gaze fell again to the weapon in his hands. There was power in these bones to start with—the witches simply did some enhancements, spells of binding to keep the parts together and such. Perhaps the bone feeds the warren in the sack somehow…or the handful of irritating people I’ve stuffed inside in my own fits of ill temper. Wonder where they all went…


-----


Changes are coming to us all, it seems. He glanced over at Crokus, who sat rigid with barely restrained impatience on the spare mount he had inherited. He’d caught the lad running through a gamut of close-in knife-fighting moves a short while earlier. The few times the sapper had seen him use the knives before there’d been a kind of desperation marring his technique. Crokus had some skill but he lacked maturity—he was too conscious of himself behind the blades. That had changed, Fiddler realized as he watched the lad go through his routine. Taking cuts was essential to delivering killing thrusts. Knife-fighting was a messy business. Cold determination backed Crokus now—he would do more than just hold his own from now on, the sapper knew. Nor would he be so quick to throw his knives, unless he had plenty of spares tucked within easy reach in the folds of his telaba. Now more likely, I’d hazard.


-----


Tell me, my dear, what am I to do with over a thousand dying mortals?” The Hounds were eyeing Apt as if the demon was a potential meal. “Am I a cutter? A healer?” Shadowthrone’s voice was rising, octave by octave. “Is Cotillion a kindly uncle? Are my Hounds farmyard skulkers and orphans’ puppies?” The shadow that was the god flared wildly. “Have you gone entirely insane?” Apt spoke in a rapid, rasping series of clicks and hisses. “Of course Kalam wanted to save them!” Shadowthrone shrieked. “But he knew it was impossible! Only vengeance was possible! But now! Now I must exhaust my powers healing a thousand maimed children! And for what?” Apt spoke again. “Servants? And precisely how big do you think Shadow Keep is, you one-armed imbecile!” The demon said nothing, her slate-gray multifaceted eye glimmering in the starlight. Shadowthrone hunched suddenly, his gauzelike cloak wrapping close as he hugged himself. “An army of servants,” he whispered. “Servants. Abandoned by the Empire, left to their fates at the hand of Sha’ik’s bloodlusted bandits. There will be…ambivalence…in their scarred, malleable souls…” The god glanced up at the demon. “I see long-term benefits in your precipitous act, demon. Lucky for you!” 


-----


“You’re known, old man. They say you walk in the spirit world. That old horsewife wouldn’t offer food to just anybody—not me, that’s for certain.” The spirit world. Yes, I walked there. Once. Never again. “See an old man in crusty rags…” “And he’s gods-touched, aye. Don’t mock out loud—it might save your skin one day.”


-----



“Has Bult finally managed to track down that captain of the sappers?” the historian eventually asked. “Ain’t seen his face at any of the jaw sessions, if that’s what you mean. But he’s around. Somewhere. Coltaine’s finally accepted that the man’s shy.” “Shy?” Lull shrugged. “A joke, Historian. Remember those?”


-----



They arrived at the place of the breached ceiling. Felisin laid a hand on the quartzite column nearest the hole. “I’d have to climb this like a Dosii does a coconut palm.” “And how’s that done?” Kulp asked. “Reluctantly,” Heboric muttered, cocking his head as if hearing voices. Felisin glanced at the mage. “I’ll need those straps from your belt.” With a grunt, Kulp began removing the leather band at his waist. “Damned strange time to be wanting to see me without my breeches, lass.” “We can all do with the laugh,” she replied.


-----


Spiders, big enough to make out each one even at this distance. Fiddler’s skin prickled. You should have brought brooms, friends.


-----


At the last instant the huge animal dodged lithely around him, and the historian saw that it held in its mouth a lapdog, its eyes dark pools of terror. The cattle-dog ran on, slipping between two tents and disappearing from sight. Ahead of the historian, a number of figures appeared, armed with large rocks and—bizarrely—Kanese parasols. One and all, they were dressed as if about to attend a royal function, although in their expressions Duiker saw raw fury. “You there!” one yelled imperiously. “Old man! Did you see a mad hound just now?” “I saw a running cattle-dog, aye,” the historian quietly replied. “With a rare Hengese roach dog in its mouth?” A dog that eats cockroaches? “Rare? I assumed it was raw.”


-----


His mind over a thousand leagues away, Kalam lightly touched the engraved sigil. Blackdog…we were warring against mosquitoes and leeches, poisonous snakes and blood-sucking lizards. Supply lines cut, the Moranth pulling back when we needed them the most…and this sigil I remember, there on a ragged standard, rising above a select company of Brood’s forces. What did that bastard call himself? The High King? Kallor…the High King without a kingdom. Thousands of years old, if legends speak true, perhaps tens of thousands. He claimed to have once commanded empires, each one making the Malazan Empire no larger than a province. He then claimed to have destroyed them by his own hand, destroyed them utterly. Kallor boasted he had made worlds lifeless…



-----


“This land is not home to Toblakai,” Heboric said. “Has the Rebellion’s lure of slaughter called you here? From where did you crawl, bastard?” “I have said to you all that I shall say. When I speak to you next it will be when I kill you.”


-----


“Aye, it’s him,” Stormy said, rising from his stool and approaching. “Fener’s hoof, never thought to see you again.” “I imagine,” Duiker managed, “you’ve a tale to tell.” The veteran grinned. “You got that right.” Nether spoke, her eyes on the Silanda. “Corporal Gesler, what’s your complement?” “Three.” “The ship’s crew?” “Dead.” Had he not been so weary, the historian would have noted a certain dryness to that reply.


-----


Stormy had spun his tale, allowing for his poor narrative skills, and it was his painfully obvious lack of imagination that lent it the greatest credence.


-----


Lull strode up to Gesler. The marine corporal scowled. “You ain’t as pretty as I remembered, sir.” “I know you by reputation, Gesler. Once a captain, then a sergeant, now a corporal. You’ve got your boots to the sky on the ladder—” “And head in the horseshit, aye, sir.” “Two left in your squad?” “Well, one officially, sir. The lad’s sort of a recruit, though not properly inducted, like. So, just me and Stormy, sir.” “Stormy? Not Cartheron Fist’s Adjutant Stormy—” “Once upon a time.” “Hood’s breath!” Lull swung to Coltaine. “Fist, we’ve got two of the Emperor’s Old Guard here…as Coastal Marines.”


-----


He addressed Gesler again. “As for you and Stormy—” “If you promote us, sir, I will punch you in what’s left of your face. And Stormy will likely kick you while you’re down. Sir.” Gesler then smiled. Bult pushed past Lull and stood face to face with the corporal, their noses almost touching. “And, Corporal,” the commander hissed, “would you punch me as well?” Gesler’s smile did not waver. “Yes, sir. And Hood take me, I’ll give the Fist’s crack-thong a yank too, if you ask sweetly.”


-----


The High Priest of Shadow broke into another dance, brought to an abrupt halt by Baran’s head and shoulder as the animal, with blurring speed, batted Iskaral Pust to the ground. Fiddler grunted as he reached down to help the priest up. “You’ve managed to irritate your god, Pust.” “Nonsense,” the man gasped. “Affection. The puppy was so pleased to see me it became overexcited.”


-----


“Thought you’d found a woman. A marine—what was her name?” “I don’t know. We shared one night…” “Ah, sword too small for the sheath, eh?”


-----


“Master wishes to speak with you,” one of them growled. “Too bad,” Kalam growled back. “Now.” “Or what, you kill me with your breath?


-----


A ghostly, tusked face rose before his mind’s eye, and though he had never before seen it, he knew that the Jaghut had found him. The gravest compassion filled that creature’s unhuman eyes, a compassion that Duiker could not understand. Why grieve, Jaghut? I shall not haunt eternity as you have done. I shall not return to this place, nor suffer again the losses a mortal suffers in life, and in living. Hood is about to bless me, Jaghut—no need to grieve… Those thoughts echoed only a moment longer, as the Jaghut’s ravaged face faded and darkness closed in around the historian, closed in until it swallowed him. And with it, awareness ceased.


-----


Heboric’s voice rose above it. “Who is this? I can see nothing—can sense nothing. Who is this man?” The corpulent, silk-clad priest finally spoke. “An old man, Unhanded One. A soldier, no more than that. One among ten thousand.” “Do—do you…” Heboric slowly turned, his milky eyes glistening. “Do you hear a god’s laughter? Does anyone hear a god’s laughter?” The Jhistal priest cocked his head. “Alas, I hear only the wind.” Sha’ik frowned at Heboric. He looked suddenly so…small.",,False,False,Malazan,t5_2t1dv,,,public,,self,,,DG quotes I took while reading,https://www.reddit.com/r/Malazan/comments/7t4nxu/dg_quotes_i_took_while_reading/,all_ads,,True,,,,,

In 5e, I've had to nerf/remove almost nothing, most of the time I've just added more things to classes that don't have a lot of versatility or power (I'm basically aiming to help everyone reach a high A-tier level, that's where I enjoy running games). This class was made with that in mind. It's almost Mystic-level in its power and versatility, and the sheer amount of stuff it gets. If you want to adapt this to a ""normal"" 5e game, remove the 3rd and 7th level features and the bit about turning into a ghost when you die in the level 20 capstones (though that's mostly for plot hooks).

But without further ado:

~*~

A young orc with painted skin and a necklace of small animal bones is performing his daily rituals to the spirits of the forest his tribe lives in. The woodland spirits return the favour by warning him of a group of bandits seeking to ambush him. The young shaman laughs at the bandits’ threats as the spirits of noble orcish warriors coalesce from the aether to protect him. They thought him alone. He is never alone.

The old elven woman sits on an aerie at the top of a spire, telling the future of her visitors. She tells a noblewoman the one she loves most will betray her, and that sends the aristocrat into a rage, calling her a deceiver and false prophet. The wizened oracle is impassive as she dodges every swing until the temple guards come to her aid. The future held few surprises for her.

A pair of goliath parents rush into a stone home with their sick child. The goliath witch inside, a man of many years and few words, examines the child and sees what others do not: traces of magic forming a complex pattern on the child’s skin. He turns to his grimoire and finds, near the beginning, a match for the pattern: an ancient foe he had thought vanquished long ago. He cleanses the child’s malaise with a spell and then leaves to convince the chieftain to muster a militia. A witch’s work is never done.

~*~

**Sight Beyond Sight**

Every seer is marked by their Second Sight. Some think of it as a gift, others as a curse, yet none can escape it. The Sight cannot be turned off: a seer always sees the world differently from everyone else. A shaman sees ephemeral copies of her surroundings superimposed onto the real thing, as well as spirits drifting across the Ethereal plane. An oracle sees ghostly projections of each possible action a person might take and the echoes of events past replaying on a loop. A witch sees the patterns of magic etched across people, objects and places, patterns he can understand and record in his grimoire for future reference.

The Sight is divine in nature, but it’s not always bestowed by a deity. Sometimes, the soul reaches out into the unknown, often in a time of utmost despair, and the Sight awakens, the soul glimpsing for the briefest moment the nature of the cosmos.

Most puzzlingly, however, is the fact that seers can have apprentices. Through years of meditation and training, it’s possible for anyone to awaken their own Sight, though such a process is never taken lightly. Once awakened, the Sight remains with the seer for the rest of her life.

**Pillars of the Community**

Seers, having access to magic and gifts that other divine classes don’t get, find themselves as invaluable pillars of the community, with people naturally flocking to them for aid. Their magic offers them a suit of supportive tricks they can use to heal, protect and empower allies, as well as hinder enemies and solve problems. Seers tend to approach things unorthodoxly, their unique talents letting them solve issues from unexpected angles.
Each type of seer has a different Sight, and so while they share the same core abilities and most of the same spells, they vary drastically when it comes to their specialty niche. Furthermore, powerful seers can learn mysteries of the cosmos and add even more variety to their arsenal.

There are many reasons seers become adventurers instead of staying in their communities. Some might be wandering loners or read ill omens in the wind and seek to prevent disaster. Others need to understand their Sight, find an answer to a question that troubles them or solve a mystery. Yet others seek to escape the pressure that others put on them, atone for a failure or become stronger to better serve their community.

~*~

**Creating a Seer**

The backstory of a seer necessitates explaining how the character gained their Sight. Was it bestowed by a particular deity? Was it awakened after years of training under another seer? Or did it awaken after a traumatic event that changed the character forever?

Once you have decided how the character obtained their Sight, you must determine how they feel about it. Is it a gift or a curse? Do they use it to help others or only to help themselves? Do they try to hide it or publicly advertise their talent?
The type of seer the character is will deeply influence their personality as well. A shaman can see into the Ethereal and communicate with spirits. Are they incessantly chattering or do they leave the shaman alone and simply watch, expectant? An oracle can see the potential of the future and the echoes of the past. Does that make the character overconfident? Pessimistic? Aloof? A witch can see the patterns of magic. How do they feel, seeing the underlying weave of magic in the world, and how it affects others and themselves?

**Quick Build**

You can make a seer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by the ability score used by your Second Sight features. Second, choose the sage background. Third, choose the Blade Ward and Guidance cantrips, as well as Bless, Cure Wounds and Shield as your known spells.

~*~

***Class Features***

As a seer, you gain the following class features.

**Hit Points**

*Hit Dice:* 1d6 per seer level.

**Proficiencies**

*Armour:* None.

*Weapons:* All simple weapons.

*Tools:* None.

*Saving Throws:* Wisdom, Charisma.

*Skills:* Choose two from Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, Religion, Insight, Medicine, Perception, Deception and Persuasion.

* Any simple weapon.

* (a) an arcane focus, (b) a druidic focus, (c) a holy symbol, or (d) a component pouch.

* (a) a scholar’s pack, (b) an explorer’s pack, or (c) a priest’s pack.

~*~

***Spellcasting***

The Sight that has awakened in you not only colours your perception of reality, but it also grants you the ability to call upon divine magic in your time of need.

*Cantrips*

At 1st level, you know 2 cantrips of your choice from the seer spell list. You learn additional seer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Seer table.

*Spell Slots*

The Seer table shows you how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these seer spells, you must spend a spell slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

*Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher*

You know three 1st level spells of your choice from the seer spell list, which is detailed at the end of the class description.
The Spells Known column of the Seer table shows when you learn more seer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the seer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the seer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

*Spellcasting Ability*

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your seer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a seer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

* Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.

* Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.

*Spellcasting Focus*

You can use an arcane focus, a druidic focus or a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your seer spells.

**Second Sight**

Choose a Second Sight, which describes the type of seer you are: Shaman Sight, Oracle Sight or Witch Sight, which are detailed after the core class features.

Your choice grants you features upon choosing it and again at levels 6th, 10th, 14th and 20th.

**Seer’s Curse**

The Sight does not come without a price. Choose a curse from the following list; this curse cannot be removed by any mortal means. You obtain the second part of the curse at level 7th. At level 11th, your curse is lifted, whether by deific intervention or due to your own conquering of it. You retain its benefits, but the downside is miraculously removed.

*Curse of Blindness.* You cannot see and permanently have the Blinded condition. However, you also gain Blindsight 30 feet (you do not suffer from the Blinded condition within the area of your Blindsight. Any effect that requires you to see functions normally within the area of your Blindsight). *Improved Seer’s Curse:* Your Blindsight increases to 60 feet.

*Curse of Deafness.* You cannot hear and permanently have the Deafened condition. However, you have resistance to thunder damage. *Improved Seer’s Curse:* You have immunity to thunder damage.

*Curse of Despair.* You cannot shake off this suffocating, supernatural despair. You always have disadvantage on death saves, even if you gain advantage through some means. However, you have advantage on saves against Enchantment and Illusion spells and effects. *Improved Seer’s Curse:* If you fail a save against an Enchantment or Illusion spell or effect, you may save again the next turn. If you succeed, the spell or effect ends.

*Curse of Dread.* You cannot help but come off as frightening and disturbing to others. You have disadvantage on social ability rolls against Beasts, Plants, Fey, Humanoids, Elementals and Monstrosities. However, you gain proficiency on Intimidation, and the curse’s effects do not apply to that skill. *Improved Seer’s Curse:* You can attempt an Intimidation roll as an action to frighten a Beast, Humanoid, Fey or Monstrosity. The DC is 15 + the creature’s CR (creatures with CR lower than 1 have a DC of 15). If you succeed, the creature gains the frightened condition until the end of your next turn. Once a creature succeeds its save against this ability, it is immune to it for 24 hours.

*Curse of Haunting.* You are haunted by spirits, memories or echoes of the past, which only you can see and are terribly distracting. You have disadvantage on concentration rolls. However, you have advantage on History and Religion checks. *Improved Seer’s Curse:* You also gain advantage on Arcana and Nature checks.

*Curse of Misfortune.* Luck never seems to be on your side; if anything, bad luck follows you wherever you go. You have disadvantage on rolls with tools and skills you’re not proficient with. However, you gain an additional skill proficiency from the seer list. *Improved Seer’s Curse:* You gain an additional skill proficiency from the seer list.

*Curse of Tongues.* When you are in a stressful situation, you begin speaking in tongues. Choose an Exotic Language. When in combat or a similarly stressful situation, you temporarily forget all other languages you know. However, you add that exotic language to the list of languages you know and also add the Comprehend Languages spell to your seer spells known (it doesn’t count against your total spells known). *Improved Seer’s Curse:* You add the Tongues spell to your seer spells known, it doesn’t count against your total spells known. If you already knew that spell, you may instead choose a seer spell of 3rd level or lower.

*Curse of Withering.* Your otherwise strong and hale body has been supernaturally withered, scarred or deformed in some way. You have disadvantage on Strength, Dexterity and Constitution saves. However, you gain 1 more HP at each seer level (including first level). *Improved Seer’s Curse:* You are immune to mundane diseases and have advantage on saves against poisons and magical diseases.

**Immediate Foresight**

Starting at level 2, your Sight allows you to use your magic to foresee and hopefully avoid disaster. As a reaction to an attack, spell or effect, you can spend a spell slot in order to gain a bonus equal to the level of that spell to either your AC or any one saving throw. This effect applies only against that specific attack, spell or effect.

**Mystical Gift**

When you reach 3rd level, you choose one of the following boons. If a gift outlines that you are under the effects of a spell or allows you to cast a spell, you use your own spellcasting ability, DC and attack bonus for it. At level 13, you can change your Mystical Gift if you so choose.

*Gift of Dark Mists.* While you are within mist or fog (whether natural or magical), you can cast the Misty Step spell without spending a spell slot and without needing to have it among your spells known, but you must target a location with mist. Once you use this feature twice, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

*Gift of Divine Intuition.* You can cast the Augury spell as a ritual without needing material components, spending a spell slot or needing to have it among your spells known. Once you use this feature twice, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

*Gift of Abjuring Glyphs.* While you are wielding no weapons or shields and wearing no armour, your skin glows faintly with magical glyphs, shedding dim light 5 feet around you, and you are under the effects of a Mage Armour spell. If you ever reach your carrying capacity, you lose this effect until you finish a short or long rest.

*Gift of Inviolate Presence.* While you are wielding no weapons or shields and wearing no armour, you are under the effects of a Sanctuary spell. If you deal damage to a creature, you lose this effect until you finish a short or long rest.

*Gift of Warded Sanctums.* You can designate a room or building no larger than Huge size as your sanctum. Those who seek to enter it uninvited must succeed at a Charisma save against your spell DC, failure means they cannot enter it, though they may try again after one hour. You can change the designation of your sanctum in a 10 minute ritual, but you can only do so once per week.

*Gift of Closing Wounds.* After you take damage, if you are still conscious, you immediately heal 1 HP per seer level you have. This can only trigger once per round.

**Ability Score Improvement**

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

**Cosmic Mystery**

At level 15 and again at level 18, you learn a mystery of the cosmos. Each time you gain this class feature, choose one of the following mysteries.

*Mystery of Nature.* Spells you cast that target Beasts, Plants, Elementals or Fey have their range and duration doubled. These creatures, unless controlled by a hostile force, attacked or provoked, regard you positively.

*Mystery of the Skies.* Whenever you cast a spell, you gain a flying speed of 60 feet that lasts for 10 minutes per level of the spell you cast. If you cast spells while this is already in effect, you add more minutes to your flying speed duration.

*Mystery of Destruction.* Your spells that deal damage ignore resistance (but not immunity).

*Mystery of Creation.* You can replace the material components of spells that bring back the dead or create undead for a single item of at least the same value.

*Mystery of Life.* When you would normally roll dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die.

*Mystery of Death.* Whenever you finish a long rest, you gain the effects of a Death Ward spell, lasting for 8 hours.

*Mystery of the Elements.* While in contact with earth, fire, water or wind (not merely still air), you have resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning and thunder damage.

*Mystery of Light and Dark.* You have resistance to necrotic and radiant damage. Spells you cast that create light or darkness have their areas doubled.

*Mystery of the Ephemeral.* You have resistance to force, poison and psychic damage.

*Mystery of Magic.* You can recover a single spent spell slot of 3rd level or lower when you finish a short rest.

**Second Sights**

Each type of seer is different, and that difference is determined by the type of Sight they possess. Though other, rarer types exist, the main three are Shaman Sight, Oracle Sight and Witch Sight.

~*~

***Shaman Sight***

A Shaman’s Sight allows them to see into the Ethereal and lets them communicate with the spirits that dwell therein. They are tougher than other seers and can beseech the spirits for aid.

**Ethereal Sight**

At 1st level when you choose this Second Sight, you can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when you are on the Material Plane, and vice versa. As an action, you can choose to open your senses, which allows you to hear the speech of creatures that are 60 feet around you in the Ethereal Plane. You are immune to the Horrifying Visage and Possession abilities of ghosts.

**Spiritual Bargains**

Starting at level 1, you can perform a 10 minute ritual in front of a totem (which you can fashion out of natural materials like twigs, leaves, bones and rocks in 10 minutes) to bargain with or entice the spirits that dwell in the Ethereal, which are usually Fey or Undead. Once you perform the ritual, you then have 12 hours to call upon spiritual aid, which you can do as an action. When you do so, a Fey spirit materialises adjacent to you in a place of your choosing. 

Treat it as a satyr (no pipes) with a flying speed of 30 feet and the Ethereal Sight, Etherealness and Incorporeal movement abilities of a ghost. The spirit acts on your initiative (including the turn you summon it) and remains at your service for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier or until its HP reaches 0, after which it fades back into the Ethereal Plane (regardless of what spell or effect it was subjected to while in the Material Plane).

Once you perform the bargain ritual, you cannot perform another until you finish a long rest; once you call for spiritual aid, you cannot do so again until you perform another bargain ritual.

When you reach level 5, and again at levels 10, 15 and 20, you can summon an additional spirit when you call for spirit aid.

When you reach level 12, you may choose to summon a ghost instead of a Fey spirit. However, if you do so, you summon 2 less ghosts than you could summon Fey spirits.

**Unarmoured Defence**

At 6th level, while you are not wearing any armour or wielding a shield, you add your Constitution modifier to your AC.

**Spiritual Authority**

At 6th level, you are known and respected by the nature and undead spirits you traffic with. Undead, Fey, Elementals, Beasts and Plants have disadvantage on attacks against you and you have advantage on social ability rolls against them. However, you have disadvantage on attacks against these creatures as well.

**Revered Ritualist**

Starting from level 10, whenever you cast a spell as a ritual or perform a ritual granted to you by a class feature, race or feat, you gain a spiritual blessing. When you complete the ritual, you gain the effects of a Protection From Evil and Good spell for 1 hour afterwards.

**Shamanic Totems**

Starting at level 14, you can conjure a special totem in a 10 minute ritual. These totems are sculpted of aether (in the shape of animal heads, stylised plants or entwined humanoid/monstrous figures) and do not take damage, but are instantly destroyed by a Dispel Magic spell (of any level). A created totem lasts for a number of hours equal to your Constitution modifier and can be picked up and carried only by a shaman (it is weightless and Small size), as it is incorporeal to others. You can have up to 2 totems active at any time and they must be of different types. If you create a new one, the oldest is instantly destroyed. Choose from one of the following options:

*Totem of Endless Rivers.* You and your allies, if within 10 feet of the totem, heal 1d8 damage per round, but only up to half of maximum HP.

*Totem of Fearless Wings.* You and your allies, if within 10 feet of the totem, gain a bonus of 10 feet to all movement speeds.

*Totem of Burning Hearts.* You and your allies, if within 10 feet of the totem, are immune to the charmed and frightened conditions.

*Totem of Unbroken Stones.* You and your allies, if within 10 feet of the totem, are immune to the prone and petrified conditions.

*Totem of Dark Mists.* The totem emits a thick mist (as per the Fog Cloud spell) in a 10 feet radius around it that you and your allies can see through perfectly.

*Totem of Astral Lights.* The totem emits bright light 10 feet around it and dim light 10 feet further. This light counts as sunlight, starlight and moonlight all at once. Shapechangers and Aberrations have disadvantage on attack and ability rolls while under the light of this totem.

*Totem of Tamed Beasts.* Beasts that enter an area 30 feet around the totem must make a Wisdom save against your spell DC or be charmed for the duration of the totem. Once the totem is destroyed, the beasts regard the shaman and their allies positively unless attacked or frightened. If a beast succeeds on the Wisdom save, it is immune to the effects of that totem (but may be affected by a different Totem of Tamed Beasts).

*Totem of Sacred Blooms.* The ground around the totem is constantly sprouting magical plants and flowers, and it rains softly with flower petals and leaves around it. A 10 feet radius around the totem is considered difficult terrain by all but you and your allies, and gases, smoke, winds, rain and mists cannot penetrate the serenity of the area 10 feet around the totem either.

**Shaman of Legend**

When you reach level 20, you finally take your place amongst the shaman legends of old. You gain the following benefits:
You no longer age and cannot die of old age. You cannot be magically aged (but you can be de-aged up to young adult).

* As an action, you can enter the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane or viceversa. However, unlike using the Etherealness spell, you are visible to the Material Plane while in the Border Ethereal and viceversa, though you can’t be affected by creatures or effects from the plane you are not in. You cannot remain in the Ethereal Plane with this ability more than a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier. Once you use this ability twice, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

* You have resistance to the damage dealt by Undead, Fey, Elementals, Beasts and Plants, and they have disadvantage on saves against your spells.

* You automatically identify other seers and what type of Sight they have.

* Should you die, you can choose to automatically become a ghost (you retain your ability scores and are in control of whether you show your Frightening Visage). However, you can still be resurrected or reincarnated if you are willing.

~*~

***Oracle Sight***

An oracle’s sight allows them to glimpse into both the future and the past. They are wiser than other seers and can avoid  disaster before it happens.

**Danger Sight**

At 1st level when you choose this Second Sight, you have the ongoing effects of the Find Traps and Detect Poison and Disease spells, but only in the area you can see and up to 30 feet of distance.

**Visions of the Future and the Past**

At 1st level, you can attempt to see what the future holds in store for you. After performing a 10 minute ritual where you meditate or use a divinatory instrument (like a deck of cards, a crystal ball, a mirror or the like), you receive a vision of an event that could potentially happen within the next 24 hours. Once you perform this ritual, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

At level 5, you begin to receive brief glimpses of a person’s past or current troubles when you look at them, giving you advantage on Insight rolls.

At level 10, whenever you step into an important location for the first time, you receive a brief vision of the most salient event that happened there in the last millennium.

At level 15, instead of gaining a vision of a potential future, you may use the ritual granted by this ability to duplicate the effects of a Divination spell.

At level 20, instead of gaining a vision of a potential future, you may use  the ritual granted by this ability to duplicate the effects of a Legend Lore spell.

**Unarmoured Defence**

At 6th level, while you are not wearing any armour or wielding a shield, you add your Wisdom modifier to your AC.

**Heartsight**

Starting at level 6, you gain the ability to touch a creature to learn its current emotional state. When you do so, you can force the creature to make a Charisma save against your spell DC. On a failure, you learn the creature’s alignment and the most pressing concern it currently has. On a success, it is immune to this ability for 24 hours. Aberrations, Celestials, Constructs, Fiends and Undead automatically fail this save.

**Unmatched Instinct**

At level 10, you can see events unfolding seconds before they happen. You add your Wisdom modifier to your Initiative and Dexterity saving throws. Additionally, you can always act in a surprise round and cannot be surprised.

**Oracular Epiphanies**

Starting at level 14, you can invoke a special epiphany. Once you invoke an epiphany, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

*They Were Never There.* As a reaction to yourself or an ally you can see being in the area of a spell, you can invoke this epiphany to move that target outside of the area of that spell, but no further than the fastest of the target’s speeds.

*The Wound Was Never Mortal.* As a reaction to an ally you can see being reduced to 0 HP by damage, you can instantly reduce that damage by 2 per seer level you have (but no lower than 0 damage). This can prevent death due to massive damage and any effect that triggers if the target reaches 0 HP.

*It Was Only A Warning.* As a reaction to yourself or an ally you can see failing a saving throw, you can invoke this epiphany to immediate reroll the save. You or the ally must accept the new roll.

*You Struck True.* As a reaction to an ally you can see missing a weapon attack, you can invoke this epiphany to immediate reroll the attack. Your ally must accept the new roll.

*I Don’t Think So.* As a reaction to an enemy you can see choosing to succeed on a save without rolling, you can invoke this epiphany to force that enemy to roll the saving throw instead. The enemy’s attempt, if it has a limited amount, is expended anyway.

*There Is No Escape.* As a reaction to an enemy you can see that is adjacent to one of your allies attempting to escape (whether it’s through the use of teleportation magic, the disengage action, or any other means), you can invoke this epiphany to force the enemy to roll a Charisma saving throw against your spell DC. On a failure, the enemy wastes their attempt to escape and remains where it is.

**Oracle of Legend**

When you reach level 20, you become recognised as a legendary oracle. You gain the following benefits:

* You no longer age and cannot die of old age. You cannot be magically aged (but you can be de-aged up to young adult).

* Your Danger Sight also gains the benefits of the Detect Evil and Good and the True Seeing spells, with the same limitations.

* When you finish a long rest, you gain the benefits of a Foresight spell for 16 hours.

* You automatically identify other seers and what type of Sight they have.

* Should you die, you can choose to automatically become a ghost (you retain your ability scores and are in control of whether you show your Frightening Visage). However, you can still be resurrected or reincarnated if you are willing.

~*~

***Witch Sight***

A witch’s sight allows them to see the unique patterns that magic makes on people, objects and places. They are smarter than other seers and can twist magic on itself to hex others.

**Arcane Sight**

At 1st level when you choose this Second Sight, you have the ongoing effects of the Detect Magic spell. Additionally, each spell or magical effect currently affecting an object, person or place appears as a distinctive pattern that you can copy down in your Grimoire (a process that takes 10 minutes per unique pattern). Each spellcaster has their own unique pattern, so consulting your Grimoire allows you to make a DC 15 Arcana check to recognise a magical pattern you’ve seen before and identify its caster.

**Grimoire of Witchcraft**

At 1st level, you create or inherit a Grimoire of Witchcraft. This object uses the statistics of a spellbook, but does not contain only spells. It also functions as a place for you to document important information and inscribe the magical patterns you find in the world. As you grow in power, your Grimoire becomes more useful. Should your Grimoire be destroyed, you can recover it through an hour-long ritual that imposes 3 levels of Exhaustion on you.

At the start, it gives you an additional cantrip from either the seer or the wizard spell lists and adds the Find Familiar spell to your spells known. You only gain these benefits while consulting the Grimoire (though you can hold the Grimoire in the same hand you use for your component pouch or spellcasting focus).

At level 5, it gives you proficiency with the alchemist’s kit, herbalist’s kit and poisoner’s kit while consulting the Grimoire.

At levels 10, 15 and 20, it allows you to add a spell of a level you can cast from the wizard list to your spells known. You only have access to these spells while consulting the Grimoire.

**Unarmoured Defence**

At 6th level, while you are not wearing any armour or wielding a shield, you add your Intelligence modifier to your AC.

**Eye for Magic**

At 6th level, you automatically identify spells and magical effects without needing to make Arcana rolls if they are of a level you can cast. If they are higher, you have advantage on Arcana rolls to identify them. You also know when a spell is being cast within 60 feet of you, even if you cannot see the caster or the casting.

**Witch’s Cunning**

Starting at level 10, whenever you use Immediate Foresight against a spell, you also add your Intelligence modifier to the bonus you gain.

**Witch Hexes**

Starting at level 14, you can twist magic to hex others. All hexes are performed as an action targeting a creature you can see within 30 feet, they use your spell DC and last until the end of your next turn. Once you perform a hex, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest. When you wish to perform a hex, choose from one of the following:

*Hex of Ill Omens.* The target must make a Charisma save or have disadvantage on all rolls and saves. Regardless of whether the save is successful or not, the target takes 4d6 necrotic damage.

*Hex of the Shattered Mind.* The target must make an Intelligence save or be incapacitated. Regardless of whether the save is successful or not, the target takes 4d6 psychic damage.

*Hex of the Frozen Tomb.* The target must make a Constitution save or take 8d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Regardless of whether the save is successful or not, the target is restrained by ice.

*Hex of Strength Undone.* The target must make a Constitution save or lose all resistances. If that save fails, the target must immediately make another Constitution save or also lose all immunities.

*Hex of the Iridescent Night.* The target must make an Intelligence save or be mentally overwhelmed by shimmering darkness, rendering them Blinded, Deafened and unable to speak.

*Hex of the Broken Seal.* The target must make a Charisma save or gain vulnerability to the damage of spells and become unable to cast spells.

**Witch of Legend**

When you reach level 20, you join the ranks of the witches of legend. You gain the following benefits:

* You no longer age and cannot die of old age. You cannot be magically aged (but you can be de-aged up to young adult).

* You have resistance to the damage of spells.

* You add your Intelligence modifier to your Perception, Insight, Survival, Medicine and Concentration rolls.
You automatically identify other seers and what type of Sight they have.

* Should you die, you can choose to automatically become a ghost (you retain your ability scores and are in control of whether you show your Frightening Visage). However, you can still be resurrected or reincarnated if you are willing.

Good day all,

First real post on here and I’m excited to share the power reserve version of the Seiko Presage Starlight limited edition. Recently I saw the non-power reserve version on here and loved it. Initial search showed everyone was sold out but thanks to u/thenightislight for pointing me to watches88. Initially I was also disappointed to find the Sakura version in stock and further disappointed when they emailed back saying they are unlikely to get any in stock. On a whim I checked a couple of days later and there it was!

Now on to the watch itself. This is my first Seiko and I am in awe of what they are able to do for the price point. The photos do no justice to the dial. It’s mesmerizing. The watch wears surprisingly small for such a tall watch. The only thing is the band. Not the biggest fan of the croc print (this is the international version) so will most likely change that out to a smooth skin band (any suggestions?) very soon.

My daily is a Christopher Ward C60 Pro so it will be great to add this to the rotation.

I have been trying to get to 100% recently but have been slowed down various infant related duties so I don’t have a ton of time to build a perfect settlement.

I have tried making the pads and using companions to fight and flipping the siren right away. No cheevo

I tried making a special stadium with seating and getting other settlers seated before opening the arena. No cheevo.

I even tried doing it at a raider camp. No cheevo.

I feel like part of my problem is that I have too few settlers actually in the settlement. Many of my attempts, with the exception of the raider camp, have occurred at starlight with around 7 settlers total. Many of the video guides I have seen seem to have 21 settlers. I also recently saw that I might have been using the quitting time siren out of order so I might try that as well. Previously I had been doing ring bell to gather, assign to pads, quitting time.

Any tips or tricks you guys have would be much appreciated.

Greeting~
I have played this game for two months.
There’s my hero deck and I saved resource from the start.
Now I have 85 scrolls (could go 100+ if diamond is counted) and 55 orbs.
I will save orbs to 120 but I want to know should I use scrolls tomorrow?
Because gathering 550 scrolls is really a huge work.....
Another question is should I go fusion if no fusion event tomorrow?
I can make DH, Ormus, IB, Dominator and Starlight to 6-star.
I really want to upgrade my team but get no bonus without event.
Furthermore, should I try to use scrolls tomorrow to get Walter, Vesa for awakening them instead of Dominator, Starlight?

His mind suddenly lit the scene of his dream. He was in a house, seated at the table of a warm, dry kitchen. A gentle, comforting heat pulsed from the nearby stove, Diath didn't know exactly what was in it, but it smelled pleasant.

Gradually his mind filled in further detail. A room to his right with a modest couch, a shin height table with a flower vase atop partnered with it bloomed into view. The rooms themselves were cozy, the walls were clean and bright, the wood framework tidy and untarnished. Behind him, stairs lead to an unknown upper floor.

To his left, a happy little doorway, boots he recognized as his own sitting beside the frame.

The door latch suddenly clanked

&amp;nbsp;

Swinging the door open with her shoulder, Strix pushed into the house. Diath almost didn't recognize her. Her robes, they weren't moth-eaten, patchwork amalgams of different cloth. Instead, her robes were neat, clearly made for her, they hugged to her figure too well not to be. A large, thick almost blanket-like shawl cascaded around her shoulders and chest. Her hair was similarly changed, instead of a haphazard tangle of knots and sticks, it seemed done up. A large rear braid dominated the do, two smaller braids accompanying it by her temples. The rest of her hair was pulled back into an intricate bun that sat upon the beginning of the rear braid. Diath worried for a moment that Strix had been forced to dress up for something, but the air with which she shoved the door to it's side, and placed the bags she'd been carrying and Diath had ignored on the floor told Diath this was something she chose, she seemed comfortable.

&amp;nbsp;

""Ah, hello love. I hope you weren't lonely for too long."" She said to Diath briefly glimpsing him before removing her shawl and tossing it to him then turning her gaze downward to unfasten her boots.

Diath deftly caught the shawl on instinct and paused before folding it down to a neat square and placing it atop the table.

&amp;nbsp;

What was happening? This... This was lovely. Diath was unprepared for how kind his dream would be to him. He hoped it persisted.

&amp;nbsp;

""No, not at all. Though I am all the happier now that you're back."" Diath said lifting himself swiftly to his feet and striding over to Strix. Her face glowed, and she smiled wider and wider with each step Diath took toward her. Her hands reached out and took his own within them. Her eyes started hiding themselves beneath her smiling cheeks. She pulled on his hands, and he let himself be lowered to her face...

A beat pounded throughout the dreamscape. Details of the surroundings beaten off in motes of dust like a dirty carpet.

Another beat, louder, harder than the first, and the paired couch and table disintegrated.

Another.

The stairs, kitchen, and table were gone as well.

Diath hadn't noticed he turned to watch them go, confused, his gaze came back to Strix.

&amp;nbsp;

The braids at the side of her face lashed themselves around Diath's neck, squeezing tightly, his breath choked from his windpipe. The remaining braid reared up behind her head, now terminating in a vile maw of hairy teeth.

The face of his beloved, her lids now closed, rose level to his.

""We...""

Her eyes opened, the beautiful pale white of pure starlight replaced with empty blackness that without even the faintest detail, somehow contained every fear he'd ever felt.

""Will never...""

The snake-like braid hissed and tensed, ready to lunge forward.

""Be.""

And it's twisted hairy fangs, and silky smooth maw bit down on Diath's entire field of view in an instant.

_________________________________________________________

Diath's eyes flew open, his breathing was ragged and painful as though the braids were still clamping down on his throat. He was soaked with sweat, icy cold and thick.

And Strix was there to greet him, normal Strix, dirty, tattered robe-clad Strix. Her eyes were their usual starlight white, and full of concern.

""Diath, are you ok? Were you having a nightmare? You started choking, and grabbing at your throat. I tried to wake you up but you wouldn't open your eyes!""

Strix shook Diath's shoulders absentmindedly with nearly every word.

Taking in a deep breath of stale, lifeless air, Diath closed his eyes again to regain his composure.

&amp;nbsp;

Then a pair of dry, cracked lips meet his. Again.

&amp;nbsp;

And his eyes flew open. Again.

""Did it work? Like pinching someone awake right? That's what *YOU* said, right? Oh please, please don't be cursed!"" Strix's worry-filled eyes took up most of Diath's view.

""It- I'm ok Strix, it was just... a bad dream."" Diath said, scanning Strix's face hoping his words would ease its tension.

&amp;nbsp;

After a drawn out silence, Strix sighed, and the worry relaxed somewhat.

Strix turns away from Diath, and seats herself next to him. Diath feels her eyes still on him, and groans as he pulls himself up to sit as well.

&amp;nbsp;

Another quiet moment passes.

&amp;nbsp;

An alarmingly loud shriek escapes Strix suddenly.

""AAAAAGGGGHHH, I DID IT AGAIN! WHY?! *WHYYYY*!!!""

And then she's wriggling and thrashing on the ground, Diath, still too sleepy and shaken to do anything simply sits there, occasionally enduring a stray limb.

&amp;nbsp;

After minutes of thrashing Strix stood to her feet.

""I'm going to get breakfast. I'll bring you some back as well. You better eat it."" Strix demanded as she moved to the closed door of their room.

A moment later Diath was alone. He heard muffled voiced just barely beyond the door. When they stopped, Evelyn stepped into the room, gears steadily whirring.

""Let's talk, Diath. I'm under strix- UHHH, I mean, strict orders not to let you leave this room until you feel better."" Evelyn's blunder brought a weak smile to Diath's face.

In colors and forever


As something beautiful

My love for you is sunshine


In gold and sparkling hues


It lands on crests between my lips 


And tumbles onto you 

*


My love for you is starlight


That peeks from time to time


Through stormy clouds and blue-black nights


To try to ease your mind

*


My love for you is sparrows


That beat against their cage


And want to burst from in my chest


But shy from warm clichés 





*

My love for you is distance


That tightens at the close


Nervous words and confidence


That set my world aglow

England was predictably wet, covered in rain and disappointingly grey. The falling rain painted the windows of an Essex manor blurry and left only indistinguishable shapes that inhabited the world beyond. The red convertible- the roof always up, which made its owner confused as to why it was even in England- looked like a bizarre fuzzy triangle on the gravel driveway. The sun had left the country several days ago which, if you asked any of the local populace, was a natural part of a Britons lifestyle wherein the Sun hibernates for ninety-five percent of the year, only to return for those few days in the middle of Autumn before disappearing once more into oblivion. Or as some would like to call it: ‘The United States of America.’ Indeed the falling rain was a normal part of Britain. Throughout the local town persons chittered and scattered with their umbrellas up, unless they were one of the many who embraced with only a jacket and a hood.

In Braddock Manor sat the three children of James and Elizabeth Braddock, ignorant of the rain beyond their doorway as they sat on the sofa fawning over days long left behind.  Christmas had passed with a  hustle and bustle of extended family, and now the trio indulged themselves in Coronation Street and home movies. The living room was down a short flight of wooden stairs covered in the middle by carpet decorated with a simple striped pattern, the lines running lateral to the door. The sofas were old but comfortable and cared for, covered with an old threaded throw and several cushions that though long removed from softness, were not uncomfortable. The throws were there for the dog, Rudy, and the cushions for decor and comfort.

Laughter filled the room as the two brothers and their younger sister watched a tape of Jamie falling into a small swimming pool, wearing yellow rubber ducky armbands.

“I can’t believe you had those.” Spoke a dark haired woman absentmindedly. She looked as though she could be a model- and she was. She was slim figured but she looked after herself carefully. Here she wore an oversized sweater with drunk Reindeer printed on it. She had her legs tucked up in front of her, hands wrapped around a mug of tea. Her older brother- the very eldest- chuckled in response.

“Hey, I spared you from such a fate. You owe me one.” Jamie responded, grinning. He  soon caught a cushion to the face, eliciting a real laugh from the blond sat to their right on the  armchair. “I like to think I’m the one responsible for your modelling career.”

“And now I’m fairly certain Betsy makes more money than the two of us combined, Jamie.” Brian told him, laughing.

“I’ll make no comment.” Betsy smirked, picking up a cup of tea, 

“We’ll see how long that lasts, *Doctor* Braddock.” Jamie remarked, looking pointedly at the blonde man. 

“I’m not a Doctor… Yet.”

A shadow moved at the top of the stairs, where an older man with a pencil thin moustache and balding hair, left only at the sides and back of his head stood. He raised a brow pointedly, looking towards the television and then back to them. 

“Master Brian. You have a visitor.” He spoke. 

“I do?” Brian asked, glancing up from his placement upon the sofa. It was at this point he noticed a redheaded woman walking down the steps from where she hadn’t been before. She wore a long green dress with a corset keeping it in place, and a large ruffled cape of black feathers upon her shoulders and neckline. A blackbird- Brian wasn’t sure which- was perched upon her arm, extended out slightly. However the most striking part of her wasn’t the red hair nor the large claymore at her side. It was the pale white of her eyes, that borderline glowed as she stared at him unwavering. Brian rose carefully from his seat and stared at her.

“Brian Braddock, the blood of your ancestors calls your name. You have a great duty to perform for these lands and the threats to their livelihood.” The woman’s voice was not single, Brian could identify three separate voices all speaking in unison, and he wasn’t sure if there were more beyond it. Betsy peered up and Jamie shifted his entire body to the right to get a better look at the woman.

“Sorry- But who are you?” Jamie asked, raising his right brow in confusion and annoyance at the arrival and cryptic messages of their uninvited guest.

“I am The Morrigan.”

---

**Some time (if one assumes time is linear) earlier**

“It is time that Earth found a new protector.”

“And which Earth are we speaking of?” Replied The Morrigan, picking an apple from a tree above as they strode alongside a tall man. “Is it..?”

“That is the one.” The man replied, keeping stride alongside the warrior. He was a proud man, powerful and well aware of his limits. He had seen much in his time, a vast and limitless time that would end only when others sought to make it so.

“Then I suppose you are asking that I take the mantle, to seek out Braddock and ensure he follows along his typical fate?”

“Brian has no fate.”

“You confuse me.”

“When James Braddock, Brian’s father, departed from Avalon, he was split across the Multiverse. The Starlight Citadel is a beacon across the Multiverse, as you know, and so his leaving promoted a new and intriguing circumstance.”

“I am aware, I live within this realm.”

“Ahh… But are you aware that Avalon is singular? It, unlike the Starlight Citadel, does not occupy a single point across the fabric of the Multiverse. There is only one of you, though there are many.”

“I know of my theology.”

“You misunderstand. I do not speak of myth and legend, I speak of the nature of a balancing upon scales higher than you or I. Our place is to look across, never up.”

“And so when I come to ensure Brian becomes… What do they typically mantle themselves within other worlds?”

“Captain Britain.”

“Captain Britain, right.” She responds. “Why do you not seek him personally?”

“Because sometimes change is valuable. This Brian is not linked solely to Arthur. He is Éireannach, Alba, Cymraeg, Kernowek… He is that which has been a foundry of Britain since time immemorial, since the Romans were a speck and not even considered to be a remote possibility. Through him a great power stems, a different power. And you shall be the one to bring it out of him. He will go through trials, and tribulations. He will meet those who wish to aid, and those wish to do harm. He shall toil with gods and monsters, man and machine. And all shall come to know his might…”

“And what shall his name be?”

“His name… His name shall be **CAPTEINIAID ALBION!**

---

“The Morrigan?” Asked Jamie, creasing his brow as he stared at her. He knew the name, but he could not place it. It was of importance, this much he knew. He stared at her feet and trailed his eyes up her, pausing for a moment upon her chest before his eyes narrowed in contemplative thought. The Morrigan tilted her head, looking back at him and matching his inquisitive and confused look. She smiled then, and looked back to Brian.

“Allow me to explain in more detail. I am The Morrigan, Goddess of War for the Tuatha Dé Danann. Though you may not entirely believe such a notion, and truthfully I cannot fault you for such disbelief, for a woman claims to be someone of myth. But I am she. I have come here, now, to you, to ensure you fulfil your destiny. Before you there was your father, Captain Briton.”

The Braddocks stared at Morrigan for perhaps a second, before their three voices clamoured in a din of questions. Eventually The Morrigan whistled sharply, silencing them so that she could speak further. “Yes. Your father was Captain Briton, until his death.”

Brian glanced out of the window, and then back to her. “Bloody hell, how did we never know?”

“That is not a question I have the answer to, Brian.”

“So… What next?”

“You are to follow within his footsteps. Your father did more than protect Britain. He protected these islands from threats abroad and beyond this reality, challenging man and monster.”

“I am to become Captain Briton like my father?”

“No. You are to become something new, something more deeply connected with these lands than that of your predecessors. You are to become Capteiniad Albion, spirit of the Ancient Britons.”

The Morrigan reached for the hilt of her blade, pulling it free of its scabbard and holding it within her hands by the tip of the hilt. She held it steady, and then tapped the floor. There was a sudden whirlwind of blackbirds through the room, ghostly apparitions of smoke and feathers. They consumed all the space within and then they were gone just as soon as they arrived, leaving no trace of their existence. The Morrigan smiled to herself as Jamie and Betsy ducked behind cover, with Brian far too focused on her to move. As the tide of corvids washed over him, his attire changed. Gone were Brian’s jeans and sweater, replaced by white spandex. As Brian glanced to his arms, the rest of the costume materialised, the colours on his inner arms and legs turning to red and blue. A mask wrapped around his head, covering his eyes and leaving his mouth visible, hair spilling out over the top. A gold lion appeared upon his chest, laying down and staring out at whomever stands before Brian. The lion roared loudly crossed its front legs and then stilled. Next came brown boots made of fur and leather, with leather braces fastened by metal pins taking place upon his lower arm. A cape of feathers akin to The Morrigan’s own descends down his back, unfurling from nonexistence. Fastened beneath it and across his chest came a green tartan material, folding over his left shoulder and forming a sort of skirt-like look pinned by a belt with the Union Jack carved within the bronze. He flexed his hand out and then shut it, clamping down on the grip of a bow, long and tapered, with the string bound tightly to each end of it.

“This is a gift from myself. There shall soon be more, as tradition desires. But you represent a parlour now of Avalon, where lay the immortals of Kernow to Alba, and of Tír na nÓg, where lie the Tuatha Dé Danann and those who have come before and after. Come, we must meet with Goibhniu. He has crafted two items for your use. However the choice, ultimately, is yours.”

The Morrigan turned and stepped into nonexistence, Brian did the same without thought, and both stepped into the Otherworld.

---

Brian balked at the strange landscape that surrounded him. It felt like a depiction from within a fantasy novel, rolling green grass in varying shades, with a light mist making its way up from the coastline. The sea was a deep dark blue, pleasantly so. This world felt clean, loved, cared for. Brian looked to The Morrigan, who stood beside him, whispering to her blackbird before throwing it to the air above. It soared away, caught by air currents unseen.

“This is Tír na nÓg, a land of youth. It is part of the Otherworld, an aspect of it born from old Éireann. It is where I, and others, came to when our time to leave Éireann was upon us.” The Morrigan responded, casting a look to him. She moved then, stepping along the pure green grass towards a large wall of wooden pillars, placed side by side. Brian could tell it was a circle, but he wasn’t sure of the scale of it. He followed The Morrigan, watching as it grew in size. The wooden pillars were dug into a mound, with a grass covered pit around that, likely where the ground had been dug from. Surrounding the strange fort were varying livestock and crops, with persons working them. Within the wall, Brian could make out thatched round roofs, with a hole where the point shall be. The Morrigan lead him towards a small gap in the wall, where a fence stood with a guard beside it, staring down at them.

“I have come to speak with Goibhniu. It is of highest priority.”

Brian became aware that The Morrigan wasn’t speaking English. Rather what sounded similar to Gaelic, but old and unforgiving on those who didn’t know it. He found he could understand her with clarity, despite the knowledge he shouldn’t. The man behind the gate glared at Brian for a moment, before opening it. The Morrigan walked through the wood, twigs laden over and under one another in a crosshatch sort of pattern. Now within the rath, as his subconscious told him, he could see it for the size it truly was. It was as large as a football stadium, but with a strange shape that matched the hill, neither circular nor square. The center was filled with a large stone building, half-laden with wooden walls and topped with a thatched roof. Smoke drifted from the top of it, and metal sounds rang hollow. The people within the Rath watched them walk towards it, and followed behind in quiet chatter.

Within the large building stood three men at varying workstations, the tallest of which was a dark haired man holding a large two handed hammer, a flat circular disc at the head, the opposite side a curled point, with a rams horn affixed to it. He brought it down, hammering it against a blade. He was barrel chested, with thick curling hair covered his torso. Black dirt coated his features, and his eyes were ablaze with focus. The Morrigan waited in silence, the light casting a shadow against the top of her face, the ghostly white glow of her eyes even more prominent. Behind the man at the anvil stood a shorter blonde man, as wide as an oxen. He was tending to finer crafts within the background, and the third man within the roundhouse was redheaded. He was not as wide or as tall as the others, but he looked cold and calculating. He was engraving a design into a shield.

“Goibhniu.” The Morrigan spoke. “I have brought him.”

Goibhniu looked up, stared deeply at Brian and nodded slowly in admiration. “He’s a strong looking lad. Wide, sturdy. You choose well.”

“It was not my choice. It is fate.”

“Fate is illusory.”

The Morrigan raised a brow. “Regardless of our beliefs, he is here to make his choice.”

“Of course.” Goibhniu responded, calling out to his brothers. His brothers glanced over, and then picked up a large chest, taking hold of a rope at each end. They brought it towards Brian, placing it upon a sturdy table. Brian reached out, uncoupling the latch on the front of it, lifting the heavy lid and folding it back. He was immediately dazzled by an amulet, a rounded-square shaped red stone embedded in gold, slightly larger than the palm of his hand. It was pinned to the inside of the lid, fastened down by a cloth band. Below it, atop a stand, was a long silver blade with a simple golden hilt, ending in a sphere. Brian looked between them, and then up to Goibhniu.

“Which do you choose? The Amulet of Right? Or the Sword of Might?”

Brian looked back down, reached into the chest and clasps the hilt tightly. He lifted the blade, holding the point of it up by the tip of his index finger. Goibhniu nodded, and closed the lid as gently as it arose. The Morrigan put her hand onto Brian’s shoulder, and soon he returned to his home. There, Betsy and Jamie peeked over the sofa towards him, while their manservant simply watched from atop the stairs.

“Brian? What just happened?”

Brian looked down at his sweater and raises both his brows, concerned and confused. He was apparently now a hero of the British Isles, tasked by a Celtic goddess and her colleagues with protecting the land from threats.

“I’m not entirely certain. I think I need a drink.”

“I shall go and bring you one.” Muttered the servant, climbing the stairs again and walking towards the kitchen across a long wooden hall.

 ---

Brian stared at the ceiling in his room and reflected on the days events. He had been to work at Thames University, delivering a lecturer on Quantum Physics and now… Now he was a superhero, entering into the ranks alongside his father and Captain America. He was Capteiniaid Albion- though he would have preferred the name Captain Britain. He had a sword, a costume… His new life began now, and it began strangely to be certain. He ran a hand into his hair and sighed in quiet. He stirred and sat upright.

And found The Morrigan standing at the foot of his bed.

“You are required in London.”

Brian made a loud ‘Gauhh’ sound and jumped slightly in surprise. He held a finger up to her, pinching the bridge of his nose in his other hand. She cocked a brow, staring down at him.

“In London? What’s happening in London?”

“A man seeks an item of power, he cannot be allowed to obtain it.”

“Why can’t you stop him?” He asked, confused.

“It is not our place to do so.” She responded, confusing him further.

Brian looked at her with a mixture of disappointment and annoyance, but threw his hands up regardless and sighed. “Alright. I’ll go and deal with it then.”

The Morrigan nodded her head, and stepped back into nonexistence. Brian rose from his bed and looked at himself in the mirror, scratching his jawline. “Wait… How do I..?”
He thought trying to work out if his redheaded friend had informed him on how to switch into gear, but found she had not as far as he could remember. “Open Sesame? By the Power of Grayskull! SHAZAM!”

“Oh for heavens sake.” Brian muttered, dragging his hands down his face and feeling the spandex against it. He didn’t understand how this costume worked, and he sensed it would be his downfall. He pinched the bridge of his nose and concentrated hard, willing the spandex and tartan into existence. He opened his eyes looking into the mirror to check if he had succeeded, and was pleasantly surprised to see that he had in fact, changed. With this new and life changing experience under his belt, Brian walked out onto his balcony, and leapt over the railing.

And into the pool.

 The splash was loud, and caught the attention of Betsy, quietly reading in her room. She opened her window, and leant out of it to look down at a soggy Brian as he clambered from the side of the pool. “Are you okay?”

“Quite. Just getting used to this. I thought I might be able to fly. The guy in New York with the gold helmet makes it look so easy.”

“His helmet is black now.”

Brian looked to her, sighed, and shrugged. “I don’t know how people keep up.”

“Very easily.” Betsy winks.

He looked at her boredly and jumped. Brian would later recount on how firing into the clouds wasn’t the most joyous experience one could have, and that it’s a rather terrifying facet. But he would find his way to London regardless, honing in on the sirens in Kensington. As he tore across the sky, he grinned at the rippling cape behind, feeling it pull slightly. Perhaps this is how Superman felt... He landed, awkwardly, losing his balance and taking a few needless steps forwards, but he came to a halt among a field of dead men and women in simple security gear with ‘MI-13’ across their chests. The building before him was a large brick and mortar building, constructed after the second world war, when London was ripped apart in the Blitz. A large steel door had been forced open, and a strange smell lingered, one that Brian couldn’t put his finger on. He stepped into the building, and followed the bodies.

Some of the bodies were maimed and cut, or filled with what seemed to be bullet holes. But many of them had seemingly and simply keeled over, killed by some unknown force. A selection of voices echoed ahead, and he quickly moved into a large space filled with crates stacked atop one another, holding what, he wasn’t sure. Brian peeked over a small tower, and stared at a small selection of men and and women in bizarre green uniform. In the middle of them stood a bald headed man, with scars that that looked like cracks across his features. One of his eyes was red, like a piece of glass moulded to the shape of his face, an epicenter of the scarring.

He pushed a crate over and allowed the wood to splinter, watching the contents spill onto the floor in search of an item of value. Brian watched them carefully, trying to discern what they were searching for. Or even how best to handle the situation.

“Keep searching.” The man spoke, his accent was German. Brian didn’t know which part of Germany, but that wasn’t particularly important in this moment.

“Yes Sir.” One of the women responded, taking a crowbar to a crate and tearing the side off. Brian noticed movement beyond her, and he came to the realisation it was another member of security.

“Hands in the air!” The woman shouted at the interceding group, aiming down the sights of a submachine gun at the scarred man and his loyal goons.

The scarred man looked to her, and he smiled grimly. The woman began to lose her focus, arm struggling to hold up the weapon in her hand. Brian watched in wide eyed confusion, trying to discern the situation. There was a scream of bullets from the weapon, shredding into crates and one of the green uniformed men, dropping them like a sack. Strucker tilted their head, sighing irritably as a bullet bounced off his forehead. The two men beside him looked down to their friend, and then to the very much recently deceased corpse of the guard. As they bent down to pick him up, one of the men in green looked right at Brian, and Brian stared back.

“Excuse me, sir?”

“What is it?”

“There’s someone else.”

The scarred man turned on his heel and looked at Brian. He growled, and pointed to a pair of larger men. “You two. Keep searching. I’ll enjoy myself with this one.”

The Capteiniaid stepped out from behind the crate and closed the gap quickly, launching a right hook that caught the henchwoman round the face and knocking him cold in an instant. He rounded on the next person, ducking a blow and launching an uppcercut that sent him to darkness. He moved to the scarred man immediately, and took a sword point to the cheek for his troubles. The sword bounced off of him like armour, and the man narrowed his eyes, slicing at Brian for a second time, his sword blocked by the one Brian had chosen earlier in the day at the blacksmiths roundhouse. The blades clashed and sparks flew.

“A swordsman. I am in need of practice.”

“It might be the last you get for a while.” Brian threatened, kicking out at the mans stomach. The man fell back, away from the leg and surged forwards again, trying to impale Brian, the tip of his rapier meeting the barrier around Brian’s body. It strained to break it, and was whipped away as Brian brought his sword up from his right hip to cut into the scarred man, colliding with their shoulder, cutting through the material and failing to draw blood. The man laughed once, and shoulder-checked Brian, sending him off balance and dropping him to the floor. The man strode forwards, swivelling the blade and bearing it down to slice Brian from neck to crotch. Brian raised his sword in front of him, blocking the attempt. Brian kicked, foot connecting with his foes shin.

“Enough.” The man barked, backing away from Brian.

*Feeling weaker…* Brian remarked silently. *Can barely move my legs… But I must!*

He raises his sword again and surged towards the German, impractical knowledge causing him to bring his sword up to their crotch. The blow is blocked, and the man slams his head into Brian’s. 

“Stay down.” He warned.

“We’ve found it, sir.”

The man turned from Brian, placing the sword back onto his hip as he walked towards the crates, pushing his weight into them and sending them cascading to the floor. He kicked several objects away from the cluster of debris, and smiled grimly as he lifted up a large red gauntlet, the fingertips ending in sharp points. He held it up to the light, and placed his hand within it.

“Finally… After all this time, we are reunited.”

He turned, just in time to see Brian’s sword swinging for his neck. It dug in, drawing a huge gap of blood. There was a resounding bounce from the blade, and a single touch from the claw sent Brian flying backwards into a nest of crates, electricity crackling in the ever increasing space between them. The boxes cracked beneath Brian’s weight.

“Before I die.” The man started, walking over and planting his boot on Brian’s chest. “I want you to know my name.”

“Fuck you.” Brian remarked, coughing the words out.

“Baron Wolfgang Von-”

“STRUCKER.” A man shouted from across the room. Brian looked over, eyes struggling to remain open. He watched a disc fly through the air, colliding with Strucker and and firing him away like a pinball, bouncing away from them and colliding with the remaining two minions. The effects were the same, the pair flying away from one another as the shield bounced. Strucker hit the floor and rolled, splaying his palm and firing something, a large calibre bullet Brian guessed, by the loud ‘CHK CHK CHK CHK’ noise it made. The man caught the shield and charged towards Strucker, holding it up before him and roaring.

“YER CAN’T STOP CAPTAIN MIDLANDS.” The man, supposedly Captain Midlands, responded. He collided with Strucker, and they fell to the ground.

“This isn’t over.” He stated, before vanishing from the room, claw and all.

The man placed the shield onto his back and stepped towards Brian, looking down at him. He wore a more contemporary helmet and uniform covered in camouflage, face masked by a green material that left only his eyes and the lower half of his face visible, with a chin strap to hold it all together. He chuckled to himself, and then Brian met darkness.

I can't help but feel like the 3D models used in the Love Live! franchise look... Dead. 

If I go back to the ""Natsuiro egao de 1,2 Jump!"" MV (PV https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz6OX8cYUFA ), the animation was of course quite crude and with very low fps, but the models had more heart in them. The movements (apart from the insane jumping) had such nice energy.
Seasons came, then a movie and then Aqours rolled by, and the 3D models were getting better. The movement slowed down and it felt more computer generated, but the faces looked good. The expressions are good enough to keep you engaged and happily far from uncanny valley robots. I thought it was all up from there!
Example: Happy Party train (PV https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0QdD_-f-UE )


But then... After School Activity came out. 
What happened? Why did it happen? Who is in charge of this?
The look and move so robotic. The faces are flat as pancakes, the eyes are DEAD, and their singing mouths/expression are a joke. There is no energy in their dancing... It is hard to be happy and excited seeing my favorite girls again with these models. Some songs are of course better/worse than others, and they have indeed gotten better since it came out, but they aren't cutting it. They lost the spark.
Makes me very worried about the incoming All Stars app. 
Example (Soldier Game) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-v8ufVLQruk
Example (aqours) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyaOVvUXWKk

I would not be so salty about it if other franchises did not have superior 3D animation. 
I am not talking about the series being better or worse, just the models, their movements and expression.

""Idolm@ster: Cinderella Girls Starlight Stage"" is a free mobile game and has much more engaging models/animation.
Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXQHlTTP9q0

""Idolm@ster: Million Live! Theater days"" is another free mobile game with simpler character interpretations (Cinderella has softer and more intricate shading), but does not fall behind with their MVs either.
Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Weo5KH3UFwA

""Pretty Cure: A la mode"" ED. THIS. THIS is so beautiful. I couldn't care less about Precure but THIS is SO nice to look at. So fluid, so authentic, you can feel what they are feeling, it's just SO good it makes me angry. I never thought I'd see the day where I would rather watch this than 2D animation. It's just THAT good. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFfsTeExwbQ

""Precure All Stars New Stage: Mirai no Tomodachi - Yay! Yay! Yay! "" This one is from 2012 (or at least the upload is). That is six years ago, and it still makes After School Activities eat their dust.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnWpywSGTJU

This one is also Precure, 2013. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LBHe7gtCv8

""Tsukipro: The animation"". They aren't that good in face expressions, but the body language is very nice and sharp. Warning: they are men (yuk! Haha no offense)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBTYShgD7VQ


What is Love Live!'s excuse? They obviously have enough money to bump it up; they are everywhere! Merchandise, music... everything and anything is Love Live!, and it is not coming even close to a stop. 
Are they that greedy? Did they realize the fanbase will just buy everything they spew out at this point, no matter how little effort they put in?

I find myself getting less and less into Love Live! as time goes by. The models, this ugly ass artist (I refuse to go the cafe again until they take their wretched ""art"" out, this guy needs to be fired. Dia and Yoshiko are the ones he butchers the most hhttp://sega-collabocafe.com/images/sunshine05/key.png  One of his worst offenses is this Inferno Phoenix spread http://lovelive-sunshine.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1498737999-033b9df394df1da6cbacf640b31a8b1c.jpg Just revolting), the whole second half of season 2 of Sunshine (This is going to be quite a long rant: [Spoiler]The series DIED after miracle wave imo. That one episode were Chika was trying really hard to do the super mega flip was fun and I enjoyed it, but the ones that followed got draggier and draggier. Half of the season is about how they wanted to save the school but couldn't. They didn't even feel like going to the LOVE LIVE after that, but I couldn't connect with that frustration. When they didn't get to save the school, I just couldn't care. I wanted to care, but it was just meh. They kept staring at that the number, and it was so obvious that they were NOT going to get enough people. They didn't, boohoo. The pacing was awkward and off, the drama was forced, I couldn't care less about their school closing. ""Awaken the power"" had NO reason to include EVERYBODY in it. Ruby &amp; Leah made the song for their sisters. You may add Sarah and Dia, but the rest of aqours??? why??? how??? What!? It makes no sense and it only hurts the plot of that episode.
 Water Blue New world is the least memorable song I ever heard. It's a bunch of nothing. The outfits are ugly (that one-sleeve in You? ugh), and the song is just building up and building up and then... It's over, and that's it. The final episode doesn't even feel like a final episode. They are like ""we won, we are such mature people now, let's close doors of this school nobody cares about, bye. Oh, also, you know these people who should be accross the world? They are here now for NO REASON haha, they are ruining their career choices for a song! The end, watch our movie and buy our blu-ray"". The worst thing about this season is how every character became a bland washed-out meme version of themselves. Chika: ""WAKARANAI, BUT I WILL TRY. I TRY A LOT"", Riko: ""I hate dogs! Come here doggy! Don't look at my gay books!"". Yoshiko only says ""Yohane"". Hanamaru, more like zura zura zura eating zura zura. Ruby: PIGGYAAA, GANBARUBY. Kanan: *locks hands behind head*. Mari: SHINY! Random English!! . Dia: BU-BU-EVERYTHING. You: YOUSORO YOUSORO-I NOT-SO-SECRETLY LIKE CHIKA-YOUSORO!!. Their personalities stayed back in Season 1 and never really made it that far into Second Season. Oh, and let's not talk about how they started pushing ships. I do not like shipping, but I could make it through all of μ's, the movie and LL!SS! S1 watching the series and thinking ""yeah, people who are not romantically into one another would act like this as well. I actually see myself  (a female) acting like this among my (female) friends without it being weird! Except the boob grabbing, of course"". This season, however, has everybody getting their hands held tight, and smiling at each other super awkwardly... ??? Who acts like that??? The first 6 episodes were somehow fun to watch, but they were already so washed out and trying SO hard to BE the characters they were in the first season... I tuned in every week to watch them, but from episodes 7+ I was just waiting for it to be over. I really wanted to like this second season, specially after how great μ's season 2 was, but I was and still am beyond disappointed. I mean, just remembering how strongly I felt about μ's breaking up almost makes me cry. The final episodes of Love Live! S2 were so touching, I want to go back and watch it all again. Sunshine S2 is something I wish would disappear from my memory so I could return to the opinions and enjoyment I had of the characters before this trainwreck.[/spoiler]) ... I love the designs for the All Star girls, but I am afraid they might ruin them with a bland story, lackluster CGI and deformed illustrations. Let's hope I am wrong and All Stars will bring the spark back. I really -really really really- WANT to be wrong. I want All Stars to be GREAT, but I can't seem to get my hopes up.

***Chapter 4: Stories at Midnight***

“Jack? Why aren’t you sleeping? What are you doing up here?”

The human, lying on his back on the roof of their home, didn’t even turn his head to look at her. “Looking at the stars.”

Dawn looked up. Some of the sky was visible through the trees, but not nearly enough for stargazing. She looked back at Jack. For some reason, he didn’t look right. His hands were behind his head, one of his legs was bent at the knee so that the foot was flat on the roof of the ruined ship. He wasn’t wearing his usual shirt, but it was still warm in the night. She could see the starlight reflecting off of metallic specks in his skin.

More curious than she could stand, she climbed the rest of the way on the roof. Walking toward the prone human, she could finally see why he looked so odd. 

He wasn’t smiling.

It happened, every now and then. A tool would break, or he would miss a shot with the bow, or some other thing would cause his upturned mouth to become downturned. But every time his smile fell, it never really went away. It was in his eyes, or how he held his head. Without fail, the smile would come back quickly, with some comment or joke. It was so odd to see the smile she had grown used to seeing just... nowhere.

She dropped to all fours, padded over to the human, and lay down next to him. For a long while, she couldn’t think of what to say. What do you say to a pensive human?

“You know...” Jack said, without prompting. He stopped. He didn’t move; his gaze was still locked somewhere far away.

“You know, I never get tired of the stars. I’ve seen the night on... maybe not hundreds of worlds, but many more than most. I’ve seen the night sky through the haze of war, the clarity of peace, the fog of confusion, and many other metaphorical and literal filters. But it’s never lost that pull, you know?”

Looking at the night, Dawn nodded. She had felt it too. It was the reason she jumped to leave Tax. Well, one of the reasons.

There was a quiet, comfortable silence. In the distance, the movement of a monstrous creature caused a tree to fall, but that was normal.

Dawn turned her head to the human. “Why are you really up here?”

Jack didn’t look away from the sky. “This is the longest I’ve spent on one world since I left Earth. Don’t panic like that, I’m not banished or anything. I just don’t spend that long on Earth when I visit. My feet start to itch. The space between the stars starts calling my name. That’s usually when I jump on a transport and find someplace else to be.”

Dawn’s curiosity was peaked. “How long do you normally spend on a planet?”

A corner of Jack’s mouth turned up, but Dawn couldn’t read it as a smile. It was a similar expression, but none of the emotion was there. “*Ferrishar*.”

The sleepy, almost bored air crystalized to one of extreme attentiveness. Jack just said a word in perfect Taxi. It meant ‘the wrong question was just asked’ or ‘you’re looking for the wrong answer’. It was a word with subtle implications that most Taxtil took a while to grasp and more still couldn’t use correctly.

Dawn opened her mouth, but Jack was already speaking. “You’ve asked me a lot of questions about humans. Honestly, I didn’t expect anything less. We’re practically legends. You win an intergalactic war and suddenly vanish, and people tend to view you as an oddity. My body, subspace, Codex. You’ve asked me a lot of questions. All but the one that matters.”

Jack turned his head. His smile was still missing, but there was something like kindness in his eyes. “I’ve told you how many times you went on a pirate ship. Every time the crash comes up I tell you about just how obvious that it was a pirate ship. And every time I bring up just how pirate-y the pirate ship full of pirates was, you don’t ask the question that should be begging at your mind.”

The question she should have asked was instantly in her head. Just like he said, it was so obvious. Slowly, letting each take it’s time to be spoken, she asked, “What were *you* doing on a pirate ship?”

The smile returned for a moment as a glimmer in Jack’s eyes. “I’ll tell you because you're going to hear it anyway, but it’ll be a long story. I’ll explain everything, so try not to interrupt, okay?”

Dawn could only think to nod. Jack nodded back at her and then turned back to the night sky. She saw his chest expand as he took a large breath and slowly exhaled.

“A long time ago, however long a couple hundred Earth years is, we went to war with the Kotqic. We know that they started it. It started as bandit activity, just attacking whatever came close. After a while, it became full-on pirate activity; Kotqic ships would seek out Human ships, civilian or otherwise, board, kill and pillage, then leave. Our diplomats tried to get the government to do anything, but there was always some reason, some excuse. It didn’t take long for even the diplomats to lose patience. They screamed, accused, demanded. The Kotqic took that as a declaration of war. Of course they did; they were just looking for a reason to go to war. They had been from the beginning.”

Jack paused to take another large breath.

“So we went to war. It really wasn’t anything to talk about until Halley-6. It was a garden world, mostly farmers and other workers. No real military, basically the equivalent of a knife in your shoe. Enough to protect, but not enough for a big fight. Not enough to stop a full invasion. We didn’t even think they would attack. Why would they? There was no tactical reason to do so. It wasn’t an advantageous position, no significant resources, and, again, it was full of civilians.”

This pause lasted multiple breaths. The words seemed to stick in his throat.

“They killed almost everyone. Bombed it from orbit, sent squads to take care of the rest. Two transport ships made it off of Halley-6.  No prisoners, two handfuls of survivors.”

The silence felt heavy, but Jack didn’t let it go on too long.

“There’s an old, old quote from a famous movie: ‘They send one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue’. It wasn’t said back in those meetings, but that was the feeling. We were looking for revenge. I think, personally, the Kotqic were looking for us to fight harder. They were always about combat and warfare. The strong survive and who cares about the rest. To that, we said ‘Fine.’ We suspended our rules of war. If they wanted to see how we fought unbound by honor or pride or decency, they would see just how violent Humans could be.

“Simply put, they weren’t prepared. They were used to sound tactics, restraint, and lethal weaponry. Our weapons and ships advanced by leaps and bounds over the years. Our tactics became more savage. They weren’t ready for suicide runs, weapons that would bounce around a bunker almost indefinitely, chemical weapons with a 99% infection rate, or orbital strikes that sunk continents. ”

The human took a heavy breath. Dawn turned on her side, hoping to see how Jack was feeling. There wasn’t anything on his face. None of the tics or movements that she had learned were there. The only clue to his feelings were his eyes. They were pointed at the sky, but they were looking at guilt and regret.

“We tore through them. Pushed them back to their homeworld. And then we glassed it.”

Dawn just barely stopped herself from recoiling in outright shock and disgust. She couldn’t stop the gasp from being audible.

“I know. I actually threw up when I heard that. It was just... too much, taken way too far. And once the war ended, once the bloodlust fell away and the red faded from our sight, we realized what we did. We finally listened to the people who wanted us to act... well, act like humans. But it was too late.

“There were more meetings. More debates. Finally, we made a decision. We asked our allies to not speak about what happened to end the war.  We holed up in our solar system. Sent a broad-spectrum message to anyone who approached: “No visitors. Go away.” I assume it was longer and more pleading, but you get the idea. We decided that we didn’t deserve the universe. We didn’t deserve the sky.

“Then, at least five or so generations later, the Steve ship crashed. No, that’s not a joke, or a name I gave them because I can’t pronounce their real name. They are called the Steve. It was our second first contact and it scared the shit out of both of us. Their ship was malfunctioning in a bad way, which caused them to appear out of subspace in Mars’ atmosphere. After some tense moments, we started talking. More Steve showed up and we kept talking. They made us realize something: we weren’t atoning for our sins. We were just wallowing in self-pity and grief. If we wanted to make it better, then we needed to *actually make it better*.”

The smile in his eyes tugged at the corners of his mouth as he continued: “Fast forward some more, to one of the most important times in human history: I was born. My life was pretty boring, except it quickly became apparent that I was at least a little good at everything I did. There was usually someone who could do it a little better, but I was at least competent at whatever I tried. It didn’t really matter much, until I finished school. I had choices, but for the life of me I couldn’t make a decision. I could have gone to higher education; there were some things that I was interested in, but nothing that I was passionate about. I could have gone into the workforce as a skilled laborer, but I knew there really wasn’t anything I could specialize in. I could have done x and y and z, but nothing looked interesting. So, I joined the military. I figured, hey, they would probably appreciate someone who could do basically anything.

“Turns out if you go into the military with experience in pretty much everything, you *do* everything. My days were spent bouncing around to whoever needed an extra pair of hands. I learned a lot about a lot of things, but my problem was the same: I was a generalist in a world that prefered specialists.

“One day, two men in neat, spotless suits approached me. They looked like they were from the intelligence department. It says a lot that we called them ‘Spooks’. They asked if I wanted to put my skills to good use. I gave them a glare, and said something like ‘what, *all* of them?’ And they said the strangest thing. They said, ‘Yes, *all* of them’. Now there really wasn’t a better way to spark my curiosity. I said ‘Sure’ and sealed my fate.

“They introduced me to a program they were starting. A select few were going to be given permission to leave the solar system for the first time in decades, at least. The exemplars of humanity. Not really the ‘best of the best’, but those few that really lived by what it means to be human. They chose me for my adaptability. They gave me my title, told me the whole history with the Kotqic, partnered me with Codex, and handed me a ticket to wherever I wanted to go. The trade off was that I was to do some missions if I was in the area and to generally do good things. We were going to be the heroes of the universe to clean our hands of the villainy of the past.”

The pause was much less heavy. Dawn had questions, almost as much as she had before Jack started speaking. But Jack wasn’t done.

“Recently, the humans have made motions to leave our self-imposed exile. We asked for support. Really, we were asking for friends. We’ve been living autonomously for how many years; we really didn’t need ‘support’. We needed allies. People to help us re-integrate with the rest of the universe. The universe has changed and we don’t know the new rules. We got some offers, but the Taxtil Empress Red Claws *herself* offered an alliance. Humans appreciate rulers that do things themselves, so we gave it special consideration. The more we considered it, the better it looked. We’re both humanoid, humans have some experience with felines, and we understood your culture. Several cultures in human history were warriors and poets, so the culture gap was shorter than you’d think. The Taxtil didn’t stand to gain anything more than we do, they aren’t planning any wars or power grabs, and we both stand to gain from a technological standpoint. A match made in heaven.

“I’m on a moon off of... somewhere, it doesn’t really matter. I get a call from Central. They say they have a mission for me. The Taxtil Empress is sending her daughter Dawn of Glory to sign the paperwork, as it were. I was to make sure she made it to Earth. Well, that just didn’t make sense. Why would the Taxtil Emprincess, or whatever the word is, need me to bodyguard her? Oh, because she turned down all honor guard, subspace transport, or anything to the otherwise.

“As I hear it, her Emprincessness wanted to make a name for herself. That phrase has a meaning to humans, but it means something much more literal for Taxtil, as you know. She was thinking that she could hop her way to Earth and somewhere along the way she would find her Name. Alright, that was certainly odd, but I can appreciate it. And then they made a point to say that under no circumstances, and I mean *no circumstances* not even the usual ones no not even for *that*, was she to know that I was following and protecting her. Apparently Central had made various promises and swore up and down that she would be free to come to Earth as the Fates, Destiny, and All That Jazz deemed. I was to follow and protect her in case the Fates weren’t playing fair.

“I could go into some of the things I had to do, but what really mattered was when she got on the pirate ship. I couldn’t pick her pocket again; the pirates didn’t care if she had a ticket. I didn’t have time to sabotage their ship. The only thing Codex or I could think of was to board as well. Which we did. Which, as an aside, technically makes the Human government a party to piracy, which gave both of us a good chuckle.

“And then the ship started to crash over this backwater, uncharted planet. And then,” He trailed off. He turned to look at Dawn, the smile back in his eyes. “Well, you know the rest.”

It took a minute of silence before Dawn could think to say anything. “So what you’re saying is that you *didn’t* crash the ship.”

Jack’s laugher almost shook the trees. Once he was able to breathe without chuckling and crying, Dawn had her next question. “You said they gave you a title. When you joined this program. What was it? I’d like to know your Name.”

“Ah."" Strangely, he looked awkward and uncomfortable. ""So you have to understand, I haven’t told anyone my name since before I joined the Jacks.”

“‘The Jacks’? That is the name of the organisation to which you belong? It shares your name?”

Jack slowly shook his head. “No, it’s more the other way around. My rank and title is ‘Jack of Wandering’. I’m a Jack, and I wander around. Everyone in the program is given the name Jack and a title about why they were chosen. It's from an old saying.”

He took in a breath. It almost seemed like saying his true Name would be harder than saying why the humans exiled themselves.

He breathed out, reserving just enough air to say, “My name is Jonas.""

She smiled at Jonas. “Greetings Jonas, the Jack of Wandering. I am Dawn of Glory, daughter of Empress Red Claws. Thank you for looking out for me.”

Jonas smiled from his mouth to his eyes. “Anytime, Dawn. Good to meet you too.”

“I’m going to still call you Jack.”

“I’m okay with that. I wasn’t planning on calling you Dawn of Glory anytime soon.”

She moved his arm and laid down next to his body, using the arm as a pillow. For a timeless moment, they stared at the stars. Nothing more needed to be said.

Without prompting, Dawn giggled. Jack raised his head in an unasked question. A smirk on her face, she answered, “No, it’s nothing. I’m just not sure I can picture you angry. I was stunned enough to see you not smiling. Almost makes me want to see it, if only once.”

He didn’t laugh with her. He simply set his head back down on the roof of the ship. “We have a saying about that: be careful what you wish for, you just might get it.”

Aw, that's nice. Calm, peaceful conversation/exposition dumping. Some secrets revealed, and two people becoming closer together. It's nice.

Whelp, keep an eye out for Chapter 5: **""Kill Me.""**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGih0bGyLoc


Text from video:


In a small cluster of trees,  
each branch a trapeze,  
the slowest acrobat show,  
ten still foxes in a row.


Does it bring you unease  
that these bearers of disease  
are more useful than bees  
at giving us flowers?  
Panting,  
they sleep through daylight hours.


A rhythmic beat,  
works against the heat,  
Commonwealth Park’s furry heartbeat.


In sync,  
they dance around a skating rink,  
kissing it,  
in an indelible drink.


As the first one flew,  
the lust grew,  
to disappear into a golden hue.  
The others said ""after you"".


The sun began to set,  
the time was right to run from threat.  
At light's last hour,  
they relocate to Telstra Tower.


A single bat leads the sky,  
he’s the bravest guy,  
the rest follow suit,  
in pursuit of nectar and fruit.  
An orange collar on a grey suit,  
one thousand bats  
fly en route.


Their blackness against the moonlight,  
the darkest starlight.  
They twinkle to their campsite,  
and will return at first light.

“I *see* it,” she affirmed with a thoughtless whisper. “Or I can picture it, at least. The shimmering path, the bridge that always bends away from our eyes… It starts here, doesn’t it?”

Her hand touched the tree bark and left it just as quickly, for fear that it might begin to splinter. It had been here as long as House Celtigar had, and though it was a magnificent sight, the edges of the bark were as sharp as a razor. She felt her little nightingale take wing from her shoulder, bringing her attention back to the task at hand. Her brothers, even Aerion, had been ignoring the smallfolk populace along the docks for quite some time. But someone had to look after them, even if there were so-called “important matters” to attend to. Besides, she could certainly use the distraction from the news she’d received earlier in the morning.

*What’s so important that you can’t foster good relations with your own subjects?*

Her family had always called it the Hestian, but the smallfolk simply referred to it as the Cauldron of Good Faith. It was a great hearth that burned in the common building at the center of Claw Isle’s docks. It had been alight for nigh on two hundred years, a flame that House Celtigar swore would never be extinguished. The first Lord Celtigar had decreed it would represent the eternal bonds and unity between his family and those who served them. And while it had remained aflame for one hundred and ninety five years, the future Lords Celtigar had little influence over that. Their servants did almost all the work in maintaining the flame. 

Vaelyra had brought a bundle of firewood with her, hoping to show the commoners that at least *one* Celtigar still thought about them from time to time. But when she arrived at the Hestian, there wasn’t a single soul in sight. *Not even a barmaid or a lonely whore.* Even though it was a new moon on a cold autumn evening, it seemed that the people of Claw Isle were more than comfortable sheltering in their divided streets and sects. The sight saddened her, but she recalled that the absence of the moon meant half of them must have been off engaging in their hymns and sacrifices. *And those who aren’t partaking are afraid that they’ll be forced to.* With a glum look on her face, she tended to the fire before bolting back to the keep as though the docks were flooding behind her.

When she left, she didn’t even have a destination in her mind other than *away*. Away from all the restlessness and agitation that Lucael has caused. *This Church continues even after one of its priests was hanged, and he seems to be doing nothing about it. But neither do they. Are they truly all so alright with this? Has half the island forsaken the religions they were raised on in favor of esoteric foreign worship?* The consideration bothered her more than she could say. But for the most fleeting of moments, she was almost able to forget about it.

Somehow, without any thought or intention to do so, she’d ended up in the library. Aerion, the one person who’d actually given a whit about her thoughts and feelings over the past few years, sat by a shelf mulling over several thick, dusty volumes. *No doubt he got the news as well.* Still, something odd overcame her whenever she looked at her youngest stepbrother’s face. They rarely spoke to one another, they didn’t even share any blood, but they shared a peculiar sort of understanding. Of all the Celtigar siblings, they were the two outcasts; one the rebellious youth who was cursed to live in not one, but three brothers’ shadows, and the other the spawn of a foreign couple that had absolutely nothing to do with Claw Isle until twenty years ago. For better or worse, they’d found a kinship in their isolation from the rest of the family. And maybe it was all a pretty contrivation in her mind, but she always felt a deeper kind of love for him than for the rest of her family. One that felt so familiar, it was as though it had been alive for longer than they had been.

He looked up with tired eyes as the sound of her shuffling feet came to a stop. In that moment, time felt like it stopped for a breath. She thought of how her family had never been truly together, not since what had happened with their father. And with the business of the Church, she realized that the rift between brother, sister, mother, and uncle would only continue to widen. 

And there was nothing she could do about it.

Aerion set down the page he was reading and stood up in silence, a look almost as somber as her own. He knew what she was thinking, or at least, what she was feeling. She slid over near the shelf and into his arms, her tears beginning to wet the ink-black fabric of his doublet’s right shoulder. “Why does it have to be like this?” She cried. “Why are we falling apart at the seams? Why are they sacrificing human bloody lives? What could make them so...” After a long moment, she reached a hand up and clutched desperately behind his back. Even if she sounded childish, she didn’t care; what was going on, all the darkness and blood that had come to the Isle… It made no sense. It certainly wasn’t fair, and she could feel the place she once called home slipping away like rain off a wing. The same land might be underneath her feet, but it wasn’t the same people she had to look in the eye every day. Lewyn and Arlan had gone off to play politics in the capital, her sister was having the time of her life at Princess Daenerys’ side, her mother and Caedmon hardly left their chambers on any given day, and she had to sit back and watch the very foundation of House Celtigar twist and crumble under its new Lord’s hands. *But Aerion didn’t change. No, he’ll never forsake the past.*

Though he couldn’t fix anything on his own, his embrace was at least some semblance of respite from the grim caliginosity that was Claw Isle’s present state. She couldn’t forget the stench of corruption, nor the sight of pliable and thick-skulled fanatics that used to be devout followers of the Seven and the Old Gods. But she could at least remember that not everyone on the island followed the spiritless masses.

“I’m sorry,” were the first words out of Aerion’s mouth. He spoke them as though it was all his fault. “I know how you’re feeling. Everything is just…” He gently slid his hand up and down her back to console her, sighing out of his own despondence. “*Off*. Compared to before. Before father had to be put down, I mean. It’s like the world turned around and decided it didn’t like its own reflection. Everyone is so much different. Like a collective will has taken over their minds and told them to do what makes the least sense, what will most divide us from the world outside the Isle.”

“Everyone except us, I suppose,” she pulled back to sniffle and wipe some of the tears off her cheek.

He looked down at her with a weak smile. “Aye, I suppose you’re right.” They shared another moment of silence, and a profound warmth began to overwhelm Vaelyra as she looked into Aerion’s eyes. For a long while, she could hear two hearts beating in tune with one another. The noise swelled and faded, making a quiet, subtle song that only they could hear. Whatever it was, it made her feel as strong, as tender, as sure, as *vulnerable* as she’d ever felt before. Eventually, instead of listening to the beats, it was almost as though she could *feel* it around them. A calm, even pulsating between them that brought them together and pushed them apart in perfect symmetry. It felt like the earth itself gave out a low hum, echoing the resonance of their two hearts together. Then she realized that she was so captivated, so riveted by the intensity of this sensation that it, too, was scaring her. Trying to play it off, she slithered out of Aerion’s arms and began to study the books behind him.

“You’ve found something else, haven’t you?”

Aerion hesitated for a brief moment, turning to let his finger slide along the edge of the table as he returned to his seat. It traced up and across the open book in front of him, lingering for a while before it found the manuscript entitled *Strange Stone.* “News of the human sacrifices,” he began, “I– I think they might have been misconstrued, to some extent. Ardyn made it sound like the Church is just rallying a bunch of poor souls into pens and bleeding them out one by one, but I don’t think that’s the case. Here,” he opened *Strange Stone* to a page that he’d marked with a feather, pointing at the bottom of it. “Of all the texts we have about this Church of Starry Wisdom and the Deep Ones, this is the only one that mentions sacrificing real people. Maester Theron writes this line alone on its own page.”

It read, *For foul is the taste of a lamb that the blade surprises, rich is the taste of humility and gracious death. The shepherd is just as sweet if only he were willing.*

“I do believe he means to say that when the sacrifice is greater than livestock, the sacrificed must go willingly to their death. But,” he added, turning to the other side of the page, “This part perplexes me. He writes of a woman he apparently met and believed to be some kind of prophet. I don’t know much of High Valyrian, but I know enough to understand that this first line *is* that tongue, while the second below it… it’s something far more indecipherable.”
Vaelyra clutched the book quickly and sat in the other chair, reading it aloud to help herself understand it more clearly.

“These lines that follow were given to me by a most magnificent woman, she whose eyes shone like lilac starlight. At the end of my journies, when I thought my work had finished, she came along with this most fortuitous and cryptic parchment, and with a gaze that spoke truths of future’s past. Deep in my bones could I feel the weight of her presence, as though she were a prophet to give me the missing piece to the ever-so-elusive story of the Ones from the Deep and their strange Church. One is High Valyrian, echoing the optimal time for the Deep Ones’ brutal, sacrificial rites, but the second is a tongue that even the wisest of men struggle to make sense of. I leave it to you, reader, to decipher the rest. Language can be such a fickle thing. Why each dialect was chosen… I cannot say, other than to surmise the potentiality that she wished to show me that many creeds and colors the world over find their way into the Church. If she reads this, I hope that one day she may find me again and grant me my sole wish: to understand.”

“That’s odd,” she observed. “This paragraph, its tone and style is nothing like the rest of Theron’s work.” She continued on, reading the first line as it rolled off her tongue with a natural fluency. “Ānogar vaogenka iksis ānogar ojūdan, sīr ȳdra daor tepagon ziry naejot se ruarza hūra.” A moment passed before she could extract the full meaning from it; she recalled a similar phrase in one of the books she’d studied on the gods of Old Valyria. “It’s a tricky phrase… it has a double meaning. I can’t make it word for word, but the idea is that tainted blood is as worthless as an absent moon. So you may be right that these sacrifices are willed by all participating parties. Though you must be wary that different Valyrian dialects could change the meaning of this sentence entirely.” *But why would they live by such an unusual term?*

She hoped the second line would help, but she couldn’t make sense of a single letter. *Thax atk ru’ tsa’t, ftias gha niats gu’a shan gh’ash. Ssuftan raush thannus yfta agha’gol.*

*What the fuck?*

Vaelyra stared at the page bewildered before snatching a filled inkwell and some parchment from the corner of the table. Without a word to Aerion, she hastily scrawled the two foreign phrases onto a separate sheet of parchment.

“What are you doing?” He inquired partway through.

“Just because we don’t understand it doesn’t mean that no one else will.” Once she dropped the quill back into the inkwell, she leaned back against her chair and looked at Aerion pensively. “Does that Volantene scribe still live on the Isle? He might know languages better than anyone else at our disposal.”

He cocked his head to the side, almost surprised at how quickly she was thinking through potential solutions. “I believe so. If I recall right, he’s become a lover to the innkeep down at Tangled Branches.”

“Then let us go find him,” she said abruptly. She moved at a brisk pace, the air *whooshing* in her ears as she left the library and set out towards the docks. Vaelyra didn’t have to check if Aerion was following her; she knew that he would.

Tangled Branches had always been a strange place. The Isle was small enough that it only had one such facility for every citizens’ use, so it was no wonder that all manner of important dealings stemmed from there. But whenever she was around the place, she began to felt strange. Like mist was rising before her eyes, and her guts were twisting and turning all by themselves. Still, now was not the time for such distractions. If she had any part to play in resolving the matter of the Church, it would begin now. And she could not squander that.

The scribe’s presence was memorable enough that she picked him out within moments of setting foot in the common hall. His hair had faded, but he still had the shoulders of an ox, and the garb of a Lysene magister. He was sitting at the bar with a scholarly-looking fellow, one who seemed to be wearing a maester’s chain around his throat. She briefly checked over her shoulder to ensure Aerion was present to be her watchful guardian, if nothing else, before weaving through the guests and making her way to the man’s side.

“Beg pardon,” she said meekly, tapping the scribe on his shoulder. He’d worked as a scribe and translator for Draqen before his death, so it was likely that he already knew what this was about. She withdrew the parchment from her dress and held it in front of the man, who’d taken an almost indignant expression to his face. “But could you–”

“My…” the Maester breathed as though he’d seen a masterpiece of divine art. “Most magnificent Lady, we will do whatever you desire.” In turn, the scribe shot his companion a look before turning back to Vaelyra with a kind, though half-hearted grin. 

She couldn’t say whether it was malice, sarcasm, a provocative insinuation, or something else entirely… but something deep within her churned at the man’s words. A dark, panicked feeling overcame her in an instant. The kind of feeling she’d get as a child when her parents caught her doing something forbidden, only much worse. Much more suffocating. Like a corset pulled far too tight, underneath the weight of stone and iron blocks on her chest. “Get it to me. Soon,” She managed to utter through shortened breaths. 

Vaelyra wasted no time in turning on her heels and sliding right past Aerion towards the door, desperate to escape the thinning air and the Maester’s gaze. But when she reached for the door’s handle, she froze at the sound of a voice that came from nowhere.

“They paint themselves with the blood of their heretics and feed them to the sea, thinking that some ancient god from the deep will be pleased enough to grant them more bountiful harvests of food and gold for it. As if such a thing existed in the first place. Even if it did, what business would it have giving favor to blind fools?” 

She looked over her shoulder with terror in her eyes, even though she knew deep down that the voice hadn’t come from anywhere inside the inn. Aerion followed close behind with an urgent demeanor.

Within a single blink, Vaelyra had opened the door, tripped forward, and fallen into Aerion’s arms. She had a feeling in her bones, like she’d been shocked and shaken to her very core. There was a ringing in her ears, and everything was so *bright.* But once her eyes adjusted, her pain was supplanted by confusion; their surroundings had changed completely. They were in a sprawling, cavernous space with rocks and paths that extended into shapeless darkness. Up above her, behind where Aerion was crouched, was a massive black door grey with rust and green with moss. It had the number 12 inscribed into its center.

“What… what happened?” She asked as she found her voice again.
That was when he looked as fearful and confounded as she already felt. “I don’t know, you– we– we were in the tavern, you gave that parchment to the two men at the bar, and then you… You almost ran to the door, Vae. You hesitated, and then went straight outside. I followed, but when the door…” He was so distraught, he almost seemed to be questioning his own sanity. “When I opened it, I came out here. You were on the ground, shaking… and your eyes, they… gods, they were all white… and now… now we’re here.” She could see how much he wanted to make sense of what had just happened, but so too could she sense how much he feared the answers that might come out of such a question. She was even more frightened than him, at that.

They both knew they were underneath the Isle, in the underground city they’d always thought were just children’s fables. But the how and why were too much to consider. It had all transpired so quickly and unusually that they were more concerned about each other’s safety than anything else.

Any rational man would be most concerned about what the hell had just happened, or where they were, but those were not Aerion’s first questions.

“Are you alright?” He smoothed her hair and felt her forehead for a fever, his eyes still reflecting her own pain.

She felt more conscious now, but the piercing sensation in her head would not fade. *I don’t know,* she thought. It was such a grim consideration that she almost found it humorous.
