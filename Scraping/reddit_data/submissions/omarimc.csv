I'm posting my results here for others who are thinking of paying to promote their music. I also would love any advice from those who have done this sort of thing 

To begin, as noted in my title, Playlist Push is a complete scam. I repeat, DO NOY WASTE YOUR MONEY ON PLAYLIST PUSH. I paid them $300 to send a song to their list of ""curated playlists"" the song got put on zero playlists. That's right, 300 dollars for literally nothing. Worse, I got many responses from playlist owners that the song was really good but didn't fit the style of their playlist. So why did Playlist Push send to them? What a joke, so much for ""curated."" Even worse, I sent the exact same song to 15 playlist curators via Submithub and got 2 accepted. So I got about a 10% acceptance rate -- versus 0% -- doing it myself, and more importantly only cost about $20 worth of credits to do so on Submit Hub. If you take one thing away from this post PLEASE DON'T USE PLAYLIST PUSH!

Some other services I used to varying degrees of success:

OmariMC, which claims to get you guaranteed listens. I used their ""bronze""  tier which for $77 says they will get your song 500-5000 plays on spotify. Mine got 1200 as of now, so that's nice. I'm under no illusion that 1200 people actually listened to my song, I'm sure they use bots, but at least I got something to show for my money, unlike Playlist Push.

I decide to use twitter ads, boosting a tweet I sent that had a link to the song. I spent 100 bucks to boost for 5 days. While the tweet got over 100 likes it only got 1 rewteet, resulted in only 1 new follower and had only  13 clickthroughs on the link to the song. So, not great.

I also paid 25 bucks through Reverbnation to have a ""digital ad"" show up on Facebook and other social media platforms. Unfortunately these ads lead those who click on it to your reverbnation page and not spotify/youtube etc and i have no idea how to monetize reverbnation. I also don't trust their statistics; they claim I am the 33rd most popular artist in my region; Well I am in the NYC region and I seriously doubt with all the signed/professional musicians in the NYC area plus the thousands of unsigned acts that I am number 33. But the ad did get 40-50 people to listen to songs on my reverb nation page. For 25 bucks, probably the best value of all the things I did.

I wanted to post this to give real life examples to those who are considering paying for a music promotion service. I was able to reinvest my extra money from gigs into this, but I know many musicians do not have the extra 5-600 bucks to throw at promotion so wanted to help anyone thinking about it. Definitely avoid Playlist Push at all costs. I guess for value the reverbnation ad and submit hub got the best bang for my buck. Omari delivered on what they promised, but I suspect they use bots.

**Music promotion companies**   

Promotion may seem so simple, but most artists don’t have this part of the process thought out and need help finding the right solutions for marketing their singles and albums. If you don’t have a target, you’re probably wasting money. If you only want to “make it” or “get your music out there,” how the heck will you recognize if you’ve done it? Music promo is most helpful when you’re working for something specific – blog coverage, a particular number of Spotify streams, email list signups for fans. You get it. Some companies even offer [free music promotion!](https://www.inaflashhhmarketingllc.com/store/Free-Spotify-Song-Placement-p273656461) Music promotion companies are worthwhile. It’s the difference between reaching people and sending a song into the void. In the end, you’ve put into the music, you owe it to yourself to make it count.

You can run YouTube discovery ads yourself but OmariMC claims that their service is superior because they have experience running ads and know how to target them really well to get the most engagement. So this claim is total bullshit. They will get you views but the engagement is horrible.

This video has performed well on Instagram getting me about 10 followers for every $5.80-$6 all from USA and Canada (these regions are expensive for ads). I really don't think it's that the video is bad. Especially because my organic audience retention is doing fine.

Audience retention for YouTube to recommend videos is roughly at least 30-35% average. My average retention from organic promotion meets this bar but the Omari ad is dragging it WAYYYY down. I actually asked him to pull the ad because it's so low. At 1 minute 30 seconds in the retention from the OmariMC ad is fuckin 4 PERCENT. Like uhhh. Highly targeted my ass. At 2 minutes in it's 2%. You can view your organic vs ad retention and the graph of audience retention from the Ad is an exponential decay graph. I looked at the demographics and it's being shown to 87% people from age 25-65. I emailed support saying that this was not my target audience and asking politely for them to change my audience targeting by age. No reply. Day 4 (today) I finally just asked them to scrap the ad and refund me because the product was falsely advertised to have high engagement and targeting and it is not performing.

From what I can tell this company relies on inexperienced musicians who want to get their view count up but don't have a good understanding of their advanced YouTube analytics. You are much better off running the ads yourself. If you have an understanding of your actual potential fan base, your targeting will be better than theirs because it couldn't really get any worse!

He advertises himself as ""organic promotion"" and has high SEO rankings and I wanted to see what I could do with his company as a test run.

I decided to try the YouTube campaign, lowest tier. So estimated 2000-5000 views for the 5-7 day ad period.

DAYS 1-2 My ad started yesterday and in 2 days the view count has gone up by 1400. At this rate I am expecting the campaign to end up at around 4K views. They are location targeting effectively and my views are coming from USA and Canada.

I gained 4 subscribers so ...not a lot. The view duration from the ads is low. The like to dislike ratio from the ad is not great. It went from 21 likes and 1 dislike (and the dislike was from some asshole on reddit who went to my page just to dislike it) to 27 likes and 3 dislikes...so 6 likes and 2 dislikes. A 75% like rate is pretty bad and if it keeps up at this rate I'm DEFINITELY not buying any more packages . (here's the video, you be the judge of whether it's that bad  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPivalc5JP0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPivalc5JP0) ) On top of that I am running my own IG ads which are getting click throughs that definitely are much more likely to be contributing to likes than dislikes bc its a preview of the video and the people clicking on it already saw part of it and want to watch more of it.

In the purchasing window it allows you to location target but as far as I can tell everything else is poorly targeted. They allow you to put a short description of the songs.

Some of them poor money into promotion, or to be placed on playlists, and in return have very few fans. They are easily taken advantage of, by scam promotion companies, promising them something that they can not provide: fans. 

A few of these companies to watch out for are OmariMC, Industry All Access, Indie Power, Diamoon Media, and many more! See here for proof:  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sNo2TJCny9XeLtWxPzcUQQqXd1QvkbB-bmJFyxE7SMc/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sNo2TJCny9XeLtWxPzcUQQqXd1QvkbB-bmJFyxE7SMc/edit) 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

To those musicians that are lost, I want to offer a bit of advice. **I wouldn’t suggest investing money into promotion, or advertisement, until you are ready to perform live!** I also wouldn't suggest investing money into your music until you have built yourself a place for fans to follow you! 

&amp;#x200B;

Check out these two artists: 

  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LHP9l2lJJbYwEDQQq5xX4QlsUj96fxke587Pm-zl1Jo/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LHP9l2lJJbYwEDQQq5xX4QlsUj96fxke587Pm-zl1Jo/edit) 

&amp;#x200B;

Notice these artists have Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Holly even has a personal website! I'd also like to point out that BOTH of these artists are performing live! These things are really important to do, especially performing live! **If you aren't willing to play live, you will be giving yourself a huge disadvantage**.  

See what the famous Record Label Deathwish Inc has to say about the issue: 

**Deathwish Inc. Records**: [https://deathwishinc.tumblr.com/post/99734256907/do-you-guys-still-take-submissions](https://deathwishinc.tumblr.com/post/99734256907/do-you-guys-still-take-submissions)

We do take still submissions at demos@deathwishinc.com (links only, no attachments please) but to be honest, we’ve never worked with a band who has just submitted us a demo unsolicited.  

The best way to get your band heard or noticed, by us, **or any label** is just go out and play shows.  We are constantly being hit up by friends, “Hey have you heard of \_\_\_\_\_\_?  They played this show I was at the other day and they were awesome, you guys should check them out.”  

&amp;#x200B;

So it is very apparent that there are few record labels that will sign anyone that isn't performing live. They need to hear about you by word of mouth. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Submit your music to college radios!**

 

Campus radios want to hear your music! They are hoping you will send it to them, so that they can include it in their broadcasts! You don't have to be local, but if you are, be sure to let them know it! Offer to do an interview, and to play live for them! They want to support local artists, and they have the money to do it!

The King has been removed, a Constitution approved, and all the mechanisms are in place for the first President of Morocco to lead the nation into greatness, and a legislature to help him.

What is yet to be decided is who that will be.

**The candidates**

The chief candidate in the election, and the one considered most likely to win, is Prime Minister Idris Karim. Karim was not much of a politician before suddenly becoming the sole sovereign of the state after a wide-reaching corruption scandal destroyed not only the monarchy’s power but also the political capital of the once-influential Moroccan liberal establishment. Since those days over three years ago now, Karim has settled into his position as a decision-maker and has revealed himself to be an appealing campaigner to the millions of impoverished Moroccans. 

The Mabadi (“principles”) which have been enshrined in the recent Constitution are almost entirely of his own thought; this and his prior campaign goals, dominated by his strong anti-corruption stance and concentration on rural/poor interests, has won him significant allies. Most notably, the Moroccan left, which has for the first time in decades decided to stop bickering and throw their support behind one candidate - Karim. Istiqlal, the center-right secular and nationalist party which is an off-and-on friend of Karim, has resolved that it is in its own best interests to deny the Islamists or the liberals executive power, knowing full well it cannot be won on their own. Therefore, they are endorsing the Colonel in a remarkable display of solidarity not seen since the old Koutla coalitions of socialists and nationalists.

Of course, Karim has his opponents - two of them major. The one best poised to give him a real challenge (despite the slim chance of victory) is former Rabat mayor Abdelaziz El Omari, the nominee for the Justice and Development Party (PJD). The PJD espouses Islamism and social conservatism, but is economically more on the liberal side than the heavily pro-nationalization Karim or Istiqlal, both of which seek to remedy the condition of the Moroccan poor. El Omari is young but is not inexperienced - serving as the mayor of the capital, he made quite a few friends and the majority of the establishment is backing him due to his less-than-radical stance on the traditional Islamism of the party. 

The lesser of the three is Fatima-Zahra Mansouri, the candidate for the Royalist Coalition, a rebranding of the failed “Crown Defense Pact” which contested last elections. Mansouri was at one point the mayor of Marrakech and was considered a rising star in Moroccan politics when the Authenticity and Modernity Party was still prominent. However, the January Crisis greatly diminished her stature (like that of all liberals) and she has a great hill to climb if she wants to not be eliminated in the first round. Still, opinion polling ahead of the election suggests the royalists have a few tricks up their sleeve in collecting voters. One is their large war-chest, funded by the monied allies of the monarchy who desperately want it re-established. Another is the support for King Hassan in rural areas, a demographic which was one by Karim in the last elections. Analysts say, however, by focusing solely on reestablishing the providence of Hassan she is doing herself a disservice. 

**The Parties**

Like in all general elections, the parties contesting the Presidency and those contesting the Majlis are decidedly different. For one, the Koutla is absent here - Istiqlal is intent on becoming the largest party once more, and are willing to take on their occasional allies to do so. To fight this, a broad pact has been formed amongst Tajdid, Karim’s party which became the largest with 40% of the seats in 2022, and the left-wing of Morocco, which saw a small rebound in voters in that same election. 

There is now centralized liberal or socialist faction this time around. Mansouri’s Royalist Coalition is just that - a coalition of disparate parties and ideologies dedicated only to nullifying the recently passed Constitution. Some of them serve as vehicles for singular politicians vying for selection as one of 80 individually elected deputies, and others backing niche ideologies or special interests. The socialists, on the other hand, have returned to their own battle lines but have agreed to unite if it has been found necessary. In the Party of Progress and Socialism, at first a communist party that later became a vaguely progressive establishment party, deputies have returned to actual leftist thought. This is likely to serve a boon for the leftists, who were abandoned in the past few elections by the middle class. 

Because of the fractured state of their opponents and the lack of other Islamist parties, the PJD looks set to secure many, many seats, mostly via the proportional representation offered in the Constitution. They currently sit as the second-smallest party, although this is only due to the fact that they were, in futility, a part of the Crown Defense Pact which contested the 2022 elections and immediately split upon defeat. Polling suggests they will certainly be a top-five, if not top-three or even the largest party.

**The Issues**

* Constitutional Reforms

The elections are being framed as a referendum on the changes brought to the national laws which precipitated the necessity of these elections. The Koutla, led by Karim, seeks to uphold the Constitution as was written and passed, noting that they are in fact campaigning on the Mabadi principles espoused in the document. The Justice and Development Party wishes to keep the democracy but strike down the clauses banning Morocco from adopting a state religion or allowing governments to abide by a religious law. Also in their sights is the now-protected rights of gays and women, which they again wish to reduce, and the power of the President, who they say could become just another King. Meanwhile, the liberals wish to nullify the entire document and replace it with the old Constitution, unchanged from when it was voted out last year.

* Shanghai Cooperation Community

The SCC recently offered further integration with Morocco, a proposal which was, temporarily, rejected by the government because of these elections. The proposal will be reevaluated when the next President takes power. Karim has been vague on the issue, one of the few this can be truthfully said on. Before making a decision he says he will “consult our allies.” His allies, on their other hand, are rather cut and dry. “Reject it,” declare the socialists, while Istiqlal believes it would be “a step in the right direction if we can keep our integration with Europe.” The PJD is completely in favor of redirecting Morocco towards the East and away from our traditional allies of Europe and especially France. Mansouri is prone to outright denying the invitation, and has said so many times. “We should not be friends with authoritarians - at home or abroad,” she says, in a jab at the domineering Karim. 

* Corruption

The one issue all parties and fronts are united on is their opposition to corruption. All notable contenders have labeled corruption as one of their “major issues” or something along those lines. How this will be tackled is where they diverge. Karimists (a name for those supporting Mabadi and Karim, who himself has encouraged the term’s usage) believe that civilian tribunals should be set up in every wilaya (province) and corrupt officials will be tried based on public evidence and testimony. Karim says that decentralizing the process will return judicial power “back to the people and away from the makhzen.” The Makhzen is the Moroccan term for a very real deep state. Opponents, namely in the PJD, say that this is horrifying and Leninism with a Moroccan face, something Karim vehemently denies. PJD prefers a top-down approach, with their new bureaucracy going after the “liberal elite.” Critics of the Islamist plan say this will be both biased and useless since the makhzen will simply not eat their own. The liberals have their own solution which favors giving prosecutorial direction to the states, but not many are listening since they loss of capital is entirely due to a corruption scandal.

**The Results (Presidential)**

Presidential elections take place in an IRV system: if one candidate does not secure an outright majority, votes will be transferred and redistributed until they do. 

Candidate | Party | First Round Results
---------|-----|-------------------
Idris Karim | Koutla (Tajdid + leftists + Istiqlal) | 57.9%
Abdelaziz El Omari | Justice and Development Party | 28.4%
Fatima-Zahra Mansouri | Royalist Coalition | 13.7%

**Idris Karim,** along with his running mate **Nabila Mounib,** will become the first President and Vice President of the Federal Republic of Morocco until 2027 with 57.9% of the vote. They take office on April 1.

**The Results (State Seats)**

No party secures a majority of seats, not even with the addition of directly elected districts.

**Aftermath and Analysis**

When all was said and done, by the morning voting blocs emerged in the Majlis, and the final results were published:

Party Name | Leader | Seats | Ruling Coalition?
----------|------|-----|-----------------
Tajdid | Idris Karim | 124 | Yes, senior partner
Justice and Development Party | Abdelaziz El Omari | 74 | No, chief opposition
Istiqlal | Nizar Baraka | 52 | No
Liberal Party | Fatima-Zahra Mansouri | 33 | No
Union of Popular Forces | Habib el Malki | 29 | Yes, junior partner
Federation of the Democratic Left | Omar Balafrej | 24 | Yes, junior partner
Rural Interests | Mohamed Laenser | 13 | No
Better Together | Hamdi Ould Errachid | 2 | No

The election could be called a decisive victory for Tajdid despite the fact they lost seats nationwide. Idris Karim will become the first chief executive of the Federal Republic of Morocco, and he has been granted a razor thin majority coalition in the Majlis with the UFP and FGD. The second party emerged, clearly, as the Justice and Development Party, which had a relatively standard night despite the apparent energization of the Islamist factions in Moroccan society. Clearly, it has become obvious that their radical policies have hit a ceiling which they frankly cannot break. 

Istiqlal had a somewhat disappointing night. Despite their highest share of both votes and seats in years, they were expected to emerge as the second largest party but take a definite third place as they, like PJD, have no clear allies in the Majlis. They can, however, at least work with the government on quite a few issues they share common ground on, namely corruption and helping the poor gain a fairer hand. The left-wing did surprisingly well considering its fractures, but this is not likely to win any favors from Karim, who otherwise would have swept their demographics (namely, the urban poor and middle class). Still, it’s a major win, especially with Nabila Mounib of the FGD becoming Vice President on a ticket with Karim. 

Overall, Karim and co. performed amazingly well in a typically fractured nation. Now, it’s time to get to work for the Karimists and their allies.",True,False,False,Geosim,t5_39wjl,r/Geosim,1982,public,,self,,,[Event] The First Moroccan Elections,,0.0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/bdaxhz/event_the_first_moroccan_elections/,,house_only,1.0,,,,,,,,,

Hello Zoid fans, as a *Gundam 00* (11 years ago!) sequel is being developed it occurred to me that a sequel to [*Zoids: New Century*](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Zoids:_New_Century) may not be so unlikely, I believe the premise of a potential sequel to *Zoids: New Century* was implied to be the [Blitz Team](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Battle_Teams#Blitz_Team) having class S battles on one of the other continents of [Planet Zi](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Planet_Zi).

I'll make sections that I may add to whenever someone leaves a comment with an idea, a section for series title suggestions, one for any other ideas regarding a sequel anime, sections for Zoid battle teams, characters and episodes as well as any general ideas and even a section for ideas on entirely new Zoids (maybe a horse type Zoid to get viewership from fans of *The Saddle Club* and add more fangirls to the Zoids fanbase) would be good too.

And anyone reading this who are also fans of [*Gundam*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mecha/comments/azcskn/after_colony_and_anno_domini_mobile_suitarmour/) and [*Alien*](https://www.reddit.com/r/LV426/comments/b3e746/dictum_on_xenomorph_hive_dynamics_and/) might be interested in my posts regarding topics from those franchises.

&amp;#x200B;

Also see my [**Zoid classification system**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mecha/comments/b61nag/zoid_classification_system/) as well as my [Zoids waifu classification system](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mecha/comments/b61mim/zoids_waifu_hair_colour_classification_system/) for help with ideas, I'll start it off with a few.

**2**. New Zoids:

* Notes:
   * New Zoids are conceptualised with faction specific designs in mind regarding features, capabilities and aesthetics, though the Grav Skate can be seen as a [Dragoon Nest](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Dragoon_Nest)\-like ([Neo-Zenebas Empire](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Zenebas_Empire#The_Neo-Zenebas_Empire), ZAC 2101+) Zoid with some [Hover Cargo](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Hover_Cargo) ([Helic Republic](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Helic_Republic), ZAC 2101-) designs as this Zoid would have come about sometime after the wars of circa ZAC 2100 where some features from Zoids of differing factions and entirely new designs can be feasibly implemented in the development of new Zoids, such as those developed by [ZOITEC](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/ZOITEC) after the wars and I am redesigning the Broadmane to use only that which can be identified as designs of the Helic Republic found in their Zoids from ZAC 2056 - 2099 whilst the Mowhorse is depicted with features from the [Blade Liger](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Blade_Liger) (Helic Republic, ZAC 2099 - 2100), [Liger Zero](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Liger_Zero) (Helic Republic, ZAC 2101) and [Parablade](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Parablade) ([Zi-Arms](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Zi-Arms), 2230) whilst being the base horse-type Zoid that the [Orudios](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Orudios) was developed from in ZAC 2054, though these features from later Zoids are only used to illustrate it's equipment using the most well-known examples, though the ion boosters, laser blades and AZ X-style blade could simply be [New Century](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Zoids:_New_Century) era (despite the Parablade possibly having been developed after New Century though this would depend on whether or not New Century takes place before or after ZAC 2230) refits over the base Zoid chassis.

   * **Grav Skate** (transport Zoid) — Named this as whilst being based on a horseshoe crab, it is also similar in appearance to a skate (animal, Rajidae) and uses the same type of anti-gravity cushion system as that of the [Hover Cargo](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Hover_Cargo), the Grav Skate is a large, heavily armoured, low to the ground, horseshoe crab-type hovering transport Zoid, it is proportionately of a similar size to the Hover Cargo and is also fully amphibious as well as being capable of similar speeds and altitude to the Hover Cargo and has a hyper energy shield as well. Its armament is also identical to that of the Hover Cargo with a pair of heavy beam cannons at the front and a twin beam repeater atop both thruster pods which are also identical to those of the Hover Cargo as well as ten homing torpedo tubes like those of the [Dragoon Nest](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Dragoon_Nest), with the side window sections in the accomodation level also being identical to those of the Hover Cargo. The aerial Zoid catapult hatch at the upper rear surface of the Grav Skate is also very similar to that of the Dragoon Nest. The Grav Skate also has ten legs with the front pair featuring servo pincers for lifting wrecked Zoids into the front deployment hatch and the rear pair for the same purpose with the lateral rear deployment hatches whilst the remaining middle three pairs are used as landing apparatus. — **Known as the transport Zoid of the Taiga Team.**

[Grav Skate \(transport Zoid\)](https://i.redd.it/s1xyngipl1431.jpg)

* **Mowhorse** — A portmanteau of 'mow', 'mohawk' (hairstyle) and 'horse', this high-speed mêlée combat horse-type Zoid is the base Zoid that the [Orudios](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Orudios) was created from and features a prominent [Parablade](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Parablade)\-style laser blade from the front to the back of its head in the shape of a axe/mohawk style horse mane for charging headbutt attacks, it also has a lateral fold-down laser blades (hence 'mow'), dorsal ion boosters and an energy shield. The Mowhorse is a dedicated high-speed mêlée combat Zoid.

[Mowhorse](https://i.redd.it/tp3ep6dqez031.png)

* **Broadmane** — A reference to the Zoid's broad build, this draught horse-type Zoid is larger and stockier than the Mowhorse and whilst not capable of such high speeds, it is well armoured and still quite capable of defending itself in close quarters. Hurriedly developed after ZAC 2056 to fulfill a similar role as the then retired [Dibison](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Dibison) though without the focus on needing to combat the [Death Saurer](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Saurer), the Broadmane features designs from several different Zoids including those not of the Helic Republic with its primary combat role is as a missile and heavy weapons (including [CP-10 Gojulas Cannons](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Zoids_Customise_Parts#CP-10_Gojulas_Cannons)) platform it features crusher metal spike hooves, nose cannons and 8-shot missile pods (2) on its cheeks, shoulder armour missile pod arrays, lower leg 6-shot high manoeuvre missile pods (2) as standard, ventral cannons and tail-tip weapon array of beam cannons (2) and an AZ 6-shot high manoeuvre missile pod as standard.

* **Hyaenagore** — A portmanteau of 'hyaena' and 'gore', this hyena-type Zoid is highly agile and capable in mêlée combat, able to crush armour with its powerful laser fangs. Whilst of a similar height to the [Command Wolf](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Command_Wolf), the Hyaenagore is stockier and well armoured for its size, adept at ambush and shock assault tactics it is equipped with laser fangs and a mouth sonic blaster as standard. — **SKETCH COMING SOON**
* **Megasuchus** — A reference to it being a large crocodilian Zoid, large, well armoured, amphibious [*Deinosuchus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinosuchus)\-type Zoid is of a similar length to a [Gojulas Mariner Type B](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Gojulas#Video_Games) and has large powerful jaws capable of crushing and wrenching off the limbs of prey Zoids, it is also adept at ambush tactics with quick bursts of speed and has a dorsal hardpoint for mounting heavy weaponry.
* **Scythe Kaiser** — A reference to it's powerful scythe-like raptorial forelegs and its great proficiency in mêlée combat, this large rare mantis-type Zoid is not only agile and highly efficient in mêlée combat and ambush tactics but is also able to fly with its retractable magnesser wings, though not at a very high speed. It features large laser blades as its raptorial forelegs and active camouflage as standard as well as a sophisticated optical sensor suit that can detect Zoids using smokescreens and active camouflage.
* **Strike Vesper** — A reference to the type of animal it is based on, this hornet-type Zoid is agile and features hardened alloy mandibles and claws at the end of its legs as well as a mouth sonic blaster and laser blade beam cannon combo as its stinger in addition to an advanced optical sensor suite that is able to detect Zoids using smokescreens and active camouflage.
* **Blitzpider** — A portmanteau of 'blitz' (as in quick as lightning) and 'spider', this agile jumping spider-type Zoid is of a similar size to a [Guysak](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Guysak) and is capable of a high-speed leaping type locomotion and is able to quickly traverse highly sloped surfaces, primarily an ambush type Zoid it is equipped with sophisticated optical sensors that can detect Zoids using smokescreens and active camouflage and features two laser fangs (chelicerae) and eight hardened alloy tarsus claws for mêlée combat, it also has a spinneret grapnel launcher and dorsal opisthosom-mounted electromagnetic net gun as standard.
* **ZBCS** **Alabaster** — A reference to this Zoid's white colouration, this extremely large Sperm whale-type transport Zoid is; like the [Great Whale King](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Dr._Laon#Ability_as_a_Zoid_Pilot); a larger more advanced derivative of the standard [Whale King](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Whale_King) and is the flagship of the ZBC. — **This rare transport Zoid is only known to be utilized by the** [**ZBC**](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Zoid_Battle_Commission)**.**
* **Ironback** — A play on words derived from 'leatherback' as in the leatherback sea turtle, this extremely large, aquatic, very heavily armoured [*Archelon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archelon)\-type transport Zoid is of a comparable size to a [Whale King](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Whale_King) and is utilised in a similar role, it features not only the strongest armour of all Zoids but also a powerful energy shield and its flippers double as wings as they have in-built magnesser systems enabling it to fly, though not at very high speeds. It is armed with several anti-aircraft cannons and torpedo-missle launcher pods as standard. — **This rare Zoid is only known to be utilized by the** [**ZBC**](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Zoid_Battle_Commission)**.**
* **Ultrasaurus Mariner Type A** — A designation using the same naming convention as the [Gojulas Mariner Type A](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Gojulas#Gojulas_Mariner), this Zoid is an  [Ultrasaurus](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Ultrasaurus) with additional attachments to allow it to fight better underwater while retaining its mobility on land and with torpedo-missile launchers in place of other weaponry (e.g. the Eight-Shot Missile Launcher etc.). — **This rare Zoid is only known to be utilized by the** [**ZBC**](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Zoid_Battle_Commission)**.**
* **Ultrasaurus Mariner Type B** — A designation using the same naming convention as the [Gojulas Mariner Type B](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Gojulas#Video_Games), this very large, heavily armoured aquatic plesiosaur-type Zoid is directly related to the [Ultrasaurus](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Ultrasaurus) in that it's chassis is nearly identical apart from the plesiosaur paddles it has instead of legs and a powerful propulsion system in place of the Ultrasaurus' tail as well as a similar armament to the Ultrasaurus (four 360mm Supercannons) except with torpedo-missile launchers in place of other weaponry (e.g. the Eight-Shot Missile Launcher etc.). — **This rare Zoid is only known to be utilized by the** [**ZBC**](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Zoid_Battle_Commission)**.**
* **Mawmax** — A portmanteau of 'maw' and 'maximum' in reference to it's large jaws filled with hardened alloy shark teeth, this large aquatic [*megalodon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalodon)\-type Zoid is of a similar length to a [Gojulas Mariner Type B](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Gojulas#Video_Games) and is capable of not only high subsurface water speeds but also flight as it has [magnesser systems](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Magnesser_System) built into it's large pectoral fins which also feature forward edge mounted laser blades that are also found on the forward edges of its dorsal and caudal fins. This Zoid has large jaws filled with proportionately oversized hardened alloy shark teeth that are capable of opening wide enough to securely bite into both sides of a [Dibison](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Dibison)\-sized Zoid's torso from above. This Zoid also has a sophisticated electrosensor/EW suite in its nose that can detect Zoids using ink/smokescreens and active camouflage as well as a hardpoint for mounting heavy ventral weapons though it is primarily a hunter-killer shock assault mêlée combat Zoid. — **This rare and powerful Zoid is only known to be utilized by the** [**ZBC**](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Zoid_Battle_Commission)**.**
* **Torpedo Hunter** — A reference to its primary weapons and its aggressive combat role, this fast, aquatic barracuda-type Zoid is armed with several multi-torpedo pods and a sophisticated sensor suite at the tip of its lower jaw that is similar to that of the **Gorial** and is able to detect Zoids using ink/smokescreens and active camouflage. — **This Zoid is only known to be utilized by the** [**ZBC**](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Zoid_Battle_Commission)**.**
* **Deinukus** — A portmanteau of '*Deinosuchus*' and 'nuke' (due to its large powerful torpedo-missile armament), this  large, well armoured, amphibious [*Deinosuchus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinosuchus)\-type Zoid is a variant of **Megasuchus**, differing primarily in its modified jaws that conceal a large powerful missile-torpedo used to attack large carrier Zoids such as Whale Kings etc. and like the **Megasuchus**, it is also adept at ambush tactics with quick bursts of speed and also has a dorsal hardpoint for mounting heavy weaponry though it is not quite as capable in mêlée combat as the **Megasuchus** due to its jaws being modified to launch the large missile-torpedo, though it is still easily capable of mangling smaller Zoids. This Zoid is often used in conjunction with Gorials as their advanced sensory and EW capabilities assist with target acquisition, hit probability and ambush tactics. — **This Zoid is only known to be utilized by the** [**ZBC**](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Zoid_Battle_Commission)**.**
* **Gorial** — A portmanteau of 'Gor' (as in [Gorhecks](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Gorhecks), due to similar EW capabilities), 'gore' and 'gharial' (due to the resemblance of *Sarcosuchus* *imperator* to gharials), this large, well armoured, amphibious [*Sarcosuchus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcosuchus)\-type Zoid is a variant of **Megasuchus**, differing primarily in the narrower snout which ends in a bulla module featuring advanced sensory equipment that can detect Zoids using a smokescreen or active camouflage, this module also has EW capabilities and like the **Megasuchus**, it is adept at ambush tactics with quick bursts of speed and also has a dorsal hardpoint for mounting heavy weaponry though it is not quite as capable in mêlée combat as the **Megasuchus** due to its less robust snout that is instead primarily a housing for advanced sensory and EW equipment though it is still easily capable of mangling smaller Zoids. Due to its advanced sensory and EW capabilities it is often utilised in the role of an amphibious anti-aircraft artillery platform. — **This Zoid is only known to be utilized by the** [**ZBC**](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Zoid_Battle_Commission)**.**
* **Madbutcher** — A reference to the common mistranslation of the genus *Megalania prisca* as 'ancient great butcher' as well as its design and size similarities to the [Madthunder](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Madthunder) with which it was developed to fight alongside when facing [Death Saurers](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Saurer) with its lesser anti-charged particle shield and provide CPC-resistant artillery support with it's Gojulas cannons and then quickly charge the enemy battle lines and tear apart lesser Zoids piecemeal, leaving the Madthunders free to combat the enemy Death Saurers unmolested. This large [*Megalania*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalania)\-type Zoid is well armoured and deceptively fast as it is capable of quick bursts of speed despite its size, it is highly efficient in mêlée combat as it can quickly wrestle and pin lesser Zoids to the ground with its large strong jaws and powerful claws, the Madbutcher can also mount a variety of heavy weapons (including [CP-10 Gojulas Cannons](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Zoids_Customise_Parts#CP-10_Gojulas_Cannons)) on dorsal and lateral hardpoints. — **This Zoid is only known to be utilized by the** [**ZBC**](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Zoid_Battle_Commission)**.** — **SKETCH COMING SOON**
* **Maxornis** — A reversed portmanteau of *Aepyornis maximus* and which is also immediately indicative that this Zoid is based on a large bird, this high-speed [*Aepyornis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aepyornis)\-type Zoid is unique in that it is not only quite large but also very fast and capable of laterally mounting various heavy weapons (including [CP-10 Gojulas Cannons](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Zoids_Customise_Parts#CP-10_Gojulas_Cannons)) without effecting its speed too much and is also brutally efficient in mêlée combat. The [Berserk Fury's](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Berserk_Fury) back (and head) would be at almost level height with Maxornis' back and it has lateral fold-down laser blades and hardened alloy talons as standard as well posterior mounted thrusters. Picture something like Leena's [Gun Sniper LS](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Gun_Sniper#Video_Games) but much larger, faster and more capable in both ranged and mêlée combat. — **This rare Zoid is quite powerful and is a type only utilised by the** [**Zoid Battle Commission**](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Zoid_Battle_Commission) **and if you think about it, its silhouette would look very similar to that of the front half of the Ultrasaurus Zoid also used by the ZBC, perfect congruity!**
* **Stratosentinel** — A portmanteau of 'stratosphere' and 'sentinel', this large [*Quetzalcoatlus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetzalcoatlus)\-type aerial Zoid functions primarily as a high-altitude hypersonic reconnaissance and EW bomber aircraft and with a wingspan fifty percent wider than that of a [Storm Sworder](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Storm_Sworder) it has many hardpoints for a variety of bombs and missiles, it also features a large thunder lance (beak) and pinion laser blades for aerial mêlée combat as standard. — **This rare Zoid is only known to be utilized by the** [**ZBC**](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Zoid_Battle_Commission)**.**

* **Boa-borer** — A reference to the animal it is based on and its aptitude at fossorial locomotion, this extremely large [*Titanoboa*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanoboa)\-type transport Zoid is 1.5 times the length of a [Whale King](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Whale_King) and can transport several medium sized Zoids in it's many cargo segments as it travels beneath the surface and can tunnel through harder earth than a [Stealth Viper](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth_Viper) as it has special thermal borers on its head and tail tip that enable it to do so as well as variable suspension rollers at the four diagonal points on each cargo segment to move it through the tunnels it creates. — **This rare transport Zoid is only known to be utilised by the** [**Backdraft**](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Backdraft) **Group**.
* **Leviathan** — A reference to the biblical entity, this very large heavily armoured aquatic sea serpent-type Zoid is of the same length as a [Seismosaurus](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Seismosaurus) and is directly related to it primarily in that it features the same focused CPC and thirty one beam cannons spread along its neck, body and tail that can channel energy from the Zoid's CPC, making their power output far greater, it also features advanced EW systems to help make sure that the 'coast is clear' so to speak so that it can safely surface and charge its CPC as this Zoid is primarily used for coastal bombardment using its focused CPC as well as the rapid destruction of flotillas via its CPC enhanced beam cannon array. — **This rare and powerful Zoid is only known to be utilised by the** [**Backdraft**](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Backdraft) **Group**.
* **Volteuthis** — A portmanteau of 'volt' and 'teuthis' which is a reference to its ability to disable other Zoids by tackling them with its eight arms and then electrocuting them with its two harpoon tentacles, this large but sparsely armoured aquatic [*Architeuthis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_squid)\-type Zoid is not only capable of high subsurface water speeds but can also fly as it has a [magnesser system](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Magnesser_System) built into the large fins of its mantle and a powerful propulsion system CPC combo in its hardened alloy beak, it is particularly adept at grappling and electrocuting Zoids with its arms and harpoon tentacles and its arms are also lined with hardened alloy serrations for gripping and sawing through Zoids, it also has ink/smoke dischargers and a mantle-tip mounted beam cannon as standard and can fan its arms out to generate an energy shield or charge its beak CPC, this Zoid does not have any external hardpoints to mount weapons on. — **This rare Zoid is only known to be utilised by the** [**Backdraft**](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Backdraft) **Group**.
* **Cutterfish** — A portmanteau of 'cutter' (a reference to its mantle fin laser blade) and 'cuttlefish', this agile aquatic cuttlefish-type Zoid has a large fin running along the tip and sides of its mantle that features a chevron-shaped laser blade along its entire edge, essentially making this Zoid a giant self-propelled spearhead and it features a powerful propulsion system beam cannon combo in its beak, it is also equipped with active camouflage as standard and can fan its arms out to generate an energy shield. This Zoid is primarily used as an ambush/shock assault mêlée combat ramming type Zoid and does not have any external hardpoints to mount weapons on. — **This rare Zoid is only known to be utilised by the** [**Backdraft**](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Backdraft) **Group**.
* **Crescent Menace** — A reference to its crescent-like head, this large amphibious *Diplocaulus*\-type Zoid is agile for its size and features EW capabilities and advanced electrosensors that can detect Zoids using smokescreens and active camouflage as well as laser blades along the forward edges of its head. — **This rare Zoid is only known to be utilised by the** [**Backdraft**](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Backdraft) **Group**.
* **Sabreside** — A reference to how its lateral laser blades are similar to the broadside cannons of a warship, this rattlesnake-type Zoid is slightly larger and better armoured than a [Stealth Viper](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth_Viper) but just as agile and is also fossorial. It features advanced optical and electrosensors that can detect Zoids using smokescreens and active camouflage and has large jaws with prominent laser fangs as well as laterally retractable laser blades along the length of its body allowing it to rapidly cut through Zoids, hence 'thresher', it also has an omni-directional smoke grenade launcher comprising the 'rattle' at the end of its tail. — **This rare Zoid is only known to be utilised by the** [**Backdraft**](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Backdraft) **Group**.
* **Salvantula** — A portmanteau of 'salvo' (as in a salvo of missiles) and 'tarantula', this large heavily armoured tarantula-type Zoid is of a similar size to a [Death Stinger](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Stinger) and is essentially a land-based missile frigate as a large portion of its outer surface is covered in multi-missile launchers (analogous to the urticating hairs of an actual tarantula) in a similar fashion to the [Liger Zero's Panzer](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Liger_Zero_Panzer) CAS, though with more missile pods.

* **Terrortornyx** — A stylised spelling of *Teratornis* ending with 'nyx' (Greek goddess of night) to imply its stealth capabilities, this large, rarely seen, vulture-like [*Teratornis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teratornis)\-type aerial Zoid is of a similar size to the Stratosentinel though instead of fulfilling the role of a hypersonic bomber, the Terrortornyx functions primarily as a high-altitude reconnaissance and EW stealth aircraft in support of [Zabat](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Zabat) squadrons as a mediary Zoid between them and the carrier [Whale King](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Whale_King) during [Backdraft](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Backdraft) engagements. It is equipped with large crushing talons and; Like the [Storm Sworder](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Storm_Sworder); also large laser blade pinions for aerial mêlée combat as standard and is also capable of equipping a variety of missiles and bombs when stealth is not a mission priority. — **This rare Zoid is only known to be utilised by the** [**Backdraft**](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Backdraft) **Group**.

**4**. Character ideas:

* Vega Obscura with a Sturm Tyrann (red coloured [Storm Fury](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Storm%20Fury)) in a similar role to and as a parallel to Leon and his Red Blade Liger, this is plausible since he is a Backdraft pilot as none of the other teams from *Zoids: New Century* would be able to partake in class S battles, though there could be a mid series (or second series) Royal Cup tournament plot element where one team from the previous anime can begin making appearances on the class S Zoid battle continent.
* A goodie rival to Bit and his Liger Zero piloting a König Wolf DSR.
* A baddie rival to Bit and his Liger Zero piloting a Liger Zero EM — **Like Vega Obscura this rival would also be a Backdraft pilot, though their role would be much more antagonistic than Vega's and who would also be in a team of three or four Zoids to match the Blitz Team, as opposed to Vega who would be only utilised in a team of one**.
* A baddie female rival to and possible eventual love interest of Brad Hunter and his Shadow Fox piloting the Painther for Dr. Laon of the Backdraft Group which is a further development of the technology used to create the Shadow Fox, though Brad's higher Zoid piloting skills places them at about even footing.
* A new 'Tigers Team' to be what would at first glance would be a parallel to them, except in a plot twist they are called the 'Ligers Team' and they are not incompetent as they are a class S Zoid battle team with three yellow Blade Liger ABs, also the Blitz Team's first encounter with the Taiga Team is the cause of a brief comedic confusion when their name is first heard, thinking that they have just encountered the Tigers Team from the other continent.
* Either of those two rivals could be a female pilot and possibly an eventual love interest of Bit Cloud (probably the Mowhorse pilot), if he would pull it out of the Liger Zero for long enough...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**5**. Story arc ideas:

* Possible mid first or early second season plot element where Jamie Hemeros decides to join the Fluegel Team for battles on the other continent and the Blitz Team acquires a new aerial Zoid pilot (not a female pilot as it is likely Leena would kill or maim her within an episode or two).
* Late season story arc featuring a naval/coastal battle between the ZBC and the Backdraft and their use of weather altering technology advanced further from Dr. Laon's developments shown in *Zoids: New Century* to create enough stormcloud cover to prevent the ZBC's judge satellites from assisiting their naval and ground forces.

&amp;#x200B;

**6**. Episode ideas:

* An episode with Bit using the [Liger Zero Mariner](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/File:Liger_Zero_Mariner.jpg) CAS that also features a [Gojulas Mariner Type B](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Gojulas#Video_Games).
* An episode with Leon Toros upgrading his Red Blade Liger with the [CP-12 AB unit](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Zoids_Customise_Parts#CP-12_Attack_Booster).
* An episode where Jamie Hemeros upgrades his Raynos with the CP-18 Impact Cannon.
* An episode where Leena Toros upgrades to a Parablade.
* An episode with the König Wolf DSR's pilot upgrading it with the [prototype CAS](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/K%C3%B6nig_Wolf#PROTOTYPE_CAS).
* An episode with the Liger Zero EM's pilot upgrading it to the Liger Zero X.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**7**. General ideas:

* The Backdraft group doing its thing on the class S Zoid battle continent with primarily Vega Obscura and his Berserk Fury, though with different CAS for it (Storm/Jagd Fury etc.), however due to a higher ZBC presence on the class S battle continent they must rely on coastal ambushes etc. and the subterranean **Boa-borer** transport Zoid instead of their usual Whale Kings to interfere in Zoid battles.
* Some episodes could feature Zoid battles on the other continent with teams from the previous anime.
* Continuation of amusing plot elements from the previous anime, e.g. comedic interludes by Harry Champ and Dr. Laon directed toward Leena and Steve Toros.
* More backstory about Jamie Hemeros and his father's friendship with Steve Toros and Dr. Laon.

Hello Zoid fans, as a *Gundam 00* (11 years ago!) sequel is being developed it occurred to me that a sequel to [*Zoids: New Century*](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Zoids:_New_Century) may not be so unlikely, I believe the premise of a potential sequel to *Zoids: New Century* was implied to be the [Blitz Team](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Battle_Teams#Blitz_Team) having class S battles on one of the other continents of [Planet Zi](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Planet_Zi).

I'll make sections that I may add to whenever someone leaves a comment with an idea, a section for series title suggestions, one for any other ideas regarding a sequel anime, sections for Zoid battle teams, characters and episodes as well as any general ideas and even a section for ideas on entirely new Zoids (maybe a horse type Zoid to get viewership from fans of *The Saddle Club* and add more fangirls to the Zoids fanbase) would be good too.

And anyone reading this who are also fans of [*Gundam*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mecha/comments/azcskn/after_colony_and_anno_domini_mobile_suitarmour/) and [*Alien*](https://www.reddit.com/r/LV426/comments/b3e746/dictum_on_xenomorph_hive_dynamics_and/) might be interested in my posts regarding topics from those franchises.

&amp;#x200B;

Also see my [**Zoid classification system**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mecha/comments/b61nag/zoid_classification_system/) as well as my [Zoids waifu classification system](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mecha/comments/b61mim/zoids_waifu_hair_colour_classification_system/) for help with ideas, I'll start it off with a few.

The aerial Zoid catapult hatch at the upper rear surface of the Grav Skate is also very similar to that of the Dragoon Nest. The Grav Skate also has ten legs with the front pair featuring servo pincers for lifting wrecked Zoids into the front deployment hatch and the rear pair for the same purpose with the lateral rear deployment hatches whilst the remaining middle three pairs are used as landing apparatus. — **Known as the transport Zoid of the Taiga Team.**

[Grav Skate \(transport Zoid\)](https://i.redd.it/ncqb7bvtl0331.jpg)

* **Mowhorse** — A portmanteau of 'mow', 'mohawk' (hairstyle) and 'horse', this high-speed mêlée combat horse-type Zoid is the base Zoid that the [Orudios](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Orudios) was created from and features a prominent [Parablade](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Parablade)\-style laser blade from the front to the back of its head in the shape of a axe/mohawk style horse mane for charging headbutt attacks, it also has a lateral fold-down laser blades (hence 'mow'), dorsal ion boosters and an energy shield. The Mowhorse is a dedicated high-speed mêlée combat Zoid.

[Mowhorse](https://i.redd.it/qyz6h0jrdz031.jpg)

* **Broadmane** — A reference to the Zoid's broad build, this draught horse-type Zoid is larger and stockier than the Mowhorse and whilst not capable of such high speeds, it is well armoured and still quite capable of defending itself in close quarters. Hurriedly developed after ZAC 2056 to fulfill a similar role as the then retired [Dibison](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Dibison) though without the focus on needing to combat the [Death Saurer](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Saurer), the Broadmane features designs from several different Zoids including those not of the Helic Republic with its primary combat role is as a missile and heavy weapons (including [CP-10 Gojulas Cannons](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Zoids_Customise_Parts#CP-10_Gojulas_Cannons)) platform it features crusher metal spike hooves, nose cannons and 8-shot missile pods (2) on its cheeks, shoulder armour missile pod arrays, lower leg 6-shot high manoeuvre missile pods (2) as standard, ventral cannons and tail-tip weapon array of beam cannons (2) and an AZ 6-shot high manoeuvre missile pod as standard.

It features large laser fangs (chelicerae), a sophisticated optical sensor suite, the missile pods and a spinneret grapnel launcher as standard and has dorsal and lateral opisthosomal (abdomen) hardpoints for mounting heavy weapons.
* **ZBCS** **Alabaster** — A reference to this Zoid's white colouration, this extremely large Sperm whale-type transport Zoid is; like the [Great Whale King](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Dr._Laon#Ability_as_a_Zoid_Pilot); a larger more advanced derivative of the standard [Whale King](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Whale_King) and is the flagship of the ZBC. — **This rare transport Zoid is only known to be utilized by the** [**ZBC**](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Zoid_Battle_Commission)**.**
* **Ironback** — A play on words derived from 'leatherback' as in the leatherback sea turtle, this extremely large, aquatic, very heavily armoured [*Archelon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archelon)\-type transport Zoid is of a comparable size to a [Whale King](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Whale_King) and is utilised in a similar role, it features not only the strongest armour of all Zoids but also a powerful energy shield and its flippers double as wings as they have in-built magnesser systems enabling it to fly, though not at very high speeds.

* **Deinukus** — A portmanteau of '*Deinosuchus*' and 'nuke' (due to its large powerful torpedo-missile armament), this  large, well armoured, amphibious [*Deinosuchus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinosuchus)\-type Zoid is a variant of **Megasuchus**, differing primarily in its modified jaws that conceal a large powerful missile-torpedo used to attack large carrier Zoids such as Whale Kings etc. and like the **Megasuchus**, it is also adept at ambush tactics with quick bursts of speed and also has a dorsal hardpoint for mounting heavy weaponry though it is not quite as capable in mêlée combat as the **Megasuchus** due to its jaws being modified to launch the large missile-torpedo, though it is still easily capable of mangling smaller Zoids. This Zoid is often used in conjunction with Gorials as their advanced sensory and EW capabilities assist with target acquisition, hit probability and ambush tactics. — **This Zoid is only known to be utilized by the** [**ZBC**](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Zoid_Battle_Commission)**.**
* **Gorial** — A portmanteau of 'Gor' (as in [Gorhecks](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Gorhecks), due to similar EW capabilities), 'gore' and 'gharial' (due to the resemblance of *Sarcosuchus* *imperator* to gharials), this large, well armoured, amphibious [*Sarcosuchus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcosuchus)\-type Zoid is a variant of **Megasuchus**, differing primarily in the narrower snout which ends in a bulla module featuring advanced sensory equipment that can detect Zoids using a smokescreen or active camouflage, this module also has EW capabilities and like the **Megasuchus**, it is adept at ambush tactics with quick bursts of speed and also has a dorsal hardpoint for mounting heavy weaponry though it is not quite as capable in mêlée combat as the **Megasuchus** due to its less robust snout that is instead primarily a housing for advanced sensory and EW equipment though it is still easily capable of mangling smaller Zoids. Due to its advanced sensory and EW capabilities it is often utilised in the role of an amphibious anti-aircraft artillery platform. — **This Zoid is only known to be utilized by the** [**ZBC**](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Zoid_Battle_Commission)**.**
* **Madbutcher** — A reference to the common mistranslation of the genus *Megalania prisca* as 'ancient great butcher' as well as its design and size similarities to the [Madthunder](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Madthunder) with which it was developed to fight alongside when facing [Death Saurers](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Saurer) with its lesser anti-charged particle shield and provide CPC-resistant artillery support with it's Gojulas cannons and then quickly charge the enemy battle lines and tear apart lesser Zoids piecemeal, leaving the Madthunders free to combat the enemy Death Saurers unmolested. This large [*Megalania*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalania)\-type Zoid is well armoured and deceptively fast as it is capable of quick bursts of speed despite its size, it is highly efficient in mêlée combat as it can quickly wrestle and pin lesser Zoids to the ground with its large strong jaws and powerful claws, the Madbutcher can also mount a variety of heavy weapons (including [CP-10 Gojulas Cannons](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Zoids_Customise_Parts#CP-10_Gojulas_Cannons)) on dorsal and lateral hardpoints.— **This Zoid is only known to be utilized by the** [**ZBC**](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Zoid_Battle_Commission)**.** — **SKETCH COMING SOON**

The [Berserk Fury's](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Berserk_Fury) back (and head) would be at almost level height with Maxornis' back and it has lateral fold-down laser blades and hardened alloy talons as standard as well posterior mounted thrusters. Picture something like Leena's [Gun Sniper LS](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Gun_Sniper#Video_Games) but much larger, faster and more capable in both ranged and mêlée combat. — **This rare Zoid is quite powerful and is a type only utilised by the** [**Zoid Battle Commission**](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Zoid_Battle_Commission) **and if you think about it, its silhouette would look very similar to that of the front half of the Ultrasaurus Zoid also used by the ZBC, perfect congruity!**
* **Stratosentinel** — A portmanteau of 'stratosphere' and 'sentinel', this large [*Quetzalcoatlus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetzalcoatlus)\-type aerial Zoid functions primarily as a high-altitude hypersonic reconnaissance and EW bomber aircraft and with a wingspan fifty percent wider than that of a [Storm Sworder](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Storm_Sworder) it has many hardpoints for a variety of bombs and missiles, it also features a large thunder lance (beak) and pinion laser blades for aerial mêlée combat as standard. — **This rare Zoid is only known to be utilized by the** [**ZBC**](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Zoid_Battle_Commission)**.**

&amp;#x200B;

**4**. Character ideas:

* Vega Obscura with a Sturm Tyrann (red coloured [Storm Fury](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Storm%20Fury)) in a similar role to and as a parallel to Leon and his Red Blade Liger, this is plausible since he is a Backdraft pilot as none of the other teams from *Zoids: New Century* would be able to partake in class S battles, though there could be a mid series (or second series) Royal Cup tournament plot element where one team from the previous anime can begin making appearances on the class S Zoid battle continent.
* A goodie rival to Bit and his Liger Zero piloting a König Wolf DSR.
* A baddie rival to Bit and his Liger Zero piloting a Liger Zero EM — **Like Vega Obscura this rival would also be a Backdraft pilot, though their role would be much more antagonistic than Vega's and who would also be in a team of three or four Zoids to match the Blitz Team, as opposed to Vega who would be only utilised in a team of one**.
* A baddie female rival to and possible eventual love interest of Brad Hunter and his Shadow Fox piloting the Painther for Dr. Laon of the Backdraft Group which is a further development of the technology used to create the Shadow Fox, though Brad's higher Zoid piloting skills places them at about even footing.
* A new 'Tigers Team' to be what would at first glance would be a parallel to them, except in a plot twist they are called the 'Ligers Team' and they are not incompetent as they are a class S Zoid battle team with three yellow Blade Liger ABs, also the Blitz Team's first encounter with the Taiga Team is the cause of a brief comedic confusion when their name is first heard, thinking that they have just encountered the Tigers Team from the other continent.
* Either of those two rivals could be a female pilot and possibly an eventual love interest of Bit Cloud (probably the Mowhorse pilot), if he would pull it out of the Liger Zero for long enough...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**5**. Story arc ideas:

* Possible mid first or early second season plot element where Jamie Hemeros decides to join the Fluegel Team for battles on the other continent and the Blitz Team acquires a new aerial Zoid pilot (not a female pilot as it is likely Leena would kill or maim her within an episode or two).
* Late season story arc featuring a naval/coastal battle between the ZBC and the Backdraft and their use of weather altering technology advanced further from Dr. Laon's developments shown in *Zoids: New Century* to create enough stormcloud cover to prevent the ZBC's judge satellites from assisiting their naval and ground forces.

&amp;#x200B;

**6**. Episode ideas:

* An episode with Bit using the [Liger Zero Mariner](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/File:Liger_Zero_Mariner.jpg) CAS that also features a [Gojulas Mariner Type B](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Gojulas#Video_Games).
* An episode with Leon Toros upgrading his Red Blade Liger with the [CP-12 AB unit](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/Zoids_Customise_Parts#CP-12_Attack_Booster).
* An episode where Jamie Hemeros upgrades his Raynos with the CP-18 Impact Cannon.
* An episode where Leena Toros upgrades to a Parablade.
* An episode with the König Wolf DSR's pilot upgrading it with the [prototype CAS](https://zoids.fandom.com/wiki/K%C3%B6nig_Wolf#PROTOTYPE_CAS).
* An episode with the Liger Zero EM's pilot upgrading it to the Liger Zero X.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**7**. General ideas:

* The Backdraft group doing its thing on the class S Zoid battle continent with primarily Vega Obscura and his Berserk Fury, though with different CAS for it (Storm/Jagd Fury etc.), however due to a higher ZBC presence on the class S battle continent they must rely on coastal ambushes etc. and the subterranean **Boa-borer** transport Zoid instead of their usual Whale Kings to interfere in Zoid battles.
* Some episodes could feature Zoid battles on the other continent with teams from the previous anime.
* Continuation of amusing plot elements from the previous anime, e.g. comedic interludes by Harry Champ and Dr. Laon directed toward Leena and Steve Toros.
* More backstory about Jamie Hemeros and his father's friendship with Steve Toros and Dr. Laon.

Dec 3, IRNA -- The Yemeni army and the Arab country’s popular forces
surrounded the Saudi cities of Najran and Jizan as they are pushing
ahead with their retaliatory campaign against Riyadh's deadly
aggression, a senior military spokesman said.“Yemeni army units, backed
by fighters from popular committees, are now waiting for a political
decision to capture the two cities, both located in Saudi Arabia’s
Southwestern parts,” Yemeni Army Spokesman Brigadier General Sharaf
Luqman said in an interview with Arabic-language al-Manar TV on
Thursday.Luqman also expressed the army’s readiness to embark on an
operation on a larger scale, saying that the Yemeni troops have stepped
up their offensives on the Saudis. Touching on the status quo in Yemen’s
central province of Ma’rib, he said the army and tribal volunteer forces
are working together in a bid to restore ceasefire in two volatile
districts there.Luqman said the Saudi forces have been attempting in
vain to seize the al-Omari camp north of the Bab al-Mandeb Strait.Yemen
has been under constant military attacks by Saudi warplanes since late
March.The Saudi military strikes were aimed to supposedly undermine the
popular Ansarullah movement, and bring fugitive former President Abd
Rabbuh Mansour Hadi, who is a Saudi ally, back to power.More than 7,500
people have been killed and over 14,000 others wounded since
March.Yemeni army soldiers fighting alongside allied fighters from
popular committees loyal to the Ansarullah movement have conducted
retaliatory attacks against the Saudi
aggression.&lt;http://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13940912000364&gt;也门武装周四宣布，已在沙特南部三个省迅速推进，即将夺取Najran全省。沙特已经在本国土地上使用集束炸弹，妄图阻止也门武装的推进。自周日开始，也门武装改变战略，越过边境向沙特南部三个省发起进攻，已夺取多个军事基地。TEHRAN
(FNA)- Yemen's army declared major win in battle against Saudi troops in
the Southern parts of Saudi Arabia, saying it has made rapid and major
advances in the three bordering provinces of Najran, Jizan and
Asir.Sharaf Loqman, the spokesman of the Yemeni army, told the
Arabic-language al-Mayadeen news channel on Thursday that the massive
operations by the country's forces in the three Southern provinces
started with rapid progress.He said in case of an order by the top brass
in the army, ""we will capture the entire Najran province"".His remarks
came after reports disclosed on Wednesday that the Saudi Arabia's
warplanes were targeting the Southern parts of the kingdom with cluster
bombs in a bid to stop the Yemeni army and popular forces' continued and
rapid advance deep into their territories.Saudi Arabia has used cluster
bombs many times before, but this is the first time that it is using it
against its own population in a desperate move to stop the huge advances
made by the Yemeni forces inside the kingdom in recent days.The Yemeni
army and popular forces have frequently crossed the border captured the
Saudi military bases and outpost, ruined the military sites and returned
home in the last few months and after the Riyadh-led coalition refrained
from stopping its air raids on residential areas in Yemen's cities.But,
after months of coalition intensified air raids on civilian areas, the
Yemeni forces changed strategy and warned that they would start ground
assaults on Saudi territories to force Riyadh stop the massacre.The new
strategy was put into effect on Sunday, when Yemen's army and popular
forces crossed the border and captured several key military bases in
three provinces in Southern Saudi Arabia near the border.The Yemeni
forces seized Malhama, al-Radif and al-Mamoud military bases in Jizan,
al-Rabou'a military base in Asir and Nahouqa military base in Najran
provinces.Then on Monday, the Yemeni forces took control of three more
Saudi military bases in al-Shurfa region in Najran.They also captured a
military camp in Najran, and destroyed the military vehicles in there.On
Tuesday, the Saudi warplanes used banned cluster bombs against civilians
in 5 airstrikes on residential areas in Yemen's Hajjah province. Tens of
people were killed and wounded in the air raids.Earlier today, the
Yemeni army spokesman Sharaf Luqman said that the army and popular
forces are advancing deep inside Saudi Arabia and capturing more
military bases in the Southern parts of the kingdom.""The Yemeni forces
have managed to inflict heavy losses on the Saudi enemy inside Saudi
Arabia,"" Luqman said.He reiterated that the Yemeni army and the popular
forces are having high morale to fight the enemy, and said, ""The
military operation to capture new military bases of Saudi Arabia is
underway.""Luqman said that the Saudi enemy has resorted to airstrikes
which will surely fail.Saudi Arabia has been striking Yemen for 253 days
now to restore power to fugitive president Mansour Hadi, a close ally of
Riyadh. The Saudi-led aggression has so far killed at least 7,116
Yemenis, including hundreds of women and children.Hadi stepped down in
January and refused to reconsider the decision despite calls by
Ansarullah revolutionaries of the Houthi movement.Despite Riyadh’s
claims that it is bombing the positions of the Ansarullah fighters,

###*This report was authorized on June 17, 2019, by the honourable members of the Regency Council and by President of the Regency Council Bouchaib Arroub*

***INTRODUCTION***

The Regency Council, in its third meeting, directly preceding the death of His Majesty King Mohammed VI, ordered in a 12-3 vote for prosecutors to by the end of 2019 produce a report detailing the possibility of royal interference in national elections. This report was asked to include by the Council’s liaison to the federal intelligence services a noting of: directing of courses of political action; corruption and other fiscal manipulations; and human rights abuses or imprisonment of political dissidents and journalists. 

The produced report, on behalf of the Regency Council (note that the Report has been greatly shortened in the interest of brevity, and only includes the most immediately relevant information):


***POLITICAL DIRECTION***

* Summary

There is considerable evidence to propose that the Authenticity and Modernity Party, a semi-reformist party with unclear motives currently serving as the opposition, is wholly aimed at backing the agenda of the crown and those close to it. 

* Detail

The Authenticity and Modernity Party was founded in 2008 by Fouad Ali El HIMMA (see: Detail of “FINANCIAL MANIPULATION”) as a merger of multiple parties with disparate goals and ideas. However, all parties had in common their support for the monarchy and its agenda. Mr. HIMMA is a close associate of His Majesty the King and attended school with him. The Authenticity and Modernity Party (henceforth abbreviated to PAM) is primarily a party dedicated to some form of liberalism and or/modernism. Despite this, there is little in the way of an actual agenda for the PAM, and most representatives use it as a way of gaining more influence within the Moroccan government or as a way to reach His Majesty the King. Only 10 PAM deputies have served more than one term. It is widely suspected that the PAM was set up by His Majesty the King to oppose conservative and Islamist forces in the Parliament. 

A 2016 [paper](http://internationalrelations.org/pam-morocco-authenticity-and-modernity/) suggests that Mr. HIMMA is beholden to the “makhzen,” a Moroccan term representing a body similar to a “deep state” or “shadow government.” The makhzen is made up of influential politicians and businessmen, by default close to the monarch and moving pieces to fit his will. The report notes that Mr. HIMMA “...has mastered the core principles of the makhzen (deep authoritarian state structure) in the kingdom, namely the division of the political scene, electoral engineering and the drowning political dissent with palace-friendly parties in the name of “rationalization of the party system.” The inquiry has found significant evidence to back these findings, including when a socialist minister noted Mr. HIMMA’s connections to His Majesty the King. The government issued a staunch and stark rebuke of the accusations of Mr. BENABDELLAH, the minister in question. Additionally, Ilyas El Omari, former Secretary-General of PAM (2015-2017) was forced out of his role after a short time at the helm, largely due to his conflicts with the agenda of Mr. HIMMA and His Majesty the King. 

***FINANCIAL MANIPULATION***

* Summary

Under the reign of His Majesty the King, financial corruption was institutionalized and breached the very core of nationwide business dealings. His Majesty has been found to have routinely practiced cronyism and to have monopolized much of the daily life of Moroccans under his or his allies’ control.

* Detail

The major holding company SNI (Société Nationale d’Investissement) is directed by friends of His Majesty despite being privately owned. It owns almost all energy services in Morocco via the company Nareva. Other institutions held either by SNI include: Attijariwafa Bank (Morocco’s largest bank and the fourth largest in Africa); the Maroc Culture Association (which funds many international events, like Mawazine, the Rabat music festival); the largest mining company in Morocco, MANAGEM; massive grocery store chain Marjane; and the Cheikh Zaid hospital. The SNI holds what is essentially a monopoly over these sectors. 

Mounir MAJIDI was a close ally of His Majesty the King, being his confidant and senior advisor for a twenty-year period. Mr. MAJIDI is reputed to now be the most powerful man in the nation of Morocco, as he is President of the royal holding company SIGER and many other national assets directed by the crown. When the fiscal malpractice and widespread corruption perpetrated by Mr. MAJIDI was pointed out by journalist and French resident Ahmed BENCHEMSI, Mr. MAJIDI brought charges against Mr. BENCHEMSI. Mr. BENCHEMSI was acquitted. Also of note is Hassan BOUHEMOU, a business executive and ally of His Majesty; Mr. BOUHEMOU currently holds the leadership of SNI. Mr. MAJIDI and Mr. BOUHEMOU are both currently sitting on the Regency Council. 

His Majesty also committed cronyism to relation to his classmates at the Class of Prince Sidi Mohammed in 1973. Of his classmates, up to 15 later received high-level government roles and/or fruitful careers elsewhere. They include: Fouad Ali El HIMMA (founder of the Authenticity and Modernity Party); Yassine MANSOURI (Director-General of the DGED); Noureddine BENSOUDA (Director of the DGI and the Royal Treasury); Rochdi CHRAIBI (Director of the Royal Cabinet); Fadel BENYAICH (Ambassador to Spain); and Samir El YAZIDI (Governor of Tiznit). Of the aforementioned, 5 are currently serving on the Regency Council, all being appointed directly by His Majesty the King. 

***HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AND POLITICAL IMPRISONMENT***

* Summary

The King has been found to have routinely jailed dissidents and journalists over the course of his twenty year sovereignty, often despite international condemnation and clamoring for their release. These journalists and dissidents were often imprisoned shortly after noting corruption at the national level, or directly opposed the monarch or the royal agenda. 

* Detail

Ali LAMBARAT, the owner of two satirical magazines who was jailed in 2003 on charges of defaming the monarchy and the royal budget. The charges were seen both in Morocco and abroad as trumped-up and Mr. LAMBARAT, the head of Reporters Sans Frontieres in Morocco, was deemed a political prisoner in the court of public opinion. 

Ali ANOUZLA, the editor-in-chief of publishing website Lakome.com (banned in 2013), was jailed in 2013 after a police raid on his home. This raid was seen by human rights officials, including those resident at AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, as retribution for Lakome.com’s reporting on the release of a convicted Spanish pedophile so that His Majesty the King could keep good graces with the royal family of Spain. Contributor to Lakome.com and first man to renounce his oath of allegiance to His Majesty Ahmed BENSEDDIK was found poisoned in October of 2014; Mr. BENSEDDIK very narrowly survived the episode. It should be noted there is little evidence to support the monarch’s direct involvement, although the involvement of parties related to the royal family has been proven and was declared in the form of constant death threats to Mr. BENSEDDIK prior to the event. 

Mustapha ADIB was a captain in the Royal Moroccan Air Force, imprisoned in 1999 shortly after the accession of His Majesty Mohammed VI due to his witnessing and further reporting of fuel theft by commanders in the Royal Moroccan Air Force. Ali Salem TAMEK is a left-wing Sahrawi independence activist greatly maligned by the state-owned Moroccan press who was detained at multiple points in the mid-2000s in what was seen by international observers as an unlawful deprival of justice. The EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT passed a resolution (**P6_TA(2005)0414**) that demanded the immediate release of Mr. TAMEK.

Perhaps most notable is His Majesty the King’s punishment of the leader of Hirak Rif, or the so-called “Rif Movement,” Nasser ZEFZAFI. Mr. ZEFZAFI, who attained nationwide attention for becoming a figurehead for Hirak Rif in the aftermath of the murder of a fishmonger in the year 2018, received a twenty year sentence, sparking further protests. Alongside Mr. ZEFZAFI were other prominent members of Hirak Rif, including Nabil AHMIJEQ, Wassim El BOUSTANI, and Samir AGHID. 

***CONCLUSION***

The Regency Council has found widespread fiscal and political malpractice by the royal family and specifically by His Majesty the late King Mohammed VI, prosecutable by federal charges in the court of law on the basis of corruption. It also indicts the leadership of the Authenticity and Modernity Party, His Majesty the King’s royal secretary, and numerous other political officials. 

The Regency Council recommends immediate action be taken legislators to combat this corruption and eliminate its sources. It also recommends federal prosecution to those who were in the company of His Majesty or others who oversaw the meddling in political affairs.

Kardashian）求情释放的爱丽丝·约翰逊（Alice Marie Johnson）。

CNN6月7日报道，美国非裔毒品罪犯爱丽丝于周三获释。现年63岁的她已是一名曾祖母，于1996年因贩毒和洗钱罪名被判终身监禁，不得假释，至今已在狱中渡过21年。

&lt;img src=""https://bbsstaticoss.hoopchina.com.cn/aHR0cDovL2kuZ3VhbmNoYS5jbi9uZXdzL2V4dGVybmFsLzIwMTgvMDYvMDgvMjAxODA2MDgyMTU1MzkyMjguanBn?x-oss-process=image/resize,w_465/format,jpg/quality,Q_60"" class=""article-deposit-pic lazy"" /&gt;

白宫在一份声明中说：“爱丽丝·对她过去的所作所为负有责任。尽管获得无期徒刑，但她在服刑期间积极改造，堪称模范，甚至成为狱友的导师。尽管政府对犯罪行为态度严厉，但仍然认为应该给那些向社会偿还债务、努力在狱中改造的赎罪者第二次机会。”

报道称，得知爱丽丝获释，卡戴珊激动不已，在推特上发文欢呼“最好的消息！”，并向统特朗普和库什纳（Jared
Kushner）表示感谢。

&lt;img src=""https://bbsstaticoss.hoopchina.com.cn/aHR0cDovL2kuZ3VhbmNoYS5jbi9uZXdzL2V4dGVybmFsLzIwMTgvMDYvMDgvMjAxODA2MDgyMTU1NTg2MzMucG5n?x-oss-process=image/resize,w_465/format,jpg/quality,Q_60"" class=""article-deposit-pic lazy"" /&gt;

&lt;img src=""http://b1.hoopchina.com.cn/games/images/day.png?l=3"" class=""article-deposit-pic lazy"" /&gt;

[观察者网此前报道](http://www.guancha.cn/internation/2018_05_31_458540.shtml)，上月底，美国真人秀女星卡戴珊来到特朗普办公室，为她希望解救的一名毒枭求情，并探讨司法改革问题。在讨论监狱体制改革问题的同时，卡戴珊积极建议总统为爱丽丝减刑。

&lt;img src=""http://b1.hoopchina.com.cn/games/images/day.png?l=4"" class=""article-deposit-pic lazy"" /&gt;

卡戴珊在一段视频中表示，在现在这个人生阶段，花钱疯狂购物已经无法满足自己，用这些钱去拯救一些人的人生，让自己的心灵更充实，她设想每年像这样救一个人。

据了解，爱丽丝曾于1991年至1994年间协助一个大型可卡因贩毒集团运营，并因涉毒和洗钱受到重罪指控。法官认为，爱丽丝是主犯之一，经她之手流入社区的毒品或高达2000至3000公斤。鉴于此，即便她是初犯、且不涉及暴力行径，爱丽丝依然在1996年仍然受到法律的严厉制裁——被判终身监禁、不得保释。

CNN报道称，早在奥巴马执政时期，就有人为爱丽丝申请减刑。不过这些诉求并未被送到奥巴马近前。“司法部建议否认爱丽丝的减刑要求。”美国检方认为，爱丽丝罪行严重，不值得法外开恩。

对于特朗普的介入，田纳西州检方迈克尔·杜纳万特（Michael
Dunavant）在声明中表示，总统拥有绝对的行政宽赦权，检方对此“理解和尊重”。但声明同时说，将继续不遗余力地对类似案件进行起诉追责。

据了解，对爱丽丝减刑是特朗普执政以来实施的第六次特赦。上个月，特朗普特赦已故拳王、首位美国黑人重量级拳击世界冠军杰克·约翰逊（Jack
Johnson）和保守派印度裔作家兼导演迪内石·迪索萨（Dinesh D'Souza）。

&lt;img src=""http://b1.hoopchina.com.cn/games/images/day.png?l=6"" class=""article-deposit-pic lazy"" /&gt;

4月中旬，曾卷入中央情报局特工身份泄密案的前副总统切尼（Dick
Cheney）幕僚长李比（Scooter Libby）获得特赦。

&lt;img src=""http://b1.hoopchina.com.cn/games/images/day.png?l=7"" class=""article-deposit-pic lazy"" /&gt;

3月上旬，美国海军上士克里斯蒂安·索西尔（Kristian
Saucier）获特赦被释放。据了解，索西尔曾于2009年拍摄6张有关美军“亚历山德里亚”号攻击型核潜艇涉密区域照片。2016年5月，索西耶认罪，但却以希拉里所陷“邮件门”丑闻为类比，向法官申请缓刑判决。

但最终还是判处他一年监禁，刑满释放后还将接受3年监外看管。

&lt;img src=""http://b1.hoopchina.com.cn/games/images/day.png?l=8"" class=""article-deposit-pic lazy"" /&gt;

此前，严重侵犯\*河蟹\*、藐视法庭的亚利桑那州警长乔·阿尔帕约（Joe
Arpaio）也获得特赦。

&lt;img src=""http://b1.hoopchina.com.cn/games/images/day.png?l=9"" class=""article-deposit-pic lazy"" /&gt;

对于特朗普接连签署特赦令，美国媒体给出不同的分析。

VOX新闻网称，特朗普此举可能是照顾人情。自就职以来，特朗普便对忠实的追随者奖勉有加，而卡戴珊的丈夫、著名说唱乐手坎耶·韦斯特（Kanye
Omari
West）之前就不惜“掉粉”对特朗普进行声援。此外，二人的会面也是由特朗普的女婿库什纳促成。

&lt;img src=""http://b1.hoopchina.com.cn/games/images/day.png?l=10"" class=""article-deposit-pic lazy"" /&gt;

《华盛顿邮报》认为，特朗普厌恶“权力受限”，而行政赦免权恰为总统最不受制约的权限之一。

CNN援引批评人士的话称，在“通俄门”的调查背景下，特朗普接连签署特赦令可能出为已经落马或正受到特别检察官施压的前助理和盟友送去定心丸。

There have been misconceptions about strategies and the effectiveness of Triggers, some of which I will still need to correct later on (e.g. Escudo was on occasion overestimated). So don't feel down if this tournament didn't go too well for you, because in no way is it a measure of your skills! What you did was participate in an experiment to see what is viable.

Now, I know that I said there would be a scond phase, but people ar eobviously getting fed up and I have been struggling to gather strategies and votes, plus my free time is diminishing (not to mention I took on too much responsibility). So the tournament ends here... but anyone who feels like continuing to fight with their OCs is welcome to do so! I probably won't be modding thos ematches, but they will be every bit as official as the others, if you want them to be.

Without further ado, here is the ranking! From what I've seen, all the ties we've had were time outs with no penalties, which awarded neither points nor penalties, and as such count the same as a loss. Within one same tier contestants are just ordered alphabetically, with none of the outranking another. If there is anything you'd like to check, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldtrigger/comments/agfjip/oc_tournament_masterpost/) is the masterpost.

Hope you guys had fun!

Additionally, what kind of player do you project them becoming? For my Hawks, here's what I came up with

**Trae Young**

**Strengths:** Gifted passer, already shown the ability to read the defense and make the right play, able to generate free throws, deceptively quick on both sides of the ball.

**Weaknesses:** Plays hard, but tries to do too much on offense at times. Both questionable shots and passes lead to lots of turnovers, doesn't move enough off ball, too small and needs to put on some weight.

Trae had already put on a good amount of weight before this season, getting up to around 180, but getting up another 20 pounds would benefit him greatly. He's already shown he can get to the line which is an invaluable asset for any scorer By building his strength, he'll be able to finish through contact and get more and 1 opportunities, or just get the layups if the refs don't blow the whistle. Turnovers should be fairly obvious. Any great PG needs to be able to limit careless turnovers. Trae has already established himself as one of the league's better playmakers, and cutting down on turnovers would make him one of, if not the, NBA's best. Off ball play is important because Trae will eventually have teammates who can help run the offense, which will lead to more off ball shots. Making cuts, setting, and going through screens will increase his impact on the floor and make him even more dangerous than he already is. 

My prediction for Trae is that he'll develop nicely into an amazing scorer, and generational playmaker.

**Kevin Huerter**

**Strengths:** Good shooter, can score in a variety of ways. Good size, overall just a smart player with a good feel for the game.

**Weaknesses:** Ball handling is lacking, lacks the strength/athleticism to keep up with the plethora of athletic guards/wings in the league. Fouls jump shooters way too often.

As a 6'7"" wing, he has the size necessary to become a great or even elite defender, but he's still young and inexperienced, tending to foul jumpshooters way too often. Cutting down on unnecessary fouls is absolutely necessary in today's game. Facilitating is probably the most underrated aspect of Kevin's game. He's actually pretty nice off the dribble. He really needs to get better in the pick and roll, and continue to work on his ball handing. If he can get to the point where he can initiate the offense, it'll open up so many opportunities to for himself, Trae and the rest of team.

My prediction for Kevin is that he'll be a quality starter who just may sneak into an all star game or two because of the overall team success.


**Omari Spellman**

**Strengths:** Decent shooter, good rebounder, good passer, lots of physical tools with good size, weight and wingspan. Overall just a nice, well rounded player.

**Weaknesses:** Inconsistent offensively, needs to slim down (we don't call him Weighmond Green for nothing).


Spellman tends to be very streaky on a game to game basis, and sometimes even a half to half basis. He'll go from looking like a perfect modern stretch big to a benchwarmer at best. He really needs to be more reliable on the offensive side of the ball. Especially when it comes to outside shooting. Slimming down will also be necessary if he hopes to keep up with some of these quick wings the NBA has. Being able to defend multiple positions is a skill that'll take him far in this league.

My prediction is that Spellman will become a quality starter with very few, if any weaknesses to his game. Although he'll never be a top scoring option on a contender, I can definitely see him becoming a great defender. Honestly very excited to see his development.",True,False,False,nba,t5_2qo4s,r/nba,2377412,public,,self,,,What do your team's rookies need to improve on heading into the offseason?,,0.0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/b0qrnc/what_do_your_teams_rookies_need_to_improve_on/,,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,,,

He was originally held prisoner there by the guards until he showed them his power of rap, which caused them to faint in disbelief. With Kanye realizing this may be his only opportunity to escape, he stole one of the guards pod racers and rose to the surface of Lake Michigan. When he reaches the surface, a lady in a super boat picked him up and took him in as her own. Kanye grew up calling this lady his mother, whose name is Donda. Donda took Kanye to chicago to live in there hut which was built into the side of a mountain. Kanye, having no school background, only knew how to rap due to his gift from God. Once Donda found out about this, she took Kanye to a rap battle organization called “GOOD Music”. Kanye blew everyone away with his amazing musical talents and started to grow to stardom. Between the years 2000 and 2003 he released his first album “Kon the Louis Vuitton Don” which fell way below his expectations. To try and regain his fame Mr. West called up a supporter of his, Donald Trump. The two of them began talking and decided to plan a rap battle between the two. February 10th 2004 was the date they decided the epic battle would take place. The weeks leading up to the battle were some of the hardest in all of Kanyes life, he was forced to train 18 hours a day if he even wanted a chance to take down Trump.

The day of the event had finally arrived and Kanye had prepared the most he thought was physically possible. He hadn’t slept in over 3 weeks and yet had felt no signs of exhaustion. When entering the facility the battle would take place, Mr. West met his all time idol, Eminem. Kanye ran up to him and instantly began to fall to his knees to pray to him. “Calm yourself Omari” said Eminem, “I will lend you all of my power so you can have a fair battle against The Donald, I couldn’t beat him on my one when I faced him 20 years ago, I doubt you can alone.” “No I can’t accept this, I have wanted to take down Donald since the day of found out he existed. He is my arch rival and will continue to plague this earth unless I take him down alone. Im sorry Marshall, but I must reject your offer.” Said Kanye, affirmatively.

Kanye and Trump had finally met up with each other on stage. Kanyes knees were quacking below him with sweat dripping off of his palms. The only sound in the room was Kanye’s slow breathes, In and out, in and out. While at the same time Trump was just standing there, menacingly. The time had finally come, round 1 was about to begin and Trump was to go first. Trumps rap went exactly as he had planned, he thought he for sure won the round and that Kanye would just give up right there, until Kanye started rapping. “The Holocaust is bad!” Yelled Kanye. It was at this moment that Donald realized his major mistake, he never said anything anti Holocaust. “And since Trump never stated he was anti-holocaust, this means he’s Pro-Holocaust!” Said Kanye. The entire crowd went silent and Trump began disappearing into mid-air. At the same time of the rap battle, Kanye wrote and released his new album “College Dropout”, which was instantly given 20 platinum awards.

Now, Kairi isn’t exactly the formal type. His says “arigachu” to thank people, for one, and this gets translated as “thanks muchly” in certain subs. 

Now I’m wondering about a certain other one of Kairi’s frequently-used lines.

There’s a term he frequently uses to refer to Keiichirou/Patran 1gou that gets subbed as “Mr. Policeman.” I can’t really make out what he says in Japanese during those bits. It sounds like “Omari-san” or something in that ballpark. I tried googling it but didn’t have any luck. Is it some kind of Japanese slang term for cops, like “cop” kind of is in English? It sounds like it may have a respectful connotation on its own, with Kairi’s patronizing/sarcastic tone turning into a playful jab/insult.

I hope we're all having an amazing week!

Not much to say about this card, ultimately the main event is the only thing that super interests me, unfortunately ill probably be missing out on this event because its my mums birthday on event day so, family first!

Also im starting this write-up late at night, so this will be a two part post, ill write a chunk tonight, and then the rest tomorrow. Sorry for the inconvenience 

(c) - Champ

(D) - Debut

NS - No Streak

FLS - Fight Lose Streak

FWS - Fight Win Streak

(#x) - Rank in Division

Lets do this!

**Prelims**

**Lightweight**

**Alex White (12-5-0, 2 FLS) v Dan Moret (13-4-0, NS)** - A fairly fun fight to start off this event. **White** is a solid striker, he's good, but he's not exactly a powerhouse, he's more of a volume striker, lots of slick combo's but despite his technique he always has been on the wrong end of the fight, he's maybe not all that ready for the UFC and i feel like this fight against Moret is as good of a fight as he's gonna get. **Moret** is someone who is fairly new, he didn't get much screen time in his debut because well, he got knocked out by a tough Gilbert Burns. Despite all that though, he's a submission artist and loves the ground, his striking leaves much to be imagined but his grappling game is on point. I just don't see White getting the better of Moret, especially since White isn't that great on the ground, i see Moret going for the takedown and just grappling, doing that BJJ stuff that grapplers do.

**Moret via Sub**

**Welterweight**

**Alex Morono (15-5-1, NS) v Zak Ottow (17-6-0, NS)** - An interesting match up, that's for sure. **Morono** surprised me when he fought Kenan Song last year, that fight was an absolute banger, Morono absolutely schooled Song, those combo's, the range finding, the head movement, it was all perfect and i hope he sticks with that because holy shit. I didn't have the best of opinions on Morono until that fight, now i honestly feel like he's got Ottow easily... but wait, there's more! **Ottow** hasnt really faced and defeated anyone major in a long time, he fought Dwight Grant but otherwise no one really worth mentioning, which is kinda sad because shit, he's faced a lot of people, he did defeat Pyle but i mean, Pyle was a walking zombie anyway. Ottow is a very well rounded fighter but is at the moment somewhat fodder for other fighters. The Sam Alvey of the Welterweight division, probably. 

**Morono via KO**

**Bantamweight**

**Louis Smolka (15-5-0, 4 FWS) v Matt Schnell (11-4-0, 2 FWS)** - You know, i always thought **Smolka** was a kinda shit fighter, but his temporary leave from the UFC was well worth it, he came back roaring in with a beautiful submission against newcomer and prospect Su Mudaerji, it was beautiful because before that, the last time we saw Smolka, he was crying and saying he couldn't do it anymore, fuck yeah Smolka, you did it. you dang diddily doogle did it. Smolka is pretty great on the ground, he's not so much good on his feet though so whenever the opportunity is there, he takes the fight to the ground with relative ease. I like his story, i don't like what he's been through but he's the perfect example of don't walk away from your dreams because you never know what you can accomplish. **Schnell** is a strange case, probably just some dude that's in the UFC, there's not much significance behind him other than he got knocked out in both his debut and the fight after that, i dont know if that literally knocked some sense in to him but he won his last two fights. I'm not sure how he will perform against Smolka, the new Smolka, Smolka 2.0, but it will be interesting to see what he does.

**Smolka via UD**

**Heavyweight**

**Maurice Greene (6-2-0, NS) v Jeff Hughes (D) (10-1-0, 4 FWS)** - What the fuck, this is a rematch? that's kinda rare to see a rematch in a prelim, this is awesome, it tells a bit of a story. These guys fought each other before, recently in fact, how much did both fighters improve? well, i feel like Hughes only had one fight in whilst Greene had multiple as well as multiple mini camps from the TUF series. Plus, Greene has personal problems that i can feel for, coping with family stuff through not-so-very-good means... Idk, lots of heart in this one. Greene also is a great first round fighter, he has zero cardio but otherwise is great in the first round whether its striking or wrestling, he's got it. **Hughes** is a question mark for me, he's a debuting fighter, i havent seen Greene v Hughes yet, but im basically about to see it this weekend. It's gonna be a great fight regardless because we get to see Greene develop, and we've seen him develop on TUF so there's that curiosity there as well. 

**Greene via Sub**

**Featherweight**

**Grant Dawson (D) (12-1-0, 3 FWS) v Julian Erosa (22-6-0, NS)** - I don't know all too much about either fighter to be honest. **Dawson** has great submission skills and is a winner of DWTNCS, winning of course by submission, he seems somewhat quick on the ground and able to lock in a submission at a click of a finger, he is very much a finisher which makes it interesting to see him in the UFC now, against tougher and tougher opponents. The only problem is that Dawson hasnt fought for a little over a year, whether that is due to injury, personal shit or just no fights, i don't know, but regardless i don't know where he has improved. **Erosa** is a funky tall dude that has great striking and grappling, he lost his debut to a strong striker but i feel like he's gonna make a comeback and he indeed has a height advantage over Dawson, so his striking could be troublesome for Dawson, but i mean, Dawsons not gonna strike Erosa, he's gonna take him down and grapple him. It's going to be an interesting fight regardless and we're all gonna learn a little from each fighter. 

**Dawson via Sub**

**Women's Bantamweight**

**Marion Reneau (#6) (9-4-1, NS) v Yana Kunitskaya (11-4-1, NS)** - This is an interesting fight, and im a huge fan of Kunitskaya so uh, slight bias here. **Reneau** is a strong grappler, she prefers the ground game over the striking lifestyle, she does strike, don't get me wrong, but i mean, anyone can strike, and she's on the level of ""anyone"". her grappling though is quite advanced and is very dangerous, especially for Kunitskaya who is mostly a striker, who kinda lacks in the grappling skill. Reneau doesn't really explode either when it comes to taking down her opponents, she moreso trips her opponents, there's not much explosiveness on her. **Kunitskaya** made her debut last year when she fought Cyborg, it was a piss poor performance but i mean, its Cyborg, you can't really get past her.. Anyway, Kunitskaya is still a dangerous striker, very powerful and snappy strikes and is very quick on the feet. She survived Lansbergs striking and that fight was honestly a ""yep, shes got something"" moment for me, and i honestly can't wait to see her fight again. 

**Kunitskaya via KO**

**Welterweight**

**Anthony Rocco Martin (15-4-0, 3 FWS) v Sergio Moraes (14-3-1, 2 FWS)** - Great fight here, perfect for a featured bout. **Martin** is a great striker, but an even better grappler, he's got kinda skinny arms so they can slip under the neck of some dude pretty easily. he's slick as fuck on the ground and just, knows what to do, once he's on the ground he's basically in the zone, zero panic and nothing but advancing through the positions. The same kinda goes for **Moraes**, extremely skilled submission artist, great knowledge on the ground, awesome at changing position and taking advantage of those positions... Moraes does the ground game pretty damn perfectly and it's going to be awesome to see him fight someone who is also very skilled on the ground, my eyes will be glued to the screen with a pen in my hand so i can write down whatever the fuck goes on on the ground, because when it comes to BJJ, i'm still a noob. 

**Moraes via Sub**

**Main Card**

**Middleweight**

**Tim Boetsch (21-12-0, NS) v Omari Akhmedov (17-4-1, NS)** - This fight seems mildly meh, and i rarely say that about fights these days but fuck it. **Boetsch** doesn't really have an impressive record, no big names he has faced, inconsistent win/loss ratio, he seems to be just a filler fighter at the moment, especially since losing to Antonio Carlos Junior, which is kinda eh, I don't know what to say about Boetsch to be honest, he's just okay. everything about him is okay. that's it. **Akhmedov** is kinda similar, he apparently has an ""International Master of Sport"" in Sambo and Hand to hand combat, i dont know what the absolute fuck that means, maybe he's friends with putin and they just gave him awards, but regardless, he's in the UFC now, we're stuck watching him fight some old dude, and his last finish was in 2015, so i don't know what to say about this fight, im drawing blanks, i can't make this one exciting...

**Akhmedov via KO**

**Lightweight**

**Beneil Dariush (15-4-1, NS) v Drew Dober (20-8-0, 3 FWS)** - **Dariush** has been around for a long time now, since his debut in 2014, he fought 19 times, that's a solid amount of times, he's got a strong work ethic and he's very well rounded, but i don't know if he's capable of being big in the UFC, he lost recently against Hernandez, and won against newcomer Moises, so maybe he is kinda ready, but still needs development, but regardless, he's still a young dude and has a long way to go, and i can see him going on for years to come, unless the UFC cuts him for some reason. **Dober** has been racking up wins over the last two years, with exceptional performances against those like Josh Burkman and Camacho, so like, he's on a hot streak at the moment, he's an excellent striker and grappler, he's very well rounded and i feel like Dariush is just a very tough opponent to fight, so this will be a very true test of skill and endurance if this fight keeps going to the 3rd round. 

**Dober via UD**

**Heavyweight**

**Blagoy Ivanov (#15) (16-2-1, NS) v Ben Rothwell (36-10-0, NS)** - Goddamn this fight is gonna be sick. **Ivanov** is a very strong grappler, he throws his opponents with relative ease, he just, man handles them, he ground and pounds them into a mist, he throws them and trips them to absolutely frustrate the shit outta them, but either way he's a very dominating fighter, he doesn't stop. He's new to the UFC and recently faced JDS and went all the way last year, it was great to see but JDS ultimately schooled him. **Rothwell** on the other hand is a huge, huge finisher, whether its on the ground or on the feet, he is very comfortable on both and has absolute power in his hands, and great speed and technique on the ground, he's a perfect mix of power, explosiveness, and technique and it's so beautiful to watch him put away opponents. He doesn't fight all too much, mostly due to the fact he's a juicy slut, but hopefully he's clean now, and is a clean fighter for a long time to come. 

**Rothwell via KO**

**Welterweight**

**Tim Means (28-10-1, NS) v Niko Price (12-2-1, NS)** - The ultimate brawl. This is going to be a generic prediction. Both fighters are excellent strikers, the best in terms of biting down on the mouth piece and just swinging, and it's beautiful to see because well, swang and bang for 3 rounds is a sight to see, but both of these guys pack absolute power and i don't see it going past round 2, because if both fighters just strike and strike and strike, this could be a FOTY contender and holy shit what a fight that would be. I might lean towards Price because he's more methodical with his striking and might counter Means better. 

**Price via KO**

**Co-Main**

**Welterweight**

**Elizeu Zaleski dos Santos (#14) (20-5-0, 6 FWS) v Curtis Millender (17-3-0, 9 FWS)** - Fucking wow, this is an incredible fight. **Zaleski dos Santos** is an excellent, excellent striker, he's so relaxed and chill on the feet, he stance switches with such ease and loads up combo's after combo's like he's a KFC commercial. Such an entertaining fighter, one hell of a contender for a top rank fight for sure. **Millender** is a great striker, hes long and excellent at striking at range, he throws great kicks and he's very snappy with his strikes, his ground game isnt really there but i mean, who needs ground game when you can knock out a dude with a slick head kick? Millender isn't high on the ranking and he's only fighting dos Santos because he's a huge up and comer who is on a very mean streak. Regardless, this fights gonna be sexy. 

**Zaleski dos Santos via KO**

**Main Card**

**Heavyweight**

**Derrick Lewis (#3) (21-6-1, NS) v Junior Dos Santos (#8) (20-5-0, 2 FWS)** - Strong bias with this one coz i bought the ""my balls was hot"" t-shirt and i feel like i just have to predict that Lewis will win, that and i love Lewis. **Lewis** isn't a martial artist by any means, he's a fighter, and that's it, he's a powerful, powerful striker, perhaps stronger than Ngannou, he's a great first round fighter, a decent second round fighter and a mixed bag in the third round. Regardless, Lewis hits hard, and if he lands on JDS, JDS is going to sleep. **JDS** is also a great striker, but he's more technical, more methodical, he is just, more of a fighter than Lewis is. He defeated champion after champion, Miocic, Mir, Hunt, Velasquez, the four big names in the heavyweight division, all defeated by JDS, and he recently defeated the young dog in Tuivasa who was on a very mean streak before the loss. JDS is a Heavyweight king and he's about to be dethroned by the Black Beast, AWOOOOOOOO

**Lewis via KO**

**Who do you think will win the main event?**

Well, um, i'm back. Came off a really rough day going like 2-7 and the next day had these 3 picks above which I was super confident in. The Cavs and Pistons played each other and it was a 30 point game at halftime, not the script I was looking for, so Osman and Drummond only played like 2 and a half quarters which was quite unfortunate. Tobias was just brutal. Scored 16 in the first half in like 17 minutes, and proceeds to play every fucking minute of the second half, and score 1 point during the first 23 minutes of the half before hitting a 3 and leaving us a bucket short. The amount of usage he got was absurd, and he managed to miss every shot. This like 8u loss over the course of two days absolutely destroyed my morale. Overall, we are over 50% on bets but the units aren't looking to great. Took a few days off to collect myself, but baby we back.

**DeMar DeRozan o12 RA 1.15u @-115**

**LaMarcus Aldridge o21.5 pts 1.2u @-120**

Oh baby, props against the Spurs have treated me well this year, and props on the Spurs have treated me well this year. Just gonna have one blurp on this. So the Spurs on the road have a bad rep, but a large part of that is their defense. Odds are this game is a lot closer than a Spurs-Hawks game should be, but we are going to take advantage of that. The Spurs are coming off back to back wins against the Thunder and Nuggets, are kinda feeling themselves. The implied total for the Spurs this game is around 120, which is high as fuck. This is a beautiful pace up spot for the Spurs who rank 24th in pace, versus an Atlanta team that recently moved into the #1 spot for pace in the NBA. I also love this game because of the injuries going on: Poetl is out, Dedmon is out, Spellman is out. Starting on the Spurs side, the only active big man on the Spurs besides LMA, is two-wayer Drew Eubanks.

* Aldridge is going to be pushing 40 minutes tonight, which he showed he could do a few games ago playing 39 minutes against the Pistons bigs. On the Hawks side, Omari Spellman, the backup PF, and Dedmon, the starting center are both out, leaving a probable John Collins and Alex Len as the two healthy big man (besides Alex Poythress haha). LMA will most likely be starting at C, against Len who is a very average center DRPM ranking in the middle of the 67 eligible players. But because of how short the Hawks are, odds are wee are going to get LMA being guarded by John Collins sometimes, who is the third worst defending PF according to DRPM. Aldridge has hit this point total in 4 straight, including against the Thunder and Nuggets with talented defensive big men in Adams and Jokic, and the Spurs will need him to step up tonight in a depleted matchup.
* DeRozan is averaging 2.6 ppg more on the road this year, has hit this point total in 4/6 since the all star break, and is averaging 22.8-7.2-6 since then as well. Even with White back, he's still a primary ball handler for the team, getting 8, 7, and 7 assists with in the last 3. His RA total since the all-star break is 12, 13, 7, 21, 13, 13, and a game with minimal big men and a high pace is great for the rebound total. He is also going against an Atlanta sf defense that is 7th worst in Defense v Position. Spurs are gonna need their two stars to ball out tonight, and they sure as hell will. At least 2/3 of these props have hit in every game since the All-Star break, let's ride the wave.

BOL to all! Let me know if you appreciate and/or used the analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

Before UFC 235, I implemented the Whole-History Rating system and ran it on a dataset of \~14,000 fights from the top 20 promotions and used it to post predictions here. The result was 8/12 fights correctly predicted.

You can find those posts here for more information on what I'm doing:

Predictions: [https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/awhyzr/wholehistory\_rating\_predictions\_for\_ufc\_235/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/awhyzr/wholehistory_rating_predictions_for_ufc_235/)

Results: [https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/awrbxr/wholehistory\_rating\_ufc\_235\_prediction\_results/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/awrbxr/wholehistory_rating_ufc_235_prediction_results/)

&amp;#x200B;

After those predictions I concluded to make two changes;

**1)** Increase the size of the data set to include more regional organisations, since I was lacking data for most of the fights the rating system got wrong (such as J. Walker).

**2)** Increase the rate at which fighters move up/down the ratings, since it is likely that by doing so, some of the predictions of close fights (even correct predictions) would have been more accurate with this change.

&amp;#x200B;

Since that event, I've expanded my data set to include \~110,000 fights. It took me three days to process and there's a lot of errors in the data, so I'll be collecting it again, but that won't be ready in time for the upcoming event, so I decided to provide the predictions from the data I collected in the hope that any errors are small enough to not impact the actual predictions.

&amp;#x200B;

As with before, there are some caveats that I want to make as clear as possible to avoid confusion or frustration;

*- I did not invent the rating system, I simply implemented it for MMA. Google 'Whole-History Rating' to read more about the system.*

*- I have NOT updated the rate at which fighters move up/down the rankings, I want to test the larger data set before I make that change so I can see if it's still needed.*

*- These ratings only take into account whether someone Won/Drew/Lost and when they did so, nothing else.*

*- A negative rating is NOT bad, the ratings go further below 0 than they go above it and if I'm lacking data for a fighter, they will almost certainly get a lower rating than they should (and I do still lack a lot of data).*

*- The system is still a WIP, I'm tweaking it with every event, if it predicts a stupid outcome, it's not some conscious choice I have made, it's a flaw in the data or variables (or method). The system cannot use the 'eye test', so promising prospects will be rated lower than they otherwise would be.*

***- The rating you see is not the only variable, there is also a variable determining uncertainty about that rating, depending on the information available. If someone is rated higher than someone else, the uncertainty could mean that they are really actually below them, but the system just expects them to be roughly at that rating. This is really important to note and I didn't mention it before, for (a really really basic) example:***

***Fighter one is rated 1000, with an uncertainty of +/- 200Fighter two is rated 900, with an uncertainty of +/- 50***

***It means the system thinks fighter one is probably better than fighter two, but they might not be. The 'true' rating for fighter one could be 800, while the 'true' rating for fighter two might be 950.***

&amp;#x200B;

I will also provide the betting favourites at the time of writing (based on bet365, since that's what I use when I want to throw money away) since last time round the betting lines predicted 8/12 just as this system did (although not the same 8/12) and there were multiple comments about this.

&amp;#x200B;

So here are the predictions for...

# UFC Fight Night: Lewis vs. dos Santos

&amp;#x200B;

This time around, almost all of the fights are very close if not extremely close and as far as the rating system is concerned, pretty much a 50/50. If any of the pick 'em fights are predicted wrong, I'm not going to be discouraged by it. I am a little worried that it's almost picked the underdog in every fight, so there's a good chance that this time it'll result in a 2/13 or something awful like that, in which case I'll probably revert to the smaller dataset and see if that would have predicted it better. Please remember these are a massive work in progress.

I've added the predictions of the previous set of data where it is different to the new data, so a direct comparison can be made.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT: Please let me know if you'd rather I post odds instead of ratings in future? The rating system has the ability to provide theoretical odds for fights that also take into account uncertainty and time since last competing. I've only avoided them as I simply haven't programmed a quick way to calculate them, but if people are interested, I'd happily do that for the next event.** 

I'm posting these ratings each time to let people observe, suggest and comment as I configure the rating system, the system is nowhere near configured and each event is trial and error. I can't say that these are accurate predictions, only that I will continue to improve the accuracy whenever they are inaccurate, failure is actually more helpful right now than success is :)

Bonus:

Here's the top 10 current fighters based on this rating system, including only those who have fought in the last year (remember, there's incorrect data and I actually cancelled this run part way through so I could add these, so differences \~100 could easily flip over when I run the whole thing, I just thought I'd post them for a bit of fun).Please also note, these ratings are mostly only relative to their weight class, not quite as relative to each other, please don't read too much into them.

I like to base my races on certain aspects of real life civilizations. 

There are 12 Great Races on Aldaria, each created by one of the Twelve God-Titans.

\- The Humans were created by  Vorlin the Glorybringer, God of the Day and Titan of Dawn. I like the idea of their civilization being like a roman-Empire thing. In where the ""honor"" is really important but sometimes they forget other important things.

\-The Vaelari were created by Theia the Dreamweaver, Goddess of the Night and Titan of Dusk. They are mostly a clan-based society. They are mostly nomads, although some live in the cities. The Chief is the leader of each Clan, but the Dreamer, a shaman capable of watching into the World of the Dreams and seeing bits of the future, is sometimes more important in the society. They have humanoid forms, with white or silver hair, blueish grey skin and glowy blue eyes. They also have tattoos all over their skins.

\-The Selestials were created by Seles the Judge, Goddess of Justice and Titan of Law. They are winged humanoid creatures (like an angel but more ""human"") with really pale skin. They have a nomocracy, a government based on the rule of law, and guided by the Argentum Codex, source of all laws and rules, the Angeari Council and the Aspect of Justice, an avatar of Seles' power.

\-The Daemons were created by Ashramae the Trickster, God of Chaos and Titan of Entropy. Their civilization is a gothic-like monarchy. Their society is really divided by titles and royal blood, where the Azzarai nobles and the King are the most powerful. There exists a lot of different types of Daemons, for example the simple-minded fiends, the grotesque bezari, the gigantic wyvarghs, etcetera. Each type of daemon have their own physiology, but the Azzarai nobles are humanoids with grey or black skin, horns, fangs and the most powerful ones have bat-like wings.

\-The Zhajin were created by Lereas the Fatetwister, Goddess of Fate and Titan of Luck. They have an asian-like culture (a combination of chinese and japanese). They are a semi-amphibian race of humanoids, that can breath on the water but most of the times prefer the land. They live generally on islands, rivers and sometimes swamps. They have blueish skin.

\-The Ssysk were created by Raltia the Stormcaller, Goddess of Thunder and Titan of Spontaneity. They are a serpent/lizard humanoid race, and their civilizations is based on the Aztec Empire. They are a really advanced civilizations because they use the Gift of Raltia, gigantic storms charged with almost unlimited energy, to power their constructs and create new technology.

\-The  Golgar were created by Maladar the Watcher, God of Death and Titan of Decay. They are skeletal humanoids. They live deep underground in cities called Tombs. They do not go to the surface often and sometimes, the Tombs stay sealed for long periods of time. They are a really mysterious race.

\-The Omari were created by Aradis the Sage, God of Knowledge and Titan of Magic. They are a humanoid race with antlers. They wear masks and cover their mouths and faces. 

\-The Drakkal were created by Valthalar the Warrior, God of Battles and Titan of Carnage. They are draconic humanoids that can ascend and become full dragons. They have an ancient-egypt civilization and revere the Suns.

\-The Earthens were created by Tarn the Forger, God of Craftmanship and Titan of Construction. They are big humanoid creatures with big beards and a ragged earth-like skin. They are really good artificers and smiths.

\-The Vatir were created by Elarai the Binder, Goddess of  Oaths and Titan of Solidarity. They are a race of fox-like humanoids.

\-The Na'ari were created by Naeo the Singer, Goddess of Nature and Titan of Wilderness. They are humanoid creatures attuned to an element. There exists the Forest, Plains, River and Mountain Na'ari, each different from the others. They tend to be really protective of their homes and the nature.

&amp;#x200B;

What i would really appreciate are some ideas to improve my races. For example, the Omari, Drakkal, the Earthens, the Vatir and the Na'ari are the ones that lack the most characterization. Also take on mind that not all the race is like the stereotype of it. Of course there exists dishonorable humans, evil selestials, gentle daemons, stupid omari, etc

&amp;#x200B;

The thread is back after a few week hiatus, just in time for the return to Defiant Wrestling, and to his hometown Newcastle, of reigning **Open the Dream Gate Champion**, **PAC**. The world renowned star, and more, are available to view for free on YouTube!

&amp;#x200B;

Announced for the show:

&amp;#x200B;

# PAC vs Robbie X (Main Event):

The hometown hero **PAC** will go one on one with the exciting, debuting **Robbie X** in a non title match. Following on from his last appearance in Defiant where PAC demanded more competition, Defiant have drafted in a newcomer, Robbie X, who has impressed up and down the country, including being a major player on last summers WoS Wrestling. Could Robbie X pull off the victory of his life, or will PAC's hunt for competition he deems worthy of him continue? 

&amp;#x200B;

# El Phantasmo vs Omari:

The next contender for the **Defiant Internet Championship**, **El Phantasmo** will go one on one with the young but extremely gifted **Omari**. After being unable to compete at **Unstoppable**, El Phantasmo will get his title match at **Magnificent Seven** so needs to keep his momentum going. Omari, on the other hand, is coming off a devastating loss to **Nathan Cruz** at Unstoppable, and without a match of his own for Magnificent Seven, will want a win here to try and force himself into the Internet Championship picture. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Magnificent Seven field rounded off:

The namesake match of the **Magnificent Seven** show, the match, which features seven competitors, with the winner able to challenge for ANY title of their choosing at ANY time, will have its final 2 competitors announced tonight. Who will join **Visage**, **Los Federales Super Santos Jr**, **Man Like Dereiss**, **Benji**, and the debuting **MJF**?

&amp;#x200B;

# John Klinger vs Adam Foster w/ Simon Miller:

Today I'm going to update my rookie rankings, but will do it a little bit differently this time. I'm going to use tiers to show where I have each player right now. 

This class has been intriguing, so here's where I have every player.

() current overall NBA ranking

**Tier 1: Clear Rookie of the Year/Probable All Star by 2021**

*Luka Doncic (27)*

The hype is with Trae right now, but Luka is the clear ROTY. 

**Tier 2: Top 100 Players/Probable All Stars by 2022**

*DeAndre Ayton (79), Trae Young (92)*

The gap between Ayton and Young is closing rapidly and Young has surged into the top 100. Ayton doesn't have hype but 16/10 averages as a 20 year old with plenty of room to grow, I could see a sophomore leap.

As for Young, his play of late needs no introduction. He had early season struggles but he's come onto the national scene with a bang.

**Tier 3: Top 125 Players/Still Raw but holy shit they could be scary in 2-3 years**

*Marvin Bagley III (111), Jaren Jackson Jr (116)*

Bagley hasn't been able to stay healthy the whole season but he averaged 18/9 in February. A trio of Fox/Hield/Bagley for the Kings is looking nice.

JJJ still has scary long term potential but is raw right now and there's a chance he misses the rest of the season.

**Tier 4: Top 175 Players/by 2021 good chance they are top 100 players**

*Collin Sexton (156), Shai Gilgeous Alexander (168), Wendell Carter Jr (175)*

Sexton averaged 19 PPG in February. Although on only 40% shooting, he's been slowly progressing.

SGA had a slow month and had a 1-17 shooting slump at one point last month. But he's shown enough to where progression should be expected next season.

WCJ is still injured, but he should look nice next to Markkanen once he comes back.

**Tier 5: Top 200 Players/potential for top 100 eventually**

*Landry Shamet (195), Allonzo Trier (198)*

Shamet is averaging 11 PPG for the Clippers so far. He could be a Lou Williams type player long term.

Trier is inconsistent, but in Feb he did average 11 PPG on 49% shooting. But it's more like a 20 point one game, and 5 the next type month. Still, he has nice skills and I see a low end top 100 ceiling.

**Tier 6: Potential, Potential, POTENTIAL**

*Mitchell Robinson (217), Mikal Bridges (220)*

Mitchell Robinson had himself a month in Feb with 11/9 and 3 BPG. As with Trier, he can still be inconsistent, but he's rapidly rising and with more consistency next year I see him as a top 150 player.

Bridges has talent, his minutes are up, and he's averaged over 2 SPG since February. He's a round peg going into a square hole, he deserves better than what he's getting in Phoenix. His long range shooting needs to improve but he's consistently moving up over time.

**Tier 7: Very nice role players, potential for top 100 in 5 ish years but who knows maybe sooner**

*Kevin Huerter (231), Miles Bridges (232), Josh Okogie (236)*

Huerter is a good fit long term next to Trae and is averaging 43% from 3 since February. Still only 20 years old, his game fits today's era and I could see top 150-175 overall in 2019-2020.

Bridges is a unique talent and has very good long term potential as a nice role player. I could see him making the low end top 100 overall sometime in his career.

Okogie is averaging 9 PPG in 2019 and his offensive efficiency is slowly matching his defensive potential. If that happens he could be a Donovan Mitchell type player. That is a big if though.

**Tier 8: Potential that is just potential right now**

*Mohamed Bamba (249), Chandler Hutchison (253), Kevin Knox (259), Rodions Kurucs (269)*

Bamba has probably been the biggest let down as a rookie. Vucci Man turned into a top 25 overall talent randomly so good for Orlando but bad for Bamba's development and it doesn't help he's injured right now.

Hutchison is an interesting player. Incredible IQ, low key incredible athleticism, his skills just aren't developed yet. I would even argue top 100 potential long term. He was averaging 29 MPG in 2019 before getting injured and he's now up to about 40 days missed. Which was unfortunate because he was starting to get into a groove. 

Kevin Knox has shot at least 50% in a game ONCE in the last 19 games. I understand rookies need time to grow but that's MCW level. He still will just be turning 20 right before next season and I could see him improving, but the scale he has to improve on is more difficult than some might think.

Kurucs averaged 10 PPG from December-January but his minutes were cut once last month came around. Good IQ, good skills, once his confidence comes around we could see a nice surge in 2019-2020.

**Tier 9: Very solid long term role player potential/top 300 overall**

*Jalen Brunson (275), Bruce Brown (293)*

Brunson averaged 12/4/4 with solid efficiency in February. Can be inconsistent, but last game vs. Indiana was the best of his season. He could either be a DJ Augustin type starter or one of the best 2nd string PG's in the NBA.

Bruce Brown has low key started 35 games this year. 11th most starts among rookies. He has a long way to go but his athleticism is nice and he's clearly a team player. 

**Tier 10: The Rest**

Monte Morris was ranked outside of my top 500 last year as a rookie and he's in contention for a top 100 spot for this season overall. You just never know who could make a name for themselves and likely some of these players will going forward.

*Kenrich Williams (305), Omari Spellman (321), Jonah Bolden (322), De'Anthony Melton (335), Donte DiVincenzo (337), Frank Jackson (339), Svi Mykhailiuk (341), Troy Brown Jr (345), Isaiah Briscoe (348), Devonte' Graham (349), Aaron Holiday (350), Elie Okobo (351), Hamidou Diallo (353), Robert Williams (357), Gary Clark (359), Brad Wanamaker (374), Jevon Carter (375), Theo Pinson (383), Moritz Wagner (384), Deonte Burton (388), Jerome Robinson (394), Jaron Blossomgame (395), Grayson Allen (396), Khyri Thomas (401), Ryan Broekhoff (405), Jacob Evans (407), Shake Milton (408), Chimezie Metu (412), Isaiah Hartenstein (413), Jonathan Williams (416), Keita Bates Diop (420), Marcus Derrickson (433), Melvin Frazier Jr (436), Drew Eubanks (437), Lonnie Walker IV (439), Anfernee Simons (441), Yuta Watanabe (444), Alize Johnson (446), Isaac Bonga (447), Jared Terrell (451), Jaylen Adams (452), Mitchell Creek (454), Dzanan Musa (455), Brandon Goodwin (456), Deng Adel (457), Gary Trent Jr (458), Jaylen Morris (459), Thomas Welsh (460), Jarred Vanderbilt (463), Brandon Sampson (465), Julian Washburn (466), Emanuel Terry (469), Daryl Macon (471), Troy Caupain (473), Zach Lofton (474), Trevon Duval (476), Amile Jefferson (477), Rawle Alkins (478), Duncan Robinson (479), Ray Spalding (483), JP Macura (485), Haywood Highsmith (486), Jordan Loyd (487), Vince Edwards (478), Devaughn Akoon-Purcell (490), Angel Delgado (491), Tahjere McCall (495), Donte Grantham (499), Jordan Sibert (500), Tyler Davis (502), George King (503), Joe Chealey (504), Bonzie Colson (507)*

----

# Description

**Name:** Omari

**Gender:** Male

**Position:** Sniper

He has trained himself to be ambidextrous. He's laidback and mild-mannered, often lazy, and is (annoyingly) patient. Likes to read and prefers to remain in the background.

# Stats

Trion = 7

Sniper = 10

Mobility = 8

Strategy = 8

Special Techniques = 7

# Trigger Set

Main | Sub
---------|----------
Lightning | Shield
Egret | Bagworm
Shield | Teleporter
Bagworm | Grasshopper

# Special Techniques

**Short Warp:** The ability to [teleport only 2 or 3 meters, which can be used multiple times in quick succession due to the cooldown being only 0.5 seconds](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ryexGQksZBc/WLxUbG6n90I/AAAAAAAAkYs/ySQ4Jp5X1uEUXuLoZe7OIoqWNom6UsoLQCHM/s16000/0048-019.png) (still long enough for the opponent to spot the OC). (*costs 2*)

**Quick Switch:** The ability to activate or swap Triggers in the blink of an eye, changing range and switching from attack to defense and vice versa instantaneously. What this means is that there is almost no difference between activating a Trigger from either column when none is active and switch from one to another, whereas for everyone else, switching Triggers take longer than activating one when no other from that same column is active. (*costs 2.5*)

**More Speed:** The user can [fire with a high rate without sacrificing accuracy](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WNMGqdzOLWQ/WLxHM0j907I/AAAAAAAAiFI/UKuyEJxxrpM92siot5yxFqOyblYNMHHVgCHM/s16000/0114-011.png). It is useful [against focused defenses](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AExgOaZzhvo/WLxDrkWznfI/AAAAAAAAhco/cSZMo-b0iTM_PVsX3PnzCIUvXeRvSV_5gCHM/s16000/0114-002.png). (*costs 2.5*)

# Fighting Style

Omari specialises in shooting moving targets while he is in movement. Ideally, he spends most of the time in hiding (bagworm), locating other people and moving around the map, then shooting at multiple targets before disappearing again. He'll usually start without lightning, but with a bagworm on. He isn't too worried about his opponents being close and he always maps out escape routes and remains calm. However, he prefers to defend using his mobility or (especially in duels with attackers) with distance. He uses grasshopper and teleporter for attacking and escaping, and is good at using them together (eg, feinting with grasshopper, then teleporting away) it also allows him to retain some mobility even with the loss of a limb. The double bagworm is mainly to allow for two different things:

Mobile stealth - Bagworm and Teleporter/Grasshopper

Mobile offence - Lightning and Teleporter/Grasshopper (with only one bagworm you either couldn't shoot and use bagworm or use grasshopper/teleporter and lightning at the same time).

# Special Techniques

**Vault:** The OC can [launch themselves and/or an ally up into the air](http://93.190.142.23/manga/World-Trigger/0170-007.png) by causing a shield to rise from under their feet. The maximum height that can be achieved corresponds roughly to a [five/six-story building](http://93.190.142.23/manga/World-Trigger/0170-008.png). (*costs 0.5*)

**Shape Modification:** The ability to [alter the shape of Shield after it has been cast](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yMWiSbfa4Cc/WLxG1evUg4I/AAAAAAAAiBA/8ava2wKxLmoPJ4GPf-bUbL0W40h22WO4wCHM/s16000/0112-010.png). (*costs 0.5*)

**Shrapnel:** The ability to [make individual bullets immobile after dividing the trion cube](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Jta14f_7z8Q/WLxJOVMRaeI/AAAAAAAAibc/LFGlawxTpOI4Z7IGPO60hD-qARkzoPMhQCHM/s16000/0099-016.png), so as to lay explosive traps that are even harder to spot even while fighting. (*costs 1*)

**Interceptor:** The user can [predict where an enemy with Teleporter will materialize](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pu8y_taco20/WLxRKbZUxGI/AAAAAAAAjz8/oBFeunyrS6EGN1W-11FrFHbJc6AJtv15QCHM/s16000/0030-013.png), provided they can guess if a long-range or a short-range warp was used and they can see where the enemy was facing. (*costs 1*)

**Mock Gunner:** The ability to use Sniper Triggers proficiently even [at Gunner range](http://93.190.142.23/manga/World-Trigger/0171-019.png). (*costs 2.5*)

**Eruption:** The OC can cause a single barrier to emerge from underneath or close to the opponent [to unbalance them and push them away. It is also possible to eject it out of the opponent's body](https://img.mangashow.me/upload/766b7c86599dcaa8a579b8af5ba36c99.jpeg) through direct contact [to hinder them](https://img.mangashow.me/upload/9403b787f3e08ffeb3e1816fd4442710.jpeg), although there is the concrete risk of failing and losing one's hand. (*costs 1.5*)

**Spring Walls:** The ability to [surround an enemy with Escudo](http://93.190.142.23/manga/World-Trigger/0171-005.png). Although it is easy to leap out of, it briefly restricts their movement and makes their escape predictable, unless the environment allows them to tunnel through the ground instead. It consumes a lot of trion. (*costs 1*)

**Trip Hazard:** The OC can create smaller barriers than usual usual as trip hazards. (*costs 0.5*)

**Pants on Fire:** The ability to [shout the name of a different Gunner Trigger](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5i_r3mgRlLY/WLxI9tWlqcI/AAAAAAAAiYs/VTjjahe5o4ABSAPRuFj53hFRcuz1S8ROQCHM/s16000/0155-016.png) than the one being used, increasing chances of injuring less observant enemies. (*costs 0.5*)

Broman starts by constantly switching between chameleon and bagworm. He does this while searching for the best and safest spot available. He sets up traps with meteora pieces lying around. He uses meteora traps in a unique way. He leaves entire cubes lying all over the place. When the enemy comes anywhere near a meteora cube, he shoots it with a shot with lightning while pretending to aim for the person. Sometimes he even pretends to shoot the cube but actually aims for his opponent. Whenever he needs to cause more damage, he uses asteroid and hound. He also has escudo which he generally only uses to defend himself. However, if he needs to, he can use it to vault himself up and even surround his opponent with them. In mid-range, he uses chameleon to sneak around the enemy and attacks with asteroid and meteora. Against attackers, he uses escudo in a unique way. He first creates a wall underneath his opponent, and if that fails, he creates another escudo that hits and unbalances his opponent. Then, while his opponent is still unbalanced, he attacks with hound, while setting the range to be low while power and speed are set to be high. He is notorious for his use of trip hazards, which he uses while creating smokescreens with meteora.

He has recently learned pants on fire. He uses this to disguise meteora as hound. He uses spring wall to unbalance his opponent, then uses a full cube meteora disguised as hound that he'll send above his opponent. Since his opponent thinks it's hound, he/she will use a normal sheild as hound doesn't cause much damage. Broman will then activate the meteora with asteroid, causing a giant explosion.

Fighters already selected will be BOLDED in the spreadsheet.

And here's a list of all picks if you can't get to Excel and need to pick. This will also be updated, likely a few times per round (or whenever I'm online). I'd add the list of available fighters in here too, but there are 600+ and you'd be scrolling for days.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;***Carson Beck‍ - 6’4, 226 LBS from FL – 4\* prospect with a 0.9365 Rating as a QB (Pro)***  
&gt;  
&gt;""Mr. Florida"" 2018 visited on 2/2/2018 and then decommitted from Alabama. While he is listed as a ""Pro-Style"" QB, from what I had read and seen, he does have the ability to run. Maybe not a power runner, but definitely a ""willing"" runner and probably more comparable to Will Grier’s running ability. He has some pretty impressive offers, but right Florida appears to be in the lead and they hope to get him back on campus for the OB game (if not sooner).

&amp;#x200B;

**RUNNING BACK – With Perine leaving after the 2019 season and uncertainly about the health of Davis (back to back season ending injuries), Florida is going to been someone to step in and complete for that #2 role in 2020 and an elite recruit could do that…or at least snag that #3 rotation spot. Florida probably needs at least 1 elite prospect at this position this cycle.**

&gt;***Demarkcus Bowman – 5’11, 186 LBS‍ from FL – 5\* prospect with a 0.9858 Rating as a HB***  
&gt;  
&gt;He also visited Florida on 2/2/2019 and is expected to visit again, with Beck, for the OB game. This is Florida’s best chance of landing an elite HB for the first-time sine Taylor in 2013, Florida appears to be in the lead right now.  
&gt;  
&gt;***EJ Smith‍ – 6’0, 190 LBS from TX – 4\* prospect with a 0.9589 Rating as a HB***  
&gt;  
&gt;The son of Emmitt Smith (Gator Great) is an elite prospect, but legacy recruits can be hard to predict because you never know if they want to follow footsteps or pave their own path.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Keyvone Lee – 6’0, 216 LBS from FL – 4\* prospect with a 0.9531 Rating as an ATH (HB)***  
&gt;  
&gt;This one-time Florida Commit (decommitted 2/22/19) originally committed to Florida back in March of 2018 and he has made 4 unofficial visits to Florida since (including Feb 2, 2019), but based on interviews it would appear that Florida was looking to move him to Linebacker and he would prefer to play running back.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Jo’Quavious Marks – 5’11, 190 LBS from GA – 4\* prospect with a 0.9483Rating as a HB***  
&gt;  
&gt;He was able to make an unofficial visit to Florida last season for a game and has also visited Georgia Tech, Tennessee (3), Clemson (2), Georgia, South Carolina, and Miami (2).

&amp;#x200B;

**WIDE RECEIVER – Probably the second most area of need this class as Florida has a mass exodus coming at the end of the 2019 season with at least 4 receivers graduating and in the last 2 cycles, Florida has only landed 2 elite prospects.  They need at least 1 recruit that can push for starting time in 2020 and 2 more that can rotate in and out during the 2020 season and be ready to start in 2021.  Good news is they have 1 elite prospect committed and are in good position for a few others.**

&gt;***Rakim Jarrett‍ – 6’0, 182 LBS from DC – 5\* prospect with a 0.9902 Rating as a WR***  
&gt;  
&gt;Florida is in his top six, but has yet to receive a visit. He has visited Penn State (2), Alabama, Ohio State, Clemson, Georgia, and Tennessee. but need to get him on campus. Looks like Florida has some work to do if they want to at least get a hat on the table.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Leonard Manuel‍ – 6’4, 200 LBS from FL – 4\* prospect with a 0.9858 Rating as a WR***  
&gt;  
&gt;Committed to Florida in January 2019, but has not shut things down. 2 weeks after committing to Florida was on campus at Clemson. He has also visited Florida 2/2/2018 with other elite 2020 prospects. He has the size and talent you want, I imagine getting Beck (QB) will help solidify his commitment to Florida.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Marc Britt‍ – 6’2, 190 LBS from FL – 4\* prospect with a 0.9549 rating as a WR***  
&gt;  
&gt;He has 4 back to back to back to back visits to Miami early during the 2018 season, but after a weekend unofficial visit to Florida in December, he decommitted from Miami…I’m sure the coaching change has something to do with that too. He has been back on the Miami campus and should be tough battle to get this talented recruit out of south Florida.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Malachi Wideman - 6’4, 180 LBS from FL – 4\* prospect with a 0.9505 rating as a WR***  
&gt;  
&gt;This recruit is out if Sarasota (Riverview HS, which was my HS) and is better known as a basketball talent and does not hold many offers for football. We shall see which path he commits to….  
&gt;  
&gt;***Ja'Khi Douglas - 5'9, 184 LBS from LA - 4\* prospect with a 0.9309 rating as a ATH***  
&gt;  
&gt;He has made several visits to multiple schools, including Mississipi State, Alabama, LSU (2), Florida (2), and A&amp;M.  However, one of his Florida visits was the watch the LSU game, so hard to know for sure if he is going to leave his home start...probably helps that we won that game!  
&gt;  
&gt;***Jaquavion Fraziars‍ – 6’4, 194 LBS from FL – 4\* prospect with a 0.9301 rating as a WR***  
&gt;  
&gt;This Florida commit (12/2018) has been on campus before and after his commitment. He has not made another other visits to this point and I would suspect the staff will push to have him on campus for the OB game.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Xzavier Henderson – 6’3, 180 LBS from FL – 4\* prospect with a 0.9067 rating as a WR***  
&gt;  
&gt;He has 5 visits to Miami (4 before the coaching change) and 3 visits to Florida, including a recent one in February. He has also recently visited Clemson (January) and Miami (February).  
&gt;  
&gt;***Aydin Henningham‍ - 6’1, 200 LBS from FL – 4\* prospect with a 0.9013 rating as a WR***  
&gt;  
&gt;He has unofficial visits to FSU, Miami (2), LSU, South Carolina but has not been on foot at Florida.

&amp;#x200B;

**TIGHT END – Florida is pretty health at the position right now, especially after securing Zipperer this past class. However, if Pitts moves to WR as expected, Florida will need at least 1 solid TE this cycle.**

&gt;***Elijah Yelverton – 6’5, 225 LBS from TX – 3\* prospect with a 0.8739 rating as a TE***  
&gt;  
&gt;Florida made an offer in September 2018, but at this point it does not appear that EY has made any visits to any schools, so TBD at this point where he ends up.

&amp;#x200B;

**OFFENSIVE LINE – Florida secured 7 lineman this past class, but no real elite prospects. While Florida is not in need of numbers right now, they do need to get at least 2 elite prospects this class to improve the overall quality at the position.**

&gt;***Omari Thomas‍ – 6’5, 301 LBS from TN – 4\* prospect with a 0.9677 rating as an OT***  
&gt;  
&gt;Thomas has made 3 unofficial visits to Ole Miss (back in March 2018) and has visited Tennessee (2), Clemson, Georgia, LSU, and an unofficial to Alabama (with a visit from Saban) it would appear that Florida is out the outside looking in on this prospect.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Jalen Rivers‍ – 6’5, 327 LBS from FL – 4\* prospect with a 0.9612 rating as an OT***  
&gt;  
&gt;He has made a total of 4 visits to Florida (1 during the Mac days) including visits in February 2019, May 2018 and February 2018. He has also made other unofficial visits to Miami (before the coaching change), FSU, Clemson, and LSU. He recently released his Top 5 and it included Florida.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Aaryn Parks‍ – 6’4, 294 LBS from MD – 4\* prospect with a 0.9442 rating as an OT***  
&gt;  
&gt;Florida was in his top five, but with 3 unofficial visits to Penn State and a coach visit from them as well, Florida has a significant amount of ground to make up if they want to be anything more than a hat on the table.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Marcus Dumervil‍ – 6’5, 300 LBS from FL – 4\* prospect with a 0.9430 rating as an OT***  
&gt;  
&gt;Florida has made an offer, but has not gotten him on campus as of yet. However, he has had 6 unofficial visits to Miami (5 before the coaching change) and has also made an unofficial visit to UCF. The staff seems interested but need to get him on campus quickly to have a chance.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Joshua Braun‍ – 6’6, 335 LBS from FL – 4\* prospect with a 0.9365 rating as an OT***  
&gt;  
&gt;He has 2 visits to FSU (all before the 2018 season, LOL) and 1 visit to Miami before their season. However, his last two visits were to Florida (October 2018 for the LSU game &amp; on February 2, 2019). Florida looks to be in a good spot right now and needs to get him on campus again to lock him in!  
&gt;  
&gt;***Sedrick Van Pran‍ – 6’4, 305 LBS from LA – 4\* prospect with a 0.9097 rating as an OC***  
&gt;  
&gt;Lots of offers, but very few visits. Aside from the Junior day visit he made to Alabama, he has not made any other campus visits…so this appears to be wide open. Florida was able to secure one of his teammates last class (Chester Kimbrough) so we shall see if that helps any going forward…  
&gt;  
&gt;***Issiah Walker - 6'4, 284 LBS from FL - 4\* prospect with a 0.9029 rating as a OT***  
&gt;  
&gt;Currently committed to South Carolina, that was prior to receiving offers from Miami, Florida, FSU and LSU.  Since that commitment, he has visited Florida (2) and Miami and South Carolina.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Jovens Janvier - 6'3, 350 LBS from FL - 4\* prospect with a 0.9000 rating as a OG***  
&gt;  
&gt;He decommitted from Louisville in December, 2 days after an unofficial visit to Florida.  He has also been to Miami 3 times during the 2018 season while he was committed to Louisville.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Jonathan Denis‍ – 6’3, 285 LBS from FL – 4\* prospect with a 0.8963 rating as an OG***  
&gt;  
&gt;It is hard to know for sure, but he made back to back to back visits to Miami from 9/22/2018 – 10/6/2018 and then decommitted from Miami. Hard to know if that is because of how poor they were playing or what, but it was before the coaching change. He has been back on the Mami campus twice since then and has not made any other visits. So, he seems like a Miami guy at this point

&amp;#x200B;

**Interior Defensive Line – Probably one of Florida’s biggest need positions considering they only secured 1 DT prospect in last year’s class. Florida needs at least 3 elite prospects this class.  Good news is that have 2 committed already!**

&gt;***Johnnie Brown – 6’2, 250 LBS from FL – 4\* prospect with a 0.9531 rating as a DT***  
&gt;  
&gt;Committed to Florida during his February 2, 2019 unofficial visit and he has not made any visits to any other schools to date…. seems pretty solid at this point.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Gervon Dexter – 6’6, 276 LBS from FL – 4\* prospect with a 0.9486 rating as a DT***  
&gt;  
&gt;Committed to Florida in November 2018 and made an unofficial visit to Florida in February 2, 2019. He has not made any other visits since he committed to Florida, but he has received offers from Alabama, A&amp;M and Miami.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Zykeivous Walker – 6’4, 255 LBS from GA – 4\* prospect with a 0.9449 rating as a SDE**  
&gt;  
&gt;Lots of activity going on here. He has unofficially visited to Florida, Clemson, Alabama, Georgia (2), Tennessee, and recently received a visit from Muschamp (SC). Florida is going to have to put in some work to get him back on campus.

&amp;#x200B;

**Linebacker / Rush End – Florida has a lot of talent lined up for the Rush position and this past recruiting cycle secured some solid talent at linebacker, but given that the heard of a defense in the SEC is the front 7, you always need to sure elite talent! Florida needs at least 2 elite linebackers and 1 elite rush/DE.**

&gt;***Sav’ell Smalls – 6’3, 230 LBS from WA – 5\* prospect with a 0.9975 rating as a OLB***  
&gt;  
&gt;He recently listed his Top 12 (which included Florida) but has a long list of elite schools. He has made unofficial visits to Washington, Oregon, Florida State, Florida, Sandford, UCLA, USC, and Alabama. Given that he is on the west coast, Florida is going to be at a disadvantage because visits are going to be hard to come by.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Fadil Diggs – 6’4, 225 LBS from NJ – 4\* prospect with a 0.9491 rating as a WDE/RUSH***  
&gt;  
&gt;He has made unofficial visits to Maryland, Virginia Tech, Penn State (2) and Ohio State, so Florida is going to have some work to do get this recruit on campus.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Chantz Williams – 6’3, 221 LBS from FL – 4\* prospect with a 0.9463 rating as WDE/RUSH***  
&gt;  
&gt;He has 3 unofficial visits to Florida, most recently in February 2018. However, he has also visited Miami (5 times, all before coaching change) and Florida State (3) and LSU (1).  
&gt;  
&gt;***Brandon Williams – 6’3, 220 LBS from LA – 4\* prospect with a 0.9086 rating as an OLB***  
&gt;  
&gt;He has 2 unofficial visits to Tennessee and LSU, and 1 visit to Alabama. Florida is going to need to get him on campus quickly to have a real chance of landing him.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Jayion McCluster - 6'1, 190 LBS from FL - 4\* prospect with a 0.9083 rating as a ILB***  
&gt;  
&gt;He has visited Miami (before the coaching change) and Florida and FSU.  Going to have to follow the next few visits on this one...may also come down to where he wants to play and which schools are willing to let him play that position.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Morven Joseph – 6’3, 210 LBS from FL – 3\* prospect with a 0.8739 rating as a WDE/RUSH***  
&gt;  
&gt;This Florida commit had his only unofficial visit on February 2, 2019 and committed a week later.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Josh Griffis – 6’4, 230 LBS from FL – 3\* prospect with a 0.8577 rating as a WDE/RUSH***  
&gt;  
&gt;This one-time Florida commit (decommitted - 2/20/2019) appears to be more in love with Florida than they are with him. Griffis was a hold over commitment from the prior staff (9/2017) and while he has visited the campus 5 times since the new staff has been on board, the ""love"" just does not seem to be there from the staff and Griffis has stated as much in interviews.

&amp;#x200B;

**Secondary – With defensive backs, it is hard to know where they will end up, so best to just group them together. Having said that, Florida will have a need for Safeties this class and less of a need for pure corners, especially given the recruits they landed in the 2019 class.**

&gt;***Fred Davis – 6’1, 182 LBS from FL – 4\* prospect with a 0.9811 rating as a CB***  
&gt;  
&gt;He has taken 2 unofficial visits to Florida, one in October 2018 for the LSU game and the other in April of 2018. He also took an unofficial to Clemson in January. He has also taken 2 unofficial visits to Miami, but not since the coaching change.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Miles Brooks - 6'2, 183 LBS from FL - 4\* prospect with a 0.9310 rating as a CB***  
&gt;  
&gt;He has visited Florida 4 times (1 during Mac's time), he also has visits to Miami and Alabama but has not made any visits since October of 2018 (which was to Florida for the LSU game).    
&gt;  
&gt;***Rashad Terrence II – 6’0, 195 LBS from GA – 4\* prospect with a 0.8963 rating as a S***  
&gt;  
&gt;This Florida Commit took 2 unofficial visits to Clemson in September and October. He also took 2 unofficial visits to Tennessee in November. But it took just 1 unofficial visit to Florida in December to secure commitment. Since then, he has made a second unofficial visit to Florida in February and has not made any other visits to other schools since his commitment.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Ethan Pouncey – 6’1, 160 LBS from FL – 3\* prospect with a 0.8333 rating as a CB***  
&gt;  
&gt;He has offers from FSU, Auburn, Alabama and Georgia, but his only visit thus far was been to Florida on February 2, 2019.

# FIGHTER 1

----

# Description

**Name:** Omari

**Gender:** Male

**Position:** Sniper

He has trained himself to be ambidextrous. He's laidback and mild-mannered, often lazy, and is (annoyingly) patient. Likes to read and prefers to remain in the background.

# Stats

Trion = 7

Sniper = 10

Mobility = 8

Strategy = 8

Special Techniques = 7

# Trigger Set

Main | Sub
---------|----------
Lightning | Shield
Egret | Bagworm
Shield | Teleporter
Bagworm | Grasshopper

# Special Techniques

**Short Warp:** The ability to [teleport only 2 or 3 meters, which can be used multiple times in quick succession due to the cooldown being only 0.5 seconds](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ryexGQksZBc/WLxUbG6n90I/AAAAAAAAkYs/ySQ4Jp5X1uEUXuLoZe7OIoqWNom6UsoLQCHM/s16000/0048-019.png) (still long enough for the opponent to spot the OC). (*costs 2*)

**Quick Switch:** The ability to activate or swap Triggers in the blink of an eye, changing range and switching from attack to defense and vice versa instantaneously. What this means is that there is almost no difference between activating a Trigger from either column when none is active and switch from one to another, whereas for everyone else, switching Triggers take longer than activating one when no other from that same column is active. (*costs 2.5*)

**More Speed:** The user can [fire with a high rate without sacrificing accuracy](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WNMGqdzOLWQ/WLxHM0j907I/AAAAAAAAiFI/UKuyEJxxrpM92siot5yxFqOyblYNMHHVgCHM/s16000/0114-011.png). It is useful [against focused defenses](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AExgOaZzhvo/WLxDrkWznfI/AAAAAAAAhco/cSZMo-b0iTM_PVsX3PnzCIUvXeRvSV_5gCHM/s16000/0114-002.png). (*costs 2.5*)

# Fighting Style

Omari specialises in shooting moving targets while he is in movement. Ideally, he spends most of the time in hiding (bagworm), locating other people and moving around the map, then shooting at multiple targets before disappearing again. He'll usually start without lightning, but with a bagworm on. He isn't too worried about his opponents being close and he always maps out escape routes and remains calm. However, he prefers to defend using his mobility or (especially in duels with attackers) with distance. He uses grasshopper and teleporter for attacking and escaping, and is good at using them together (eg, feinting with grasshopper, then teleporting away) it also allows him to retain some mobility even with the loss of a limb. The double bagworm is mainly to allow for two different things:

Mobile stealth - Bagworm and Teleporter/Grasshopper

Mobile offence - Lightning and Teleporter/Grasshopper (with only one bagworm you either couldn't shoot and use bagworm or use grasshopper/teleporter and lightning at the same time).

# Description

**Name:** Zyn

**Gender:** Male

**Position:** Gunner

# Stats

Trion = 7

# Special Techniques

**Gun Onslaught:** The ability to retain decent accuracy at mid-to-short range while [firing with two Gun-shaped Triggers at once](http://93.190.142.23/manga/World-Trigger/0168-010.png). (*costs 1*)

**Runner Gunner:** The ability to [retain high accuracy while running](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oodbVIgAsr4/WLxHMKkN1mI/AAAAAAAAiFA/yB0sRjnbryA9lPjswpdbiey1cP_TCtilwCHM/s16000/0113-011.png), a [difficult but essential skill](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-p8DX69b2cfQ/WLxPXQdfl_I/AAAAAAAAjf4/IM_qsKcShac1k46o-HocT2DAGVXlgE-IgCHM/s16000/0076-009.png) for Gunners who emphasize mobility and/or want to be able to score by themselves. (*costs 1.5*)

**Shock and Awe:** The OC is especially skilled at keeping their cool and [scoring in the middle of chaos](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gUOuBPhuKAg/WLxJIHHq2XI/AAAAAAAAiaM/XsAPQMAnPfQeoAckMS3A2aJznDyVVi7FQCHM/s16000/0114-016.png). Their success is not guaranteed, but they will be able to go on the offensive while everyone else is either befuddled or wary of making a move. It is especially convenient for long-ranged fighters, since [they can attack from outside the area of mayhem](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JMma_L3sa1g/WLxJhWbwOWI/AAAAAAAAifA/38Z_Q8N5j58Lq2UyhO294yF-58L0MIvtwCHM/s16000/0114-017.png) and do not have to survive the bombardment in the first place. (*costs 2*)

**Enveloping Fire:** A multi-directional attack to circumvent enemy Shields with either [Shooter](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nCMe4WVvcSI/WLxEWWL1yHI/AAAAAAAAhkk/gkIgzagqXBYbtNa_7nEaPxJ5pZoWT1JLgCHM/s16000/0127-004.png) or [Gunner](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UtvBg0vP1MM/WLxGnf5CIVI/AAAAAAAAh-c/L7TADaemX90bFIE3dksjaIbQBTzvG13ogCHM/s16000/0145-010.png) Triggers. (*costs 1.5*)

**Bunker:** The ability to cast one’s Shield [around one’s firearm](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NwqHwgRWiw0/WLxHGjWUy8I/AAAAAAAAiEA/jLvGTVNlr7gWsPyKT-QajPxIq_3ooxxbACHM/s16000/0139-011.png). (*costs 0.5*)

**Symmetry:** The ability to reappear after a warp [facing the direction opposite to the one used to activate the Trigger]( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eDqIVkIH2so/WLxOseD9LfI/AAAAAAAAjYg/Zf_KTVEXv30a9NMyO8O88iibDZmXYNHAACHM/s16000/0029-008.png). (*costs 1*)

**Shape Modification:** The ability to [alter the shape of Shield after it has been cast](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yMWiSbfa4Cc/WLxG1evUg4I/AAAAAAAAiBA/8ava2wKxLmoPJ4GPf-bUbL0W40h22WO4wCHM/s16000/0112-010.png). (*costs 0.5*)

# Fighting Style

Zyn wields two handgun styled triggers at the same time. His fighting system could be called that of a wild west gunslinger. He activates bagworm at the start of a match to conceal himself as he begin to look for his opponent.

Zyn excels in close to mid range combat with his gunner triggers but is at a disadvantage when fighting at distance. He has high mobility allowing him to close or increase the distance between him and his opponent. He also has teleport to help with that aspect as well.

He also has the ability to stay cool in chaotic situations and when facing melee opponents he can shield around his firearm to fight at very close range.

When he needs to escape or help create distance between him and his opponent he uses lead bullet or teleport. In a last ditch to create confusion he will you meteroa to destroy buildings or objects to create a screen of smoke and rubble.

Zyn will use either asteroid to attack his opponent head on or hound to try and bypass their defenses.

&amp;#x200B;

So here is a little backstory before the main event, I Dropped out from a school i was in before i moved to 3rd grade because my aunt told my mom to do so, she described it as, Painful, Horrifc and all that, so i changed schools on the spot, ok on to the main event...

&amp;#x200B;

Charactors: me: Me (duh) asshole""friend"":af and support teacher:st

&amp;#x200B;

So when i moved to this new school i was entitled to alot of things because of my mental disability, The lunch system was pretty wack, it worked like this, certain classes of a grade would go into the lunch hall to eat, then they'd be called to leave to make way for the next class (cuz the hall was quite small) because of the painfully long times that would be differant everyday, i couldnt have any of it, my mom complained and got me a bypass, permission to go to the lunch hall when ever i please, All the adults in the lunch hall knew me seeing as i liked to interact with them seeing as i get on well with them, they would even go the extra mile to Check on me if i hadn't have gone to lunch at my expected time

it would go like this ST: ""Why haven't you gone to eat your lunch today?"" Me: ""im not feeling very hungry atm"" ST: ""thats not a good excuse, you need to eat"" this would happen most times.

&amp;#x200B;

after doing this for weeks i got a bit lonely, so i asked my ST if i could bring a friend to sit with me, it got approved! No more lonely me!

&amp;#x200B;

I had my 2 best friends come half time for each of them, then i started getting approached by students in my grade that i have never fully interacted with AF: ""Hey dude"" me: ""hey?..."" AF: ""so i hear you get lunch passes, Can i come with?""

Me (being a real nice guy): ""uhm, ok, sure!"" this was the worst mistake of my LIIIIIFE, so i let him join me for lunch once a week and he demanded more with excuses like ""i get really hungry, could you help a friend out??"", i was annoyed, i wanted to save space for my other friends too, so i came up with an idea, i drew out a little bar chart signifying differant people and dates that i would bring them, he scrunched it up and threw it in the trash, AF: ""Ahhhh, you dont need them im your best friend for life"" when he said this a shiver ran down my back, Pure evil, and a shit eating grin on his face.

&amp;#x200B;

So i said ill comply, and he became greedy, he asked if he could bring ANOTHER friend over to eat with me, i said no, he got pissed.

&amp;#x200B;

So i imagne by this point he was scanning around for a way to get back at me, i didnt know this but this is what i thought he did.

&amp;#x200B;

After he scanned around for ways to put me in trouble, he located a pack of pokemon cards, In a clear seal book (yes the cards were legal in my school and we had fuckin tornaments!) i will tell you how interested i am in pokemon, so a few days before this happened outside school, i found a stack of 20 cards, one card in it being a zapdos that legendary, my stoopid ass (not knowing SHIT about pokemon) Traded it for an arcanine, there thats how much i knew about pokemon at the time, he sprinted over to the sealed pokemon card book, picked it up and STOLE it, made his way to the exit, 5 people got up including ST, Chased him around the outside, 3 mins later, comes sprinting back in, SITS DOWN and shoves the book in my face exclaiming ""its his fault!, he wouldnt do it so he dared me to do it"", me, being autisic i had to take the blame for EVERYTHING, Autistic children are known fortaking things that arnt theirs, luckily i had backup, MY ST, ST: ""he wouldnt do it? OP Doesnt even know anything about pokemon, and thats a fact, he shares with me what he does and doesnt like, you are going to so the headmaster young man"" and he got dragged away screaming ""IM INNOCENT, LET ME GO!""

&amp;#x200B;

Few weeks later i noticed something weird, 4 boys started to follow me including AF, They were stalking me, i ran inside hoping to juke them, i couldnt, they waited outside the exits of doors, i got paranoid As fuck (couldnt say af, you know why :l"" I ran to my ST and asked for help, she came out with me guarding me like a little kitten, the boys came up to me and said, boys: ""excuse me but can we talk to him?"" ST: ""he specificly asked to not talk to you, would you mind leaving while we move across the ground?"", They backed off for a while, St said she had  to go do something and left me for a while, the boys came up to me so i got up and sprinted away, hid behind trees, and managed to get to a safe spot, My muslim friend comes up to me, and askes me whats wrong, i tell him the story and he says thats messed up, He helps me and shields me, Hes quite a socially akward person, but when it comes to friendship, he wants to guard that with his life, its because i was his only friend supporting him, he hides me and asks the boys who they were looking for and he asks why, they reply with ""we just want to chat"" with blood thirsty grins, i sneak around back of a shed, get to my other friend, who we'll call ""Kyle"" for now, He was my long running friend and has always been there to support me, even if i had to lie about something, even though he isnt a friend anymore i hold Grudges, FEIRCELY, and havent talked to him in a humane voice since.

&amp;#x200B;

He told me to stay calm and we got through lunch, That marks the WILDEST fucking day ive every had.

&amp;#x200B;

P.s I learnt one of the boys names over the past few months, and im getting my revenge, Hope to see myself on r/pettyrevenge or r/ProRevenge in the near future, Take care and have a nice day!

&amp;#x200B;

P.ss The guys name was Omari or something like that, I remembered him from school classes, He was legit gay and wanted to hide that. PLOTTING REVENGE NOW  &gt;:DDD

Spellman said they need to have more fun. Huerter said that they need to regain their spirit. Says they did a good job of moving the ball early but missed way too many wide open shots tonight. Not surprisingly he said that defense was an emphasis early after last night but they still have ways to go. Justin Anderson said that he does a lot of yoga to stay ready for his limited minutes.

He was originally held prisoner there by the guards until he showed them his power of rap, which caused them to faint in disbelief. With Kanye realizing this may be his only opportunity to escape, he stole one of the guards pod racers and rose to the surface of Lake Michigan. When he reaches the surface, a lady in a super boat picked him up and took him in as her own. Kanye grew up calling this lady his mother, whose name is Donda. Donda took Kanye to chicago to live in there hut which was built into the side of a mountain. Kanye, having no school background, only knew how to rap due to his gift from God. Once Donda found out about this, she took Kanye to a rap battle organization called “GOOD Music”. Kanye blew everyone away with his amazing musical talents and started to grow to stardom. Between the years 2000 and 2003 he released his first album “Kon the Louis Vuitton Don” which fell way below his expectations. To try and regain his fame Mr. West called up a supporter of his, Donald Trump. The two of them began talking and decided to plan a rap battle between the two. February 10th 2004 was the date they decided the epic battle would take place. The weeks leading up to the battle were some of the hardest in all of Kanyes life, he was forced to train 18 hours a day if he even wanted a chance to take down Trump. 

The day of the event had finally arrived and Kanye had prepared the most he thought was physically possible. He hadn’t slept in over 3 weeks and yet had felt no signs of exhaustion. When entering the facility the battle would take place, Mr. West met his all time idol, Eminem. Kanye ran up to him and instantly began to fall to his knees to pray to him. “Calm yourself Omari” said Eminem, “I will lend you all of my power so you can have a fair battle against The Donald, I couldn’t beat him on my one when I faced him 20 years ago, I doubt you can alone.” 
“No I can’t accept this, I have wanted to take down Donald since the day of found out he existed. He is my arch rival and will continue to plague this earth unless I take him down alone. Im sorry Marshall, but I must reject your offer.” Said Kanye, affirmatively.

Kanye and Trump had finally met up with each other on stage. Kanyes knees were quacking below him with sweat dripping off of his palms. The only sound in the room was Kanye’s slow breathes, In and out, in and out. While at the same time Trump was just standing there, menacingly. The time had finally come, round 1 was about to begin and Trump was to go first. Trumps rap went exactly as he had planned, he thought he for sure won the round and that Kanye would just give up right there, until Kanye started rapping. “The Holocaust is bad!” Yelled Kanye. It was at this moment that Donald realized his major mistake, he never said anything anti Holocaust. “And since Trump never stated he was anti-holocaust, this means he’s Pro-Holocaust!” Said Kanye. The entire crowd went silent and Trump began disappearing into mid-air. At the same time of the rap battle, Kanye wrote and released his new album “College Dropout”, which was instantly given 20 platinum awards.

We've got a double week around the All-Star weekend ahead of us. What are your thoughts on the streaming approach? 

Just like the previous weeks, I've put mine down in an article on RotoBaller, and here is a chunk of it:

 

## NBA Weekly Streamers for Double Week 18 &amp; 19 (Feb 11 - Feb 24)

The trade deadline has come and gone. I hope you nailed some of your speculative adds!

I've missed mine with [Omari Spellman](https://www.reddit.com/nba/player/20002012/Omari+Spellman) in a 20-team league. With the All-Star weekend just around the corner, and the end of the fantasy regular season drawing near I'm going to be letting him go soon. With [Dewayne Dedmon](https://www.reddit.com/nba/player/20000684/Dewayne+Dedmon) and [Alex Len](https://www.reddit.com/nba/player/20000852/Alex+Len) remaining in Atlanta, it doesn't seem he will be getting the minutes, and the chase for the fantasy playoffs is heating up. I will keep him for the first part of next week as he has a great schedule but will welcome a streaming spot after that instead of hoping Spellman gets a decent opportunity in such a crowded frontcourt.

If you're in a similar situation with some of your guys, and you have a playoff to qualify for, I suggest you do the same and set your mind to winning your next matchup.

Here are our **fantasy basketball streamers for Double Week 18 &amp; 19.**

## NBA Schedule Guide - Double Week 18 &amp; 19

The All-Star break this weekend means that there will be no NBA basketball from Friday (Feb 15) until Wednesday (Feb 20) with the first games before and after the break coming on Thursdays. Fantasy teams will find it harder to field a decent lineup on Tuesday, the first Thursday (Feb 14) and Sunday. None of these days have more than 5 games played.

As for the teams, the Knicks have a five-game week, and all but five teams play four times. Furthermore, the Magic play on all three of the scarce days and have a four-game week, and a couple of other teams play on two of the three aforementioned days so their guys could make decent options for streaming as well.

Here's the low-down:

\-

## Baller Streaming Strategy for Double Week 18 &amp; 19

The Thursday before the All-Star weekend (Feb 14) and Sunday have just three games apiece, so these two days will be the toughest for fantasy owners to weather. Tuesday is also troublesome with just five games. I will rely on players from teams that play on these days to save our fantasy teams on this double week.

The Orlando Magic plays on all three of these days and also has another game this week. The Knicks have a five-game week and play on both Thursday (Feb 14) and Sunday. In addition to guys from these two teams, you could also find that players from the Hawks and Pelicans, who both play four games and play on both Tuesday and Thursday (Feb 14), can help fill some voids. Even some Spurs' players could come in handy despite playing only three games this week, as two of those games come on the scarcest of days - Tuesday and Sunday.

|1. Giannis Antetokounmpo (+1)|I watched the game against the Wizards last night. Dominant. He takes over the number 1 spot for now.||
|2. James Harden (+1)|Despite the hate he gets on here we can't deny what he's doing this year is impressive. Will he be able to keep this ranking through the playoffs? We'll see.||
|3. Paul George (+4)|PG13 is the surprise number 3 right now. I have my doubts he finishes this high but overall on the season he should be an MVP candidate.||
|4. Stephen Curry (-3)|Curry loses his number 1 spot but remains in the top 4 and he is right in the mix to finish 1st.||
|5. Kevin Durant (+1)|Reporter drama is afloat but he finished 1st overall for 2017-2018 and LeBron picked him 1st in the all star draft for a reason.||
|6. Kawhi Leonard (+2)|The Raptors got Marc Gasol at the deadline and are going all in for a championship, ||
|7. LeBron James (+6)|Back from injury, and a lot of drama surrounding the team. But a very good triple double vs. Boston last night as he looks to get back on track.||
|8. Russell Westbrook (+3)|Westbrook now has the longest triple double streak in 51 years.||
|9. Nikola Jokic (-5)|Jokic is now a first time all star, he falls 5 spots but Denver is looking good.||
|10. Anthony Davis (same)|He's still a Pelican for now and will play tonight.||
|11. Kyrie Irving (-2)|The talk of Kyrie rejoining LeBron has turned from joke to semi serious.||
|12. Damian Lillard (+3)|Portland is still winning and Lillard is still having the best season of his career.||
|13. Joel Embiid (-8)|22 turnovers/15 assists and 42% shooting the last 4 games. ||
|14. Blake Griffin (+4)|BG has consistently been a monster this season.||
|15. Klay Thompson (+9)|23 PPG on 60% shooting the last 4 games.||
|16. Ben Simmons (same)|1st time all star and his consistency has been all star level since last ranking.||
|17. LaMarcus Aldridge (+5)|LA is now a 7X all star. There are very, very few players in NBA history who have not made the HOF at 7X all star.||
|18. Kemba Walker (+3)|31/7/6 averages the last 4 games.||
|19. Karl-Anthony Towns (-7)|I watched him a couple of games. Memphis played them twice. His assertiveness doesn't match his talent, nice buzzer beater the 1st game but there is zero reason he shouldn't have just completely taken over both games.||
|20. Rudy Gobert (-3)|100% all star in the East and it wouldn't have been close.||
|21. Bradley Beal (-7)|Has scored less than 21 points just once in 2019.||
|22. Jrue Holiday (+3)|A 40% 3 point shooting Jrue Holiday would be a top 10 player in the league.||
|23. Kyle Lowry (-3)|Shooting 35% from the field in 2019. But also 8.5 APG and starting PG for a finals contender. His start to the year helps his ranking, have to balance that out.||
|24. Luka Doncic (+6)|Welcome to the top 25, expectations are higher now but his rookie season now officially rivals Ben Simmons + Mitchell last year.||
|25. Khris Middleton (+7)|17/5/5 on 52% shooting last 6 games. 1st time all star too.||
|26. Jimmy Butler (-7)|Even with the drama, my biggest snub is Butler not getting in over Vucevic or Russell. ||
|27. Pascal Siakam (+4)|23/7 averages the last 4 games. His play is going from trend to starting to establish a serious reputation.||
|28. Mike Conley (+8)|As a Grizz fan I'm fine with us keeping him. Fine with the Gasol trade too.||
|29. Victor Oladipo (-3)|Injured for season, value down. Still, at the end of season ranking I doubt he falls below 35||
|30. Donovan Mitchell (-7)|35% shooting last 3 games. Still an impressive 2019.||
|31. CJ McCollum (+2)|Has scored at least 28 points 5 of last 6 games.||
|32. DeMar DeRozan (-5)|His first 2 months were unquestionably all star level. In 2019 he's barely top 50 overall level.||
|33. Steven Adams (-4)|One of the most consistent players in the league this year.||
|34. Andre Drummond (+6)|Pistons offered Drummond for Gasol. On talent I take it but don't think Drummond would have fit great next to JJJ.||
|35. Al Horford (+3)|Al Horford was shocked by the Sixers-Clippers trade just so you all know.||
|36. DeMarcus Cousins (-1)|His minutes are likely to increase after the all star break. 15/7/4 averages so far.||
|37. Eric Bledsoe (+11)|17/6/5 averages in 2019 so far.||
|38. Jusuf Nurkic (-10)|17/11/4 averages in 2019 so far.||
|39. Draymond Green (-5)|Has only scored in double figures 2 times since 12/27.||
|40. Nikola Vucevic (+4)|1st time all star, Bamba isn't progressing like we thought and is injured right now, Magic are seriously going to have to consider re-signing him.||
|41. Jayson Tatum (-4)|Giving up Tatum for AD is not worth it.||
|42. Tobias Harris (same)|What Philly gave up for Tobias is worth it.||
|43. Myles Turner (+8)|17 PPG, 4 BPG on 56% shooting last 4 games.||
|44. Malcolm Brogdon (+5)|Most underrated player in the NBA.||
|45. Julius Randle (-4)|Returned last night after a 2 week injury. He can finish close to the top 30 if he plays well the rest of the year.||
|46. Buddy Hield (-1)|22/5/3 averages on over 50% shooting in 2019.||
|47. De'Aaron Fox (+9)|The Kings having 2 top 50 players might be the biggest shock of the season for me.||
|48. Clint Capela (-9)|Still injured, value down.||
|49. Chris Paul (+3)|He's looking a little more like himself the last few games.||
|50. John Wall (-7)|I'm keeping an eye on his value. I just can't see myself moving him down much more than this and will give him a close review for my end of season ranking.||

Alex Len (Omari Spellman in deeper formats): If Dedmon is traded, Len and Spellman will see more minutes. Len is averaging 12pts 7reb 1bl over the last month in 20min, so pick up him if he gets more minutes without Dedmon.

Jabari Parker: He has shown that if he gets minutes, he can produce. He is averaging 12pts 4reb 2as over the last month in only 17min. Keep an eye on his destination because he only need minutes to produce.

JaMychal Green: He is averaging 11pts 6reb over the last month in 22min with Gasol. If Marc is traded and JaMychal plays 30min/night, he can give you points, rebounds and some blocks.

Allonzo Trier: The only thing that Trier needs is a trade for Hardaway Jr. He can give you points and 3s if you need it. Great pick up for Dynasty leagues too.

Mo Bamba: If Orlando trades Vucevic for a PG, Bamba can be a beast for rebounds and blocks. He only need consistent minutes.

# Special Techniques

**One-Handed  Sword:** The ability to wield Kogetsu and/or Raygust proficiently with only one hand [despite their weight](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RWXXDyHiue0/WLxFxJtUdAI/AAAAAAAAh0E/stFHXBqPVH07Ldx-sB7fho50XQaMj_xNwCHM/s16000/0139-007.png). It is essential to dual-wielding either or both of those Triggers. (*costs 1*)

**Advanced Blade:** The ability to alter the shape of Raygust in Blade Mode to better suit the user’s fighting style as well as to reduce its weight and trion consumption. The blade can be shrunk to the size [of a shorter sword](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-h4nTXamEa7Q/WLxLozJm8WI/AAAAAAAAi0k/-aqA2MZUc5M_JKX3CW_Tg6wWGN8JA9nygCHM/s16000/0005-002.png), [a knife](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ed7u3UK0-GU/WLxMifajsVI/AAAAAAAAjAE/EkvGJRyM6PUUnagF2r7DCEjmweSv71jDwCHM/s16000/0063-004.png), or [an axe-like weapon](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-u2KChEo9PWk/WLxGcrQgNnI/AAAAAAAAh8U/uVaReCglDWYpIjjCBzHChgOj60bvaoniACHM/s16000/0128-009.png), also making it a more effective projectile. Any of these modifications can be easily wielded with only one hand. (*costs 0.5*)

**Advanced Shield:** The ability to alter the shape of Raygust in Shield Mode to launch unsuspected counterattacks. Raygust can be shapeshifted to [trap the opponent](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Wtyj-WXoulQ/WLxUPEmx2WI/AAAAAAAAkWg/crSAsrNG_dg-KBvaabjlCDchWytgQrqQACHM/s16000/0036-019.png), [pin them](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HNRpswAW58Y/WLxIxG2RMLI/AAAAAAAAiWc/R9y50cyq9Xw57BsKEjcNavaokpmp9rpTACHM/s16000/0100-015.png), [redirect their Attacker Triggers](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FOVA2kLOazU/WLxE-DVLLEI/AAAAAAAAhr4/s0_161qu8hUyY-AFbZjwEyM8Wf0QPQW5wCHM/s16000/0099-005.png), or [better absorb impacts](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OrpydxFOsP0/WLxROCEBU4I/AAAAAAAAj0s/sRJ3MUGY36Md4odCAkNCDzlAEu8FrT6ygCHM/s16000/0053-013.png). (*costs 0.5*)

**Battering Ram:** The ability to [ram the opponent with Thruster](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-F90C7dZfXso/WLxEnvXinOI/AAAAAAAAhoA/7a8a4XCDb2ULTB8BQo_WZwPle78f0G4rgCHM/s16000/0097-005.png) without moving from one’s position. It inflicts no damage, but it can push the target several meters away. (*costs 0.5*)

**Jet Muscle Punch:** The ability to use Thruster to [accelerate one’s punches](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qht1veH21V8/WLxTHk14BoI/AAAAAAAAkJc/rTzuukBaxDQyxh3rnXy2-9_zJxNYlHi7ACHM/s16000/0053-016.png), also multiple times in a row.The damage inflicted and the reach are both very low, but it is a good way to save trion. (*costs 1*)

**Shock and Awe:** The OC is especially skilled at keeping their cool and [scoring in the middle of chaos](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gUOuBPhuKAg/WLxJIHHq2XI/AAAAAAAAiaM/XsAPQMAnPfQeoAckMS3A2aJznDyVVi7FQCHM/s16000/0114-016.png). Their success is not guaranteed, but they will be able to go on the offensive while everyone else is either befuddled or wary of making a move. It is especially convenient for long-ranged fighters, since [they can attack from outside the area of mayhem](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JMma_L3sa1g/WLxJhWbwOWI/AAAAAAAAifA/38Z_Q8N5j58Lq2UyhO294yF-58L0MIvtwCHM/s16000/0114-017.png) and do not have to survive the bombardment in the first place. (*costs 2*)

**Shape Modification:** The ability to [alter the shape of Shield after it has been cast](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yMWiSbfa4Cc/WLxG1evUg4I/AAAAAAAAiBA/8ava2wKxLmoPJ4GPf-bUbL0W40h22WO4wCHM/s16000/0112-010.png). (*costs 0.5*)

# Fighting Style

Simply put, a vicious and violent brawler, with a focus on punishment. Often using her Raygust as brass knuckles, or taking the shape of a swordbreaker (disarming, or breaking enemy Attacker's blades using Raygust's higher sturdiness), using part of the scenery as a weapon, grappling opponents, swinging and kicking them around...

Although considered by many as ""unsightly"" or even ""bullying"", she banks its effectiveness on her real body's brawny and tall build (almost like Reiji's female counterpart), contrasting an otherwise weak Trion user.

This leads people to mistake her for a hot-head, but ironically enough, outside of combat, she's fairly calm, and rarely ever takes the initiative, always waiting for an opportune time to strike. Due to her low Trion, she cannot allow the enemy to disengage, since a battle of attrition would quickly wear her out. So instead, she just attacks relentlessly, until she depletes her Trion, or the enemy is taken out.

She's always on the lookout for traps, and when in combat, always tries to be a few steps ahead of the opponent, either through exploiting desperate moves, or intercepting escape routes.

Some other key signature moves include slanted shields (either Raygust or Shield) to deflect shots instead of stopping them, making them less prone to shattering, using enemies as shields, using Shields as a small block to stop and stun Grasshoper users, or as a small stepping stone, amongst others.

# FIGHTER 2

----

# Description

**Name:** Omari

**Gender:** Male

**Position:** Sniper

He has trained himself to be ambidextrous. He's laidback and mild-mannered, often lazy, and is (annoyingly) patient. Likes to read and prefers to remain in the background.

# Stats

Trion = 7

Sniper = 10

Mobility = 8

Strategy = 8

Special Techniques = 7

# Trigger Set

Main | Sub
---------|----------
Lightning | Shield
Egret | Bagworm
Shield | Teleporter
Bagworm | Grasshopper

# Special Techniques

**Short Warp:** The ability to [teleport only 2 or 3 meters, which can be used multiple times in quick succession due to the cooldown being only 0.5 seconds](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ryexGQksZBc/WLxUbG6n90I/AAAAAAAAkYs/ySQ4Jp5X1uEUXuLoZe7OIoqWNom6UsoLQCHM/s16000/0048-019.png) (still long enough for the opponent to spot the OC). (*costs 2*)

**Quick Switch:** The ability to activate or swap Triggers in the blink of an eye, changing range and switching from attack to defense and vice versa instantaneously. What this means is that there is almost no difference between activating a Trigger from either column when none is active and switch from one to another, whereas for everyone else, switching Triggers take longer than activating one when no other from that same column is active. (*costs 2.5*)

**More Speed:** The user can [fire with a high rate without sacrificing accuracy](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WNMGqdzOLWQ/WLxHM0j907I/AAAAAAAAiFI/UKuyEJxxrpM92siot5yxFqOyblYNMHHVgCHM/s16000/0114-011.png). It is useful [against focused defenses](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AExgOaZzhvo/WLxDrkWznfI/AAAAAAAAhco/cSZMo-b0iTM_PVsX3PnzCIUvXeRvSV_5gCHM/s16000/0114-002.png). (*costs 2.5*)

# Fighting Style

Omari specialises in shooting moving targets while he is in movement. Ideally, he spends most of the time in hiding (bagworm), locating other people and moving around the map, then shooting at multiple targets before disappearing again. He'll usually start without lightning, but with a bagworm on. He isn't too worried about his opponents being close and he always maps out escape routes and remains calm. However, he prefers to defend using his mobility or (especially in duels with attackers) with distance. He uses grasshopper and teleporter for attacking and escaping, and is good at using them together (eg, feinting with grasshopper, then teleporting away) it also allows him to retain some mobility even with the loss of a limb. The double bagworm is mainly to allow for two different things:

Mobile stealth - Bagworm and Teleporter/Grasshopper

Mobile offence - Lightning and Teleporter/Grasshopper (with only one bagworm you either couldn't shoot and use bagworm or use grasshopper/teleporter and lightning at the same time).

Today I am going to post my updated rookie rankings.

I actually made an article on this about a week ago but my computer froze right before I was about to post it. Make sure to always save drafts on reddit!

Anyways here is my updated rookie rankings as of after last night's games. I am not going to post descriptions in this edition, but am more than happy to discuss in comments.

Perseverance of the saints (also referred to as eternal security or as once saved, always saved) is a Christian teaching that asserts that once a person is truly ""born of God"" or ""regenerated"" by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, nothing in heaven or earth ""shall be able to separate (them) from the love of God"" (Romans 8:39) resulting in a reversal of the converted condition.

Sometimes this position is held in conjunction with Reformed Christian confessions of faith in traditional Calvinist doctrine which argues that all men are ""dead in trespasses and sins"" and so apart from being resurrected from spiritual death to spiritual life, no one chooses salvation alone. However, it must be distinguished from Arminianism which also teaches that all men are ""dead in trespasses and sins"" and could not respond to the gospel if God did not enable individuals to do so by His prevenient grace.[1]",True,False,False,AtlantaHawks,t5_2sgwl,r/AtlantaHawks,32425,public,,self,,,Does Omari Spellman prove Perseverance of the saints,,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/akwxb1/does_omari_spellman_prove_perseverance_of_the/,,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,,,

Following the biggest win of **Omari**'s career, and the unfortunate news about **Ilja Dragunov**, Defiant Wrestling  are back with another episode of their weekly wrestling show, Loaded, for free! **This show will finish before the Royal Rumble pre-show starts.**

&amp;#x200B;

Announced for the show:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Martin Kirby has something to say before Unstoppable (Main Event): 

After learning recently that he is set to go one on one with **El Phantasmo** at **Unstoppable** for the **Defiant Internet Championship**, we will hear for the first time since then from **Martin Kirby**, the man who recently defeated **Walter** under... Suspect circumstances. What will the Leader of the Kirbcrawlers have to say about the announcement less than 2 weeks before he is scheduled to defend his Championship?

&amp;#x200B;

# Primate vs BT Gunn:

After the events of recent weeks, with **Rory Coyle** premiering ""The Yard"" on **Loaded #6**, **Joe Hendry** has expressed doubts over whether he can trust **Primate**, his tag team partner at **Unstoppable**. To prove himself, Primate has asked to go one on one with the recently returned **BT Gunn**, a former ally of Hendry back in **The Prestige** days. Can Primate prove to Hendry that he has nothing to worry about, or will Gunn pull off a relative upset and position himself very strongly on the Defiant roster, following his return victory against **Lucky Kid** back on **Loaded #5**?

&amp;#x200B;

# No Fun Dunne vs Visage:

Since joining Defiant, **No Fun Dunne** and his allies (**HT Drake** and **Los Federales Super Santos Jr.**) have been aiming to remove any semblance of fun from the company. After being unable to defeat **Mark Haskins** in a 2 on 1 handicap match on **Loaded #7** last week, No Fun Dunne will return to action against someone who is everything he stands against, **Visage**. Can the Queen of Queens defeat the leader of the **Anti Fun Police**, or will Dunne continue his crusade to stop Funnahhhhhhh in Defiant?

&amp;#x200B;

# Nathan Cruz vs Man Like Dereiss:

**Nathan Cruz** is not a happy man after his defeat to **Omari** last week on **Loaded #7**. This week, he has the chance to take out his frustration on a newcomer to Defiant, and a friend of Omari in **Man Like Dereiss**. Cruz is the heavy favourite heading into this match, but the same could've been said for his match vs Omari. Can Dereiss further upset Cruz, or will the angry veteran put the much younger talent to the sword?

Another 10 days have gone by, all star starters announced, and this is my updated complete ranking list.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

|Player (change from last edition)|Comment||
|:-|:-|:-|
|1. Stephen Curry (same)|Curry isn't MVP but I do believe he's the best overall player in the NBA right now and keeps his number 1 ranking.||
|2. Giannis Antetokounmpo (same)|National media wise has taken a backseat to Harden but he's still right there for MVP race, and I would give it to him if season ended today.||
|3. James Harden (same)|I watched the full 61 point performance live and dude's on another level, but I agree with the national media narrative that his style of play will not sustain long term success in the playoffs.||
|4. Nikola Jokic (+4)|The consistency is starting to remain and Jokic is dominating. He should be the very clear 1st reserve pick for the all star team.||
|5. Joel Embiid (+6)|Him not playing vs. Denver honestly raised his value in my eyes, last night's game showed how important he is.||
|6. Kevin Durant (-1)|With KD (like LeBron) at this point I just expect him to go off in the playoffs. He finished number 1 last year (my final ranking includes playoffs) and he's very much in contention for that spot still.||
|7. Paul George (+2)|The all star starter nod gives him national recognition, and his play has equaled that consistently throughout the season.||
|8. Kawhi Leonard (-2)|The more the season progresses, the more I think he's going to LA. But the Raptors were my preseason pick to win the Finals and that could change things.||
|9. Kyrie Irving (+7)|Good last 10 days. All star starter, and he's by far the most unguardable guard in the East.||
|10. Anthony Davis (-6)|The closer we get to the break, I would not completely rule out a trade. But he's been number 1 this season before but with how stacked the talent at the top is him being here speaks to that.||
|11. Russell Westbrook (+4)|His efficiency has been better the last few games, Thunder winning, should be a clear all star reserve.||
|12. Karl-Anthony Towns (+2)|Last 3 games: 25/18/7, 27/12/5, 33/10/4. Dude is beasting.||
|13. LeBron James (-6)|He's coming back soon, he should finish higher than this when all said and done, but serious questions are starting to emerge. LeBron has made the NBA Finals every year since 2011. That's not happening this year and a Lakers 1st round exit is not out of question, what happens to his reputation (for this season) compared to other superstars if that occurs? It's something to keep in mind.||
|14. Bradley Beal (-2)|I thought he should have been a starter over Kemba, and he has turned himself into the Wizards' franchise centerpiece in a matter of literally weeks.||
|15. Damian Lillard (-2)|Overall I would say quietly having his best season.||
|16. Ben Simmons (+2)|I think he is a near lock for his 1st all star game. At just 22 years old that's nice.||
|17. Rudy Gobert (-7)|He's out of my top 10 but his consistency is enough for me to have him as an all star right now. He would be a very bad omission if left off.||
|18. Blake Griffin (-1)|BG is solid and the rest of the team needs work.||
|19. Jimmy Butler (same)|Despite all the drama, I think Butler is still an all star in the east.||
|20. Kyle Lowry (+2)|Arguably the best point guard in the league the first 3ish weeks but that's long in the past now. Still, overall on the season, he's in my top 20 right now.||
|21. Kemba Walker (-1)|I think he should have been a reserve but still him starting is good for the league.||
|22. LaMarcus Aldridge (+2)|I posted my all star reserves yesterday. One change: I now have Aldridge in over Klay for the 12th spot.||
|23. Donovan Mitchell (+11)|Biggest comeback of 2019 goes to him without question so far.||
|24. Klay Thompson (-3)|He's made 4 straight all star games, a 5th is in jeopardy. It's going to be very close.||
|25. Jrue Holiday (+3)|He keeps finding ways to stay in the elite mix. Although I don't have him in right now, he is a legitimate all star contender.||
|26. Victor Oladipo (+1)|The most unfortunate injury of the season so far.||
|27. DeMar DeRozan (-4)|He was an all star lock even a month ago, but now he's probably not getting in.||
|28. Jusuf Nurkic (+8)|Dude's on the rise. He isn't close to the scoring level as most players above him yet, but his IQ is near Jokic level. He'll have to play consistent to move up higher than this, as now that he's ranked here he has to prove it.||
|29. Steven Adams (-3)|Remains consistent and still a career season, I had him as an all star in late December but I'm going with no.||
|30. Luka Doncic (same)|In the East he would 110% be an all star. I wouldn't be totally surprised to see him get in the West but I think not this year.||
|31. Pascal Siakam (+7)|His consistent play is a big reason the Raptors have remained elite, and with how the East is shaped I believe he is an all star.||
|32. Khris Middleton (+1)|Middleton is currently my 12th pick for the East team. The top upvoted comment on NBA was saying Bledsoe deserves it over him. I disagree. Bledsoe looks like a top 20 overall player at times but he just doesn't keep that level of play consistent over a season. Middleton has played solid and consistent just about the whole season, and with how the East is I give him the all star nod right now.||
|33. CJ McCollum (-2)|If he were in the East, would be a serious all star candidate.||
|34. Draymond Green (-9)|Being more consistent on offense got him a top 25 spot 10 days ago. That consistency hasn't been there since last edition.||
|35. DeMarcus Cousins (NEW)|His fit with Golden State is even better than expected, he takes this team to a new dimension.||
|36. Mike Conley (+6)|As a Grizzlies fan, I would prefer to keep him to Gasol. For the love of humanity even with a tank watching the Shelvin Mack show the last 2 months would be too much.||
|37. Jayson Tatum (-2)|Not quite an all star this year, but my early bet is he will be in 2020.||
|38. Al Horford (+3)|Dude's been playing consistent, clutch and his impact has gone up in 2019.||
|39. Clint Capela (-10)|Injured and value down, which is unfortunate because the way he was playing pre injury he was trending to be a serious all star candidate by now.||
|40. Andre Drummond (-8)|I hate using the term ""empty stats"" and Drummond is very talented, but for 2019 that term is appropriate at times.||
|41. Julius Randle (-4)|Quiet last 10 days, but as I said in my reserve article I would pick him as an all star over Tobias Harris if it came down to those 2.||
|42. Tobias Harris (+4)|Good player, small progression from last season, I don't think he's an all star. He plays better against bad teams than playoff contenders, one of the weirdest players to rank all season.||
|43. John Wall (-3)|Him being 72nd in fan voting wow. His clout took a 180||
|44. Nikola Vucevic (+6)|The Lakers giving up assets for Vucevic is probably a mistake, but I do think he would fit well next to LeBron.||
|45. Buddy Hield (+9)|His consistency and impressive scoring ability gives him a nice bump to the top 45. Very impressive season.||
|46. Domantas Sabonis (-7)|He's been consistent but..from analyzing him a little more that's maybe not always in important clutch situations.||
|47. Serge Ibaka (+2)|Has scored in double figures 12 straight games.||
|48. Eric Bledsoe (+5)|A 40% 3 point shooting Eric Bledsoe would be a top 20 overall player.||
|49. Malcolm Brogdon (+6)|He might get the award for most consistent player on the year. Makes an unexpected jump into the top 50 with 16/5/3 averages and great efficiency. The Bucks join Warriors/Raptors as only teams with 4 top 50 players. As a matter of fact, the Warriors/Raptors/Bucks have 25% of all top 50 players.||
|50. John Collins (-2)|Still playing impressive enough to keep his top 50 spot.||
|51. Myles Turner (-6)|You would like to see him take over with Oladipo now out, we'll see what happens.||
|52. Chris Paul (-9)|Still injured and value down.||
|53. Devin Booker (-6)|In 2019 Booker is shooting 31% from 3 point land, the Suns are a mess, I understand he doesn't have much to work with just an unfortunate situation all around.||
|54. Lou Williams (-2)|Congrats on 1st triple double.||
|55. Marc Gasol (+3)|If we are looking at the last few days of Gasol in Memphis it's been a good 10+ years.||
|56. De'Aaron Fox (-12)|Since last edition he's shooting 37% from the field.||
|57. Thaddeus Young (+3)|23/15 against the Raptors shows just how good this guy is. Consistently helps the Pacers win, finished 63rd last season and is even higher than that right now.||
|58. Jamal Murray (-7)|As I've said all year if he can consistently play like he can when on, a top 25 player.||
|59. DeAndre Jordan (-3)|As is the case with Drummond, he feels like an ""empty stats"" guy sometimes.||
|60. Montrezl Harrell (-1)|He's remained consistent off the bench the whole season, a near lock for a top 100 finish and probably top 75 minimum.||
|61. Danilo Gallinari (-4)|Injured and value down.||
|62. D'Angelo Russell (+13)|Since January 2 he's up 40 overall spots. No player in the league is making a serious name for himself at a quicker rate.||
|63. Kyle Kuzma (+1)|Around this part in the ranking, a theme emerges where the talent =/ consistency.||
|64. Zach LaVine (-3)|Despite the Bulls' mess, he is unquestionably having himself a very good season.||
|65. DeAndre Ayton (-3)|With Ayton injured we get to watch the Dragan Bender show.||
|66. Aaron Gordon (+3)|22/11/6 vs. Wizards last game was good.||
|67. JJ Redick (+3)|Consistently getting buckets still.||
|68. Josh Richardson (-3)|Talented, makes impressive plays, but right now this is a more appropriate ranking than the 54th he was at January 2.||
|69. Derrick Rose (-3)|It's been a slow last 10 days.||
|70. Andrew Wiggins (+1)|He's not a bust. Below expectations sure, but not a bust.||
|71. Robert Covington (-8)|Still injured, value down.||
|72. Spencer Dinwiddie (+12)|The injury is unfortunate, but he at least played well enough to where it's highly unlikely he falls out of the top 100 (or even top 90) before he comes back.||
|73. Joe Ingles (-1)|Playing well in his role, just not being asked as much in terms of scoring.||
|74. Paul Millsap (-7)|He's not where he was at pre getting injured for 3 weeks but still top 75.||
|75. Brandon Ingram (-7)|I would seriously consider trading him.||
|76. Hassan Whiteside (+3)|22/16 vs. the Clippers was good. But not enough of those type games.||
|77. Gary Harris (-4)|He's looked good the last few games, just needs to build momentum.||
|78. Willie Cauley-Stein (-4)|""He doesn't contribute to winning basketball"" well he's started every game this season for an above .500 Kings team and has scored in double figures 11 of the last 12 games. He did move down, but a ""so overrated he's underrated"" player.||
|79. Jerami Grant (+1)|What a season for him so far. Very impressed.||
|80. Brook Lopez (+5)|Up 13 spots since January 2. Good to see him have a nice bounce back year.||
|81. Bojan Bogdanovic (same)|He's going to be asked to have a more prominent role with Oladipo out, interested to see what happened.||
|82. Jarrett Allen (+8)|Up 17 spots since January 2. You'd like to see more offensive consistency but this man has some seriously scary potential.||
|83. Darren Collison (+6)|15/7 on 47% shooting last 5 games.||
|84. Marcus Morris (-6)|One of my favorite role players in the entire league, but the claim I witnessed yesterday saying he deserves an all star spot over Tatum/Horford is just absurd.||
|85. Jonas Valanciunas (-9)|Still injured and value down.||
|86. Bogdan Bogdanovic (-3)|A little inconsistent (followed up 16/9/8 with being shut down by Memphis) but clearly a top 100 talent this year.||
|87. Kevin Love (-10)|Still injured, value down. But that injury has taken a huge hit to his value at this point.||
|88. Marcus Smart (+5)|Up 17 spots since January 2. Shooting 44% from 3 in 2019 is a stat I would never in a million years believe to be something Marcus Smart could do.||
|89. Al-Farouq Aminu (+10)|This dude put up 17/8/4 with a broken pinky. But also one of the more underrated players overall this season. He finished 112th last season, his chances of a final top 100 spot are decent right now||
|90. Derrick Favors (-5)|Consistently playing well enough to hang on to a top 100 spot.||
|91. Danny Green (+7)|Very impressive game on national TV vs. Houston.||
|92. Harrison Barnes (-10)|Last 5 games: 32% from the field.||
|93. Jaylen Brown (-1)|It's been a 3rd year slump, but he's been able to hang on to a top 100 spot the whole season.||
|94. Otto Porter Jr (+2)|I think he could thrive in a different situation.||
|95. Nikola Mirotic (-8)|His impressive start to the season is keeping him in the top 100 for now, just unfortunate injury situation with him.||
|**96. Justise Winslow (+5)**|101st 10 days ago, Winslow cracks the top 100 for the first time ever. Well deserved and it's been incredible to see his steady progression.||
|97. Dwyane Wade (-3)|Wade keeps his top 100 spot, he's in veteran role but he still makes impressive plays.||
|98. Dennis Schroder (-1)|Schroder makes 5 top 100 players for the Thunder currently.||
|99. Ricky Rubio (-4)|Despite the quiet season, Rubio barely hangs on to his top 100 spot.||
|100. TJ Warren (-9)|Warren edges Lauri Markkanen for the final top 100 spot currently. His shooting performance this season has been impressive (and he's higher than his 106 finish last season) but the league continues to expand in depth and he's now injured for 2-3 weeks.||

For reference, Spellman weighed in at the combine at 254 pounds. Boban Marjanovic weighs 291. Marjanovic is 7’3. Spellman is 6’9. 

Some other things from the article: 

&gt;	Spellman arrived at Villanova weighing 290 pounds with more than 20 percent body fat, and it was clear to Shackleton and head coach Jay Wright that Spellman was going to need to drop around 50 pounds in order to have his potential maximized.

&gt;When Spellman arrived in Atlanta, he realized that, for the most part, he was on his own when it came to taking care of his well-being.
 
&gt;	In the position Spellman was in, it was easy to gain weight, especially when his life wasn’t structured. He played in just two games in December and averaged 19 minutes per game in November. There’s not much practice time in the NBA with games occurring almost every other day, lots of travel and the easiness of lavish meals at luxury restaurants in different cities across the country.

&gt;“You go from being flat broke to having five-digit paychecks every week,” Spellman said. “Nothing can prepare you for that other than getting hit in the face when it comes.”

&gt;	Once I was able to tell the coaching staff that I needed help, and I was struggling, it was so much easier on myself. “It’s something that you have to face, and you have to let people know that you’re not afraid to talk about these issues. It’s crazy how people on the outside will judge you, and it’s hard for yourself. Yes, I’m a professional athlete, but I’m a human being first. It’s something that I had to take care of, and it’s something that I am continuing to work at. There’s nothing to be ashamed of. People need help in their every-day lives. You can judge me all you want, but you have to judge my entire body of work, too.”

&gt;	Spellman called himself “fat.” He looked in the mirror one day and said, “Bro, you’re heavy as hell.” He was aware there were people around the league and fans who looked at him as overweight. Once he was able to admit it himself, he finally could make the necessary changes.

This kind of went under the radar because it’s from the Athletic and about a relatively unknown Hawks rookie, but I thought it was a great story. It’s great to see someone admit to their problems and seek help. Spellman has been playing well for the Hawks lately and I’m kind of proud of him for it.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Blood Orange - Charcoal Baby: I listen to this song on my way to work or whenever i want to feel good and it always works. I think this song is perfect and probably one of the best that i have ever heard. If you like this one, i recommend Jewelry and Nappy Wonder.
2. Iman Omari - Energy: I found this song years ago after it was sampled in an Isaiah Rashad song. It was weird to me at first but now i listen to it whenever i need some positive energy, i listened to it on repeat on my way to my first date and it kind of set my mood for the night. Great track especially when you're on the m a r i j u a n a
3. King Krule - Midnight 01: Beautiful track and amazing vocals. The lyrics really speak to me and i just love the switch up at ""why'd you leaveeeee mee"". If you like this, check out Slush Puppy and La Lune (The Ooz version)
4. Flume &amp; Moses Sumney - Weekend: Incredible track. I wish it was a bit longer but I used to cry to this one late at night. Reminds me of White Ferrari... If you like this one, look into Fantastic and Quirk
5. James Blake - I'll Come Too: This one was released very recently but I already love it and feel like it will be on my playlist for a long time. Beautiful lyrics about being in love and wanting to follow your love everywhere she goes which is unreasonable but one can desire right? Similar songs by him: If The Car Beside You Moves Ahead (be sure to listen on acid) and Lullaby For My Insomniac

Probably wasnt worth typing this all out but maybe someone will find some new good music from it.

----

# Description

**Name:** Omari

**Gender:** Male

**Position:** Sniper

He has trained himself to be ambidextrous. He's laidback and mild-mannered, often lazy, and is (annoyingly) patient. Likes to read and prefers to remain in the background.

# Stats

Trion = 7

Sniper = 10

Mobility = 8

Strategy = 8

Special Techniques = 7

# Trigger Set

Main | Sub
---------|----------
Lightning | Shield
Egret | Bagworm
Shield | Teleporter
Bagworm | Grasshopper

# Special Techniques

**Short Warp:** The ability to [teleport only 2 or 3 meters, which can be used multiple times in quick succession due to the cooldown being only 0.5 seconds](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ryexGQksZBc/WLxUbG6n90I/AAAAAAAAkYs/ySQ4Jp5X1uEUXuLoZe7OIoqWNom6UsoLQCHM/s16000/0048-019.png) (still long enough for the opponent to spot the OC). (*costs 2*)

**Quick Switch:** The ability to activate or swap Triggers in the blink of an eye, changing range and switching from attack to defense and vice versa instantaneously. (*costs 2.5*)

**More Speed:** The user can [fire with a high rate without sacrificing accuracy](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WNMGqdzOLWQ/WLxHM0j907I/AAAAAAAAiFI/UKuyEJxxrpM92siot5yxFqOyblYNMHHVgCHM/s16000/0114-011.png). It is useful [against focused defenses](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AExgOaZzhvo/WLxDrkWznfI/AAAAAAAAhco/cSZMo-b0iTM_PVsX3PnzCIUvXeRvSV_5gCHM/s16000/0114-002.png). (*costs 2.5*)

# Fighting Style

Omari specialises in shooting moving targets while he is in movement. Ideally, he spends most of the time in hiding (bagworm), locating other people and moving around the map, then shooting at multiple targets before disappearing again. He'll usually start without lightning, but with a bagworm on. He isn't too worried about his opponents being close and he always maps out escape routes and remains calm. However, he prefers to defend using his mobility or (especially in duels with attackers) with distance. He uses grasshopper and teleporter for attacking and escaping, and is good at using them together (eg, feinting with grasshopper, then teleporting away) it also allows him to retain some mobility even with the loss of a limb. The double bagworm is mainly to allow for two different things:

Mobile stealth - Bagworm and Teleporter/Grasshopper

Mobile offence - Lightning and Teleporter/Grasshopper (with only one bagworm you either couldn't shoot and use bagworm or use grasshopper/teleporter and lightning at the same time).

# Special Techniques

**Aerial Combat:** The ability to attack while or right after propelling oneself with Grasshopper. The power of a strike can also [be increased through multiple pads](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BSbmATYD-PE/WLxHE0OHVKI/AAAAAAAAiDs/xajuTpXd-GUDxUYo-sqcjqzddWcsJoU8QCHM/s16000/0153-011.png). (*costs 1*)

**Pinball:** The user surrounds the opponent with Grasshopper pads and [rapidly bounces from one to another, cutting them with an Attacker Trigger](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZEH9XAjBPKw/WLxMlL1qyXI/AAAAAAAAjAo/p1kU0vDCUI4GdrqxPETRLcz2sl7rXeRRACHM/s16000/0060-004.png) in the process. (*costs 2.5*)

**Shrapnel:** The ability to [make individual bullets immoble after dividing the trion cube](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Jta14f_7z8Q/WLxJOVMRaeI/AAAAAAAAibc/LFGlawxTpOI4Z7IGPO60hD-qARkzoPMhQCHM/s16000/0099-016.png), so as to lay explosive traps that are even harder to spot even while fighting. (*costs 1*)

**Trampoline** The ability to [summon a pad right under an opponent](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KzcNL9qlhdw/WLxFwxoCFZI/AAAAAAAAh0A/VXkFVyeYgVMUQ_bl2k1we4OsjQwCk_vVACHM/s16000/0141-007.png) at close range to launch them in the air.

# Fighting Style

Haru starts the round using bagworm, and prioritizes finding her opponent as soon as she can (as long as the opponent is an attacker, shooter or gunner). Her goal is to ambush the opponent in a enclosed area. When going against snipers, Haru will lure them by peeking through small areas where she knows she can block at least one shot.

Due to her mediocre trion and not being good at swords, but having a vast knowledge in martial arts at the same time, she uses the shooter bullets at close range due the capability of them to blow opponents rapidly (seen in kazama's match against osamu). In the case she spots the opponent first, she'll close the gap between her and the enemy with grasshopper and use pinball to connect multiple close range shots to quickly finish the round, and if she's lucky enough to close the gap unnoticed, she'll finish the opponent with a single close ranged meteora to the head or torso. If she's spotted first, she'll lure the enemy to a enclosed area to then deploy multiple little bullets of meteora on the floor (shrapnel). Although she prefers to finish rounds quickly, if the match is not going her way, she'll try to win by making the enemy run out of trion using mid-range bullets.

Following a huge **South Coast Connection** presence and a triumphant homecoming last week for **PAC**, as well as finding out the main event for **Unstoppable** on February 9th, Defiant are back with another episode of their weekly wrestling show, Loaded, for free!

&amp;#x200B;

Announced for the show:

&amp;#x200B;

# John Klinger vs Lucky Kid (Main Event):

Following on from his defeat to **BT Gunn** on **Loaded #5**, **Lucky Kid** was attacked for as yet unknown reasons by **John Klinger** after his match on the entrance ramp. The man formerly known as Bad Bones, John Klinger has not yet given a reason for this attack, but having become disgruntled at his position in Defiant, and now refusing to conduct interviews in English, Lucky Kid has a steep battle ahead of him. Can the young Kid pull off an upset, or will Klinger do as he promised, and bring the Badness to Defiant?

&amp;#x200B;

# Mark Haskins vs Anti-Fun Police in a handicap match:

Recent Ring of Honor signee **Mark Haskins** has had enough of the **Anti-Fun Police** (**No Fun Dunne**, **HT Drake** and **Los Federales Super Santos Jr.**) and on **Loaded #6** last week, challenged them to a handicap match, with the aim to get them out of his hair for good. With Haskins and his regular tag team partner **Jimmy Havoc** having disagreements recently, Haskins is going to go it alone, facing off 2-1 against No Fun Dunne and HT Drake. Will Haskins finally get some peace, or will the Anti-Fun Police continue to try and rid the fun from Defiant?

&amp;#x200B;

# Omari vs Nathan Cruz:

Since coming up short in the **RingMaster** tournament, **Nathan Cruz** has had a chip on his shoulder, and on **Loaded #2** he decided to attack a fellow tournament competitor backstage, in **Omari**. After picking up a win on **Loaded #6** last week over **Conor Renshaw**, Omari challenged The Professional as revenge for being put in hospital a number of weeks ago. Cruz has the clear experience advantage, but Omari has been extremely impressive since making his Defiant debut, so it should be an even contest which could go either way, with both men fighting for position on a very competitive roster.

&amp;#x200B;

Plus, General Manager **Prince Ameen** will continue his search for **El Phantasmo**'s light up glasses, in hopes of persuading the Canadian to wrestle in Defiant again.

&amp;#x200B;

Please note, there is a segment this week concerning **Ilja Dragunov**, who due to contractual issues beyond Defiant's control, will no longer be able to perform in his scheduled February dates, however the angle will air as recorded and planned, with a disclaimer for anyone who doesn't know the situation.

*This post is especially for Deeper Leagues and Dynasty Leagues*

First, let me start off by stating that these are players I recommend acquiring, whether it be by trading for them or picking them up off the wire, in *Dynasty* leagues. Most of these guys won’t begin reaching their fantasy potential this season. That being said, if you are strictly a Redraft-leaguer, you can use this article as a tool for next season’s fantasy drafts. As Rookies, the majority of these youngsters are given a short leash. Obviously, that leash will get longer as time goes on.

&amp;#x200B;

Luka Doncic, Jaren Jackson Jr, and DeAndre Ayton – these are all names that we can erase off the whiteboard for obvious reasons. Wendell Carter Jr and Mikal Bridges might also be unavailable, as respected names have already talked these guys up after displaying solid abilities. There are a couple of young guns on this list that could fall into a similar category but I like them enough that I’d still trade away a rather significant package to acquire them.

&amp;#x200B;

*These are the somewhat under-the-radar Rookies I’m trying to acquire in my Dynasty leagues before they truly break out, making it too little too late.*

&amp;#x200B;

# Mo Bamba, C

* ***Ceiling***: Top 20
* ***Realistic Projection***: Top 35
* ***Current Player Comp***: longer Rudy Gobert + willingness to shoot from range
* ***Potential Strengths***: Rebounds – Blocks – FG% – TO’s – with some Points, Steals, &amp; 3’s

*Out of every Rookie we’ll discuss here, Mo Bamba is the surest bet to be owned already in your Dynasty league. He tops this list anyway because I’m still not sure people understand the havoc he can wreak once he’s unleashed. With an NBA Combine record 7’10 wingspan, any shot that enters Bamba’s vicinity has a good chance to go flying into the third row. If you ask me, it’s a good thing that Nikola Vucevic was in Orlando for Bamba’s rookie year. Mo didn’t enter the season with extremely high responsibility like some other lottery selections. He’s been granted valuable freshman time to learn from one of the top post-offensive 7-footers in the league instead of getting his performances picked apart by every expert in the known world. As monstrously long as he is, it’s scary to see how unafraid Bamba is to attempt to space the floor if he so pleases. With an early-round-upside skill set, he just needs the opportunity to put it all together. Below is his per-36 minute averages so far in his rookie season. The numbers are decent but they don’t do him justice. I expect his FG% and FT% to eventually come back up to at least what they were in College (54.1% and 68.1%, respectively), with the added benefit of likely improving even further. Plus, his Points will also come up as his scoring develops.*

*(To see the per-36 chart, click on the link to the website at the bottom of the post.)*

&amp;#x200B;

# Aaron Holiday, PG

* ***Ceiling***: Top 25
* ***Realistic Projection***: Top 40
* ***Current Player Comp***: CJ McCollum + a few more Steals &amp; Assists
* ***Strengths***: Points – Assists – Steals – 3’s – FT%

*As the 23rd pick in the 2018 NBA Draft, the Pacers might have gotten a steal in Aaron Holiday. Defensive potential aside, the youngest professional Holiday brother was a smooth-shooting ballhandler with playmaking upside in College. There’s no reason to think that can’t translate to the big leagues. Currently buried beneath a plethora of veteran Guards on Indiana’s depth chart, there exists a very real scenario where Holiday impresses his way into big minutes next season. Every single notable Guard currently ahead of Holiday (outside of Oladipo) will be a Free Agent this coming Summer. That’s Darren Collison, Tyreke Evans, Cory Joseph, and Bojan Bogdanovic – all free. I’d be surprised if Indiana brought back more than maybe half of those guys, especially considering Sabonis will be due for a hard-earned raise soon. Aaron’s 3-point success and improving movement off-ball will make him a nice fit next to Oladipo. That’s a dynamic duo I’ll be excited to keep my eye on. #AaronHolidaySZN will commence next season. Don’t miss out.*

&amp;#x200B;

# Kevin Huerter, SG

* ***Ceiling***: Top 30
* ***Realistic Projection***: Top 50
* ***Current Player Comp***: more athletic Bogdan Bogdanovic
* ***Strengths***: Points – Assists – 3’s – and hopefully FT%

*A couple of us Unicorns have made apparent our appreciation of Red Velvet‘s fantasy skill set. At the NBA Combine, he made 15 straight triples despite a torn ligament in his shooting hand. Yes, he should be a great 3-point sniper but he also offers much more than that. The old ‘never judge a book by its cover’ saying applies here. Huerter’s athleticism shouldn’t be slept on. In addition to placing first in three separate shooting exercises, Huerter achieved top-3 status in a few physical exercises, including 1st place in the shuttle run. While athletic gifts don’t always translate to fantasy, Huerter’s speed and agility might sneak up on players sometimes, maybe correlating to a few more hustle stats. Outside of all that, his playmaking should also be considered a strength. He may not often get to display this aspect of his game while playing next to a guy like Trae Young but he should at least be good for enough Assists to be considered a plus in that category. I wouldn’t be shocked if Huerter bested my Top 50 projection and worked his way into Top 30-40 territory, similar to Klay Thompson, who he’s often been compared to.*

&amp;#x200B;

# Jalen Brunson, PG

* ***Ceiling***: Top 40
* ***Realistic Projection***: Top 70
* ***Current Player Comp***: bigger Darren Collison
* ***Strengths***: Points – Assists – 3’s – FG% – FT% – and low TO’s

*Believe it or not, the reason I’m attempting to acquire Jalen Brunson in all my deep/rebuilding Dynasty leagues is not for his ceiling. In fact, it’s just the opposite. In my opinion, Brunson has one of the safest floors of all the players drafted in the 2nd round of the 2018 NBA Draft. Joined in the draft by several of his college teammates (Mikal Bridges, Omari Spellman, and Donte DiVincenzo), Brunson is clearly coming from a great developmental program. He knows how to be the primary distributor to a winning cause. The 6’3 Point Guard probably won’t post the flashy hustle stats that you see out of some athletic specimens. That’s not really his game. Brunson’s Rebounds and Blocks might be below average but those aren’t the categories you acquire him for anyway. His niche will be as a beautifully efficient piece to your 9-cat puzzle. In his final season at Villanova, Brunson showed us what his strengths are.*

*(Brunson's college stat chart is on the full article on the website linked down below.)*

Who do y'all think the best and worst teams are for developing home-grown talent?  Looking at this list, I'd say the top three are Golden State, Philadelphia, and Denver.

I last posted my overall ranking 15 days ago and here is the updated list as of after last night's games.

I will also explain the criteria for this ranking as that was a big question last edition:

***It's a ranking of who the best players in the NBA are, right now. I would not consider it a power ranking because I also take past stats, overall season performance, etc into account. I update this list every day.***

***The system I use is watching extended highlights of every game then analyzing the box scores. Then I go through each player individually and move them up or down accordingly based on how they performed each night.***

***I also take other factors into consideration as well though. For example, I moved Justise Winslow up a ton after his last game keeping in mind how consistent he's been lately.***

Anyways:

|Player (change from last edition)|Comment||
|:-|:-|:-|
|1. Stephen Curry (+5)|In the 3 seasons I have done this ranking, this year is the most interesting in terms of there not being a clear number 1. The last 2 years, the whole season it was going to be unquestionably either LeBron, Curry, or Durant at the end of the year. Maybe add Harden to the candidates last year. But this season I would say there are 7-8 players who have a legitimate shot to be number 1, so there is more parity than in the past in that regard. Curry has the top spot right now, has played out of his mind lately and the Warriors are back to the 1 seed.||
|2. Giannis Antetokounmpo (+1)|Continues to be unstoppable in the paint, right now I would give him the slight edge for MVP. The margin between him and Harden right now is very close. Could really even be 2A and 2B. Based on Giannis being healthy the whole season and all around game I will give him the spot but there is still plenty of time.||
|3. James Harden (-1)|This dude really just put up 57 points back to back.||
|4. Anthony Davis (+1)|IDK what magic juice Elfrid Payton has but the Pelicans look different with him back and AD looks better too.||
|5. Kevin Durant (-4)|Still doing his thing and solid, hasn't had as flashy of a month as the players above him but a very legitimate contender for the number 1 spot by the end of the season.||
|6. Kawhi Leonard (-2)|Raptors still number 1 in the east, Kawhi still looking good.||
|7. LeBron James (same)|We are closing in on a month of him being out, I've gotten 2nd and 3rd opinions on this ranking from colleagues. When I started this ranking in 2016, it was ""keep LeBron number 1 unless something crazy happens"". The players ahead of him have continued to play at an elite level with him injured, but when he comes back I'm not doubting the guy.||
|8. Nikola Jokic (same)|For sure a legitimate MVP candidate, and he's been more consistent on offense.||
|9. Paul George (+2)|Career year on offense + arguably the favorite for DPOY has him top 10 right now.||
|10. Rudy Gobert (+8)|A surprise entry into the top 10, Gobert has played great in January with 15/15 averages. More importantly, the Jazz are looking better and his consistent play has been the biggest reason why. Obviously an elite defender too, will he finish this high? Honestly I doubt it but he deserves recognition right now.||
|11. Joel Embiid (-2)|Took KAT to school the other night. Philly has low key been kind of quiet, but it's been a solid year for Embiid so far.||
|12. Bradley Beal (+11)|I did an article about this recently, but the comparisons between him and Ray Allen at the same age are staggering. He also has 31/7/5 averages in the month of January. That's more than just a good hot streak, that's freaking incredible play. He's going to be the primary option the rest of the year, we'll see if he can keep it up.||
|13. Damian Lillard (same)|Passed 12,000 points and I would argue playing the best ball of his career.||
|14. Karl-Anthony Towns (-2)|As I stated got his ass kicked vs. Philly, but the good is he's been superb otherwise. He's gone from all star candidate to pretty clearly getting in.||
|15. Russell Westbrook (-1)|It's kind of crazy that a triple double average at this point is just ""another year for Russell""||
|16. Kyrie Irving (-6)|An incredible game last night vs. Toronto. Boston as a team has been improving, and if Kyrie can ball out in the playoffs a top 10 finish is realistic.||
|17. Blake Griffin (+2)|I am bored watching Detroit, but Blake Griffin's talent this year is unquestioned.||
|18. Ben Simmons (+6)|His consistency has been pretty solid this month and he's showing progression.||
|19. Jimmy Butler (+1)|His leadership has helped Philly keep a top 4 seed and he's playing well himself.||
|20. Kemba Walker (-4)|His game against the Spurs was pretty to watch. What happens to his future over the next few months is even more intriguing.||
|21. Klay Thompson (+15)|Warriors going in the right direction, Thompson averaging 26 PPG on 53% shooting (47 from 3) this month.||
|22. Kyle Lowry (-5)|He hasn't been the same since being injured. But, passing still unquestionably elite right now and he's the starting PG for the number 1 team in the east so it's a conundrum. Also keeping in mind his scorching hot start to the season.||
|23. DeMar DeRozan (-8)|I guess you could say he's in a mini slump. 41% FG in January isn't great. But he's playing solid besides shooting so still in the top 25.||
|24. LaMarcus Aldridge (+9)|If he played in October/November like he has since we're talking top 10 right now.||
|25. Draymond Green (+9)|Warriors trending up, 13+ assists the last 2 games, he still has a ways to go to equal his number 9 ranking last year but he's been better.||
|26. Steven Adams (+1)|Low key one of the more consistent players in the NBA. He's doing his job every night and has been a force for OKC.||
|27. Victor Oladipo (-5)|Probably won't reach the number 12 ranking he had last year, and his 3 point shooting since December is 30%. But Indiana is winning and he's still solid.||
|28. Jrue Holiday (-7)|I have never seen a player be able to put up a more quiet 25 points than Jrue Holiday. You'll watch a game, then look at the box score after and not know what hit you when you see his stats.||
|29. Clint Capela (-4)|His injury is a big blow because dude was trending up before that.||
|30. Luka Doncic (-2)|The hype train is still moving at a rapid pace. 24 PPG in January, if he plays like this the rest of the year he'll finish higher.||
|31. CJ McCollum (same)|The Ringer article that just came out: ""CJ McCollum for Aaron Gordon who says no?"" Um Portland what lol.||
|32. Andre Drummond (-6)|Just in terms of rebounding he's the best the league has seen in a while.||
|33. Khris Middleton (-1)|Solid and efficient this month, Milwaukee is winning, and he's making winning plays.||
|34. Donovan Mitchell (+17)|27 PPG in January and very good to see him back in a groove.||
|35. Jayson Tatum (same)|Scored a career high vs. Brooklyn and is slowly progressing. I think next year we could see a serious breakout.||
|36. Jusuf Nurkic (+10)|He's been an intriguing player to watch since he decided to become the center version of Andrei Kirilenko.||
|37. Julius Randle (+7)|Consistent, has improved as the season continues, all NBA potential in the near future.||
|38. Pascal Siakam (+2)|17/9/4 averages in the month of January. He has off nights but it's been an incredible year so far.||
|39. Domantas Sabonis (same)|Still my pick for 6MOY||
|40. John Wall (-11)|With his injury, at the end of the season his ranking will for sure need some extra evaluation.||
|41. Al Horford (+9)|He's looked good this month, his ranking moves up as a result.||
|42. Mike Conley (-12)|Efficiency down from December and the team is 1-7 in 2019.||
|43. Chris Paul (-6)|Still injured, value down.||
|44. De'Aaron Fox (+5)|Despite his shot cooling off he moves up. Kings are still .500 and he's shown a tendency for winning plays rarely seen in point guards his age.||
|45. Myles Turner (-3)|Overall bounce back year for him, up 21 spots from 2017-2018.||
|46. Tobias Harris (-1)|Still getting buckets, still ridiculous efficiency, but as I said 15 days ago watching him you feel like he could do more.||
|47. Devin Booker (-9)|He's back from injury but needs to stay healthy to move back up.||
|48. John Collins (+24)|Catapults into the top 50 with 19/10 averages at 21 years old. Serious potential here.||
|49. Serge Ibaka (-8)|Quiet month but still making plays for the Raptors and keeps a top 50 spot.||
|50. Nikola Vucevic (-7)|Vucci Man gets the last top 50 spot. We'll see if he's still in Orlando 3 weeks from now.||
|51. Jamal Murray (+4)|18/5/5 averages in January with improved overall efficiency.||
|52. Lou Williams (+8)|21 PPG in 2019 and with the Clippers recent funk they might turn to him to turn it around.||
|53. Eric Bledsoe (-5)|Still one of the best two-way point guards in the league.||
|54. Buddy Hield (+14)|22 PPG in 2019 and shooting 53% from 3. Moving on up.||
|55. Malcolm Brogdon (+15)|This is low key an MIP candidate. His game is so pretty to watch and the dude's IQ is off the charts.||
|56. DeAndre Jordan (-3)|Basically Andre Drummond without the extra stuff at this point.||
|57. Danilo Gallinari (+5)|Has continued to score at a consistent rate.||
|58. Marc Gasol (-11)|Grizzlies possibly looking to trade him. As a Grizzlies fan, sure, but I don't know who would take him.||
|59. Montrezl Harrell (-3)|Unquestionably one of my favorite players to watch.||
|60. Thaddeus Young (-2)|Up 3 spots from his 63rd 2017-2018 finish. And nobody talks about him, but he's the X factor for Indiana.||
|61. Zach LaVine (-9)|Scoring: good. But the Bulls also haven't won a game since December 28.||
|62. DeAndre Ayton (+1)|Not talked about as the Slovenian Strawberry Stud Muffin, but he's got ridiculous long term potential.||
|63. Robert Covington (-4)|Injury has value a tiny bit down.||
|64. Kyle Kuzma (same)|No ESPN I don't care why Kyle Kuzma was tweeting at halftime||
|65. Josh Richardson (-11)|If he played like he did October/November since we're talking about a top 30 player right now. Since December 1 he's shooting 38% from the field.||
|66. Derrick Rose (-9)|Has only played 2 games in 2019, value a bit down.||
|67. Paul Millsap (same)|X factor for Denver.||
|68. Brandon Ingram (-7)|He's shown some progression but also has only made two 3 pointers in 2019.||
|69. Aaron Gordon (+2)|It's been a better January than December for him but still a ways to go.||
|70. JJ Redick (-5)|20 PPG in 2019, has a role and plays it well.||
|71. Andrew Wiggins (+2)|The 40 point game was very good. Needs to be more consistent but the talent is still there.||
|72. Joe Ingles (+3)|His role is a bit different from last year but he's helping Utah win as of late.||
|73. Gary Harris (-7)|Great start to the season but like last year slowed down by injuries.||
|74. Willie Cauley-Stein (same)|He's consistent yes he makes dumb plays but signs of clear talent tends to flash a lot still.||
|75. D'Angelo Russell (+17)|21/8 averages in January gets him a top 75 spot.||
|76. Jonas Valanciunas (-7)|Injured and value down.||
|77. Kevin Love (same)|Injured, but value the same. I'm sort of at the point with his ranking where if I'm debating between him and a player below him I'm like ""eh is he really better than Kevin Love"" so he will probably stay around here until he comes back.||
|78. Marcus Morris (+3)|Slow last 2 games but overall solid year still.||
|79. Hassan Whiteside (-1)|Same story. Some games looks great, some games meh.||
|80. Jerami Grant (+5)|15 PPG on 53% shooting in 2019.||
|81. Bojan Bogdanovic (-5)|Still having a career season.||
|82. Harrison Barnes (-2)|16 PPG this year and shows solid talent. But also shooting 32% so far in 2019.||
|83. Bogdan Bogdanovic (+11)|Still making big plays and is a big reason the Kings have maintained success.||
|84. Spencer Dinwiddie (-1)|Kind of a slow month, but holy cow that game last night.||
|85. Derrick Favors (+2)|A ""so overrated he's underrated"" player.||
|86. Brook Lopez (+7)|""The Milwaukee defense is built around Brook Lopez"" are words I would have never thought would be an article title.||
|87. Nikola Mirotic (+1)|Sort of fell into obscurity when he got injured but the 29 point game last night helps his case.||
|88. Jeff Teague (+1)|Another ""so overrated he's underrated"" player.||
|89. Darren Collison (-7)|Plays role well and nice 15/7/4 game last night.||
|90. Jarrett Allen (+9)|13/11 averages in 2019 has his stock rising.||
|91. TJ Warren (-12)|17 PPG in 2019 although efficiency a bit down from before.||
|92. Jaylen Brown (+5)|Inconsistent but flashes of talent keep him in the top 100 for now.||
|93. Marcus Smart (+12)|Smart jumps into the top 100 with solid play lately. He finished there last year and we'll see if he does this year.||
|94. Dwyane Wade (-4)|Playing his role well and has kept a top 100 spot all year.||
|95. Ricky Rubio (-11)|Injured, value down, has kept a top 100 spot all year but that could be slipping.||
|96. Otto Porter Jr (+8)|I like the Otto Porter Jr off the bench experiment and it has him back in the top 100.||
|97. Dennis Schroder (-11)|Efficiency is down but showing enough to keep a top 100 spot still.||
|98. Danny Green (-3)|Makes shots when needed for the 1 seed Raptors. Still in the top 100.||
|99. Al-Farouq Aminu (+4)|Aminu gets a top 100 spot which makes 4 total for Portland.||
|100. Goran Dragic (-9)|Justise Winslow is 101. The value of Dragic remains down with him injured, and Winslow is moving up. I gave Dragic the edge for now but both players are moving in different directions.||

With Dedmon on the trading block, the Atlanta Hawks could be looking at moving onto a new starting center situation.

Currently, there seem like 3 candidates:
Alex Len, Omari Spellman, and John Collins sliding to the 5.

Collins has been great at the 4, so I won't really talk about the possibility of him sliding to C since it seems it'd only be for short durations. 

**Omari Spellman has drawn two starts with Dedmon out, with the following results:**

Jan 13 vs MIL: 29MP, 13 PTS, 4-9 FG, 4-7 3P, 1-2 FT, 2 OREB, 4DREB, 1AST, 4 BLK, 2 TO and 4 PF.

Jan 15 vs OKC: 21MP, 10PTS, 4-6FG, 1-3 3P, 1-2 FT, 3 DREB, 3 AST, 1BLK, 3PF.

The difference in minutes is that the first game vs. MIL, Alex Len got into significant foul trouble and played much less. This was reversed vs OKC.

**Len's stats:**

Jan 13th vs MIL: 17MP, 12 PTS, 5-8FG, 2-2 FT, 5 OREB, 3 DREB, 2 TO, Fouled out.

Jan 15th vs OKC: 30MP, 24 PTS, 9-14 FG, 1-4 3PT, 5-6 FT, 4 OREB, 7 DREB, 3AST, 1 STL, 2BLK, 4 fouls.

With this performance, I'm personally seeing the center assignment for the Hawks looking like a 2-man timeshare between Spellman and Len. Perhaps it's equal time, perhaps it's matchup dependent, but what is everyone's thoughts on 12-14 Team league relevancy?

Spellman has the benefit of taking 3s (granted he's only a 35ish percent shooter from 3), and has some upside on the defensive end, whereas Len is a career 48% FG, non-triple shooter, with stronger rebound numbers, and stronger blocks so far. Len is also much taller and more experience than Spellman, so you can see him being the go-to for hard to guard centers like Embiid, Davis, Cousins. That said, Spellman is one of the heavier guys in the league and could be huge for post defense despite being 6'9"". 

Interested to see some discussion on if Spellman is worth stashing in the event of a Dedmon trade, and which center is the one to roster if you could only chose one.",False,False,False,fantasybball,t5_2s5ct,r/fantasybball,76194,public,confidence,self,,,"[PD] Alex Len vs. ""The Wizard"" Omari Spellman",,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybball/comments/agnsw4/pd_alex_len_vs_the_wizard_omari_spellman/,,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,,,

# Brackets

The tournament’s format will appear perplexing, but it was all I could think of that would allow everyone to fight at least 4 times without going over 50 matches, and which would reduce the importance of luck in how far you go.

What I did was divide the participant poll in 4 randomly generated groups of 5. Within each group, each member will fight all others, which means a total of 4 fights. A victory is worth 1 point, a tie 0.5 (time runs out or simultaneous KO), and a loss 0. This is the first stage of the tournament. The contestant who wins the most fights in each group will advance to the second stage: another round robin, but this time against the winner of each of the other groups. Contestants in the second phase will be ranked 1-X. I say “1-X” instead of “1-4” because if two people tie for the top score within one same group, they will both be admitted to Phase 2. In the event of a draw in this group, the contestant who scored the most wins in the first phase will be ranked higher. Should that not break the tie either, a rematch for the position will take place.

Contestants who did not make it to the second stage will fight 4 times total… unless they decide to extend a challenge to someone in another group. I will not be moderating these encounters, but by that point you’ll know how to do so yourself, and these fights will be considered “canon”: they will affect the ranking. If you did not make it to Phase 2 but win enough fights, you can even challenge one of the contestants who did to try and take their spots (you’ll need at least the same win-loss ratio minus 1 win).

The four groups of Phase 1 are the following:

1.	shubielah, JonyDrake, DarthSchu, ~~Funlife2003~~ gamerules, shoterxx
2.	fauzi236, 6_lasers, reEmperorBob, Louisdragonboy, MadnessLemon
3.	nomyriad, The_Merciful_Fox, WrongFont, ~~hotcoco222~~ electrocio, Gorynch
4.	Tau-Cola, Please_Not__Again, Kairos__, Lampyris, Geistphase

# Dates &amp; Minimum Votes
----

During Stage 1, matches inside one same group will take place every 5 days, and they will happen concurrently with those of other groups: this means that a total of 4 matches will start on the exact same day, and terminate 4 days later. For a match to end, however, it is necessary  that a minimum of 5 people vote; should this not happen, the next batch of matches will be delayed until we gather enough votes. I will vote only if by day 5 of the match we only have tied votes.

And this is when everyone will fight in Phase 1:

Of course, if any of these dates (or the following day!) is absolutely no good for you, let me know. Do also keep in mind that **I must be PM’ed your strategies within 24 hours of when I post the match**, which is also when you will find out what map your opponent has chosen (if you haven’t prepared your strategy in advance, it won’t make a difference; if you have, see what you can keep and tweak the rest; or you can use your 6-line rebuttal to address the difficulties created by the map if you don’t have the time to tweak your strategy. Even if you don’t, voters will have to imagine how your OC will deal with that map.

# Maps
----

After figuring out the when, the next step is obviously the where. When two OCs with the same number of victories and losses fight (which means at the very least the first two fights of each group), the map must be Cityscape A, the one where the TamaIkoOuji match took place. It is the most basic map of all, with a little bit of everything: buildings big and small, open areas, narrow and medium streets… The weather will be the default one (daytime, sunny). However, if one of the two fighters has a lower victory ratio and/or lower stats (more on this later), they get to pick the map. The choice is limited to the maps that have been revealed until now:

1.	[Cityscape A](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QgcteTBG0DA/WLxEDaZ6iRI/AAAAAAAAhhM/iFy7SvEJYVE9Z7BodPwzjtXKy5-sWXmkACHM/s16000/0152-003.png) (TamaIkoOuji): Described as the most standard map, it is large and with a little bit of everything. Matches here last 45 minutes.
2.	[Cityscape B](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-H4dEQs9euKY/WLxEIrexLSI/AAAAAAAAhiA/6_KqB5ASawk65_FxZ7C4YxZj3K6JzSs0ACHM/s16000/0111-003.png) (NinoKageTamaAzu): Smaller than Cityscape A and with fewer tall buildings, but overall more open spaces. Matches here last 40 minutes.
3.	[Cityscape C](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NSfGzMXNZBE/WLxQb-Q5ipI/AAAAAAAAjrw/AQMg-Qvgx7U6G4sK-z_f2Xkme95DgtzXACHM/s16000/0088-011.png) (SuwaAraTama): [A town built into a slope](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-b7xfJaH340s/WLxMkM-pggI/AAAAAAAAjAc/yQPbuzTEcN02lQFGou7WK8TPX39xe71HACHM/s16000/0088-004.png). Matches here last 35 minutes.
4.	[Cityscape D](http://93.190.142.23/manga/World-Trigger/0167-001.png) (KageTamaAzuSuzu): A very small map [with tall buildings lining along a broad road and a large six-story mall at the center](http://93.190.142.23/manga/World-Trigger/0165-015.png). Matches here last 30 minutes.
5.	[Riverbank](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MxmKsC4qgl8/WLxUPdibCGI/AAAAAAAAkWk/9n6StH9REaUYEI8OcDcL7ZpBI2b0AKeHgCHM/s16000/0095-019.png) (TamaSuzuNasu): A map crossed by [a waist-deep river](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OfSvoIwE5GQ/WLxSrxdHhoI/AAAAAAAAkEQ/4Z-zRV8w8aM7NVUbauUVGS0tDG0HHTQxQCHM/s16000/0095-016.png) with a wide road along each bank and, beyond them, buildings. The two banks are connected by a bridge. Matches here last 40 minutes.
6.	[Industrial Area](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-t2JWrCvVjIE/WLxJdk_BxUI/AAAAAAAAieQ/UlTAz3W12loBx2t7diP836Dvqg8xmgV3gCHM/s16000/0137-017.png) (TamaKatoKaki): A map with a few medium-width and many extremely narrow roads, and which alternates tall buildings which are very easy to scale with patches of smaller ones. Matches here last 30 minutes.

The weather condition and time of day are the default ones (daytime, sunny) unless either OC has lower stats than the opponent. In this case the owner of the OC with lower stats will be able to also pick the time of day and weather condition ***provided they notify me the day before the match***.  You can also pick a weather condition that has not appeared in the manga yet, provided you discuss it with me first. No natural catastrophes though (e.g. hurricanes, earthquakes, eruptions)...

**EDIT: Each fighter knows the general area their opponent spawns.**

# Extra Points
----

After each match both contestants will receive 0.5 points to add to their OC’s stats. Stats must be integers with the sole exception of Special Techniques, which can have that extra .5. Once you decide where to allocate that 0.5 extra it cannot be removed. You can also choose to wait for one or more matches before adding it.

If one’s Trion stat allows it, it is also possible to add more Triggers to one’s set; however, like the 0.5 extras, these Triggers cannot be removed once selected.

Extras and map selection serve to simulate improvisation. You had a whole strategy planned out until you find out shortly before the match that a nasty map, an unfavorable weather condition, or a new Special Technique the opponent has purchased throw a monkey wrench in it? Too bad. These are also parts of Rank Battles.

# Character Knowledge, Votes and Strategies
----

I have already tackled these subjects [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldtrigger/comments/afad78/oc_tournament_character_knowledge_strategies_and/), but all your OCs will know about each other the first time they fight will be their respective positions and Trigger Sets; that’s it. No stats, special techniques, or fighting style. It is up to the voters to call bullshit if one strategy includes unrealistic reactions or is based on information an OC could not know. In fact, the first thing a voter should do is estimate whether the strategies and advantages listed by the fighters are consistent with the OC’s knowledge and stats. For a mock battle where you can see how everything works, go [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldtrigger/comments/afdjvg/oc_tournament_mock_battle/), and visit /r/HxHFolkvangr to see matches based in a very similar system (again, all credit goes to /u/Kairos__).

The following is the list of positions, determined through your OC's points:

* shubielah: Omari -&gt; Sniper
* JonyDrake: Haru -&gt; Shooter
* DarthSchu: Zyn -&gt; Gunner
* ~~Funlife2003~~ gamerules: Broman -&gt; Shooter
* shoterxx: Yuki -&gt; Attacker
* fauzi236: Delorin -&gt; All-Rounder
* 6_lasers: Peter -&gt; Sniper
* reEmperorBob: Bob -&gt; Attacker
* Louisdragonboy: VN -&gt; Gunner
* MadnessLemon: Akifumi -&gt; Attacker
* nomyriad: Rei -&gt; Sniper
* The_Merciful_Fox: Sophita -&gt; Attacker
* WrongFont: Felix -&gt; Gunner
* ~~hotcoco222~~ electrocio: Jaxx -&gt; Attacker
* Gorynch: Isaac -&gt; Gunner
* Tau-Cola: Naruki -&gt; Sniper
* Please_Not__Again: Hysuther -&gt; All-Rounder
* Kairos__: Kairos -&gt; Attacker
* Lampyris: Yoshiro -&gt; Shooter
* Geistphase: Hon -&gt; Attacker

For the moment, this is it! More details on Stage 2 will be released once we know how many people will be in it. I hope you have a blast, everyone!

If you have any additional questions or want to see guaranteed updates in regards to breaking news-  I provide additional updates, information, and stats on my twitter **@bathrobeDFS.** Feel free to throw me a follow cause it’s much easier and more timely to provide updates over that medium. It also should go without saying, this is just a preliminary analysis of the slate: everything can change throughout the day, so make sure you are staying on top of any and all injury news and change your lineups accordingly! I am always available to help with any questions there, as well, even if I can’t do a second article. Let’s get started with the Review!

That’s a list of names of people that underperformed yesterday, either by a little or by an incredible amount. Some of these people were massively owned. Some were 2% owned punts. But this is the list. I went through every game and checked every DK score and compared it to their prices. If you played any of them (or, much more likely, several of them), you got it in a bad way today. You might think that you needed to play Harden AND Brow to win today, but if you start at the top of the 425k DK major GPP, you won’t hit a lineup with both Harden and Brow until you get to 10th. Only 2 more people in the top 20 had both, as well. It seems you had to pick either Harden OR Brow and then have a bunch of Russell, Brown, Tatum, Jarrett Allen, Gobert, Kurucs, and LMA scattered in your remaining spots. This is going to go down as one of the most frustrating slates of the year (and in recent memory). I honestly can’t recall so many people talked up around the industry that just flamed out in a horrible fashion. I wanted to go the “either Harden or Brow” route since I didn’t want to get more then 2 people in the 3000s that weren’t Rozier. So I chose Harden with Capela being out and the 80% usage rate he would have. I then went with Donovan who would have no choice to control almost all of the game. He started out poorly, but almost hit value at the end. I also locked in Nurkic who was someone, not only who showed personal success against the Kings, but who was just a great center playing against the Kings, a position I would always rank very highly. I then wanted to get Rozier, Brown, and Hayward in there. I figured, against BK, there would be enough DKP to go around with Kyrie out. It turns out most of it went to Brown and Tatum, leaving almost everyone else on the roster out in the cold. I also wanted to get Nene, who has the chance of a solid 1 PPM production and would be getting 18-20 minutes. He shat the bed (so did almost everyone). That left me 3400 and the F spot. I had Holiday locked in there until Memphis announced that Holiday would not, in fact, be starting as most places had been calling since Anderson’s injury. I had to choose if I wanted to take the risk, pivot to another risky Grizzly, or pivot to a Net who would be starting, could get 30 minutes, and might fall into some production. He had been shooting the ball 6-8 times recently (brought in as someone who would shoot 3s) and, if some of those fell, he could provide nice value, as well as as run-back against the 3 Celtics I played.

Do yourself a favor and go back and read that list of names again. That is only a 6 game slate worth of names. That’s only 12 teams. 45 names, by my count. And I’m sure I missed some. That’s just staggering. Don’t get down on yourself. Most people had a horrifying day yesterday. All we can do is try to learn the lessons we can, then wipe it from our memories and start fresh today. No team that played yesterday is playing today, so we can treat this as a bit of a palate cleanser. 

***The Daily Slate:***

***Matchup Specific Ceiling (MSC) Pick of the Day***

Matchup Specific Ceiling is a “quasi-metric” I use to make decisions. [**If you haven’t read my explanation, please check out this link right here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/dfsports/comments/a9ckrh/bathrobedfs_good_chalkbad_chalk_and/)

The explanation begins in the “injury/lineup news” section about halfway down.

In this section, I will pick the player who has fewest factors preventing him from reaching his ceiling, considering spread, pace, O/U, defense, usage, teammate health, and other factors.

***Nikola Jokic*** - There are some great folks tonight in some great spots. For a 6 game slate, the number of high priced superstars is pretty incredible: Westbrook, Giannis, Embiid, Jokic, KAT, Curry, Durant, Simmons, PG13 are all over 9k (with the 10k line coming after KAT). As always, this is a section that has less to do with pricing, though, and more to do with who has the best chance of having a ceiling game. Westbrook and PG13 against Atlanta is mouthwatering, but risky. Embiid/Simmons and KAT could go at each other all night, or could force each other into foul trouble. Giannis is a freak and two Justise Winslows wouldn’t be able to stop him.  Curry and Durant are both coming off great games. But when looking through all the spots today, one of the things that stuck out the most to me was everything Jokic has had going for him lately. First, I think he has either the best or 2nd best chance for the triple double bonus today. That’s just extra points he will get that only Russ has a decent chance of seeing. Second, this game has a significant O/U of 228. What is better, though, is a spread of GS -1. It’s not often we get a Warriors game that has the potential to get into a shootout, but when it does I want to get in on that. Third, Denver is in one of the biggest pace up spots of the day, as the 27th ranked team taking on the 10th ranked GS. Fourth, GS has been below average against C this season (but especially the last month). Not that anyone can stop Jokic, anyway. He has been out of this world this year. As I said about him in regards to the Clippers matchup a few days ago- if they put someone on him that stops him from getting his shot, he draws the defenders in and gets 10 assists by the middle of the 2nd quarter. If they try to move out and cover everyone, he annihilates whoever is on him and he winds up putting up 40 real points. Even with the exceptional defense of Dray, and the smart coaching of Kerr, I don’t expect them to be able to deal with the sheer number of options Jokic can create on the floor. Especially, again, when the Warriors have been below league average against Centers as it is. Jokic’s usage is also, by far, the highest on the Nuggets. Even with Millsap back, his usage hasn’t really changed at all. With Harris Questionable, I have to assume that, once again, he will be severely limited when he returns which shouldn’t change Jokic’s usage at all. He missed a ton of time, was getting back into regular minutes, then injured his hamstring enough to miss 4 games. To be honest, with how much work Harris would have to put in on the defensive end (ditto Craig and Millsap), even if they say he is starting and playing his normal run of minutes, my interest for Jokic wouldn’t wane in this matchup. Vegas expects this game to finish with a 115-113 score. You think Jokic isn’t going to have a share in a shit load of those 113??


**Situations to take advantage of (in no particular order):**

* ***Richaun Holmes*** - With **Devin Booker (8400)** coming back from back spasms tonight (yeesh), I am hesitant to pay for a player with a back issue who will be guarded by Vic Oladipo. His usage, though, does detract from everyone else, who are priced at completely fair prices. The one person who is getting a lot of run, though, and the ownership and price is starting to catch up to, is **Richaun Holmes (4000)**. He has been regularly getting into the 30DKP range. He has been providing a lot of scoring and defense off the bench, and they have been rewarding him with extra run. He has been using that extra run to reward us. In a game in which the Suns will need his defense, I expect Holmes to get extra minutes (as well as any blowout run, should it come to that). 

* ***Jimmy Butler*** - I have gone on the record saying that I think revenge narratives are completely overblown for the most part. A lot of times, the players don’t actually hold any grudges, and it will do nothing to change how they perform that night. **Jimmy Butler (7600)**, though, is not the kind of player that processes emotion like that. First, the Wolves have been one of the weakest teams against SF all season (something they were hoping Covington would change). This puts Butler in a great spot. This game has the 2nd highest O/U on the slate, 231, with a close enough spread of PHI -6. This also puts Butler in a great spot. Butler proved he has a deep burning hatred in his heart for the Timberwolves, and will take the 3rd string team and beat the starters by himself. That puts Butler in a great spot. Butler will have to be dragged off the court by the coach to stop him from shooting the ball 30 times tomorrow. If Brett Brown is smart, he’ll let him. A motivated Jimmy Butler is a scary thing, if you remember his days in Chicago, and you and I both know that, as far as revenge narratives go, this one is not a media creation. It’s a Jimmy Butler creation. If you don’t wanna go there, or Butler winds up being chalk, this is a great environment for production so you should make sure to get some of this game (on both sides). After SF, MIN is weakest against PG, putting **Ben Simmons (9400)** in a great, although incredibly expensive, spot. KAT is a defender that can be exploited, and **Embiid (10500)** is one of the best in the business. There is a log jam at C though, and it will be really, really hard to play him.

* ***KAT*** - Don’t get me wrong, Embiid is a good defender. He’s just not an elite defender. And **KAT (10200)** has shown that, the way he’s been playing lately, it wouldn’t really matter if he was. There *are* 2 really good defenders on the Sixers, though- Ben Simmons, the 2nd ranked PG in DRPM, who will be guarding **Jeff Teague (6100)**, and Jimmy Butler, the 5th ranked SG, who will be defending **Andrew Wiggins (6500)**. This means that, once again, the lion’s share of production in what is going to be a high scoring, fast paced, close game, will fall to KAT. The Sixers are 7th in pace and the Wolves are 12th. The O/U is 231 and the spread is only PHI -6. The one caveat I need to make is that Derrick Rose is Questionable. If he is out, it’s a huge boost to KAT. If he is in, it slightly hurts KAT’s production (from the zero-sum perspective). As I said in the Jimmy Butler section, this is one of the best games on the slate in terms of possible production. It’s going to be hard not to get a piece of this, and, with the other pieces facing superior defensive options, I will be looking to KAT. On one C sites, I would still pick Jokic first. But on DK, If enough value opens up, I will try to get Jokic and KAT in my lineup tonight. I should also point out that **Saric (4600)** was completely blindsided by the trade, by an organization that had sat him down and promised to keep him around for years to come. While I don’t know if the Wolves are going to give him enough minutes to matter, if you think they let him get that frustration out, feel free to punt with Saric tonight. I don’t think i’ll be able to afford that for someone getting 15-20 minutes, but pay attention to the news. You never know if they let him start! 

* ***Dennis Schroder*** - Picking **Schroder (5400)** today gives me access to the highest O/U game on the slate, at 233, without spending the crazy money needed to get to **Russ (11600)** or **PG13 (9200)**. Don’t get me wrong, Russ is in a great spot- he’s going against the worst defender in the entire NBA, in the most pace up spot possible, against a front court that won’t be able to stop him. Similarly, PG13, who was just priced over 10k, has fallen back down to 9200 after 3 subpar performances (for him). Like Russ, there is no one that  can stop him on this team and he should be able to have his way with the entirety of the Hawks defense. Schroder, however, might be the sneakier pick for a number of reasons. First, as I’m sure you all know, Schroder, like Jimmy Butler, is the kind of player that holds grudges and he has one against his old team, the Hawks. Second, even with his recent slump, Schroder is still top 50 in the NBA in usage. Third, regardless of whether or not this game blows out (which should be a real concern), Schroder should be safe to get 30ish minutes. Fourth, Schroder is one of those streaky players (like Aaron Gordon) who you want to get when he’s getting hot. We may be seeing that, with a solid 8-17 shooting performance in the 2nd game against the Spurs on his way to 37.25 DKP. 

* ***Alex Len*** - As much as anyone who writes/talks about DFS hates Alex Len days, here we are. Dedmon is doubtful and is not expected to play. This means **Alex Len (4100)** will get the start and starter’s minutes at way, way too cheap a price. Yes, we know the Thunder are a great defensive team and Adams is a good defender. But on a slate which begs for as much value as possible, it will be nearly impossible to pass up Len today in a slam dunk value spot. If you want to get really sneaky, or the ownership on Len gets out of control, I strongly, strongly suggest a pivot down to **Omari Spellman (3800)** who should be backing Len up today. He is about as risky as it gets, but he did get 30 minutes in their last game, and put up 31 DKP in that time. 

* ***Steph Curry*** - I don’t normally like recommending players from the GoldenState TooManyCooks, given how crazy the pricing is, and how split the usage is, but today **Steph Curry (9900)** is in the best spot, by far. When fully healthy, the major weakness the Nuggets team has is against PGs. Jokic, Millsap, Craig, and Harris are all above average defenders, leaving Jamal Murray as the weak link. And Curry has been incredibly hot as of late. Like, he has one blow out game where he got 46.75 DKP in 27 minutes and that’s the lowest DKP he’s had since Xmas. That includes 74.5 DKP last game against the Mavs, where he put up 48 real points. Jokic is a fantastic play, as I said before, in part because it’s rare that a GS game has a near 230 total and a spread of -1. This is going to be a great game to jump all over, and Curry is not priced high enough for what he should be able to do to Jamal Murray. I will start my lineups with Jokic being run back by Curry tonight. 

* ***Bulls/Lakers*** - Again, as has been the case lately, every single person for this game is underpriced for their ceiling, meaning this is a great, great place to come for GPP plays. The low 214 total should also keep people away, but the spread is close enough, and the prices are low enough, that this game is ripe for the taking. Right now the most expensive play in this entire game is **Kuzma (7300)** who has, again, shown that he can get you 5x that just in pure points. Next come the duo of **Dunn (6900)** and **LaVine (6800)** who are going to be seeing the really great D of Ball and Hart, but are still underpriced for the % of the team’s production they are responsible for. Even in a tough defensive matchup, both are capable of giving you a 50 DKP day. **Ball (6700)** and **Ingram (6600)** are both in decent spots, but with their recent production, I consider them more cash plays- guys that will probably get you right around that 5x mark with an occasional ceiling game. The two sneaky plays I will have a hard time playing are **McGee (5300)** and **Carter (5300)**. The Bulls are, by far, weakest against C. McGee should be able to throw his offensive style all over if he wants (though lately, he hasn’t really been given the chance). Not only have the Lakers been bad against C, they have been, by far, the worst in the NBA against Centers in the past month. This means that if Carter can push for 30 minutes tonight, he should be able to push past 30 DKP. The last time Carter got 30 minutes against a team that was shitty against Centers was December 28th when he put up 44.75 DKP against the Wizards in 33 minutes.

**Situations to be careful of(in no particular order):**

* ***The Miami Humidity/Milwaukee Bucks*** - With as deep as the Heat rotation has been lately, these players are really all wet today. This game does not have an O/U yet, even though no one of any significance is Questionable. I expect it to be pretty low though, compared to the other games on this slate pushing the 230 mark. I will make this one note- over the last month, the Bucks are worst-in-the-NBA against PFs. So, while I would love this to point me to someone, who on the Heat is playing more than 20 minutes at that position this game?? That’s right. No one. If you want to take a bet that **Justise (6500)** can beat Bledsoe’s defense at that price, go ahead, but I won’t be anywhere on this team (barring injury news). Similarly, there are no prices on the Bucks that really stand out, given the fact everyone is finally healthy. No one would argue against playing **Giannis (11200)** who is a freak and could have the biggest game on the slate, but the odds of that happening are less for him than for other people. And 11200 is a lot to ask without being the easy best play that day. 

**Situations to monitor:**

* ***Pacers Injuries*** - As of right now, Collison, Turner, and Cory Joseph are Questionable for this game. In a game where I do not like a lot of pricing, I really hope the news comes out some combo of these players will be in. I would love to attack the Suns at the Center position, and, while I love to play **Sabonis (7900)**, that price is getting pretty high up there given the other slate pricing. **Turner (6500)** practiced this weekend, hoping to return from a nerve issue (and, again, as someone with severe nerve issues.. It’s not fun or easy to deal with. It’s honestly hard to even think about anything else when that kind of issue happens- think tooth pain, that’s a nerve issue). If Turner is back, and not restricted in any way (unlikely), I will have him 100%. He was priced 8000 before his injury and, in this matchup, could easily perform as if he should be again. Ditto **Collison (5000)** who is generally an up and down player depending on the matchup. Well, this is a great matchup for Collison, and a great price for him to get 6-7x. If he is out, **Cory Joseph (3300)** becomes the play of the day. Unless Joseph is ALSO out, since he is also questionable, at which point **Aaron Holiday (3100)** becomes a stone lock (and you should give serious, serious consideration to a seriously slumping **Oladipo (7800)** though I will have a hard time going there until he shows some signs of life). 

Alright, today is another day. Remember- everyone was on those plays last night. It wasn’t just a couple of people that underperformed, it was at least 45. If you assume 10 players per team, that is more than 1/3 of all players and I didn’t even include a HUGE amount of punts and people that only played 3-5 minutes. Let’s hope a slate like that never happens again, and we all start fresh tonight! Let’s get it, folks!

**Omari Spellman drops nearly 22 pounds**

&gt;Omari Spellman said he fell out of the rotation because he was overweight.
Spellman weighed as much as 293 pounds, but has since dropped back down to 271 — the Hawks have him listed at 245. ""Pretty much, I was fat,"" Spellman said. ""I had to lose weight. That’s what allowed me to get back. That’s why I have been working as hard as I have and that’s why I haven’t been playing."" It sounds like the rookie is back on the right track in that regard, and he fared really well in a fill-in start for Dewayne Dedmon (ankle) on Sunday with 13 points, four 3-pointers, six rebounds and four blocks in 30 minutes. While not an add yet, he’ll be a name to monitor with Dedmon on the block and the Hawks looking to play their younger guys more often. Jan 14 - 10:20 AM

Kevin Knox 2 

Allonzo Trier, Hamidou Dallo, Jalen Brunson, Landry Shamet all got in the hall once

Bruce Brown did once before I lost all my data and had to start again
Donte DiVencenzo, Drew Eubanks, Gary Clark Jr, Jaron Blossomgame, and Mikal Bridges all got shut out of the hall.

Blossomgame had the most championships for never getting into the hall 10

Jaren Jackson Jr ha the most overall at 11

There is a universe where De'Anthony Melton had 5 60+ point games.

And one where Trae Young scored 72

And one where Jaren Jackson Jr. Topped 60 points...41 times...and maxed out at 78 (He had 48 of the top 50 scoring outputs for the 21 year span I track the league) ended his career with 54000+pts and 18000+ rebounds. Wow universe 8.

两个白人青年的出现打破了埃尔金和大卫的梦想，他们不仅剽窃了两人精心设计的舞蹈，更是对此无耻的行径丝毫不以为意。为了维护自己的梦想，埃尔金和大卫向剽窃者发出了挑战，他们要用更热烈，更完美的舞姿来彰显实力。通向成功的道路并不平坦，但只要心存梦想，就能够勇往直前。©豆瓣

[](#icon-net-big) **MATCH EVENTS**

1': We're off! 

2': Early threat from the Syrians, but Omar Al Soma's header bounces off-target, deflecting off his teammate and out for a goal kick.

5': 📒 *Jonathan Cantillana* carded for a bad sliding challenge

6': The Palestinian keeper drops the ball! Kharbin swivels and slams it on target but it's cleared off the line!

28': SAVE!! It's a looping header that's dipping just under the Palestinian crossbar but it's kept out by Rami Hedarah! And if it had gone in it would have been an own goal, it last came off poor Mohamed Saleh who is very grateful for his keeper right now. 

39': Osama Omari's being stretchered off. He went down clutching his knee, looks like a ligament gave way or something. 

41': Cantillana fires a wild shot into the stands.

41': 🔁 Syria substitution: *Youssef Kalfa* on for *Osama Omari*

43': 📒 *Mohammed Saleh* gives up a dangerously-positioned free kick with a horrible sliding challenge

**HT Syria 0 - 0 Palestine** Frustrating for Syria who have had the better chances but nothing to show for it. 

----

46': We're back!

46': Al Somah starts the half with an early shot, he's falling backwards and kicks it wildly off the mark

59': 📒 *Musab Al-Battat* slides hard into Fahad Youssef's toes

60': Youssef Kalfa's shot takes a tricky bounce in front of the keeper but Rami Hamadeh still manages to cover it. 

64': 🔁 Palestine substitution: *Alexis Norambuena* on for *Pablo Tamburrini*

68': 📕 SECOND YELLOW FOR MOHAMMED SALEH! Kharbin got hit in the head by Saleh's flying elbow! Palestine down to ten! They were both jumping in the air with their arms up, that's a harsh call.

70': El Somah fires the free kick low at goal. That's some distance to try and score from directly, Hamedeh catches it easily.  

73': 🔁 Syria substitution: Mohammed Osman* on for *Mohamad Zaher Almadani*

75': 📒 *Tamer Hag Mohamad* with a wild and ugly challenge on Mohammad Darweesh

76': 🔁 Palestine substitution: *Shadi Shaban* on for *Jonathan Cantillana*

80': Big header from Omar Al Somah goes well wide but wins a corner because the keeper doesn't let it just go out

80': 🔁 Syria substitution: *Ahmed Ashkar* on for *Tamer Hag Mohamad*

82': 🔁 Palestine substitution: *Nazmi Albadawi* on for *Yashir Islame*

90+2': 📒 *Ahmed Ashkar* knocks down an attacker with an elbow and gets carded for the professional foul

I like the idea of this sub, and will start posting content on here.

I started ranking every player in the league in November 2016 and have been doing it ever since. Doing a list like that will never be perfect but I put 40+ hours a week into it during the season and make sure it's accurate as possible.

Any player who has played at all this season is eligible (i.e. Carmelo). Any player who hasn't is not (Cousins, Porzingis) that's really it in regards to that.

This is my updated complete list as of last night, and well there's one big surprise.

|**1. Kevin Durant**|My number 1 player for 2017-2018 has the top spot still. There are for sure honestly 3-4 players who have an argument but KD is the 2X reigning Finals MVP and he's number 1 for now.||
|**2. James Harden**|What Harden did to end 2018 is absurd. He's a very close number 2.||
|**3. Giannis Antetokounmpo**|Giannis comes in at number 3. Quite literally unstoppable in the paint + improved playmaking.||
|**4. Kawhi Leonard**|Just scored a career high and has the Raptors number 1 in the East.||
|**5. Anthony Davis**|The Pelicans are a mini mess but AD is a ridiculous talent with 29/13/5 averages.||
|**6. Stephen Curry**|3 PT PCT has gone up from last year and is still scoring at an elite level.||
|**7. LeBron James**|Well here we go. This is likely his floor, when I started this list 2.5 years ago it was pretty much ""LeBron is number 1 and the regular rules don't apply to him"". That's changed, with him out for a little bit, the players ahead of him have remained elite at the same level as LeBron. I highly doubt he finishes the year here, but the conversation is that the other elite players at this point are equal to him in reputation right now.||
|**8. Nikola Jokic**|The Nuggets are the 1 seed and Jokic just had a ridiculous 19/15/14 triple double.||
|**9. Joel Embiid**|Embiid is an elite low post scorer, the best player in Philly, he gets a top 10 spot.||
|**10. Kyrie Irving**|Efficient shooting + career high 6.6 APG. Hopefully the eye injury isn't too serious.||
|**11. Paul George**|It's been a career season, even better than any year in Indiana.||
|**12. Karl-Anthony Towns**|The last few games he has shown the ridiculous potential he has. If he can continue this level of play consistently the narrative on him will change quick.||
|**13. Damian Lillard**|Shooting efficiency at a career best and making clutch plays consistently.||
|**14. Russell Westbrook**|By his own account he wasn't very good to end the year. Still averaging a triple double for the winning Thunder though.||
|**15. DeMar DeRozan**|His shooting efficiency is down from Toronto, but his leadership + other areas of his game are up and he has the Spurs firmly in the playoff hunt.||
|**16. Kemba Walker**|His level of play to start the season has mostly remained consistent and he's in the top 20.||
|**17. Kyle Lowry**|Still injured, but 14/10 averages for the best team in the East and his play to start the year was ridiculous.||
|**18. Rudy Gobert**|His role as a scorer has gone up + defense remains elite.||
|**19. Blake Griffin**|25/9/5 averages and he's changed his game up as he enters his 30's.||
|**20. Jimmy Butler**|Has made clutch plays, scoring hasn't been the most consistent but the top 20 talent is there.||
|**21. Jrue Holiday**|The most underrated elite talent in the NBA.||
|**22. Victor Oladipo**|Pacers are still winning with him back from injury.||
|**23. Bradley Beal**|Wall is out for the year, and Beal has full reign to be the primary scorer now. He's in the top 25 right now and we'll see how he does going forward.||
|**24. Ben Simmons**|Elite all around game, lack of long range shooting starting to become more of an issue.||
|**25. Clint Capela**|Has progressed from last season and I consider him a legitimate all star candidate.||
|**26. Andre Drummond**|Elite rebounder, with his talent you would like to see more as a scorer.||
|**27. Steven Adams**|It's been a career year for him and his December was ridiculous. ||
|**28. Luka Doncic**|Yes Luka is top 30 already. 20/7/5 averages as a 19 year old and only getting better.||
|**29. John Wall**|Is now out for the season. After a top 20 finish last year, this season was a down.||
|**30. Mike Conley**|21/7/4 averages. As a Grizzlies fan would love to see him in the all star game although I don't have him as one.||
|**31. CJ McCollum**|A bit inconsistent but the ridiculous scoring ability is there and he makes clutch plays.||
|**32. Khris Middleton**|Started the year well, hit a mini slump, now playing well again. Was also ranked 32nd for 2017-2018.||
|**33. LaMarcus Aldridge**|Very slow start to the season but dude's been balling out lately.||
|**34. Draymond Green**|Scoring not where it's been before, but his impact on the floor otherwise still is.||
|**35. Jayson Tatum**|With Kyrie out he will need to step up, can be inconsistent but very talented.||
|**36. Klay Thompson**|Career low shooting efficiency, he'll move back up a little bit I'm sure. The game against Portland was a plus but the slump is more than just a phase right now.||
|**37. Chris Paul**|He's still very good. 16/8/4 averages. Might not be elite but still damn good.||
|**38. Devin Booker**|He's shown progress. Career high 7.1 APG, 52% 2 PT scoring, up 8 overall spots from last year.||
|**39. Domantas Sabonis**|My very, very clear pick for 6MOTY||
|**40. Pascal Siakam**|Clearly a career season, and a career high in points last night.||
|**41. Serge Ibaka**|His best season ever offensively and an important part to Toronto's success.||
|**42. Myles Turner**|Myles Turner has turned his reputation around in a short amount of time. Consistently helping his team win and a ridiculous 2.9 BPG making him a legitimate DPOY candidate.||
|**43. Nikola Vucevic**|It's been fun to watch his career year and I'm interested to see what happens as he is a UFA this offseason||
|**44. Julius Randle**|If AD were somehow traded, I would be very interested to see a Julius Randle number 1 option experiment. 20/9 isn't a fluke.||
|**45. Tobias Harris**|21/8 averages, Clippers in playoff hunt, sometimes you feel like he could do more.||
|**46. Jusuf Nurkic**|That game last night was absurd.||
|**47. Marc Gasol**|Playing efficient. Grizzlies slipping a bit but 16/9/5 averages solid for a 34 year old.||
|**48. Eric Bledsoe**|It's not every game, but there's some games when you watch Eric Bledsoe and just go ""holy shit"" the whole time||
|**49. De'Aaron Fox**|What a sophomore surge and very fun to see the Kings fun again.||
|**50. Al Horford**|Sort of transitioning from all star to very solid role player. I mean still a top 50 talent but I'm not sure he reaches his 15th overall ranking I had him last season again.||
|**51. Donovan Mitchell**|The biggest thing is his shooting efficiency is down from last year, but I can still see Utah making strides and he has potential to move back up.||
|**52. Zach LaVine**|24/5/5 averages is legit. Might not be the most efficient but exciting to watch.||
|**53. DeAndre Jordan**|His FT% is down to 71, but overall a solid year and up 11 spots from 2017-2018.||
|**54. Josh Richardson**|What a quiet 18/4/4 season, but dude's solid. The extension Miami signed him to looks like a bargain.||
|**55. Jamal Murray**|If he could consistently play like he does when he's on, top 25 player. I could see him being an all star candidate in 2019-2020.||
|**56. Montrezl Harrell**|16/7 averages, one of the most unique players in the league.||
|**57. Derrick Rose**|The bounce back has been real and hopefully he's not injured too long.||
|**58. Thaddeus Young**|He had a very good month of December. One of the more underrated players in the league.||
|**59. Robert Covington**|Averaging 15 PPG in Minnesota so far with near elite defense.||
|**60. Lou Williams**|More inefficient than last year and the 6MOTY is somehow not even the highest ranked player off his own bench. But still 18 PPG and can go off any night.||
|**61. Brandon Ingram**|There's been strides lately. Talent is clearly there just needs to put the pieces together.||
|**62. Danilo Gallinari**|Low key having a career season. Has steadily moved up the list all year.||
|**63. Deandre Ayton**|I just figured out now his name's Deandre and not DeAndre||
|**64. Kyle Kuzma**|More dominant scorer this year. Can move up if his 3 point efficiency improves.||
|**65. JJ Redick**|Still a career high in PPG at the age of 34.||
|**66. Gary Harris**|As with last year, a hot start to the season was slowed down by injury. He came back last night but off the bench. ||
|**67. Paul Millsap**|If he'd been healthy the whole year would probably be higher, but he's been crucial to Denver's success.||
|**68. Buddy Hield**|Very good season with top 40 overall potential in 2019-2020. If not higher.||
|**69. Jonas Valanciunas**|Expected to be out until later this month. Statistically, he's really about the same as last year when I had him 43rd overall but his value has gone down with the Siakam/Ibaka rise.||
|**70. Malcolm Brogdon**|A very, very good low key year for Brogdon. 15/5/3 averages and shooting 98% from the line. There's potential for him to move up even more.||
|**71. Aaron Gordon**|Dude has talent but hasn't put it together like I hoped so far. Down from 51st overall in 2017-2018.||
|**72. John Collins**|Rising and rising fast at this pace.||
|**73. Andrew Wiggins**|He's been...a little better. Still some ways to go but there's some hope.||
|**74. Willie Cauley-Stein**|Conundrum. Looks great some nights but then gives up a historic game to Jusuf Nurkic. Very interested to see what happens with him this offseason.||
|**75. Joe Ingles**|He's down from 54th overall in 2017-2018. Solid role player, but a step down from last year so far.||
|**76. Bojan Bogdanovic**|Career high 16 PPG and has improved in other areas of his game. A+ year for him so far.||
|**77. Kevin Love**|Well he's an awkward player to rank right now, as he is automatically eligible as he's played but the longer he is out the more his value goes down.||
|**78. Hassan Whiteside**|Same issue as last year. Shows ridiculous talent at times but too many other issues going on.||
|**79. TJ Warren**|Him getting a consistent + efficient 3 point shot took his value to another tier.||
|**80. Harrison Barnes**|Career high 43% from 3 point land. Was injured to start the year but it's been a solid 2018-2019 for him.||
|**81. Marcus Morris**|In a contract year averaging 16/6 off the bench on good efficiency. We'll see the contract he gets this offseason.||
|**82. Darren Collison**|Up and down year. Isn't where he was at last year but has been a steady force for the winning Pacers.||
|**83. Spencer Dinwiddie**|Ever since he signed his extension, dude's been balling.||
|**84. Ricky Rubio**|Looking more like Minnesota Ricky, but has been able to keep a top 100 spot the whole year.||
|**85. Jerami Grant**|What a year for him so far, x factor for the Thunder.||
|**86. Dennis Schroder**|It was a better November than December, still one of the better 2nd string PG's in the league.||
|**87. Derrick Favors**|Actually a career high in FG PCT. Like Rubio, has been solid enough to keep a top 100 spot.||
|**88. Nikola Mirotic**|Value has gone down since being injured.||
|**89. Jeff Teague**|Conundrum. Bad efficiency shooting, Timberwolves fans complain about him. Also averaging career high 8.3 APG. Still in top 100 for now.||
|**90. Dwyane Wade**|In his last season, Wade is at a top 100 level.||
|**91. Goran Dragic**|I think the Heat should trade him and play Winslow at PG.||
|**92. D'Angelo Russell**|Small progress every year and a glimmer of hope still for him to reach his potential.||
|**93. Brook Lopez**|His ridiculous 3 point shooting nights keep him in the top 100.||
|**94. Bogdan Bogdanovic** |Dude's been clutch, 16/4/3 averages off the bench, he's in the top 100 now.||
|**95. Danny Green**|Solid enough for the winning Raptors to have a top 100 spot now.||
|**96. Caris LeVert**|Unfortunate because he was on a wave before he got injured, but his value is still enough for top 100.||
|**97. Jaylen Brown**|The 30 point game probably saved his top 100 spot.||
|**98. Dario Saric**|His value is down from last year but he'll be a solid role player for a while.||
|**99. Jarrett Allen**|Who would have guessed before the season, the Brooklyn Nets have 4 top 100 players (and the Kings too)||
|**100. Lauri Markkanen**|Markkanen gets the final top 100 spot. He has a while to go (and LMAO at a thread a few weeks ago I saw saying he's better than Tatum) but there's been progress from last year.||

His musical career has been marked by dramatic changes in styles, incorporating an eclectic range of influences including soul, baroque-pop, electro, indie rock, synth-pop, industrial and gospel. Over the course of his career, West has been responsible for cultural movements and progressions within mainstream hip hop and popular music at large.

Born in Atlanta and raised in Chicago, West first became known as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records in the early 2000s, producing hit singles for recording artists such as Jay-Z, Ludacris and Alicia Keys. Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, West released his debut album The College Dropout in 2004 to widespread critical and commercial success, and founded the record label GOOD Music. He went on to experiment with a variety of musical genres on subsequent acclaimed studio albums, including Late Registration (2005), Graduation (2007), and the polarizing but influential 808s &amp; Heartbreak (2008). He released his fifth album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy in 2010 to further rave reviews, and has since succeeded it with Yeezus (2013) and The Life of Pablo (2016), as well as full-length collaborations Watch the Throne (2011) and Kids See Ghosts (2018) with Jay-Z and Kid Cudi respectively.

West's outspoken views and life outside of music have received significant media attention. He has been a frequent source of controversy for his conduct at award shows, on social media, and in other public settings, as well as his comments on the music and fashion industries, U.S. politics, and race. His marriage to television personality Kim Kardashian has also been a source of substantial media attention. As a fashion designer, he has collaborated with Nike, Louis Vuitton, and A.P.C. on both clothing and footwear, and have most prominently resulted in the Yeezy collaboration with Adidas beginning in 2013. He is the founder and head of the creative content company DONDA.

West is among the most critically acclaimed musicians of the 21st century and one of the best-selling music artists of all time with over 120 million records sold worldwide.[4] He has won a total of 21 Grammy Awards, making him one of the most awarded artists of all time and the most Grammy-awarded artist of his generation.[5] Three of his albums have been included and ranked on Rolling Stone's 2012 update of the ""500 Greatest Albums of All Time"" list and he ties with Bob Dylan for having topped the annual Pazz &amp; Jop critic poll the most number of times ever, with four number-one albums each. Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2005 and 2015.

#[](#icon-notes-big) Introduction

Australia as a nation is a young one, having only federated in 1901.
For 60,000 years the continent was inhabited by Aboriginal Australians, who developed complex hunter-gatherer systems and a spiritual system revolving around a relationship with nature. It is estimated that there were 250 languages spoken in Australia at the time of European contact. Today Australia is a highly developed country of 24.6 million. 

Australia’s Asian Cup history has been short but it has not been uneventful. Since joining the AFC in 2006 the Socceroos have been one of Asia’s strongest sides, earning themselves a place as equals to the likes of Japan, South Korea, Iran and Saudi Arabia.

2007 was valiant debut, even if it did end earlier than expected considering the strength of the side. A 3-1 loss to the surprise champions Iraq in Bangkok would see Australia finish second in group A, setting up another episode in the growing rivalry between Australia and Japan. 12 months after the iconic win in Kaiserslautern, the Socceroos and Samurai Blue met once again, this time in Hanoi, where neither side could be separated in this tight, thrilling match. Even after going down to 10-men Australia held on and in the end it came down to a shoot-out, one that Japan would win 4-3, advancing them to the semi-final where they would lose to Saudi Arabia. While a quarter final finish was a disappointment, Australia played good football and showed signs of what was to come.


In 2011 Australia confidently made their way through the tournament, with a quarter final win over reigning champions Iraq and then a 6-0 thrashing of Uzbekistan to book their place in the final, where they would once again meet Japan. From kick-off Australia was relentless, and dominated possession throughout the game, but a mix of waste chances, solid defending, and the heroics of keeper Eiji Kawashima stopped the Socceroos from taking the lead, while Japan could not capitalize on the chances they made in their numerous counter attacks. Once again Australia and Japan could not be separated in 90 minutes, but this time a single goal in extra time, a volley from Japanese substitute Tayanari Lee, in the 109th minute would settle things. Japan would go home with a record 4th title, while Australia would go home with nothing, having come so close to a first Asian title. It would be the last Asian Cup for Socceroos legends such as Harry Kewell, Lucas Neil and Mark Schwarzer, who became the most capped player for Australia with this match.

Contrasting the sadness of 2011, 2015 is one of the greatest achievements in Australian football. With the home advantage, Ange Postecoglou took charge and brought in a new generation to finally win the cup. After a disastrous World Cup campaign and a descent to 100 in the Fifa World Rankings confidence there was some doubt surrounding the Socceroos, which and was only worsened with a defeat to South Korea on the final matchday of the group stage. In the quarter finals a brace by Tim Cahill sent Australia to a second consecutive semi final, and a 2-0 win against the United Arab Emirates in Newcastle took the Socceroos back to the final, where they met South Korea for the second time in the tournament. Determined not to see a repeat of the first match, Australia took the lead with a goal from Massimo Luongo and up until injury time it looked like this would be what separated the teams as Australia held on. But once again it came to extra time, as a goal from Son-Heung Min in the 91st minute brought back old fears of Australia falling at the last hurdle. This time, however, it would not be the case. The relentless attack finally gave Australia it’s second goal, South Korea could not respond and for the first time, Australia were Asian Champions.

[**Matt Ryan**](http://www1.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Matthew+Ryan+Australia+Vs+Peru+Group+C+2018+FrDp8lW76TWl.jpg): Winner of Keeper of the Tournament 4 years ago, Ryan has only improved since 2015. Carrying on from a strong 2017-18 season with Brighton, Ryan continues to impress with his shot-stopping abilities. As of writing, Ryan currently has the fourth most saves this season in the Premier League at 55 saves.

[**Martin Boyle**](https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_700,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4832606.1542734023!/image/image.jpg): 
Despite never having stepped on Australian soil before, Boyle has been welcomed with open arms as he made his first appearances in the Gold and Green against South Korea and Lebanon, making 2 goals and an assist in the game against Lebanon. The quick and mobile Hibernian winger isn’t guaranteed to start, but the Asian Cup will be the perfect chance for Boyle to become a breakout star.

[**Massimo Luongo**](http://www3.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Massimo+Luongo+Australia+v+Tajikistan+2018+-Wq7w1ytntzl.jpg): A key player in Australia’s Asian cup victory and world cup qualification, it was quite the surprise to see the QPR midfielder not play a single second in Russia under Bert Van Marwijk. Now with Arnold in charge, Luongo will be keen to remind everyone why he was a regular starter under Postecoglou. Luongo’s creativity could be vital for the Socceroos, especially with Aaron Mooy now injured.

#[](#icon-discuss-big) Points of Discussion

- **What can Arnold do in his short time as manager?** 

 Graham Arnold replaces Bert Van Marwijk following the Dutchman’s short-term stint that ended with an early exit from the World Cup. Previously manager during Australia’s first Asian Cup which ended with the disappointing quarter final exit, Arnold’s 11 years of experience since 2007 have hopefully given him some of the expertise and wisdom as a coach that he was missing. Having won 3 Premierships and 2 Championships, as well as breaking numerous records including the best winning and unbeaten percentages, Arnold has made a name for himself as one the most successful managers in A-League history during his time at Central Coast Mariners and Sydney F.C. Even with this experience the fact is that he has only been in charge for three matches, a 4-0 win away to Kuwait, a 1-1 draw with South Korea, and a 3-0 win over Lebanon, with another friendly to go before the match against Jordan. Has Arnold had the time to even figure out his team, let alone implement his game plan?

- **Who can solve Australia’s goal scoring woes?** 

 If you watched the Socceroos at the World Cup, or at any time in the last few years, you will know that that one of the key problems facing the team is just simply toothlessness in front of goal. The days of Kewell, Viduka, Aloisi, Bresciano, and now Cahill are over, and the fact is that even when dominating possession or creating far more chances than opponents Australia struggles to make the difference count. See for instance a World Cup qualifier in 2017 against Thailand where, despite taking a ridiculous 45 shots to Thailand’s 8, Australia only managed to clinch a 2-1 victory in the final minutes of the match. A defensively strong side like Iran would not give the Socceroos so many chances, Australia needs to make it count when it gets to the stronger sides in the latter rounds of the tournament. The likes of Leckie, Kruse and Juric, who have been Australia’s main men upfront in recent years are now in competition for the opportunity to start, as newcomers such as Boyle, Mabil, MacLaren and Nabbout look to make a name for themselves. New or old, someone needs to step up and start getting the ball in the net.

- **Important players out with injuries** 

 Disastrous news, with less than a month before the tournament begins it looks one of Australia’s most important players, Huddersfield midfielder Aaron Mooy, will most likely miss the Asian Cup after damaging his knee ligament in a premier league match against Arsenal. Mooy joins Daniel Arzani, the young Australian talent who had showed promise at the World Cup after Arzani injured his ACL in his senior debut for Celtic. Fellow Celtic player Tom Rogic’s fitness is also in doubt with a knee injury. Matthew Leckie is also questionable after a recent hamstring injury.  While Mooy’s absence will hurt the team’s chances, it also gives Arnold the chance to experiment with a names such as Mustafa Amini and Jackson Irvine in midfield.

#[](#icon-notes-big) Introduction

It's October of last year,  in the dying embers against Australia, Omar Al-Somah steps up to a free kick from some distance. If he scores, he books the war-torn country a spot in the intercontinental playoffs against Honduras for the 2018 World Cup...... But it wasn't meant to be as Al-Somah's shot [agonizingly hit the post](https://youtu.be/k0C7xc7Q2mM?t=144).

Syria head into 2019 AFC Asian Cup after only what can be described as a tumultuous and tiresome 2018 World Cup cycle. Bouncing from Oman to Malaysia for a temporary home (some of which were just [dreadful by the way](https://youtu.be/l3fI4fBB_tY?t=55)) and unable to secure quality friendlies, Syria have genuinely made the best of the resources that they have. Over qualification they transitioned from a team of grafters and cliche hard workers who ground out results to now a side which also has a formidable attacking presence with Omar Al-Somah spearheading it all. Drawn into a group containing Asian giants Australia and their fellow Arab mates in Palestine and Jordan, Syria is expected to make progress on last year and made a solid run into the knockout stages of the tournament, which they haven’t done in their 6 appearances at the tournament.

#[](#icon-info-big) Players to Watch

[**Omar Al-Somah**](https://www.kingfut.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/GettyImages-859649570.jpg): Undoubtedly the star of the Syria national team and of the whole tournament. The indisputable best Asian player currently playing in Asia, Al-Somah who wasn't called back up to the national team until midway through the third round of WC Qualifying, has added a completely new dimension to Syria's attack. 85 goals in 85 games for Saudi club says it all. At 6'4"", he's striker who can score by whatever means necessary: whether it be with his head, from direct free kicks, one-on-one, a potshot from distance, the list goes on and on. 

His ability to show up in the big moments is also what distinguishes from other stars at the tournament. Look no further than injury time equaliser against Iran on the final matchday to secure the playoff spot against the Aussies, and then one month later both of Syria's in the two legged playoff against the Socceroos. Don't be surprised if he ends as the top scorer as every attack will involve him in some facet

[**Omar Khiribin**](https://www.foxsportsasia.com/uploads/20171002074114/GettyImages-613950678.jpg): Okay first off I've seen multiple spellings of Omar's surname: Kharbin, Khrbin, and now Khirbin. Doesn't matter either way because he's a great player and the second attacking outlet that Syria will rely on. The first ever Syrian to win ""*Asian Footballer of the Year*"", when healthy, Kharbin plays up top for Saudi club Al-Hilal. Though due to the recall of Al-Somah to the national team, Khrbin is played out wide for the Qasioun Eagles, where he's still managed to be successful in drifting inwards to help out with Al-Somah. With all the focus likely going towards Al-Somah, it'll be up to Khirbin to take some of the responsibility off the big man's shoulders.

- **Revenge Opportunity against the Socceroos**

 One of ***the*** matches of the group phase of the 2019 AFC Asian Cup will take place on January 15th in Al Ain between Syria and Australia; a re-match of last year's confederation playoff for the World Cup. Australia prevailed over the two legs in the end, drawing the away leg 1-1 after an 85' penalty from Omar Al-Somah and reigning victorious in the return leg in Sydney 2-1 AET thanks to a brace from the good cunt Timmy Cahill after Al-Somah opened the scoring 6 minutes into the match. 

 Expect Syria to play with a dogged approach against the Aussies again, sometimes maybe even resorting to the dark arts of football: last year, there was quite the amount of rolling on the ground, time wasting, poor challenges, etc. But hey-ho that's AFC and teams have got to deal with it. Syria will lend possession over the Aussies, bunkering up and looking for the outlet in Al-Somah, with Al-Muwas and Kharbin coming inside from wide to help him out. Over the two legs in 2017 they averaged 28% of the ball and completed only 63% of their passes. 

 Since the game is on the last matchday of the group stages, Syria hope that by the time they face the Aussies, they would have already booked their spot into the knockout stages.

- **Turmoil as a Source of Motivation?**: Honestly, qualifying for the Asian Cup in itself is quite the achievement for Syria considering the aforementioned things they've had to endure over the qualification period. 

 Alright now let's address one of the more talked about subjects when speaking of Syria. Whether the national team does or doesn’t represent the Assad regime can be discussed and argued for weeks. Several players who had actively opposed the regime returned over the past several years, sparking more controversy from the country's higher-ups. Whatever the hierarchy believes, it's important to note that above all the Qasioun Eagles represent the citizens and people of Syria, not a political allegiance. The desire to make their people proud in a time of turmoil can help Stange's men if they continue to show their workmanlike attitude that got them to the UAE in the first place.

The Fedayeen are set to make their second ever Asian Cup appearance after recently undergoing a football revolution which saw the Palestine national team rise from being whipping boys to competing with the biggest nations in Asia. Palestine comfortably qualified to the tournament after finishing second in a relatively easy group. Palestine were placed in the third pot, which landed them a tough group with Australia, Syria and closest neighbours Jordan. The Palestinian national team will enter the Asian Cup carrying the hopes of a damaged nation, hoping to follow the Iraqi example of 2007 and temporarily heal the wounds of the nation by doing something extraordinary in football.

[**Abdelatif Bahdari**](https://semedia.filgoal.com/photos/person/medium/24905.png): He is the most capped player in this generation of Palestinian players and is also captain. The Gaza-born defender will most likely be playing the last Asian Cup of his illustrious career for the Palestinian national team, as perhaps the only player that has been a constant in both the terrible past and the bright present. The 34-year-old will be hoping to lead his nation to passing the group stages and fulfilling the dreams of more than 12 million Palestinians all over the world.

[**Pablo Tamburrini**](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/F5X832/amman-jordan-9th-nov-2015-palestines-pablo-tamburrini-r-competes-during-F5X832.jpg): The Chile-born midfielder is the main source of creativity and the man responsible for linking the defence with the attack. Tamburrini played for a while in Palestino, a Chilean club that was founded by Palestinian immigrants, before the Palestinian FA discovered his Palestinian roots and called him up to the national team. Since his first call-up in 2015, Tamburrini has been a key player and can be considered as one of the untouchable players in the line up thanks to his energy and creativity.

#[](#icon-discuss-big) Points of Discussion

- **Integration of diaspora Palestinians?** 

 All of you probably noticed the obvious Spanish surnames in the predicted line-up. Issues with the Israeli occupation denying exit visas to players with only Palestinian passports and the lacking quality of local players led the Palestinian FA to explore the diaspora option as an alternative. Inspired by the successes of similar projects in other nations, the Palestinians can today be proud of a project that has drastically improved the quality of the national team. The Palestinian diaspora integration is the most successful in the Middle East in my opinion, surpassing many nations like Iraq, Syria and Lebanon where the project either didn’t have a huge impact or the integration of the players failed.



- **Expectations?** 

 Palestine made their Asian Cup debut in 2015, where people didn’t hope for anything more than three respectable losses without any humiliation. This time it’s different with the huge progression that has occurred in Palestinian football since 2015. Australia and Syria are seen as huge favourites to clinch the top two spots for obvious reasons. Essentially, Palestine’s destiny will be defined in the last match against neighbours Jordan, where a win might land Palestine a place in the round of 16 as one of the best third placed teams. I personally think that Palestine also have a chance to nick a point from Syria, but the match against Jordan remains as the most important obstacle.

Jordan, a small country in the  middle east with a relatively new footballing history, will be looking to bounce back after a disappointing results both in the 2015 AFC Asian Cup and 2018 World cup qualifying campaign.
  
Al-Nashama's best result was a quarter final finish in The Asian cup (2004,2011), in addition to a great 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign ending against Uruguay in the intercontinental play-off.

#[](#icon-whistle-big) [POTENTIAL STARTING XI](https://imgur.com/a/Q6koeOX)
It's very hard to define a starting XI for the team, Borkelmans has been rotating a lot  and  still hasn't found  the right formula, many players are going in and out so this formation is mostly just a prediction of what he might  use.

#[](#icon-info-big) Players to Watch
 

 
[**Musa Al-Tamari**](https://www.joc.jo/uploads/2018/05/4101b450d4c0ff7d9dc8b3712712d5d9.jpg): Musa is the best Jordanian player currently and is on his way to stardom. A fast, agile winger with an eye for the goal, brilliant dribbling skills and great explosiveness. all the country's eyes will be on him as he looks to end a streak of bad-from that started almost since he was promoted  to the first team, he is looking to replicate his club form and finally put all the criticism to rest. He is joining  the national team camp after some brilliant performances with APOEL which put him on the watch list of some European clubs in the top 5 leagues such as Caligari, a brilliant feat for a footballer from a country with this footballing history.
 
[**Yazan Thalji**](http://www4.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Yazan+Mohammad+Yousef+Thalji+Asian+Games+Day+KTGR-OdOvqRl.jpg): A bit of unconventional choice to feature Yazan here, as his place in the starting 11 is not guaranteed(could say the same about all the other players), but he is just a natural born talent and was the best player in the Jordanian league last season, great technical skills with a beautiful touch on the ball and very good Athleticism(relatively), also some great shooting and scoring ability. Thalji suffered from an injury and is only just getting back to his form, a brilliant player if used correctly by Borkelmans.
 
[**Yaseen Al-Bakhit**](http://www4.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Yaseen+Al+Bakhit+Australia+v+Jordan+2018+FIFA+YAaW1U5osvul.jpg) :Often called the bullet by many of  the fans, Al-Bakhit offers some insane pace and stamina up and down the wings, in addition to some great playmaking ability while also drifting into the middle of the pitch to play as a midfielder.

#[](#icon-discuss-big) Points of Discussion
 
 
- **Stability**: One of the biggest problem the team is facing right is the chaos that surrounds the starting XI, the tournament is only two weeks away and the players still haven't developed their chemistry to an acceptable level, while it's understandable that Borkelmans only became a manager recently, he has been an assistant since May, he is expected to have developed an idea now of what players will work and what will not so he get them play-time, that unfortunately hasn't happened and he is still rotating heavily with no clear gameplan only  days before a tournament.
 
- **Possibility of an out-of-form players**: This problem also lies mostly on Borkelmans and the FA, the preparatory matches schedule of the camps raised some questions on whether it will negatively affect the players mentally and physically, the team had a camp in Oman but to many's surprise, it had no matches and instead, the matches were all cluttered in the two weeks before the tournament, the matches against Qatar and China should've been the final 'test' before the tournament, where the final squad is announced and the starting XI players are playing to detect mistakes, abnormalities and put  on the final touches. Instead, the players don't have a clear mind and many are still struggling mentally with the possibility of being excluded from the final 23-man squad which would surely hamper their training/preparations.

I thought it would be fun to see how each team would look after Thanos snapped his fingers. Remember, like Thanos said, the choice was completely random.

For each team, I calculated the loss in win shares and the percent of total minutes they've lost this far into the season.

The only caveat was that players that were traded throughout the season are in a different category (due to win share calculations).

* Owners, coaches, and players were done for each team.

##Here are the biggest winners(?) and losers from the snap.

**The Hawkspiracy**

Over the summer r/nba ran a game of survivor (where fans of nba teams would vote each other out until there was only was **survivor**) r/AtlantaHawks following the tanking ways of the actual Atlanta Hawks asked other fans to vote them out securing a loss for the subreddit.


(now deleted) user u/ChiliConChaos gave a brief summary of the hawkspiracy here so enjoy


""Oh boy...Lemme educate you pal. Here's the break down, but I haven't updated it for a while and there's been so much nefarious shit since I wrote this including one of the bots removing my last post about the Hawkspiracy!

Have u heard about the Hawkspiracy?

It all started with /r/NBA survivor. Hawks fans were telling people to vote them out because they didn’t want to win. But it was actually a clever attempt to use reverse psychology to win survivor because people were trying to not vote for them and make them win.

But I saw through their lies and convinced people to vote them out, putting an end to the Hawkspiracy once and for all...

Or so I thought.

People asked how the Hawks communicated to attempt such treachery, and that’s when I found them...secured channels. /r/AtlantaHawks uses GroupMe and other decrypted communications methods to hatch their devious plots in secret. But im on to their trail.

That was just the beginning though, I’m much deeper in the Hawks nest now, and I can tell you there’s some disturbing stuff.

They make Germans wear a special flair on their sub to designate that they’re German(what does this remind you of in History? cough holocaust cough)

They participated in Satanic rituals in the form of some nerdy ass Yugioh game

**Olaf shot Chili**

In late August u/ChiliConChaos finally had broken the Hawkspiracy and had become mod....for 15 minutes. During his *very very* short run as mod a post was made asking if the hawkspiracy was over (https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/9bwa2a/chili_finally_got_mod_is_the_revolt_over/)

Chili was then **UN**modded for 15 minutes...finally the mods decided that they could use Chili's knowledge of css on the sub due to none of them knowing. Chili accepted the mod invatation and then deleted his account. Yes after all of that he fucking deleted his account.

Chili left the sub on hiatus but would reemerge as u/RolePlayerAtBest (paying homage to the aforementioned meme) saying that moderator u/OlafdePolaf had shot him for finding out too much about the sub.

**Carmelo Anthony is Hawks legend** https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/909no8/carmelo_anthony_appreciation_thread/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link

*sighs* The official worst meme of the year is the one but enjoy regardless.

On July 19th the Atlanta Hawks traded former future pg of the team Dennis Schroeder in exchange for Carmelo Anthony and a future first round pick.  (link to full trade details http://www.nba.com/article/2018/07/25/carmelo-anthony-trade-hawks-dennis-schroeder-trade-thunder-official)

Carmelo would be bought about by the Hawks very fast and members of r/AtlantaHawks decided that Carmelo Anthony was a legend for his efforts to the meme, r/NBA caught on and ruined it.

Former Coach of the Atlanta Hawks Mike Budenholzer was known to make funny faces during his tenure as coach of our team. Moderator u/JbTrackXc made this showing a Photoshopped Budenholzer as a pickle.

When he was hired as new head coach of the Milwaukee Bucks r/MkeBucks tried to **STEAL** our memes and quickly apologized avoiding a meme war.

**Us Being Timberwolves fans** 

In the 2017-2018 season the Atlanta Hawks owned the Minnesota Timberwolves 2018 first round pick which was lottery protected. After a very grueling season it came down to one game between the Wolves and The Denver Nuggets. A game in which would decide if the Wolves made the playoffs or fell into the lottery which would allow them to their pick.

In support of our assets moderator u/WideSheep stole the timberwolves Reddit css and made it ours showing our support for them in securing the number 19 pick in the draft

Numerous other mentions were made of this.

**Linsanity00**

During the summer the Atlanta Hawks traded for veteran point guard Jeremy Lin of the Brooklyn Nets.

Jeremy Lin is known to have a very active fan base user u/Linsanity00 would call him our best player and say he needs to start over rookie Trae Young or veteran shooting guard Kent Bazemore on numerous occasions. As well as protesting he be traded to a contender and suggesting new trade ideas.

**COME IN PEACE**

Fans of NBA teams are known when going to other teams subreddit to say ""coming in peace"" to let it be known that they're not there to talk trash but instead ask questions and or give compliments.

The Holy Fool is similar to a biblical prophet, prescient, but more importantly able to reveal truths. As one church hymn has it, the *yurodivy* (holy fool in Russian) strives “with imaginary insanity to reveal the insanity of the world.” He not only fights the insanity of everyday sins but the crimes of the mighty as well.

I’m Catholic. I remember reading Kanye Omari West was baptized in the Church as a baby 🧐(Supposedly the tradition of his (maternal?) grandmother). This got me thinking 🤔 

Ye’s whole aesthetic and aspirations (his whole VIBE) are so ancient/gothic/baroque. His music/concerts/clothes/designs 🔥🔥🔥, I view him like a Dante/Michelangelo/Chaucer/Shakespeare👨🏾‍🎨🎨 for the 21st century... Yeezy yearns for transcendence (Truth - Goodness - Beauty) his work looks forward ultimately to a communion with God. He is so medieval and (c)atholic in his taste and dreams ⚜️🏰 Ye’s only real burning desire as an artist is to be one of “God’s Architects” (nickname for the Spanish architect Gaudí) 

look at his YEEZY company... - antediluvian/post-apocalyptic robes ☄️💀. And the themes in his music.. The 😈DARK and the 😇LIGHT, the 🦇BLACK and the 🕊WHITE - sin/sacrifice/scandal/sacrament/death/divinity/slavery/freedom/blasphemy/testimony/perdition/repentance/desolation/incarnation/oppression/resurrection/debauchery/virginity/degeneration/regeneration.... these paradoxes/tensions are pervasive throughout kanyes work and career... but this is the great spiritual battle in every heart crucified by a deeply Catholic imagination. 

Rant over

TLDR; I suspect Kanye is another under (non-)catechized unchurched lapsed Catholic “Lost In the World”. Ye has faith in Jesus Christ, and belief in himself, but Ye needs the Church and the Church badly needs Ye. 

post your favorite religious lines from Kanye, if you got any.

SG: **Troy Brown Jr** (Wizards)

* A super young talent (19 y.o) currently stuck in the g-league / garbage minutes but at 6'7"" he's extremely versatile, has great ball handling and passing vision, so he has an ability to play PG. Lack of shooting is scary but mechanically nothing is wrong and he's great at getting to the rim and finishing.

SF: **Luke Kennard** (Pistons)

* 45/41/85 shooting splits last season, he can shoot the ball from everywhere. He plays a high IQ brand of basketball has solid effort on defense.

PF: **Omari Spellman** (Atlanta)

* Explosive and powerful player who can play defense and shoot the 3 ball (although struggling this season) he's really versatile at 6'8"" and could easily play C in small ball lineups 

C: **Sabonis** (Pacers)

* Maybe not underrated this year but i still feel he doesnt get his probs. Great PnR player, good finishing around the rim, ability to shoot the 3 ball, great post moves. Has posted really great advanced metrics this year and has been valuable to Indiana winning.

Hatched in the menagerie of Iola Omaris, a wealthy elven merchant, Toko spent his first few years doing entertaining tricks for treats from his masters. Although he was in captivity, Toko was happy in the company of the menagerie - the only true pack Toko had known.

A bloody rebellion that he was too young to understand resulted in Toko's sudden and unexpected freedom, and he was swept up with a tide of other small humanoids escaping on boats from their island prison. Along with two kobold brood-mates, a duergar and a doppelganger mimicking a gnoll, Toko sailed up and down the coast aboard *'Finner'*, a small merchant cog. The motley crew survived through fishing, hunting and a little piracy, and Toko again had the time of his life with a small band he considered family. Unfortunately, *'Finner'* capsized one Summer in an unusually fierce storm, with the crew scattered or likely drowned. Toko awoke alone, on the shore of an unfamiliar land.

Toko has wandered between towns since, looking for work, new experiences, and a tribe to call his own.

\-----

Toko is a level 1 kobold ranger, and the first character I'll be playing myself in D&amp;D! I've DMed a few games before, but am very excited to have a character of my own. He's excitable, desperate to try new things and can't hold his liquor. Being a kobold, Toko has a desperate and innate desire to be part of a tribe, though he doesn't really understand this himself. His pack-bonding instinct tends to spill over onto people and animals he meets, and woe betide those who mess with someone Toko considers a pack-mate. His ultimate dream is to captain a ship of his own with a crew of those he cares about.

\-----

I'm pretty bad at art, but I wanted to knock together something to represent my character. If any artists of Reddit feel inspired and want to have a more competent bash at him, I'd be very happy to see the results! Otherwise, tips or any comments, good or bad, would be welcome.

Nick Young signed with the Nuggets today. Excluding retired players, he was my highest ranked player from last season who remained unsigned. That changed today, and I think he's a good fit for Denver.

So that led me to look through my ranking last year and I made a list of where every player who played last season but is not in the NBA this year is at now.

538 players played in the NBA last year. Of those players, 135 either have not played this year, are unsigned, or retired.

Does not include players on 2 way contracts who haven't seen NBA action this year as they are technically on NBA rosters (example: Tyler Ulis)

I'm not going to do an analysis on each player, but here is the full list of players who played last year, aren't in the NBA now, and where they are at:

&amp;#x200B;

Defiant Wrestling's weekly show has returned, as has its name from the WCPW days.  A lot has changed since the last episode of Defiant Wrestling's road-to shows back in April - [and if you need a bit of a catch-up like I did, reLoaded is back in podcast form and can bring you up to speed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79MMV70tLV8&amp;t=1229s) \- but now we're back, and we have a bit of sneak peek for things to come this week.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Internet Championship Match** \- *WALTER (c) vs El Phantasmo vs Chris Ridgeway*

Both Phantasmo and Ridgeway have won #1 Contender's matches to challenge WALTER for his Defiant Wrestling Internet Championship, and they're both cashing in those opportunities tonight!  WALTER is undefeated in Defiant Wrestling, but with the normal disadvantages of a triple threat match-type (and rumblings of contract issues), will this be the night that WALTER finally tastes his first loss?

* **Omari vs Lucky Kid**

At Fight or Flight, Omari defeated Lucky Kid in a stellar match.  Tonight, these two standouts from this year's Ringmaster Tournament continue their series against one another.  Will Lucky kid even the score, or will Omari extend his lead to 2-0?

* **David Starr &amp; Rampage vs Nathan Cruz &amp; John ""Bad Bones"" Klinger**

(I don't actually know the story here, but I'm sure they'll explain it on the show.)

* **Martin Kirby addresses his actions from Refuse to Lose**

After defeating longtime rival Joe Hendry in an I Quit match at Refuse to Lose, Kirby continued the assault despite Hendry extending his hand in respect.  What was going through Kriby's mind that night?  Will he apologize to Hendry, or does he plan to double down on his actions?

* **What do the Anti-Fun Police and HT Drake have planned for Jimmy Havoc and Mark Haskins?**

""Weapons, drinking, and swearing"" are abound every time Havoc and Haskins are on the scene, and the trio of Dunne, Federales, and Drake are ready to stop them from having so much dangerous, obnoxious fun.  What is their plan to stop this chaos, and how will Mark and Jimmy respond to their efforts?

* *And so much more!*

And don't forget - Defiant Loaded is back every Sunday at 7 PM GMT (2 ET/1 CT)!

After 9 more days, here is my updated rookie rankings.

If last edition didn't make the number 1 rookie clear, this one does.

Also, one player rises to the top 5 for the first time all season. He's been rising steadily and now is breaking away with a good grasp on a top 5 spot right now.

Let's get to it!

&amp;#x200B;

|Top 25 + Change From Last Edition|Overall Ranking Right Now/Last Edition|Comment|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1. Luka Doncic (same)|44/50|There have been ups and downs, but at this point with games like vs. Houston a legend is growing. |
|2. DeAndre Ayton (same)|71/62|It has not been a fun season for Ayton, and he falls out of the overall top 70. But, he has been consistent (when comparing him to other rookies), still has a ridiculous skillset, has a long way to go but keep in mind he's a 20 year old averaging 16/10.|
|3. Jaren Jackson Jr (same)|118/133|You've got the ridiculous games like vs. Brooklyn. Then games like vs. NO where he only scores 3 points. I watched the game vs. the Lakers last night and that was a struggle too. But if a struggle is 11/8 with the best /- among starters that is a good sign.|
|4. Marvin Bagley III (same)|134/139|Back spasms limited him the past 9 days, but did score 17 vs. Cleveland and the potential is clearly there. At this rate of progression I believe he will be a top 100 player by 2020.|
|5. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (+2)|147/156|SGA jumps into the top 5. Further along than expected, very nice all around game, has had some struggles but his future looks nice.|
|6. Trae Young (-1)|157/151|Long term potential I still like. But we are at the point where the shooting struggles are a real issue. He has the green light but the struggles have been going on for a good month now and this is even with John Collins back. He has star potential but he's in a slump.|
|7. Wendell Carter Jr (-1)|161/152|Good: 12/13/4 vs. Indiana was a solid game. But he can be in the background a lot. With LaVine/Markkanen the pressure isn't on him too much right now and he will still be 19 the whole season. His future still looks nice.|
|8. Miles Bridges (+1)|170/177|This was very close and might cause some controversy but I put him ahead of Sexton. He's only one spot ahead in my overall ranking but he's been efficient, Hornets generally always do better with him on the floor, and has shown flashes of talent (16/8 vs. NO).|
|9. Collin Sexton (-1)|171/176|Still, it was a solid week for Sexton as well moving up 5 spots on my overall ranking and within distance of Trae Young/WCJ. If he continues to score consistently like he has, expect a spike in the next edition.|
|10. Allonzo Trier (+1)|205/202|Trier gets a top 10 spot for the first time all season. He's been inconsistent at times, but had a solid 15 point game vs. BKN last night and is an underdog to root for.|
|11. Mohamed Bamba (-1)|210/199|There have been some struggles and he's been inconsistent at times, but I still think his ceiling is one of the highest in the entire class.|
|12. Landry Shamet (same)|228/225|Has had a stranglehold on this 12th spot for a while now. Not all good (1-9 from 3 the last 3 games) but has been a solid role player for a playoff team getting consistent minutes.|
|13. Mikal Bridges (+1)|253/248|Bridges moves up a spot on the rookie ranking despite moving down on my overall list. There have been struggles in this dysfunctional Suns situation but I still like his long term potential. Man it would have been nice to see him in Philly though they could have used him.|
|14. Mitchell Robinson (+2)|254/259|His potential continues to show as each week goes by. Still 20 years old, I'm excited to see how he progresses and at number 14 he's at his highest ranking all season.|
|15. Donte DiVincenzo (-2)|258/246|It's been a slow week, as he came back from injury and made a minimal impact. He's shown flashes to be a dangerous role player going into the future.|
|16. Kevin Knox (-1)|263/255|He's getting minutes and has shown..potential. He doesn't turn 20 until next August, but 34% shooting is some very painful growing pains.|
|17. Chandler Hutchison (+1)|273/278|Shows shades of very nice athleticism and as the Bulls could potentially tank we might see a bigger role as the season moves along.|
|18. Josh Okogie (+2)|282/291|If last night was any indication, as we said last edition he needs to play more and will likely move up this ranking if he does.|
|19. Aaron Holiday (+2)|284/293|Very high IQ for a rookie, nice perimeter defense. Has some struggles (0-5 shooting last game) but he brings a nice energy to the court.|
|20. Jalen Brunson (+3)|291/303|Brunson jumps into the top 20 with a very solid last 2 games. 11/7 vs. NO and getting the start with DSJ out put up 14 vs. HOU in a win. Very good last 9 days for him.|
|21. Harry Giles III (+1)|299/301|Has shown signs of very nice long term potential, have to remember he is still just 20 years old. 13 points in 10 minutes vs. PHX. We'll see how the Kings handle his minutes the rest of the year.|
|22. Rodions Kurucs (+2)|302/311|Last edition I said give him minutes. Since he entered the rotation the Nets are 2-0. He has a positive impact on the floor and has shown no reason why his minutes should be cut again.|
|23. Kevin Huerter (+3)|306/320|He's starting to get more comfortable. 8/8/10 points the last 3 games as well as making nice plays. Still has a ways to go but he's showed progress.|
|24. Gary Clark (-7)|308/275|The hype has down from the whole taking Melo's spot thing. Nice defender who can be a good role player and just signed a 3 year, 3.7 million dollar deal.|
|25. Hamidou Diallo (-6)|313/283|It's great to see him back from that injury already, the momentum he had pre injury has died down though. Still, as he gets fully healthy I wouldn't be surprised to see him move up again.|
|The Rest|||
|26. Elie Okobo (+1)|317/321||

This question was posed a couple of days ago, and I responded, but it said because I didn't add a flair... it was removed :( I'm new here, a lurker, forgive me. So here's what I think would be a cool DC Universe:

First off, I like the direction Snyder was originally going, I would just tweak a few things here and there. Also I've only really thought up to flashpoint, and I'm not positive where to go from there. I know obviously a Justice league 3 with Darkseid would be ideal, but maybe you guys can finish it for me. But Here's how Phase 1-3 would go for me:

**PHASE 1**

Movie 1 - Man of Steel

The only thing I'd change about this masterpiece is to have a more hopeful Superman by the end of the movie, similiar to how we had in Justice League. Obviously it wouldn't have the same 3 movie arch that he had to get there, but I think he can get there in one movie. After Credit scene is Lex Luthor, telling senator Finch the ""greatest lie in America"" from BvS. He would not be played by Jesse. I actually think Patrick Wilson would have made a great Luthor, he can pull of the charming and charismatic but also the obsessed and deranged. My Favorite Luthor is young justice Luthor, and I think he could pull that off.

Movie 2 - The Batman

We have a pre-BvS Bruce Wayne, dealing with Jason Todd's death. Nightwing hear's of Robins murder, so he comes from Bludhaven and spends the movie with Bruce, trying to help Alfred to get him to grieve properly. We have a self contained story where he fights scarecrow, and the fear toxin keeps giving him flashbacks of the tapes of Jason's murder. The story would mostly be self contained, and show Deadshot being capture to set up suicide squad. The end credit scenes would show Joker letting Jason escape after faking his death to mess with Batman (I wouldn't go the Ras Al Ghul rival route), revealing that he is actually still alive, setting up the sequel. I wouldn't mind Leto's joker, but played with passion like in the SS deleted scenes. Or Phoenix, I don't mind either way. My pick for Nightwing would be Channing Tatum. He can hold his own in terms of star power, and is the perfect age between Jason Todd and Bruce. Give him a little longer hair, and he is already in the amazing shape Nightwing needs to be in. Not sure who would play Scarecrow. Will Smith would not play deadshot.

Movie 3 - Wonder Woman

Stay pretty much the same, but no homage to Wayne enterprises in the beginning, save that for the end. Show that Bruce wayne sent her the photograph of her and the crew, she turns it over and it says ""from Bruce, we need to talk"" or something like that.

Movie 4 - Dawn of Justice

Similar plotline to BvS, but in the beginning of the movie with Bruce's journey through the black zero destruction, I would also show Lex's. I would take out the beginning montage of Bruce's parents being murdered and the speech, but instead show Lex growing up with his Mom and bonding wit her while his father was abusive. Then she is killed during the wreckage, as we see Bruce also having people he knows killed in the wreckage. Then later, Lex's speech on the rooftop includes him saying that he will take Clark's mother away just like Clark took his mother away. As the movie goes on, the general public actually love superman, but the rich and powerful in government do not. Lex still tries to get the kryptonite, and makes a big deal of it to the government, knowing that ""the Bat"" will catch wind and want to steal it. Bruce ends up fighting Clark, just like in BvS, and instead of Lex creating Doomsday, Doomsday is formed by accident while Lex's scientists were experimenting on Zod's body in the kryptonian scout ship to see how to harm a kryptonian body. Diana comes in to fight, just like in BvS. Superman dies at the end, and there is much more of a public feel to it. I would also make Doomsday slightly smaller, more like Hulk-size than gigantic monster size, and of course the classic bone spikes. After credits shows Bruce meeting with Amanda Waller and telling her not to assemble her team, that he'll handle any trouble going forward.

**Phase 2**

Movie 1 - Suicide Squad - Assault on Arkham

Batman is obsessed with bringing Superman back to life, but is becoming more and more depressed. Diana leaves and tells Bruce he has to move on from his guilt of thinking Clark was an enemy. She leaves and says to find her when he's ready to move forward. Meanwhile, Amanda Waller is assembling Task force X, to deal with unusual threats in light of Superman's death. First misssion is to deal with Joker who had stolen classified government property from Star Labs. Joker's intent is to hide it in Arkham, and pretend to get caught and draw out Batman, and confront him for the first time since sending the tapes of Jason dieing. Joker taunts Batman through most of the fights. The story would mostly be like the animated Assault on Arkham plotline, but resulting in Joker actually being caught and put in Jail, and the classified property revealed to be a motherbox that comes to life in the after credits scene. The movie would wrap up with Bruce and Dick visiting Joker insinuating that they are questioning him about Jason's death.

Movie 2 - Green lantern Corps

Hal Jordan and the corp face a new threat that is recruiting many lanterns to their cause at record pace; The Red Lanterns. Sinestro tasks Hal with training a new recruit to help with the fight, John Stewart. The Red Lanterns are defeated, but not before Atrocitus is able to corrupt the mind of Sinestro against the guardians and the corps. Sinestro escapes to go his own way. After credits scene shows Hal and John on their way to find Sinestro, but cross paths with Steppenwolf's ship and his parademons on their way to earth. John escapes to warn earth, but Hal is captured. Hal should be played by Armie Hammer, and John by someone like Omari Hardwick.

Movie 3 - Wonder Woman 2

Diana visits Bruce and tries to get him to move on and not obsess over bringing Superman back. Diana leaves to go try and instill hope throughout the world by doing good. She is sabotaged by a Xerces-backed Cheetah. This would be a self-contained story. After credit scene shows John crash landing in Europe and finding the only enhancing being he knows left on earth, Diana, to warn her about steppenwolf.

Movie 4 - The Flash

Self contained story that introduces us to Barry Allen, played by Justin Hartley. He is my dream casting because not only does he look like a sprinter/Barry himself, but he can be heartfelt or funny just like Barry. If you doubt me, watch This is Us. I could totally see Justin Hartley fan boying that he just found out Bruce Wayne is Batfleck. Ezra can be introduced as Wally later on if need be. I never loved Ezra as Barry. End Credit Scene shows Bruce visiting Barry to talk to him about the Speedforce's capabilities for energy production, and says he needs his help to bring back Superman.

Movie 5 - Justice League

We are introduced to Cyborg and his backstory. He feels the pinging of the motherboxes signaling Apokalypse, and the return communication from Steppenwolf, that he is coming. Steppenwolf's motive is to retrieve the mother boxes and Boom Tube them up to Darkseid, and end his banishment and shame for losing them in the first place. Cyborg seeks out Diana and finds her and John. They all find Bruce and the Flash, and an argument resumes about tying to bring back superman is never going to work. meanwhile the Parademons attack the League in the batcave, trying to steal Cyborg as he has the Motherbox from star labs absorbed into his technological matrix. The league manages to fight them off, but not before they steal Superman's body. Meanwhile Steppenwolf steals the Themyscria motherbox.

Diana, Cyborg, and John all finally realize they need superman's help in order to defeat Steppenwolf. They break into the Parademon stronghold, and use flash's speedforce to reanimate his body. He comes back as dark suit superman, the parademons flee, and the league has to fight him temporarily while he is confused. Superman flies off to find lois. During this time, Steppenwolf steals the Atlantis mother box. Cyborg can feel that he is the last motherbox, and that they have to fight steppenwolf head on, without superman. Superman comes to his senses, appears to Alfred like in the deleted scenes, and then goes and helps the team defeat Steppenwolf. At the end, a boom tube opens up, and Darkseid is seen. Superman is tempted to go with him, but instead punches Steppenwolf away from the motherboxes and up the boom tube, Diana and Cyborg separate the motherboxes and close the boomtube. End of the movie shows John using his ring to search the left behind parademon ship and finding a hole blasted in the side where Hal was being held. The ring reveals a strange yellow energy signature that burns John's hand.

After credits scene shows Lex Luthor meeting with Amanda Waller about funding an archealogical dig in a strange newly discovered ruins in Egypt.

**Phase 3**

Movie 1 - Batman - Under the Red Hood

Bruce is finally feeling a sense of resolve as Superman has returned and Steppenwolf has been fended off. But his world is shook as a new threaten in Gotham actually lowers crime. This movie would basically just follow the Red Hood animated movie, but with Penguin played by Andy Serkis instead of Black mask. Red Hood escapes at the end with the big reveal, and is now an anti-hero used in future movies.

End Credit scene shows Bane breaking out of Blackgate Prison. I don't know if he can act, but Martyn Ford literally looks like Bane and is from Venezuela too.

Movie 2 - Green Lantern Corps 2

John Leaves Earth in search of Hal, and reports to Oa that Hal is missing. The guardians are aware, and tell John that they have learned that Sinestro has created the yellow fear ring, and has already made many green lanterns deffect to his cause. Sinestro is shown reviving Hal, and trying to convince him to come to his cause. Hal escapes barely, and they return to defend Oa from Sinestro's invasion. They succeed in saving Oa from total ruin, but not before Sinestro promises revenge on Hal and John's home world.

After Credit scene shows Sinestro visiting Lex on his boat, sort of like after Justice League but it's Sinestro instead of Deathstroke.

Movie 3 - Shazam

I haven't seen David Sanberg's movie yet obviously, but I would assume it would fit snuggly right here. Lots of cameos from our boi Superman, with an end credit scene of him introducing Shazam to Diana and Bruce.

Movie 4 - Suicide Squad 2

The squad is sent to reclaim a freighter that has been captured by Bane. The freighter is carrying a large shipment of venom, and as it passes Santa Prisca, is attacked and hijacked by Bane and his pirates. As the squad parachutes onto the ship at night and infiltrates it, they discover a stowaway hooded figure who had boarded the freighter as it crossed other deserted islands near Santa Prisca. In the process, they discover that hidden amongst the containers of venom with a strange ancient casket with egyptian writing. Harley eagerly opens the casket, and Black Adam is revealed lieing dormant, with a large tracker strapped to his neck.

A rookie Green Arrow played by John Krasinski assists the squad in silently taking down as many of Bane's guards just as it ports in Gotham. There, Batman and a temporarily cooperative Red hood remain in waiting, not knowing the squad is on board. A massive fight breaks out between Bane, the squad, the pirates, Batman &amp; Red Hood, and Green Arrow in the port. During the fight, venom is spilled into Black Adam's casket, submersing him, and he wakes up in a fury and flies off during the fight. The electricity from his flight and awakening destroys the squad's detonators and the squad escapes into Gotham. Bane is subdued by batman and Red hood, with some help from Oliver Queen. Bruce holds a press conference announcing a partnership with Queen enterprises in honor of Oliver's return. The partnership is a front to help Oliver get on his feet in the vigilante game.

After credit scene shows Black Adam visiting Lex Luthor, the source of the tracker. As Adam breaks it with one hand, Lex mentions that he knows where the only threat to Adam's rule is located, and will tell him if he agrees to help Lex.

Movie 5 - Cyborg &amp; Flash Team up

Cyborg is dealing with a split personality issue in his software, that keeps urging him to investigate and harness a mysterious energy that has disrupted his apokalyptian memory data base of Earth's history. After refusing, Grid separates himself from Cyborg and flies to Central City to try and find and harness this energy. Cyborg contacts Flash to get his help, and the two of them fight off Grid, but not before Reverse Flash is revealed as the source of the energy. Flash and thawne fight for a bit, but it is never revealed how Thawne is connected to Barry.

After credit scene shows Luthor finding reverse Flash and telling him he knows who Barry's new family is now. Thawne is interested and agrees to help Lex.

Movie 6 - Nightwing

Bruce sends Dick to investigate a disturbance at the League of Shadows. He trusts no one else to go in his stead, while Bruce is dealing with the suicide squad and Bane. Upon arrival, Nightwing discovers that most of the league has been destroyed or heald hostage, by Deathstroke. He overhears Deathstroke torturing Ra's Al Ghul, asking where he was keeping Slade's Daughter. Ra's swears he has no idea what he's talking about, that the only child they had at the League of Shadows was Talia's, Ra's grandson. Nightwing confronts Talia while Slade is still fighting off other members of the League of Shadows, and Talia is furious that Nightwing had come instead of Bruce, as she reveals the child is Damian Wayne, not the child of Slade Wilson. She had given a false tip to Slade, knowing that Batman would come and defend the League of shadows if it were under attack. Heartbroken, she flees the League of Shadows and a fight breaks out between her, Nightwing, and Deathstroke. Deathstroke refuses to believe Dick as he tries to convince him that the child was not his daughter. He is finally convinced when he sees Talia escaping with Damian, a boy. Deathstroke takes off back to the mainland leaving Dick stranded with a badly beat up Ra's Al Ghul.

The after credit scene shows Lex contacting Deathstroke showing evidence that he knows where his daughter is, and is willing to give him the info if he helps him kill ""the Bat.""

Movie 7 - Justice League Doom

Lex is running for president under the notion that super beings needs to be under the rule of law, and not operate on their own basis. He uses the Legion of Doom to create distractions and cause the league to become devided, and directs them to attack the Leaguers in areas where there is maximum damage. Lex wants to leave superman stripped of his friends, and have to submit to him as president of his country of residence. As the Legion of Doom is defeated and the League is left divided at the notion of sabotaging Luthor's presidency, Reverse flash takes the opportune moment to tell Barry the truth. Impulsively Barry follows Thawne back in time to save his mother, creating Flashpoint.

**Phase 4**

Justice League - Flashpoint Paradox

Team A: PG: Austin Rivers, SG: Avery Bradley, SF: Andrew Wiggins, PF: Anthony Davis, C: Andre Drummond (back-court and wing is underwhelming, but that's a pretty badass frontcourt)

Team B: PG: Ben Simmons, SG: Bradley Beal, SF: Brandon Ingram, PF: Blake Griffin, C: Brook Lopez (really interesting team with non-traditional players across pretty much all positions except SG)

Team C: PG: Chris Paul, SG: Caris Levert, SF: Cedi Osman, PF: Carmelo Anthony, C: Clint Capela (this is like half the Rockets starting lineup lol. Melo and Cedi suck, but a CP3 and Levert backcourt could be really fun. Capela is great, and benefits greatly playing with CP3)

Team D:  PG: Damian Lillard, SG: Devin Booker (this one was hard cause I had to choose between Booker, Derozan and Donovan Mitchell but I think Booker would ultimately be the best complement to Lillard), SF: Danilo Gallinari, PF: Draymond Green, C: Demarcus Cousins (if Boogie recovers fully, this is a very, very formidable team that would be dropping 130 on a nightly basis...and getting 130 dropped on them in return)

Team E: PG: Eric Bledsoe, SG: Eric Gordon, SF: Evan Fournier, PF: Ersan Ilyasova, C: Enes Kanter (fairly run of the mill team, good at scoring but horrendous defensively. A Ilyasova/Kanter frontcourt is just laughably bad at rim protection)

Team F: PG: Frank Jackson, SG: Fred VanVleet SF: Frank Ntilikina  PF: Furkan Kormaz, C: Frank Kaminsky (this is by far the worst lineup as there are actually very few players with a first name starting with F with none of them being particularly good other than FVV)

Team G: PG: Goran Dragic, SG: Gary Harris, SF: Gordon Hayward, PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo, C: Gorgui Dieng (another strong team with versatile, well-rounded players at all positions, as well as 3 capable shooters surrounding Giannis)

Team H: PG: Hamidou Diallo , SG: Henry Ellenson, SF: Harrison Barnes, PF: Harry Giles, C: Hassan Whiteside (again, Hamidou is most definitely NOT a PG but like with Team F, there's a real dearth of players with names starting with H. This team is pretty shit, other than barnes and Whiteside there's nothing really going on here)

Team I: PG: Isaiah Thomas, SG: Ian Clark, SF: Iman Shumpert , PF: Isaiah Hartenstein, C: Ian Mahinmi (other than IT, this is a really talent-starved team that would seriously struggle to score any points)

Team J: PG: Jrue Holiday (now this might be controversial as people will wonder why I didn't put Wall here. I think Jrue has just been a better player this year. He's a better shooter, better defender and their passing skills aren't really that far apart. Jrue fits much better in the ""modern"" NBA), SG: James Harden, SF: Jimmy Butler, PF: Jaren Jackson Jr., C: Joel Embiid (This is a very talented team top-to-bottom and the J letter also probably has the most overall amount of talent. There were a lot of really high quality players at this letter in pretty much every single position, but this squad is a legitimate contender especially if you consider the depth that they would have)

Team K: PG: Kyrie Irving (I had to choose between Kyrie and Lowry but ultimately, Kyrie is a guy that can take over an offense by himself and hit clutch shots when the game is on the line, which is something Lowry has struggled with at times), SG: Klay Thompson, SF: Kawhi Leonard, PF: Kevin Durant, C: Karl-Anthony Towns (ok, this right here is just a nasty fucking team and quite easily the best out of the entire alphabet range. I don't even think I need to justify why as these names pretty much speak for themselves. This team is even better than the current GSW squad)

Team L: PG: Lonzo Ball, SG: Lou Williams, SF: Luka Doncic, PF: Lebron James, C: Lamarcus Aldridge (I couldn't find any true Cs with L so I moved LMA to that position - this would be a really fun offensive team with 3 amazing playmakers and 4 very capable scorers)

Team M: PG: Mike Conley, SG: Malik Monk, SF: Mikal Bridges, PF: Montrez Harrell, C: Marc Gasol (a fun young team surrounded by the grit and grind vet mentality of Conley/Gasol. This is a team that's probably not a contender, but would give any team, weak or strong, a run for their money)

Team N: PG: Nic Batum, SG: Nemanja Bjelica, SF: Nikola Mirotic , PF: Nikola Jokic, C: Nikola Vucevic (aka Team Nikola, this all-Euro squad is fun as hell. Jokic is about as untraditional as a C can get so I think you can slot him into the PF spot and move Vuc as the main C. The defense would not be the greatest obviously but they have fantastic size and length and excellent shooting all across the board and could really cause trouble for a lot of teams)

Team O: PG: OG Anunoby, SG: Otto Porter Jr., SF: Omri Casspi, PF: Omari Spellman, C: Okaro White (another really weak team that's kind of all over the place and would probably be really, really bad as Otto is there only halfway decent player)

Team P: PG: Patric Beverley, SG: Pat Connaughton, SF: Paul George, PF: Pascal Siakam, C: Paul Millsap (an interesting small-ball lineup. This team would be a defensive and hustle beast but their offense outside of PG13 is a little lacking)

Team Q: Unfortunately not doable as the only 2 Q players I could find are Quinn Cook and Quincy Pondexter

Team R: PG: Russell Westbrook, SG: Rodney Hood, SF: Robert Covington, PF: Richaun Holmes, C: Rudy Gobert (this is probably another team where Russ would have to stat pad for trip dubs quite a bit. They'd be pretty good defensively with Cov and Gobert but there aren't any guys here other than Russ and maybe Hood that can generate their own offense)

Team S: PG: Stephen Curry, SG: Seth Curry, SF: Stanley Johnson, PF: Serge Ibaka, C: Stephen Adams (this team would be the truest test of Steph's gravity as after him there is a very steep drop-off in talent. Little brother Seth could be an intriguing Klay-lite type of player though and Ibaka can stretch the floor as well while him and Adams can hold it down on D)

Team T: PG: Trae Young, SG: Tim Hardaway Jr., SF: Tobias Harris, PF: Taj Gibson, C: Tyson Chandler (this team imo is better than it looks on paper, even though in games it would probably resemble a local YMCA game with all the chucking that's gonna be going on along with fundamental old-man rebounding and defense)

Team U: Literally the only player in this category is Udonis Haslem and that dude is more of a mascot for Miami than an actual basketball player

Team V: There are only 3 V players (Dipo, Carter and some dude named Vincent Edwards so I wasn't able to craft a team around this letter)

Team W: PG: Wade Baldwin IV, SG: Will Barton, SF: Wesley Matthews, PF: Wendell Carter Jr., C: Willie Cauley-Stein (a fairly average team. These guys are all decent at their respective positions, but none of them are particularly great. This is probably the most league-average team in these standings)

Team X: There are 0 X first-name players in the league right now. They're the Seattle Supersonics of letters

Team Y: There are only 2 Y players (Yogi ferrell, Yuta Watanabe) so again, I was not able to create a team for them

Team Z: PG: Zach Lavine, SG: Zhaire Smith, SF: Zhou Qi, PF: Zach Collins, C: Zaza Pachulia (pretty shit team, but hey maybe Zaza can be an x-factor when they play against Team K)

Since there were a few letters that didn't enough qualifying players, I decided to put together a Wild Card team using the remaining players I wasn't able to use. I'll call them Team ABC-XYZ: PG: Quinn Cook, SG: Victor Oladipo, SF: Quincy Pondexter, PF: Vince Carter, C: Vincent Edwards. This team sucks, that's all there is to it.

And that's that. I think if I had to rank the top 5 teams, it would be:

1. Team K (Kyrie, Klay, Kawhi, KD, KAT)
2. Team J (Jrue, James Harden, Jimmy, JJJ, Joel Embiid)
3. Team D (Dame, Devin Booker, Danilo, Dray, DMC)
4. Team G (Goran, Gary Harris, G. Hayward, Giannis, Gorgui)
5. Team L (Lonzo, Lou Will, Luka, Lebron, LMA)

Thoughts?

EDIT: I forgot to add James Harden to J.

We are now in December, and another week has passed. 

LeBron James turns 34 this month. Crazy to think about, and he's playing like a madman at the age he is at. Other players are starting to catch up, but 1.5 months into the season now LeBron doesn't look like he's leaving the elite category anytime soon and regains the number 1 spot.

Here is the full list:

&amp;#x200B;

|Player|Change from Last Edition|Comment|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1. LeBron James|\+2|Finals contenders? Not sure, but the chemistry is getting better and LeBron is turning it up a level.|
|2. Kevin Durant|same|30 PPG on the season with his recent ridiculous scoring outbursts, and will unquestionably be the biggest story this offseason.|
|3. Giannis Antetokounmpo|\-2|The MVP favorite still, 28/13/6 averages, did get dunked on by Mario Hezonja but he stays in the top 3.|
|4. Kawhi Leonard|\+3|Last 2 games = 37 + 34 points. The clear star for this talented Raptors team and consistently coming up in clutch situations.|
|5. Anthony Davis|\+4|The Pelicans might not have the chemistry of the Raptors or the Bucks, but AD's individual talent is insane. Needs to stay consistently healthy but his last 2 games have been ridiculous and he gets back in the top 5.|
|6. Joel Embiid|\-2|He's been consistent. Hasn't had ridiculous scoring nights the last 2 games (15 + 16 points) but if that's his floor as a scorer then that speaks for itself.|
|7. James Harden|\-1|Actually scoring more PPG right now than in his MVP season last year. Although the team isn't as talented, but Harden looks impressive every night he's on the floor.|
|8. Russell Westbrook|same|Is now nearly at triple double averages again, Thunder winning, and we'll see how the team does going forward.|
|9. Stephen Curry|\-4|After missing time with an injury he's now back. I'm sure he will move back up this list as he gets in a groove.|
|10. Nikola Jokic|\+4|Jokic gets the last top 10 spot. He's been a little more consistent this week and the Nuggets are 1st in the Western Conference. |
|11. Blake Griffin|\+5|What a low key surprise this year so far. Pistons are successful, and BG is all of a sudden having a career season with 25/9/5 averages.|
|12. Paul George|\-2|He all around just looks more comfortable this year, I'm sure the max extension helped. Fell out of the top 10 but it's been a positive year.|
|13. Kyrie Irving|\+4|Career high 6.4 APG, getting in a scoring groove, he's bringing the Celtics back into a groove as well.|
|14. Jimmy Butler|\+9|His impact on the 76ers is starting to become clear. The leadership is clearly noticeable and he's shooting 45% from 3 since his time in Philly. Butler jumps into the top 15.|
|15. Damian Lillard|same|Lillard keeps his top 15 spot, although after the hot start Portland has fallen to 7th in the West. Still, performances like 37/10 last night help.|
|16. Kyle Lowry|\-5|Back injury currently, lucky for Toronto the depth on the team is ridiculous but Lowry is still crucial to the team's success.|
|17. DeMar DeRozan|\-4|Last night was huge for him and the Spurs with 36/8/6 and clutch play. Overall, the team has struggled though but DeRozan has been doing his thing.|
|18. Klay Thompson|same|Mr. Reddit AMA man consistently scored this week and he gets paid to do that. Nothing spectacular, Nothing bad.|
|19. Chris Paul|\+3|14/10/5 + 12/13 the last 2 games. Gets back in the top 20, still a fun player to watch even if not in his prime.|
|20. Kemba Walker|\-8|Rough week (2-18 3 PT last 3 games). 27/6/4 averages on the year still elite and he keeps his top 20 spot but if the Hornets want to stay in playoff contention he needs to bounce back.|
|21. Andre Drummond|\-2|16 RPG, not the flashiest player but is getting the job done, playing his role exceptionally well, and having the best season of his career so far.|
|22. Rudy Gobert|\+3|Gobert was not pleased with how the team was treated by refs, and says this is a consistent issue. That being said, Gobert has been consistent himself and moves up 3 spots from last week.|
|23. Victor Oladipo|\-3|Out indefinitely (which could mean 2 weeks or 6 months). Hopefully he comes back sooner than later.|
|24. Ben Simmons|\+3|FG PCT is up from last year and he's looking more comfortable as the season goes along. 16/9/8 averages and he's back in the top 25.|
|25. Jrue Holiday|\-4|I almost look for reasons to drop his ranking lower but he hasn't given any. Has played consistent, 20/9 averages, makes plays, keeps his top 25 ranking.|
|26. Steven Adams|\+4|Despite only scoring 6 points each of the last 2 games, Adams consistently makes a positive impact on the floor and overall on the season having a career 15/10 year. Low key athletic and hard to handle in the paint. This is likely his ceiling unless he starts going off for 30/10 nights but he deserves recognition.|
|27. John Wall|\+2|Wall actually has a career high in eFG% right now. A 30/9/5 game vs. Brooklyn helps. The media news on him right now is mostly negative but it was a decent week for him on the floor.|
|28. Clint Capela|\+8|Capela is starting to make a serious name for himself. I was high on him last year (he finished 28th for my 2017-2018 overall ranking as well) but the consistency has increased and dude is becoming a force.|
|29. CJ McCollum|\+3|Gained back the 3 spots he fell last week. 24 + 33 points the last 2 games, Portland needs him to continue stepping up.|
|30. Tobias Harris|\-4|Good: 28/6/4 vs. Kings, Clippers 2nd in west. Bad: 5-18 shooting vs. Dallas and getting blocked on a potential game winner by Dennis Smith Jr who is like 8 inches shorter than him. Overall: mostly a positive season and he keeps his top 30 spot.|
|31. Karl-Anthony Towns|\-7|He's been a consistently solid player, but Minnesota sitting at 13th in the West and (as has been the case) you kind of want to see more.|
|32. Devin Booker|\+1|Injured his hammy vs. the Lakers. I am very high on his long term potential but dude needs to stay healthy.|
|33. Bradley Beal|\-2|Quiet week. 33% 3 PT PCT on the year is a career low and unusual. But he's getting buckets.|
|34. Pascal Siakam|\+1|A ridiculous game vs. GS and followed that up with 15/5/5 vs. Cleveland. The man has arrived it looks like.|
|35. Khris Middleton|\-7|Good: Solid 17/6/4 vs. Chicago. Bad: 7-29 shooting in the 2 other games this week. Overall: Consistent enough to stay in the top 35 and I highly doubt he falls much lower than this on the year.|
|36. Serge Ibaka|\+1|20 points vs. GS, has been consistent, a career year so far.|
|37. Al Horford|\+2|Solid week with 20 + 15 points in the 2 games he played. Also had a nasty dunk last game. Nothing spectacular but I really liked what I saw.|
|38. Mike Conley|\+6|He's back and I love it. The consistency and efficiency is up since the start of the season, a ridiculous 37/10/5 game vs. BKN. I am rooting for him to move up more.|
|39. Jayson Tatum|\+4|IDK why this sub's opinion on him is so slanted. 16/7 averages at 20 years old, efficient, makes big shots. He had a good week and moves back into the top 40.|
|40. LaMarcus Aldridge|\-6|Moves down, but had a very nice 29/8 game last night. Hopefully that can get him in a groove and he can move back up.|
|41. Marc Gasol|\-3|Had a mediocre game vs. Philly, but overall a big bounce back season so far.|
|42. Gary Harris|\-2|Came back from injury with a 27 point game vs. Portland. Denver is the number 1 seed right now and we'll see if Harris can move up.|
|43. Jusuf Nurkic|\+3|Nurkic has been consistently doing his thing this year. At 24 years old, I'm excited to see how he progresses the next 2-3 years.|
|44. Donovan Mitchell|\+4|Overall a positive week. Wade gave him praise this morning, and before last night 30 + 29 points the previous 2 games. If he continues playing like this he'll move back up.|
|45. Zach LaVine|\+2|Good: 29 + 24 points 2 of the last 3 games. Bad: Season low 8 points on 3-12 shooting vs. Detroit. Overall: Still has been consistent and moves into the top 45.|
|46. Draymond Green|\-1|Injured, value about the same.|
|47. Lou Williams|\-5|Good: Still my top 6th man, Clippers 2nd in West. Bad: 39 FG PCT for the season is really bad, other 6th men are catching up. He keeps a top 50 spot for now.|
|48. Eric Bledsoe|\-7|More of the same. Some nights dude looks elite (27/7/5 vs. NY). Other nights he stays in the shadows (7 points vs. Chicago). 16/6/5 averages are solid though and when the team needs him he is ready.|
|49. Nikola Vucevic|\+5|Vucci Man jumps into the top 50. Orlando is the 8 seed right now, and he's having a career year. Played stellar this past week and we are at the point where IF he can keep this up all star consideration is serious.|
|50. Domantas Sabonis|\+6|The REALLY good: 20/15 games in 2 of the last 3. Bad: 6 points vs. Sacramento but even in that game he had 5 assists. I'm not kidding when I say this: Sabonis has the potential to be a top 15 player by the time he's 25.|
|51. Julius Randle|\-2|Good: 23/12 vs. the Wizards. 6MOTY candidate. Falls out of top 50 but overall positive year.|
|52. Aaron Gordon|\-2|Quiet week. Put up 18/6 vs. Suns last game. Not as flashy as Vucci Man but he's been a steady underrated talent.|
|53. Luka Doncic|\-2|With a higher reputation comes higher expectations. 2-13 shooting vs. LA doesn't help, but still his IQ is beyond his years and I'm excited to see how he does.|
|54. Josh Richardson|\-2|Consistently scoring, but Heat struggling and he's shot under 50% each of the last 3 games. Still a solid year.|
|55. Nikola Mirotic|\-2|His deep 3's are a thing of beauty to watch and he's been a consistent scorer.|
|56. Jamal Murray|\+3|Shades of ridiculous talent mixed in with inefficiency (2-13 shooting last game) but Nuggets 1st in west and the talent is clearly there.|
|57. Robert Covington|\+6|Very good week. His defensive impact is clear and has been a consistent offensive scorer.|
|58. Paul Millsap|\+8|Lost in the flashy play of Denver is Paul Millsap, but he's been the X Factor for them. Efficient and has recorded 20/10 games each of the last 2. |
|59. DeAndre Jordan|\+1|He came up big against his former team with 16/23. Playing his role well and Dallas is all of a sudden up to the 8 seed.|
|60. JJ Redick|\+1|Averaging a career high in PPG at 34 years old with some big games (24 points 2 of the last 3 games)|
|61. Derrick Rose|\+7|Stock continues to rise. Another stellar week and continuing to move up.|
|62. Kevin Love|\-7|Still injured, value down.|
|63. Montrezl Harrell|\+6|Continuing to be an absolute force for this Clippers team, and has scored 23 + 24 points each of the last 2 games.|
|64. Brandon Ingram|same|Nothing flashy but over early season struggles and playing solid.|
|65. DeAndre Ayton|\-8|Rough week. Sent to the shadow realm, shut down by Boban, Doncic is clear ROTY favorite now. Not all bad though. He's got clear talent and every rookie goes through struggles.|
|66. De'Aaron Fox|\+1|Shot was a little bit off this week, but consistently scoring and keeping the Kings above water.|
|67. Goran Dragic|\-5|Still injured, value down.|
|68. Jonas Valanciunas|\-10|The hype is officially down from last year, although he is still a very solid role player he's not a top 50 overall player like last year right now.|
|69. Myles Turner|\+7|Good week. He is very low key an all defense candidate and although can be inconsistent on offense still just 22 years old.|
|70. Dennis Schroder|\-5|Good: 18 points 2 of last 3 games. Bad: 6 points on 2-9 shooting vs. Cleveland. But OKC is doing well and it's been a positive year for Schroder.|
|71. Danilo Gallinari|\+3|The scoring has stayed consistent and shooting 47% from 3 point land. His value in other areas but scoring are keeping him here right now but his stock is up either way.|
|72. Joe Ingles|\-2|Smart, low key athletic, makes plays to help his team win. But, he's paid to be a shooter and less than 50% each of the last 3 games doesn't help.|
|73. Willie Cauley-Stein|same|Game winner vs. Pacers and double-double each of the last 2 games. Needs to stay consistent but he does that and he'll move up.|
|74. Jaylen Brown|\-3|Injured, value down|
|75. Marcus Morris|\+2|Has been a consistent, efficient scorer off the bench who's been able to stay in the top 75 range all season.|
|76. Tim Hardaway Jr|\+2|Scoring consistent. He's better than last year, but efficiency issues are showing up now more than at the start of the season. Still, I like how he's played overall.|
|77. Hassan Whiteside|\-5|23/20 vs. Utah shows dominance, but he can disappear at times and Miami needs the dominant version of him on a consistent basis right now.|
|78. Thaddeus Young|\+1|Nothing flashy still a consistent role player with underrated defense.|
|79. Kyle Kuzma|\+4|Good week. He's developing more and had a very good last couple of games.|
|80. Andrew Wiggins|\-5|Stock trending down. There is still clear talent here and he basically can be a top 100 player with his eyes closed. The problem is his eyes are like 10% open right now.|
|81. TJ Warren|\+6|Injured the last couple of games but he's shown enough for me to move him up a tiny bit.|
|82. Eric Gordon|\+2|Slow start to the season but he's starting to look like himself again which is good to see.|
|83. Malcolm Brogdon|\+8|Stock trending up. Dude's looking really good this year, and if healthy I can see him developing into a top 50 talent by next year.|
|84. Ricky Rubio|\-3|Good: He has a very good 23/6/5 game vs. the Heat. Hasn't been consistent but there are times where he shows his ridiculous talent. Bad: 0-9 shooting vs. Brooklyn. Needs to show more to prove last year was not an outlier (number 49 player in 2017-2018)|
|85. Caris LeVert|same|Still injured, value same.|
|86. Dwyane Wade|\+11|Good week. Made clutch plays and scored consistently. Showing why he's an all time great still a top 100 talent at nearly 37 years old.|
|87. Otto Porter Jr|\-7|He's too talented, there is zero way he should be this low. But his role in the Wizards offense is weird and here we are after 7 + 5 points each of the last 2 games.|
|88. Enes Kanter|same|Quiet week. Got buckets, nothing spectacular.|
|89. Jabari Parker|\+7|Stock rising, looking great out there. Let's see what his role is with Hoiberg out and Markkanen healthy.|
|90. Jeff Teague|\-4|Fans hate him on here, he's still a (low end) top 100 talent in an awkward situation who unfortunately has the contract of a top 50 player making his trade value poop.|
|91. Brook Lopez|\+3|He may never get back to the Nets days but it's good to see him in the top 100 consistently again.|
|92. Derrick Favors|\-10|Stock trending down. He got moved to the bench and although still a great rebounder + inside scorer..basically players like him were more valuable when first coming into the league, but Favors had enough talent to make up for it, but his role this year seems even less and hopefully this doesn't start a slide.|
|93. Bojan Bogdanovic (NEW)|\+12|Welcome to the top 100! He's always been a good scorer but his value has lacked in other areas. But he's been such an insane scorer this year that it doesn't matter. |
|94. Buddy Hield|\-4|The top criticism last week was Buddy Hield being too low. Usually, with overwhelming criticism, I usually missed something. In this case, I moved Buddy down even more. It's been a good season but was a bit inefficient this past week. That being said he has been a consistent scorer and I don't see him moving down further than this.|
|95. PJ Tucker|same|Scoring efficient and playing his role well.|
|96. Jae Crowder|\-7|Moved him down overall but he's scored 24 + 19 the last 2 games and has come up with buckets when needed for this Jazz team. Hangs on to his top 100 spot, for now.|
|97. JaVale McGee|\+2|After cracking the top 100 for the first time ever last week, JaVale hangs on to his spot this week as well.|
|98. Dario Saric|\-5|Maybe not the ceiling we thought last year but he'll be a solid role player for a long time.|
|99. Rajon Rondo|\-7|Still injured, value down.|
|100. Harrison Barnes (NEW)|\+7|Stock rising. He might not ever reach the max contract value but Barnes has been very solid this year and after being injured + a semi slow start he's rebounded with a bang. 30 + 29 points each of the last 2 games and with Dallas on the rise Barnes is now too.|

I will do an instagram one later this year

Players who have a twitter but have not been active for at least 1 year not eligible.

So here is a new series I'm doing. My plan is to post this twice a year. Once around this time and once after the draft.

This is called ""The Top 100 Players Under 25 Years Old"". There tends to be a lot of posts on here asking who are the best players under 25. And obviously, as NBA fans, we tend to get more excited about the younger prospects for obvious reasons.

So I compiled a list.

These are all current NBA players.

# This isn't a ""top 100 players under 25 RIGHT NOW"" list. There is also the hype factor. How big of an impact will they have, what is the star potential, etc. AKA potential was factored in a lot with current talent. EMPHASIS on this.

Anyways, let's get right to it:

&amp;#x200B;

|Top 100|Age|r/NBA Quote|Comment|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**100. Anfernee Simons**|19 years, 5 Months|*""Probably won't get much playing time but in the next few seasons he'll be a nice scoring option. If he develops quickly they might look to trade CJ.""*|Simons cracks the list at number 100. The first player picked out of high school in a while, he has time to develop but from early indications he still has a long way to go. Still, he has a cool name, and will still be eligible for this list 5 years from now.|
|**99. Dante Exum**|23 years, 4 months|*""Dante will never get that time back, but if he keeps working hard and stays healthy, he'll be a good player in this league for a very long time and has the potential to be more.""*|Exum cracks the list. A top 5 pick in 2014, has experience a lot of unfortunate circumstances. It doesn't help that he got a healthy DNP last night. But, the Jazz need a long term PG, he absolutely has serious defensive talent, and he is amazingly still young enough where there is still a slimmer of hope to reach his potential.|
|**98. Frank Ntilikina**|20 years, 4 months|""*He can pass and defend, that's pretty much it.""*|Him regressing on offense is not good. That being said, he still has ridiculous defensive potential and is basically the age of a rookie still.|
|**97. Troy Brown Jr.**|19 years, 4 months|*""I think his name is too boring""*|The quote is basic but is a good reason why he is being overlooked. It doesn't help that he's stuck in a weird spot in the Wizards rotation. But watching him last night, there is some serious potential here and I would not be surprised to see him get more playing time as the season goes on.|
|**96. Malik Beasley**|22 years, 0 months|""*As an FSU grad and a Denver Nuggets fan I'm so happy he's been doing so well in the pros. Successful FSU Basketball players are rare so I hope Beasley has a long career.""*|Wouldn't have seen the list before this season, but he has made a big time step up in his 3rd season and there is some serious promise here.|
|**95. Jordan Bell**|23 years, 10 months|*""People hate Jordan Bell? He might be the most likable guy on GSW""*|This is probably his ceiling, but he's consistently in the rotation for Golden State and has solid long term defensive potential.|
|**94. Chandler Hutchison**|22 years, 7 months|""*Hutch is such a weird player, because he’s a 4 year college player, yet everything about him screams that he’ll be a slow developing player in the pros who ends up being considerably talented.""*|He doesn't play much, but when he does Hutchison has shown some clear flashes of talent. His ceiling is likely a role player, but barring injury, I think he'll be a solid role player for a while.|
|**93. Noah Vonleh**|23 years, 3 months|""*On behalf of the Knicks community I want to thank all the other teams who gave up on Vonleh. He's been great for us.""*|It took nearly 5 years, but there was consistent improvement over time and it's finally paying off for Vonleh so far. 9/8 averages with consistent shooting and will probably get paid this offseason. Still only 23 surprisingly (just 6 months older than Chandler Hutchison) but it's been an A+ year for him so far.|
|**92. Damian Jones**|23 years, 5 months|""*The best we’ve seen from Jones and even looks way better than he did in preseason.""*|Yes he's on the Warriors, yes his long term potential is a question mark. But an athletic 7 footer who is shooting 75% from the field will get noticed regardless of the situation.|
|**91. Robert Williams**|21 years, 1 month|""*I still think Williams is a higher upside option who also happens to be cost controlled.""*|When he has played, there is clear talent and a LOT of potential. Marcus Morris praised him last night. I wouldn't be surprised to see him much higher up on this list in June.|
|**90. Omari Spellman**|21 years, 4 months|""*Fantastic pick. I have him as the steal of the draft.""*|The Hawks have struggled this year, but long term they are doing the right thing and Spellman has very nice long term potential. Just 21, nice size, surprisingly nice shooting range, nice IQ., models his game after Draymond. He's had some rookie struggles but my bet is on him looking really nice in 2 years.|
|**89. Cedi Osman**|23 years, 7 months|""*Out of all the players LeBron's played with in his 15 seasons, he took Cedi under his wing. Hell of an endorsement. I'm still surprised lol.""*|He's had his opportunities this year, and efficiency is an issue. But he has a very pretty all around game, hype being from Turkey, and when he's on it's pretty.|
|**88. Gary Clark**|24 years, 0 months|""*He is the one that took Melos mins. He is a MF beast. He will be 1st Team all defense in 2-3 years, I guarantee that.""*|An old rookie, but he's going to be known as the guy who took Melo's minutes for a while. Not likely a sexy long term player, but serious defensive potential.|
|**87. Hamidou Diallo**|20 years, 4 months|""*Really excited for this kid’s potential to be unlocked, The Thunder’s brisk offense should really benefit from his athleticism!""*|A big time surprise. Major inefficiency issues in college but this is an example of a player being more fit for the NBA with his potential. It helps he found a nice situation with OKC too. Still only 20 years old, things are looking up.|
|**86. Donte DiVincenzo**|21 years, 10 months|""*Filthy. Kids gonna be really good.""*|Has shown flashes, is a nice role player, and helps the Bucks when he is on the floor. He has a while to go but we've seen he has the clutch gene and honestly he even looks a little better than I expected so far.|
|**85. Jerome Robinson**|21 years, 9 months|""*I think sending him to the G-League was a great idea and with the way he's playing there I think its only a matter of time before he starts getting regular minutes with the Team.""*|Robinson has talent, is just on a team that literally goes 15 deep. He has killed it in the G-League and I'm still high on his potential as a solid role player.|
|**84. Josh Okogie**|20 years, 3 months|""*Let's just keep leaving him on the bench right, Thibs!?!?""*|TWOLVES fans are begging for him to play, he does have a ways to go in terms of offensive efficiency. But the ridiculous athleticism and IQ for his age can't be denied.|
|**83. Harry Giles**|20 years, 7 months|""*Its even more impressive when you realize dude basically spent 2 years on the shelf. Barely played in his year in college and was red shirted last season. He is doing wayyyyyyyyyy better than i thought he would be.""*|There is some serious talent here. Finally 100% healthy, still under 21 years old, and there are some plays he makes that are jaw dropping. Also put up 30 in the G-League last night. I'm excited to see how he develops.|
|**82. Emmanuel Mudiay**|22 years, 8 months|""*So glad to see him doing so well this season.""*|Surprised? Let's see how the rest of the season goes but it's been a big plus for Mudiay this year. He's still 22, the athleticism has always been there. What's changed is his offensive efficiency has skyrocketed. Shooting 54% from inside the 3, and his long range shot is at least respectable now. I'll be following, this is a surprising rebound.|
|**81. Kevin Knox**|19 years, 3 months|""*This kid is a fucking stud""*|He has a while to go. But let's remember: still the age of a college freshman, ridiculous physical skills, and has shown flashes of potential. It's more potential right now, but I have my hopes up.|
|**80. Trey Lyles**|23 years, 0 months|""*Projects as a solid scorer off the bench going forward, nothing more, nothing less""*|Kind of crazy he just turned 23. His efficiency needs to improve but he has very solid long term potential as a stretch 4.|
|**79. Elie Okobo**|21 years, 1 month|""*I think as he gets more time under his belt, Okobo will show us more flashes of his offensive potential.""*|He's getting his chance now and I like the early results. A flashy player to watch that has international hype being from France. We'll see how much Phoenix trusts him now.|
|**78. Ryan Arcidiacono**|24 years, 8 months|""*That boi got heart""*|A late riser, but he's got talent. Surprisingly flashy play and efficient shooting, barely cracks the under 25 threshold but I could see him being a solid 2nd string PG for a while.|
|**77. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson**|23 years, 10 months|""*I think he play a draymond kind of role as a super small ball 4, from the highlights I've seen he's a good playmaker and hustler""*|The only Net to crack my top 100 last year, has regressed a bit but still under 24 and in my overall top 125 still. Solid long term defensive potential.|
|**76. Elfrid Payton**|24 years, 9 months|""*I seriously think he can improve as a shooter now that he removed the mop from his head.""*|In the little time he's seen the floor this season there has been promise. With 9/5/5 averages, and increased efficiency. But he's had injury issues, and about to turn 25 years old, the time for potential is over. But if he can stay healthy I think he can be solid.|
|**75. Tyus Jones**|22 years, 6 months|""*He's underrated outside this sub and overrated on it""*|Maybe a surprise to some seeing him this high. He's in an odd situation with the rise of DROSE. But despite a bad season in terms of shooting efficiency so far, the team still does good with him on the floor and I still really like his potential as a long term PG just maybe in a different situation.|
|**74. Taurean Prince**|24 years, 8 months|""*IMO he’ll be fine, consistency will come with age. Very promising player.""*|He has talent. As a 6th man on a playoff team I think he would be stellar. The man can score, he's proven that, and as he's about to turn 25 he should have a nice role in the NBA going forward.|
|**73. Juancho Hernangomez**|23 years, 2 months|""*Juancho’s been looking solid on both ends of the floor this season""*|After having mono last year, Juancho has bounced back in a big way with 9 PPG and shooting 46% from downtown. He's a fun player to watch, has low key international hype, and I'm interested to see how he develops.|
|**72. Dillon Brooks**|22 years, 10 months|""*Great hustle. Good sportsman. Works for his points.""*|He's been injured for a good portion of this year, but Brooks balled out last year and has shown potential to be a fun role player to watch. From Canada, and still just 22.|
|**71. Luke Kennard**|22 years, 5 months|""*He's overshadowed by the fact that we missed on Mitchell, but I think we got ourselves a stud. He's going to be in the league for a while.""*|Kennard like Brooks has been injured most of this year, but word is he's about to return and he showed some exciting potential last year. He's a very good scorer and the Pistons could use him right now.|
|**70. Josh Jackson**|21 years, 9 months|""*hes shown actual promise in the past, so unlike bender i wouldnt write him as a bust yet""*|Josh Jackson has talent, he hasn't regressed, is just in a weird chemistry situation and the Suns should probably trade him because he has value and they can get something to fit their long term plans more in return. Not sure about star potential but he has talent for sure.|
|**69. Kris Dunn**|24 years, 8 months|""*Dunn is a great defender and is a very good playmaker""*|There was a thread this summer where one asked if LaVine or Dunn was better. 95% of the posters said Dunn. Interesting, anyways Dunn showed promise last year he probably won't be a star but there is very nice potential here and that being said I could see him being the type to hit his prime later in his career ala Billups/Lowry.|
|**68. Josh Hart**|23 years, 8 months|""*IMO Josh Hart looks like he can become one of the best 2 way shooting guards in the league""*|Hart is an odd man out ish on this Lakers team, but he's improved in his 2nd year. Efficient, nice basketball IQ, he'll be in the league a while.|
|**67. Kelly Oubre Jr.**|22 years, 11 months|""*He has a future in the NBA for sure , the length , the shooting , the defensive potential. It’s just a matter of how good he’ll be .""*|Oubre Jr. has scored 12 PPG this year and last. His efficiency needs to improve, but he's an exciting player to watch and has an interesting personality.|
|**66. Bobby Portis**|23 years, 9 months|""*He'll get a crazy offer this summer""*|My number 102 player last season, and was in my top 100 before getting injured. Lauri is the big name, but Portis is young with very nice talent. 13/7 averages last year and as the quote says he is probably getting paid this offseason.|
|**65. Kevin Huerter**|20 years, 3 months|""*Kyle Korver except he dunks twice a year instead of once.""*|He has rookie struggles, he needs to put on weight. That all being said, a 20 year old shooting 40% from 3 on a high volume of shots for damn sure has a nice future in the NBA. I really, really like his potential.|
|**64. Monte Morris**|23 years, 5 months|""*POINT GAWD""*|Turns the ball over at an absurdly low rate, and is starting to make a big name for himself. His stock has been trending up the whole season and doesn't look like that is slowing down anytime soon. He has skills that can enable to him to be a solid PG for a very long time.|
|**63. Malik Monk**|20 years, 9 months|""*Monk has the ceiling of a freak athlete Lou Williams. Dude is a walking bucket and will be a great player as long as he isn't a sieve on defense""*|His teammates love him, the team is high on his potential, I am too still honestly. But only minor progression from his rookie season so far. Keep in mind he still isn't 21 but my hopes were a bit higher for this season.|
|**62. Stanley Johnson**|22 years, 6 months|""*Although I thought he would be a lot better in the NBA, I don’t really consider him a bust since he’s still having a decent career.""*|One very under the radar player this year is SJ. Yes he has not lived up to the hype but he's having the best season of his career right now. His offensive efficiency has improved, still 22, a role player for a winning Pistons team, Dwayne Casey has clearly done wonders with him, and low key he's one of the most popular NBA players among other players. There is still potential to be reached here, and this season has been good.|
|**61. Zach Collins**|21 years, 0 months|""*Hes raw right now. But, he is already a pretty good defender. Hes going to hopefully pan out to a good modern center. Has got three point range, and has a pretty high defensive ceiling.""*|Improvement has been made in his sophomore season. He still can be inconsistent, but just turned 21 years old and there is some serious long term potential here.|
|**60. Fred VanVleet**|24 years, 9 months|""*These next two years I feel like he is going to prove a lot and earn a big next contract""*|Barely cracking the age threshold, but VanVleet is such a fun NBA story. Undrafted player who proved himself through hard work and is making 9 million a year now Was my number 100 player last year, and is a crucial role player for the best team in the East.|
|**59. Marcus Smart**|24 years, 8 months|""*Smart embodies ""winning plays"" in such a beautiful way. If there was ever an argument to be made for watching the game over looking at the box score, he'd be in the top-tier of examples.""*|One of those ""damn he's still under 25?"". But he was a top 100 player last year and is having his best season in terms of shooting efficiency right now. Has carved a nice role for himself on the Celtics, and the team recognized this by giving him an extension.|
|**58. Markelle Fultz**|20 years, 6 months|""*he showed the physical and skill ability in college to at the very least be a serviceable role player.""*|Here we go. The number 1 hype is still there, has shown small progression when on the floor, still under legal drinking age. Whether it's with Philly or elsewhere, I'm interested to see how this plays out.|
|**57. Jakob Poeltl**|23 years, 1 month|""*Ah this post made me remember we had to give up Jak. :( man I really liked him""*|With the Spurs struggles, I can see them giving Poeltl a bigger role. He was a top 140 player last year and has nice long term potential to be a solid center. If he gets minutes I can see him impressing.|
|**56. Terry Rozier**|24 years, 8 months|""*he still has a lot of upside at 24 years old and he has proved that he can be a beast when given a feature role.""*|I see a talented player who probably fits better as a starter than a 2nd string player. The catch is, would anyone be willing to give him that chance? Last year's playoffs are still fresh on my mind.|
|**55. Landry Shamet**|21 years, 8 months|*""he's a young JJ with better defense and ball handling in the making, and he's learning from the man himself.""*|Shamet got stuck in the perfect situation at the right time for him to develop. I've always liked his potential 2-3 years from now, but with how things have played out that potential is even higher now.|
|**54. Allonzo Trier**|22 years, 10 months|""*Trier reminding me of Donovan Mitchell.""*|He's fun, in a big market, and although inconsistent man he has talent. Undrafted and with his flashy style of play makes him a fan favorite.|
|**53. Justise Winslow**|22 years, 8 months|""*Let’s gooo!!!! So happy to have Winslow back. 22 year old with so much potential.""*|The stats don't look pretty, and the efficiency does need to improve. But I'm seeing progression in other areas, still only 22, has moved up my overall ranking, and I can see him having a big start to 2019.|
|**52. Dario Saric**|24 years, 7 months|""*He’s going to be an elite role player""*|Close to 25, he's in a new environment and I like the results so far. He's an excellent fit off the Minnesota bench. Maybe not the number 53 player I had him last year but he can be a top 100 talent for a while.|
|**51. Mitchell Robinson**|20 years, 8 months|""*He can run the floor, has great leaping ability and combine that with his length and wingspan, you'll have a problem.""*|There is serious, serious potential here to become DeAndre Jordan 2.0 with better shooting. He has a long way to go but his ceiling is the sky.|
|**50. Mikal Bridges**|22 years, 3 months|""*Yeah I think purely from a basketball perspective Phoenix is a great spot for Bridges.""*|Bridges is in a slump right now but he has shown enough to where we can see the man has talent. Unlike some of the other recent players Phoenix has drafted I can see him developing over time and by the time he's still on this list in 2 years could be much higher.|
|**49. OG Anunoby**|21 years, 4 months|""*Floor: solid defender, good athlete Likely: Great 3 &amp; D Ceiling: one of the 3 or so best defenders in the league. His length and size is crazy.""*|Anunoby is barely legal drinking age, is a role player for the best team in the East, and gets to learn from Kawhi. His shooting efficiency has slumped (and 31% FT is just weird) but there is a lot to like long term here.|
|**48. Aaron Holiday**|22 years, 2 months|""*Good starter potential.""*|I'm going out on a limb with this one. With Indiana's situation, he's probably the starting PG next year. And from recently cracking the rotation, you can see the NBA genes. He isn't going to be as good as Jrue. But, I see a lot of Jeff Teague in him. Which is a solid top 100 player ceiling with maybe a random all star game.|
|**47. Miles Bridges**|20 years, 8 months|""*dude has a mean stroke and is mad athletic""*|It's weird to think Bridges is still under 21 since he wasn't a one and done, but he has serious athleticism and talent. I would not be surprised to see him in the dunk contest. But other than that, he's been efficient from the floor and has a surprisingly decent long range shot. The Hornets got good value where they picked him even though it wasn't highly regarded at the time.|
|**46. John Collins**|21 years, 2 months|""*Young, athletic, rebounds, blocks shots, shows promise in switching on to guards, can hit the open three, makes freethrows""*|Was injured the first month, but averaging 15/7 since returning with 70% from inside the 3 point line. Just turned legal drinking age, he has a while to go but there's some serious potential here by the time he's 23/24.|
|**45. Jusuf Nurkic**|24 years, 3 months|""*If Nurkic can extend his range, he’ll have a long career ahead of him.""*|Another player surprisingly still under 25, but Nurkic has improved this year and is playing at the level he was at when he had ridiculous hype after the 2017 trade deadline. He has extended his range, and there is potential here to progress into a top 30 overall type talent.|
|**44. Jonathan Isaac**|21 years, 1 month|""*Gonna be an animal if he stays healthy""*|Isaac still has a long way to go. That being said, he has stayed mostly healthy this year, has progressed, and has ridiculous potential. If his offense (which has been improving. 16 + 15 points 2 of the last 3 games) can meet his defensive potential that is scary.|
|**43. Bam Adebayo**|21 years, 4 months|""*I love me some BAM he has the potential to be the best perimeter defending big in the league. No way Miami should give him up""*|Whiteside is the obvious starter, but Bam has low key improved a ton so far. Solid defense, improved efficiency, respectable FT shooter, crazy athletic. He can be a top 100 player next year if he continues to progress at this rate.|
|**42. Lonnie Walker IV**|19 years, 11 months|""*Super athletic, good defender in college""*|This is a risky spot and an out there prediction especially for a player who hasn't played at all this season yet. I just have a really good feeling about this one. Pop can do wonders with him. It might not happen this year or next but as long as he stays healthy he'll be a force by the time he's 23/24 and he also has a marketable personality.|
|**41. Dennis Smith Jr.**|21 years, 0 months|""*He's got the athleticism/talent and the clear support of his organization.""*|He's low key behind the other back court member plus another PG from his class that has improved dramatically, but DSJ has improved. His efficiency is better and he for sure can be the long term PG for Dallas with how things look right now.|
|**40. Kyle Kuzma**|23 years, 4 months|""*If he can play average defense he'll be good but Idk about top 20-30""*|This is a player who has basically been a top 100 talent since entering the NBA. That shouldn't be understated. Despite being a rookie last year, he's still I guess older than you think (6 months older than 2015 draft pick Justise Winslow). But he's making shots, and with LeBron, he's probably a consensus top 100 player for a while.|
|**39. Myles Turner**|22 years, 8 months|""*He can defend, and he can shoot.""*|The narrative on Turner has been weird, because the hype was him being a potential top 25 player at just 21 years old. And he got a big contract from Indiana. And despite the hype from another Indiana big man that's higher on the list, Turner has for real talent. There are some games where he looks ridiculous and he's averaging 2.6 BPG. I have him number 72 overall in the NBA currently and he hasn't really ever fallen out of the top 80 the last year and a half. He might not be a star but the dude is good.|
|**38. Jabari Parker**|23 years, 8 months|""*He has incredible potential, he's a hometown kid, he's only 23 and he's proven he can score at a high level in the NBA.""*|I still have high hopes for Jabari in his hometown. The start to the season was slow, but he's turned it on with 16/7 averages and is currently my number 91 overall player. The Bulls will struggle this year, but if he continues to have success + stays healthy + add another high lotto pick to the mix next year and he'll still be only 24 in a big contract year.|
|**37. Gary Harris**|24 years, 2 months|""*Gary Harris is the fucking man and is one of my favorite players to watch.""*|Harris has improved every year, and less than a year away from 25 his future looks bright. 17 PPG for a successful Nuggets team, and he doesn't have a flashy name but dude is going to be solid for years to come.|
|**36. Andrew Wiggins**|23 years, 9 months|""*Wiggins is an enigma to me.""*|This is an interesting one. A former number 1 pick, has been a top 100 player since entering the NBA, but has never reached his full potential to where we would expect him to be top 5 on a list like this. His offensive woes don't help either and he has slightly regressed from last year. The good: his defense has been nice (career high 1.5 SPG) and he usually helps his team on the floor more than hurting them. With the new look Timberwolves, and still being shy of 24, there is still hope in terms of potential but that hope is getting smaller.|
|**35. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander**|20 years, 4 months|*He looked really poised out there, and is already good at finishing thru contact.*|Already starting for Doc Rivers, and is already in my overall top 150. I am interested to see what his long term potential is, but it looks really good right now.|
|**34. Buddy Hield**|24 years, 11 months|""*Buddy has been consistently getting better and better throughout his time with the Kings.""*|Buddy Hield is a perfect example on why you shouldn't give up on potential (unless it's an Anthony Bennett out of NBA situation) until the 25 mark. Hield improved over time and now just shy of 25 is balling and in my overall top 100. 18 PPG on efficient shooting, he's limited in other areas but the potential he had as a scorer going into the draft 2 years ago is starting to come together.|
|**33. Julius Randle**|24 years, 0 months|""*Lol my god, if we could have kept him for 9 mil a year""*|Who would have guessed in 2014 Randle would be higher on a list like this than Wiggins or Parker? That's where we are at. Randle is having his best season yet averaging 18/9 and is an extremely fun player to watch. Maybe not a star but a top 50 talent for the next few years at least if healthy.|
|**32. Collin Sexton**|19 years, 10 months|""*He's a rookie, he has potential and he'll probably get to it.""*|I don't think this sub has ever seen a narrative change so quick. He has a while to go but the scoring potential is for real and he's not even 20. For sure can be the face of the Cavs franchise and could be a top 100 talent by the time he is 21.|
|**31. Caris LeVert**|24 years, 3 months|""*I fucking love Levert.""*|I saw enough before he got injured to put him this high, and I think he'll come back fine. He has talent, and if he can stay healthy is a top 75 player for the next few years.|
|**30. Jaylen Brown**|22 years, 1 month|""*Jaylen is already a damn good 3 point shooter which we all thought was going to be a project.""*|An obvious slow start to the season, but was a top 50 player last year at 21 years old and I've seen enough to say he has clear long term potential and talent. He'll bounce back.|
|**29. Clint Capela**|24 years, 6 months|""*I really think that Capela deserved to be last season MIP""*|Capela has been a low key player who has improved every year and right now is averaging 18/12. He has ridiculous athleticism and underrated IQ. If healthy he can be a consistent top 25-35 player for the next 3-4 years.|
|**28. Montrezl Harrell**|24 years, 10 months|""*MONTREZL HARRELL IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CLIPPER""*|Absolutely maybe a surprise to some him being this high, but he is the biggest reason for the Clippers success. Probably will never be a star but he has a role as a very exciting player going forward. Is already one of the best role players in the NBA.|
|**27. Wendell Carter Jr**|19 years, 7 months|""*Comped him to Horford pre-draft, think he's not a flashy option, but he's solid and has relatively low bust potential.""*|The reddit comment is fair. I don't think he'll ever be a star but by the time he's 21/22 he could already be a top 50 player if he progresses well enough.|
|**26. Jarrett Allen**|20 years, 7 months|""*Jarrett Allen looks like an ABA player transported to the modern day.""*|Allen reminds me a ton of Myles Turner at the same age. He has top 25 potential just depends how bad he wants it. Difference between him and Turner, is Turner is at his floor right now and the jury is still out on if Allen can reach his ceiling. He's progressed in year 2 so far which is a good sign.|
|**25. D'Angelo Russell**|22 years, 9 months|""*He has potential to be a top 10 player IMO. He has shown great flashes when not injured and honestly I think the comments about his work ethic by reddit users are overstated.""*|This is an interesting one. He's improved, there are some games where he looks insane (38/8/8 vs. Philly last week). Then he shoots 6-25 vs. Utah the next game. 18/6/4 averages, still only 22, I'm rooting for him and there's still a very outside shot he can be a superstar but the clock is ticking.|
|**24. Jamal Murray**|21 years, 9 months|""*He's a god I think he has massive room to grow""*|The 48 point game showed a glimpse at what could be. I have him number 55 overall right now, up from 74 last year. He still needs to be more consistent but the man has talent and is a flashy, fun player to watch.|
|**23. Mohamed Bamba**|20 years, 6 months|""*This man can hit a three, athletic, rebounding, blocks""*|The star power is already there with a top 10 billboard song named after him. There is ridiculous potential, although we are only getting it in doses right now. Vucevic having a career year complicates things as well. Interested to see what happens here, but Rudy Gobert with a 3 point shot absolutely is possible.|
|**22. Donovan Mitchell**|22 years, 2 months|""*absolute ceiling? I see a smaller wade that makes up for the size""*|Slow start to the year but he's looked better since coming back from injury. Having a top 25 player overall rookie season put high expectations that are hard to match, but if healthy he's going to be a stud long term.|
|**21. Aaron Gordon**|23 years, 2 months|""*has improved every year in the NBA and hasn’t hit his full potential yet.""*|I'm probably higher on AG than most on this sub, but at still 23 years old with steady progression (career high FG PCT and 3 PT PCT this year) with the ridiculous athleticism to go along I am very interested to see how he is at 25/26 years old if he continues to progress.|
|**20. Pascal Siakam**|24 years, 7 months|""*he might be the favorite for MIP right now""*|Just under the 25 threshold, Siakam has started to make a serious name for himself. With 15/7 averages, to combine with ridiculous efficiency + IQ on the best team in the East, with continued progression Siakam could be a top 25 talent for the next few years. Can he reach that? We'll see but the potential is there.|
|**19. Lauri Markkanen**|21 years, 6 months|""*Superstar ceiling. Personally I think he'll be a long term starter and an all star for a few years but he has the tools to be among the NBA's elite if he maxes out his potential.""*|Making his debut tonight, I'm excited to see how Lauri does in his sophomore campaign. His return is absolutely huge for Chicago and he showed a ton of potential year 1. His ceiling is a superstar and we'll see how close he can get there in year 2.|
|**18. Marvin Bagley III**|19 years, 8 months|""*The talent is there. As his body develops he can be really good. As long as the kings dont let him/want him taking perimeter shots this early in his career""*|20/17 vs. Golden State is serious bad man stuff. Dude is just scratching the surface and with his stock trending up he could be close to a top 100 player by the time he's 20.|
|**17. Domantas Sabonis**|22 years, 6 months|""*One of the most underrated players in the game""*|Domantas Sabonis has superstar potential. He is in my top 50 overall currently, his IQ is insane, and if he continues to develop I'm not even kidding he could be a top 15 player by the time he's not eligible for this list anymore.|
|**16. Brandon Ingram**|21 years, 2 months|""*Amazing talent. That young man is seriously good.""*|He's on the Lakers. With LeBron. With that comes more criticism. Still easy to forget he's barely legal drinking age, scoring 16 PPG, and has improved as the season has progressed. Things are looking up.|
|**15. Zach LaVine**|23 years, 8 months|""*Always thought he had the potential to be an offensive juggernaut. His jumpshot is a thing of beauty. Athleticism that makes everything he does look effortless. Excellent at getting to the rim.""*|Efficiency needs to improve, but as the season has continued it's clear his early season start wasn't a fluke. With crazy athleticism and an exciting game in a big market, I am very interested to see how the new look LaVine pairs with Lauri.|
|**14. Jaren Jackson Jr.**|19 years, 2 months|""*This kid is more polished than my grandad's leather shoes.""*|The youngest player on this list is already in the top 15. He has serious, serious long term potential and as a Grizzlies fan that has me excited. Stays healthy, and I can't imagine how he could look at 21.|
|**13. Lonzo Ball**|21 years, 1 month|""*He makes some great flashy defensive plays""*|He has a long way to go but the potential is there, he has ridiculous court vision, a nice all around game, and being in the big LA market gives him obvious star power if he makes it big. I am still high on his potential as shown by this ranking.|
|**12. Trae Young**|20 years, 2 months|""*Trae next stephen curry book it""*|Easily one of the most polarizing players on this sub, but his star power is for real. He's shown flashes of ridiculous potential, the Hawks are in a clear rebuild it's not happening this year. But within the next 2-3 years this guy could seriously be dangerous.|
|**11. Karl-Anthony Towns**|23 years, 0 months|""*One of the most valuable players in the league""*|Having just turned 23, with Jimmy Butler now gone, the time is now for him to start reaching his full potential. He's shown glimpses of what could be. Will he reach it? We'll see but what we can't argue now is that he's sure as hell going to have the opportunity.|
|**10. Kristaps Porzingis**|23 years, 3 months|""*missing this guy so much""*|Porzingis cracks the top 10. Injured still, but being in the New York market the star potential is still there and that was booming before he got injured. The Knicks are the right kind of bad, and hopefully they can get lucky in the lottery to get another star to mix with him.|
|**9. DeAndre Ayton**|20 years, 4 months|""*Dude reminds me of a young LSU Shaq""*|Ayton was an immediate top 70 player from the first time he stepped on the floor. That type of talent is very, very rare. This year has been a struggle for the team but he's a walking double-double and with his age the potential is still sky high.|
|**8. De'Aaron Fox**|20 years, 11 months|""*Does anyone disagree that at this point so far, he's the best PG from his draft class?""*|When you really think about it, what he's doing at 20 years old as a point guard is rarely seen. His career has taken a sophomore jump and him (+ the potential development of Bagley) has given Kings something to be excited about for the first time in a very long time.|
|**7. Ben Simmons**|22 years, 4 months|""*Simmons, if he tried, could be a high 20’s scorer, and he’s already a dub elite defender""*|Already a big Hollywood name dating Kendall Jenner, and a unique all around game, we'll see if he can reach his ultimate ceiling but the hype + top 25 talent is already there.|
|**6. Jayson Tatum**|20 years, 8 months|""*Tatum is gonna be a star""*|Fans screamed overrated on this sub last year. He had elite efficiency but we wondered if he could do it on a higher volume of shots. He's scoring 16 ppg and still has near elite efficiency. Not the flashiest player but dude is leading Boston into the future and if healthy will be the team's best player in 2020.|
|**5. Nikola Jokic**|23 years, 9 months|*""He’s so skilled just not that athletic but his skills are unreal like all nba level""*|One of the most unique centers in NBA history, we have yet to see how far he can lead this Nuggets team in the playoffs but the skills are absurd.|
|**4. Devin Booker**|22 years, 1 month|""*Destined for stardom if he keeps this up and the Suns start to win games.""*|A ridiculous offensive player, fun to watch, the Suns aren't winning yet but at this rate by the time he's 24 years old my bet is on us saying a different tune about Booker + the Suns.|
|**3. Luka Doncic**|19 years, 9 months|""*Hot take: Luka Doncic is good.""*|Doncic has clearly reached the hype so far if not exceeded it. He has the highest IQ for a teenager in the NBA since LeBron. The star power is there. He is already entering top 50 overall territory so the expectations have been set early on on his career. So far so good.|
|**2. Joel Embiid**|24 years, 8 months|""*I really hope he stays healthy for the rest of his career. Dude is a beast and one of the most enjoyable players to watch right now.""*|This is what the process was for: It was a long process, especially for Embiid not playing a single game for 2.5 years after being drafted. But it paid off, Embiid is an absolute monster, a top 5 overall player right now. On the verge of 25, things are looking up.|
|**1. Giannis Antetokounmpo**|23 years, 11 months|""*Dude is literally unstoppable at the rim""*|An incredible rise to superstardom, my favorite for MVP, and my current number 1 overall player in the NBA. How he's developed has been nothing short of incredible to see and he has become one of the NBA's most surprising superstars in history.|

I realise that ""lesser known"" is a broad and murky designation, with everybody thinking their favourite rapper is ""slept on"" or ""criminally underrated"" (ahem, Isaiah Rashad, JID, Denzel Curry...). So I've tried to skirt around that by using an objective qualifier - I've only included projects whose initial release (if it was posted at all) received fewer than 100 upvotes here, at the time of my writing this. So that excludes a lot of great artists that still very much fall under the underground label - Busdriver, Milo, Ka, Roc Marciano, Armand Hammer... - but I think it does a good job of keeping the selections/discussion fresh, and avoiding collective masturbation over the same few ""approved"" underground projects. Furthermore, I've made sure only to include one project per artist, for a lot of the same reasons. Another important note - I've tried to include a bit of variety, so in the case of 2 albums where I don't really have a preference I've usually included the one that I think adds a bit more of a new dimension to the list. The decrease from 50 to 25 is partly because of my laziness, partly because of the new restrictions, and partly because I wanted to feel comfortable writing about/recommending everything here. If possible, I've included a Bandcamp link to each of the projects - it's a great platform that facilitates music discovery and helps create an audience for smaller artists, and in my opinion gives artists the most control over their music and how it's presented. It's possible to stream everything I've linked for free, without even having to sign up (though that's also free), and if you're purchasing this is the best way to give the artist the greatest share of the profits. Otherwise, everything here should be available on the normal streaming services or at least soundcloud/youtube, so you know, use your search bar like a semi-capable human being. For each project, I've included one track that I think is the best/best representation. And finally - there is no order whatsoever to the list.

**[ANKHLEJOHN - KNOWLEDGE](https://soundcloud.com/ankhlejohn/knowledge-ep-shaaprecords)**
ANKHLEJOHN has been one of 2018's breakout stars, star of course meaning small cult following and incompatible with any mainstream recognition. Project after project of some of the grimiest hip hop there is, sounding like a the natural successor to people like Mobb Deep and Onyx while still pushing himself forward and avoiding revivalist cliches. But out of all that output, where he's jumped from car theft to Van Gogh, nothing has stuck with me as much as *KNOWLEDGE*. Drawing from 5 Percenter and Nation of Islam ideas, it's a dense 15 minute onslaught that never lets up. 

*[Tutankhamun ](https://soundcloud.com/ankhlejohn/knowledge-ep-shaaprecords)*

**[Blackfist - Strapped 4 Survival](https://rawsh-t.bandcamp.com/album/strapped-4-survival)**

Blackfist is a duo out of LA consisting of VIK and YUNGMORPHEUS, both of whom rap and produce, and who sacrifice zero creative control, by releasing music on their own label ""RAWSH_T"". In a lot of ways, *Strapped 4 Survival* can be seen as the embodiment of ""lofi hip hop"", while still moving the scene forward in a meaningful way. This album is hazy, gritty, and sounds like a weird cross between early 90s Memphis hip hop and a Madlib beat tape, with effortlessly political lyrics. It works as a slow burn stoner tape, something nostalgic, and a potent discussion of some important ideas, but what's most impressive is how all of this is done in such a casual, fluid way. 

*[Hate Run Deep](https://rawsh-t.bandcamp.com/track/hate-run-deep)*

**[lojii - lofeye](https://uuum.bandcamp.com/album/lofeye)**

lojii exploded onto my radar last year with *DUE RENT*, his collaboration with producer Swarvy. It sounded like an incredible merging of Ka and Knxwledge, just as much grit running through it as there was off kilter alt. hip hop. So considering *lofeye* shares almost no sonic similarity with that album, my initial reaction was one of disappointment. Everything about this is colder, harsher, more calculated, even uglier... that laid back working class quality is nearly all gone. But fortunately, it's been replaced with some of the sharpest, cleverest, and most efficient lyricism of the year. lojii has gone from a great rapper, to one of the best alive - he chronicles street life and social issues, always full of an incredible wit. The sparser production plays into the desolate world he's created, and while this will never be as 'fun' a listen as *DUE RENT*, it's a much more ambitious creation. 

*[colour](https://uuum.bandcamp.com/track/colour-prod-heaprize-digital-only)*

**[Cavalier - Private Stock](https://cavaliervmc.bandcamp.com/album/private-stock)**

Cavalier is from Brooklyn, resides and records in New Orleans, and is integrated with Detroit's experimental hip hop scene, and all that culminates in the wise nomad-like figure at the centre of *Private Stock*. Cavalier ruminates on race, wealth, police brutality, and spirituality, accompanied by Iman Omari's lush, ""full"" sounding production. The territory spans from the dark to the nostalgic to the joyous, and throughout Cavalier comes across measured and in control of everything around him. At surface level it's a pleasant, relaxing listen, but with a little more unpacking you encounter one of the most compelling, intelligent MCs around. 

*[Watch Me (feat. Quelle Chris &amp; Iman Omari)](https://cavaliervmc.bandcamp.com/track/watch-me-feat-quelle-chris-and-iman-omari)*


**[Knife Knights - 1 Time Mirage](https://open.spotify.com/album/2ECHYflSemkO7lQ9cIlmpw?si=FQ10z4AiTp2cDNoCBneBQA)**

The latest project from Ishmael Butler (Digable Planets, Shabazz Palaces, Cherrywine) - this time joined by Seattle music veteran Erik Blood, sees yet another evolution from an artist whose career has been characterised by adventure and unpredictability. This is perhaps the lushest and most freeform Butler's music has ever been, with a lot of the production here having more in common with shoegaze or dream pop than with what you'd expect on a hip hop album. The album is in equal parts abstract, even futuristic, and a commentary on current events. It's relaxing and 'pretty', but there's always a sinister undertone running through the album. Most of all, it's another case for Ishmael Butler being one of the best musicians ever to grace hip hop. 

*[My Dreams Never Sleep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zZWE-um7lM)*

**[Cities Aviv - ""Raised For A Better View""](https://citiesaviv.bandcamp.com/album/raised-for-a-better-view)**

Cities Aviv has been a less picked up on but nevertheless important part of ""internet rap"" during the current decade, and has shown over multiple albums his ability to experiment tastefully and intelligently, making forward thinking music that doesn't rely on being abrasive or deliberately inaccessible. After being mostly inactive since 2015's *Your Discretion is Trust*, he returns with what is possibly his finest achievement yet. The music here is a lot sparser, less busy than his previous work, and that leads to something a lot subtler, that rewards repeated listens. A good deal of the album is instrumental, and when he chooses to add vocals, they carry extra weight, each of his words sounding purposeful and powerful, the depth of his voice adding a kind of ominous quality to everything. It's not an album that goes out of its way to assert itself and make a spectacle, it fades in and fades out and once you're through it you're compelled to keep diving in. 

*[Highly Favored (spirited set)](https://citiesaviv.bandcamp.com/track/highly-favored-spirited-set)*

**[Kenny Segal - happy little trees](https://kennysegal.bandcamp.com/album/happy-little-trees)**

Kenny Segal has been a go-to producer in art rap circles for a while now, and through his work with guys like Armand Hammer, Open Mike Eagle, Busdriver, Milo etc, as well as through a vast collection of beat tapes, he's cemented himself as one of the most talented beatmakers out there. But in spite of that, this is his first 'real album', the first time that he's taken his ability and directed it into one unified, ambitious piece of music. Lots of instrumental projects drop every year. Some good, some bad, most fairly pleasant without really asserting themselves. But Kenny Segal managed to make a cohesive, consistent 'instrumental album', that exists in its own right and not as hypothetical background to someone else's stories. 

*[cole's final](https://kennysegal.bandcamp.com/track/coles-final)*

**[Sterling Hayes - SideFX](https://open.spotify.com/album/7IKnnhCdHm5cBrpo2XbZmH?si=OAgRlEPkTpqzGbsH8_Q1vw)**

Sterling Hayes is an oft-neglected part of the Savemoney collective, who hasn't yet managed to cement himself at the forefront of the burgeoning Chicago hip hop scene of the last few years. But during that time, he's occupied a space distinct from his peers - foregoing the playfulness, optimism, the mellower stuff. Instead, his music is frantic, gritty, and occasionally even ugly. He touches on fairly common topics in modern hip hop - mental health, addiction - but does it in a very real, well rounded way. It's not the mindless wallowing of emo rap, it's not an inspiring tale of overcoming struggle, and it's not even some cerebral examination of these issues. It's a visceral unrestrained portrait of desperation that never loses its grounding or realism. Vocals are yelped out, production is bass heavy with hints of soul, the tempo is constantly changing, and nothing is held back - overall an excellent album with a unique identity running through it.

*[Anxiety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqcP9uGHPTI)*

**[Mckinley Dixon - The Importance Of Self Belief](https://mckinleydixon.bandcamp.com/album/the-importance-of-self-belief)**

This is the kind of title I might initially dismiss as trite and corny, too close to self help book territory. But Mckinley Dixon has succeeded in creating a consistently engaging, genuinely moving album, which excels in the area where so many rappers struggle - making use of unique song structures that shirk the played out 'verse chorus verse chorus' template that runs through so much hip hop. Certain tracks here feature no rapping at all - there are instrumentals, poems, prayers.... And most importantly, getting through this album feels like undergoing progression - Dixon builds towards a optimistic conclusion rather than obnoxiously throwing it in your face from track one (____ The Rapper). He's backed by a live band who merge hip hop with neighbouring Black genres like jazz and soul, and throughout he acts more as a guide amplifying the music than as its main point of focus. It's like a modernised, expanded version of what Native Tongues were doing in the late 80s/early 90s, without every sounding tired or unoriginal. 

*[Black Boy Flies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj2cGCb92qE)*

**[Medhane - Ba Suba, Ak Jamm](https://medhane.bandcamp.com/album/ba-suba-ak-jamm)**

In recent years underground hip hop has been infested by guys in their teens/early 20s making pseudo-poetry out of their bedrooms, where poor mixing is supposed to be some grand artistic statement. With that in mind, it would be easy to dismiss Medhane at first glance. But he distances himself from the crowd with bolder production choices, and most importantly lyricism that goes into more abstract places, as well as an approach that foregoes self-aggrandisement, and is outward-focused enough to make him acutely aware of his place amongst things. He's not a tortured soul, but he's not lacking vulnerability either. The end result is very much 'everyday' hip hop, characterised by its balance and measured grasp of the issues that spring up around us, 

*[AiteDen](https://medhane.bandcamp.com/track/aiteden-prod-laron-tony-seltzer)*

**[Pink Siifu - ensley](https://ronee.bandcamp.com/album/ensley-2)**

It seems a lot of the discourse this year has been around the disconnect between overly long albums, and short 20 minute projects meant not to have any frill (despite, you know, EPs being around forever). Given that, it's always refreshing to hear an album that's not aimlessly filled to the brim, but is instead intentionally sprawling, and that's exactly what *ensley* does. 25 tracks, all of which bleed into each other without any set up or transitions, most representing vastly different ideas both musically and lyrically, but it all comes together into this beautifully eclectic creation. Political, introspective, soulful, witty, always charismatic... Pink Siifu has already accrued in an impossibly vast and difficult to track down discography (including a great punk EP from earlier this year, *fuck demo*), but this is him at his most complete and confident, and it really pays off into a compelling piece of music. 

*[pray everyday (feat. awhlee &amp; liv.e)](https://ronee.bandcamp.com/track/pray-everyday-ft-ahwlee-x-liv-e-prod-like)*

**[Jeremiah Jae - DAFFI](https://yellowmaskcxllective.bandcamp.com/album/daffi)**

Jeremiah Jae, although originally from Chicago (he's the son of Miles Davis collaborator Robert Irving), has been one of the anchors of the LA experimental hip hop/beat scene of the last decade, working closely with people like Jonwayne, Zeroh, Flying Lotus, Koreatown Oddity, Mndsgn... But that scene has lost some of its strength and cohesion in the last couple years, and during that time it seems Jae's music has taken a more casual, even wayward direction. Still putting out good stuff, but nothing defining came after 2015's collaboration with L'Orange. Fortunately that looks to have changed with DAFFI, which excluding the excellent *Raw Money Raps* might be his most focused and consistent solo work yet, and it's also the most vulnerable and directly introspective he's ever been. The production, all done by Jae himself, hops between griminess and making your head nod, desolation and majesty. 



*[Rise](https://yellowmaskcxllective.bandcamp.com/track/rise)*

**[Jerry Quickley - (american) FOOL](https://jerryquickly.bandcamp.com/album/american-fool)**

Jerry Quickley might be the most interesting person on this list - journalist, filmmaker, and poet, who's spent a lot of time working in Iraq as a war correspondent. And perhaps more importantly, this album's creation was preceded by 3 suicides of those close to him, all within the space of 3 months. That background manifests in one of the strangest, most unsettling, yet consistently compelling albums of the year. Quickley's urgent spoken word is soundtracked by underground icon Busdriver, whose glitchy production is eerily matched to the eccentric, near disturbing atmosphere.

**[Bambu - Exrcising A Demon | Article I | A Few Left](https://bambubeatrock.bandcamp.com/album/exrcising-a-demon-article-i-a-few-left)**

Compared to most people here, Bambu is a grizzled veteran. A Filipino who grew up in Los Angeles, he's been putting out intelligent, overtly political music for 15 years now, dealing not just with social issues within the US but with broader problems surrounding things like colonialism, authority, child labour, and the immigrant experience. On *Exrcising A Demon*, he grapples with LA gang culture, particularly the way it relates to immigrants. Obviously gang culture is not a novel topic in hip hop, and even more nuanced portraits are fairly common. But I've never encountered an album which tackles the subject with such detail and grounding, that gives a thorough examination of the tragedies involved and the social factors responsible for this climate. A significant portion of the album involves real people simply telling their stories, and through that as well as Bambu relating his own experiences in rap form, the content is consistently gripping.

**[Coops - Life In The Flesh](https://coopsofficial.bandcamp.com/album/life-in-the-flesh)**

Over the last few years Coops has established himself at the forefront of the English jazz rap scene, with his projects *God Complex* and *Lost Soul* especially acting as evidence of his measured, introspective style. But since then he's taken a bit of a dip, and his other 2018 project, *No Brainer* sounds like someone who got fed up with a lack of commercial appeal turning to the lowest common denominator. But only a few months later, he's put out his most ambitious, developed work yet. The concept here is fairly easy to grasp - Coops takes you through one man's life, from birth to death and touching everything in between. It's nothing revolutionary - Undun among others - but it takes a lot of talent to dance with this ambition at all, let alone at the level Coops does. The production is reminiscent of a smoky room, Coops sounds angry and resigned at times here - it's a very bleak album, and that lack of melodrama makes his message all the more powerful.

**[navy blue - yvan wen](https://soundcloud.com/navybluethewaterbearer/sets/yvan-wen)**

navy blue is another product of the blossoming underground scene populated by people like MIKE, Medhane, sixpress among others, and recently gained some traction after guesting on Earl Sweatshirt's ""The Mint"". Generally speaking, it's easy to say that if you're into that sound you'll enjoy navy blue's stuff. But what distinguishes him is the heart his music carries, he's not just impressive lyrically, his content comes across as genuinely endearing. All of that is on full display throughout *yvan wen*, which even at 10 minutes manages to feel like a substantial, fully formed piece of music.

**[Low Leaf - PRiMiTiVA](https://freshselects.bandcamp.com/album/primitiva)**

Low Leaf has always been on the peripheries of hip hop - working with people like Jonwayne and Zeroh - and this EP might be her hypnotic, lush sound at its most refined, equal parts live instrumentation and electronics. In a relatively short time, *PRiMiTiVA* completely envelopes you. There's this grandiose orchestral sound throughout the EP, every sound is clear, the production is full of subtle adjustments here and there, and Low Leaf's voice has an otherworldly quality. One of the most 'beautiful' releases of the year. 

*[Journey to GiGA GAiA](https://freshselects.bandcamp.com/track/journey-to-giga-gaia)*


**[Lorde Fredd33 - NORF: The Legend of Hotboy Ronald](https://newagenarcissism.bandcamp.com/album/norf-the-legend-of-hbr)**

In many ways, Lorde Fredd33 sounds like hip hop's future - a weird melding of the art rap world and mainstream sensibilities, mixing off kilter trap beats with off the wall flows and esoteric lyricism, jumping from sheer ridiculousness to something poignant at a moment's notice. If I had to pick the most well rounded, versatile album of the year, I'd probably go with this one - it's aggressive, funny, relaxing, insightful, jazzy... His delivery sounds like an evolution of people like Pharoahe Monch and Busdriver (with whom he works) - relentless, unpredictable, hitting you from all angles. There really isn't anything this album doesn't accomplish. 

*[NORF](https://newagenarcissism.bandcamp.com/track/norf)*

**[Illingsworth - You're No Fun](https://mellomusicgroup.bandcamp.com/album/youre-no-fun)**

Another excellent addition to the vast Mello Music Group catalogue, Detroit's Illingsworth exists in the same space as people like Quelle Chris, Open Mike Eagle and Denmark Vessey (the latter 2 guesting here) - getting through grave messages about mental health in a deceptively lighthearted way. Most of the album is made up of off kilter alternative hip hop instrumentals, with vocals coming from Illingsworth and the guests breaking through every now and then to anchor the project down. That loose structure allows him to explore things like self esteem and insecurity with adulthood in a way that never weighs down on you. It's always exciting when an album can succeed wholeheartedly on more than one level, and that's exactly what You're No Fun does. 

*[Wind (No Clues)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bznAPI-JPLc)*

**[Lando Chill - Black Ego](https://mmg-lando-chill.bandcamp.com/album/black-ego)**


This is the 3rd of Lando's 2018 collaborations with producer The Lasso, and of the 3 it's the most fitting successor to last year's *The Boy Who Spoke to the Wind*. It mixes the scope and spirituality of that album with the intimacy of his debut *For Mark, Your Son*, and the result is one of 2018's warmest, most textured, 'musical' hip hop albums. A lot of the mainstream is marked by artists who employ 'melody' alongside their rapping, and in that field very few can compete with Lando - his delivery is rich and soulful, he frantically jumps between flows and displays a near-unmatched flexibility. He grapples with themes of Blackness in America - both in how that relates to individual mental health as well as in the way it reflects in society at large - and because of the aforementioned musicality Lando comes across just as much as a successor to Stevie Wonder or Marvin Gaye than as a piece in contemporary hip hop. 

*[Peso (feat. Quelle Chris &amp; Rey)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI8nuhdKyoc)*


**[The Outfit, TX - Little World](https://theoutfittx.bandcamp.com/album/little-world)**

Trap music has dominated 2018, whether it's established acts exploding to a new level of success, the indistinguishable sea of new acts popping up, ""veteran"" acts aping the style in order to regain some desperately craved attention, or even genres of music totally disconnected from hip hop seeking to cash in on what's trending in the mainstream. With that level of saturation and blind commercialism, it's easy to become disillusioned with the scene as a whole. But occasionally something comes along which feels like a genuine progression within the sound, and in 2018 that's The Outfit, TX. It takes a lot of trap tropes and pushes them to their extremes past the point of tedium. The 'darkness' sounds almost demonic at points, the bass heavy production takes on hints of industrial music... It's loud and outlandish, but there's this grounded quality throughout that gives it more depth than its peers. 

*[Money Truck (feat. 03 Greedo)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4oSASFIFuY)*

**[Caleb Giles - There Will Be Rain](https://calebgiles.bandcamp.com/album/there-will-be-rain)**

Caleb Giles plays saxophone in New York trip hop/neo soul/quite a lot else group Standing on the Corner, and that versatility comes through on *There Will Be Rain*. At its base level, the album can be seen as another entry in the ever-growing New York ""lofi"" hip hop scene, but both because of the added musicality as well as the fairly difficult questions posed in the lyrics, it takes on a 'grand' quality that its peers lack. It's not a perfect release - Giles is still young and its clear that there are areas he can improve. But its rare to see something which hits these powerful notes with such ease and regularity, and that bit of imperfection only adds to the charisma and odd charm shown here. 

*[Wondering (feat. Standing on the Corner)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdbZrBvZwoA)*

**[Nocando - Coyote](https://hellfyreclub.bandcamp.com/album/coyote)**

Nocando has spent a fruitful career split between the LA underground ""art rap"" scene and the battling circuit, being as much an entrepreneur (Low End Theory, Hellfyre Club) as he is a rapper. During that time his music hasn't always been at the level of some of his collaborators (for instance his other 2018 release, *MOTH*, is one of the worst things I've heard this year). But on *Coyote* you can hear all his potential fully realised into a set of jazzy, vivid, and emotionally resonant songs, that deal with everything from fatherhood to the suffocation of poverty, all done with incredible maturity and thought. You hear the control of someone who's been rapping for so long and in so many different environments, everything sounds intentional and important. 

*[She Went to War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9pMY-5DUdQ)*

**[AKAI SOLO 無限 力力 - CRUSH EVERYTHING](https://soundcloud.com/soloshift/sets/crush-everything)**

The last few years has seen some depressing trends explode throughout the world - a resurgence of nationalism and right wing thinking, the rise of anti-intellectualism, mass attacks on journalism, and perhaps most worryingly, *l o f i hip hop radio 24/7 - chill study/relax/gaming beats*. Given the cover of *CRUSH EVERYTHING*, as well as the name ""AKAI SOLO 無限 力力"", this project strays frighteningly close to that territory. But what you get instead, is one of New York's wisest, most unique voices. Akai Solo is close to that 'hip hop shaman' Jay Electronica mould, but without the pretension and delusions of grandeur. The defining feature here is composure, control - whether he's grappling with everyday problems or something loftier, there's always a level of balance here. He's captivating without trying too hard, and he makes the array of jazzy instrumentals here sound like they're under his command. 



*[Getsuga](https://soundcloud.com/soloshift/getsuga-proddeadxbeat?in=soloshift/sets/crush-everything)*

**[Four Fists - 6666](https://fourfists.bandcamp.com/album/6666)**

Four Fists are the underground 'Cole and Kendrick' - endlessly teased collab album, but this time it's finally come out. POS and Astronautalis have been putting out some of the most ambitious hip hop of the 21st century, both accomplishing the very rare feet of making rock influenced hip hop in a way that doesn't sound like a trailer park, and this collaboration is the culmination of that - both are older, not as energetic as they once were, but that's replaced by a new level of maturity and world weariness. Both have gone through personal difficulties - notably POS's kidney failure - and on this record you hear a special chemistry that could only have been built up through time. It's the rare album that is both uncomfortably and acutely personal, while keeping hold of a larger scope. Basically, it's a good version of Kids See Ghosts.

Here are my updated top 25 rookies. 

Number 1 is pretty clear now. Number 2 is as well, but the gap between the two is increasing.

As for everyone else, some minor changes but nothing too crazy. One player is steadily moving up and starting to make a name for himself. Other than that nothing too crazy this week.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

|Top 25 + Change from Last Week|Overall Ranking This Week/Last|Comment|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1. Luka Doncic (same)|50/58|With his impressive game vs. the Rockets last night, Doncic cracks the overall top 50 for the first time this season at just 19 years old. In my 2 years of doing this, the only other teenager to do so is Jayson Tatum.|
|2. DeAndre Ayton (same)|62/63|It was an up and down week. The good is he's been a consistent 16/10 player all year. The bad is he got sent to the shadow realm and had his worst game of the year vs. the Clippers last night. Overall though he's still in the top 65.|
|3. Jaren Jackson Jr. (same)|133/139|JJJ keeps his number 3 spot. Mostly a good week, he did get shut down by Toronto last game and still needs to be more consistent but that's improving and his shooting efficiency is going up as well.|
|4. Marvin Bagley III (+1)|139/148|It was a very good week for him and he jumps ahead of Trae Young. 20/17 against GS and followed that up with 18 against Utah. I just had this thought: he was supposed to be a college freshman this year. Can you IMAGINE if Duke had him with Zion/RJ/Reddish?|
|5. Trae Young (-1)|151/146|The comments last week saying he's a worse Brandon Jennings is ridiculous. When just 3 weeks ago the consensus was having him this low was insane. His shooting efficiency isn't good but I mean look at his team. He has serious long term potential and will be fine.|
|6. Wendell Carter Jr. (same)|152/151|Quiet week. Solid rebounding, has shot under 50% the last 3 games though. Not a ton of pressure on him and has room to grow.|
|7. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (same)|156/157|With a nice 13/7/6 game last night, SGA continues to make a name for himself and is just behind Trae and WCJ. He didn't get ahead of them this week but he's right in the mix.|
|8. Collin Sexton (+1)|176/194|Sexton edges out Miles Bridges, and with consistent scoring, he could etch his name in the conversation to move up even more with 15 PPG and the green light to score.|
|9. Miles Bridges (-1)|177/172|A solid 9 point/3 steal game vs. ATL last night. Can disappear sometimes on offense but the team generally gets an energy boost when he's on the floor and his impact has overall been positive.|
|10. Mohamed Bamba (same)|199/196|Bamba holds on to his top 10 spot. He only plays 15-20 minutes a night but in the minutes he gets, he shows serious potential. He could be nasty next year.|
|11. Allonzo Trier (same)|202/211|Overall positive week. A 24/10/7 game vs. Detroit stood out. Up 9 overall spots. He can be a streaky shooter, but he is getting closer to the top 10.|
|12. Landry Shamet (same)|225/229|When I searched his name and the first article that came up was ""dark horse ROTY candidate""...that's too far. Still he's consistently getting minutes on a winning team and shooting a very solid 39% from 3.|
|13. Donte DiVincenzo (+2)|246/244|Is back from injury and in his 2 games back recorded 8 points the 1st game and 3 steals the next. Not flashy, not making a giant name for himself, but he is a crucial part to the Bucks' success.|
|14. Mikal Bridges (-1)|248/240|Last 3 games: 3-17 shooting. Not a good week. But overall it's been a solid start to his career.|
|15. Kevin Knox (-1)|255/243|The good: the physical skills are there, the dude doesn't turn 20 until next August making him the youngest rookie getting serious minutes other than JJJ. But it's been a struggle. A 9/7 game vs. PHI showed positive signs, but he has some ways to go to turn potential into serious production.|
|16. Mitchell Robinson (+2)|259/262|He has a lot of room to improve on offense, but with ridiculous athleticism and 2 BPG as a rookie the Knicks got a mid 1st round value player in the 2nd. The pressure is more on Knox as a lottery pick, less so on Robinson.|
|17. Gary Clark (+2)|275/282|Had some hype being the guy who took Melo's minutes, and he's a very nice high basketball IQ role player. But, Houston is struggling, and he's not the offensive spark plug they need off the bench. Basically I'm saying he has talent but is in a weird role.|
|18. Chandler Hutchison (-1)|278/260|When watching the Bulls, you don't see him much, but he makes 1 play a game where my reaction is ""whoa that is insane talent"". He did get a healthy DNP vs. Minnesota though which didn't help his ranking, but considering where the Bulls picked him it was good value.|
|19. Hamidou Diallo (+1)|283/287|Injured this week, hopefully coming back soon, actually moved up my overall ranking due to movement around him. But he's been a surprise.|
|20. Josh Okogie (-4)|291/250|Good lord at that dunk last night. As far as I'm concerned that is the dunk of the year. That being said, he's not getting minutes other than garbage time right now and that hurts his ranking. But after his impressive performance last night hopefully that changes?|
|21. Aaron Holiday (+8)|293/335|He's good. With Oladipo out, he got a spot for himself in the rotation for now and you can tell he's got the NBA genes. His IQ is, besides Doncic, arguably the best in this rookie class. We'll see if he can stay in the rotation, but I like what I have seen.|
|22. Harry Giles (+9)|301/337|He has looked very, very impressive the last 2 games. 10 points vs. GS in which he made a couple of plays that made my jaw drop. Followed that up with a 10/8/6/4 game vs. Utah. This week was a very, very good step in the right direction.|
|23. Jalen Brunson (+1)|303/318|Smart player who has long term potential as a 2nd string PG.|
|24. Rodions Kurucs (-2)|311/298|Honestly, if I were the Nets, I'd give him minutes. With the team struggling and LaVert out, Kurucs has looked solid whenever on the floor (51 FG%, 43 3 PT %) and there isn't much to lose.|
|25. Grayson Allen (-4)|314/289|Allen holds on to a top 25 spot but barely. After an impressive summer league + preseason my hopes were high. Those hopes are diminishing.|
|The Rest|||
|26. Kevin Huerter (same)|320/323|I like his long term potential a lot. Needs to gain weight but dude looks like a future Kyle Korver if he progresses.|
|27. Elie Okobo (-4)|321/300|He moved down as the Suns inexplicably kept playing Isaiah Canaan over him. That changed, and he put up 19 last night. Stock Rising.|
|28. Robert Williams (-3)|328/321|Should the Celtics play him more? An interesting question that might come up if the Celtics struggle going further into the season.|
|29. Jerome Robinson (-2)|332/325||
|30. Omari Spellman (-2)|334/328||
|31. Deonte Burton (+16)|340/386|Stock Rising. One of the most interesting players to watch in the league. A 6'5 250 LB SG. He has a nice IQ, ridiculous athleticism, and a surprisingly efficient 3 point shot. He is giving the Thunder no reason to put him out of the rotation.|
|32. Bruce Brown Jr (+13)|341/377||
|33. Troy Brown Jr (-3)|345/336||
|34. Jonathan Williams (-2)|347/339||

The real story is the impact of Collins on the offensive unit as a whole. His O Rating per 100 is 118, easily the highest on the team. His ability to score at all three levels and the fact that the opposition is terrified of him in the pick in roll has really opened up the entire offense.

Also, moving baze to the bench has been huge. I was scratching my head on some moves made by LP but that was genius. Let the Ginja Ninja get his minutes with Trae so that they develop, but have two reputable backcourt guys come in (Baze and Jlin) along with bembry, Omari and Alen to stabilize the offensive approach.

I am still full tank mode in my mind but losing by 20 points every night is not good for development. These guys are competitors and they have to learn how to win......maybe just try to keep it under 25 games

After every team made their pick I tried to trade but they were all asking for way to much. So I didn't find a trade but he fell to the 14th pick anyway. So I select him and then watch who this team's draft by the 29th pick I see that the hawks selected Omari Akua. I go and check and both of us selected him.

We are past Thanksgiving and nearly 25% of the way through the season now. Reputations are starting to be fully established for this season and although we still have a long way to go, there are a lot of things that look a lot different than this time last year.

And there is a new number 1. In the 2 years I've done this ranking really the only players who have gotten the number 1 spot are LBJ, KD, Curry. AD got there for like a day or 2 last year, same with Harden. Embiid got there for a day last week but that was all.

Anyways, point is Giannis is someone who could be there longer than a couple of days at this rate. Turning 24 years old in 11 days, this could be a new chapter in the NBA.

|Player|Change from Last Edition|Comment|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1. Giannis Antetokounmpo|\+2|30 point double double's each of the last 3 games, Bucks winning, he's only getting better.|
|2. Kevin Durant|\+5|Durant bounces back to the number 2 spot. Had the best game of his season vs. Sacramento, 28/8/6 averages, he'll be fine.|
|3. LeBron James|\-2|Losing to the Magic isn't good, but he's doing his part and he won't fall out of the top 3 barring a crazy regression.|
|4. Joel Embiid|\-2|There is no question, he is the best center in the game now and it's not close. The man is unstoppable every night at this point.|
|5. Stephen Curry|same|Still injured, Warriors miss him, his impact is clearly being seen, nothing new.|
|6. James Harden|same|Houston isn't where they were last year, but Harden is catching up to his usual groove. 40 points 2 of the last 3 games, the Rockets have problems but Harden is the least of those.|
|7. Kawhi Leonard|\+1|Last 2 games: 27/10, 29/10. Raptors are 17-4, extremely pretty game to watch, and has at this point re-established his superstar status.|
|8. Russell Westbrook|\+1|23/10/9 averages, Thunder winning, there are some issues (1-12 from the 3 point line last game) but he is continuing to play to his strengths for the most part, keeping his value in the top 10.|
|9. Anthony Davis|\-5|AD being number 9 speaks to the depth of the league this year. Improved long range shooting, defense, career high 5 APG. Just needs to stay in a groove with luck (missed last game). Does need to continue playing to his strengths in the paint too (career low .507 2 PT PCT)|
|10. Paul George|\+2|PG gets the last top 10 spot this edition, with the Thunder successful, a career high 8 RPG, and leading the NBA in SPG. He has been fun to watch.|
|11. Kyle Lowry|\+2|A very solid week for him, including an incredible 21/17/12 triple double vs. Atlanta. 15/10 averages for the 17-4 Raptors, and he is just outside of the top 10 this week.|
|12. Kemba Walker|\+4|With 28 PPG, Kembert is establishing himself in the elite category and was at one point in the top 10 this past week. 17-46 shooting the last 2 games knocked him back down, but still in the last 7 days he is up 4 spots.|
|13. DeMar DeRozan|\-2|25/6/6 averages, career high 51% 2 PT PCT, although his 3 point shot that was improving last year is gone and the Spurs are 9-10. Still, has been solid enough to keep a top 15 spot.|
|14. Nikola Jokic|\+5|Him being more assertive on offense is clear, and the dude is 11-40 shooting the last 3 games. So why does he move up? Denver is doing better again, and he makes his teammates better on the floor. And overall on the season 17/10/7 averages. He needs to stay consistent though.|
|15. Damian Lillard|\-5|The ridiculous start he had efficiency wise has regressed to the mean (really below the mean) and Portland has slowed down a little bit. Still, 26/6/5 averages and the team does look better than last year. Lillard keeps a top 15 spot.|
|16. Blake Griffin|\+6|Blake Griffin is on pace to have the best season of his career, a weird career arc where he hit his supposed prime around 24-25, and has now developed his game back to where he looks even better at 29. The Pistons are also 4th in the East currently and with how things are playing out I would say a playoff berth is probable right now.|
|17. Kyrie Irving|\+4|The Good: The obvious game last week, career high in RPG/APG, 22/6/5 averages, he's done his part for Boston. He's not the issue, Boston needs to trade a piece sooner than later to even chemistry out, probably Terry Rozier.|
|18. Klay Thompson|same|Last 3 games: 27/31/31 points. Career high 23 PPG. But also by far a career lor 34% from 3 so far (and a career high 53% from 2). Still has played solid enough to keep a top 20 spot.|
|19. Andre Drummond|\+6|Career high 20 PPG, elite defense, has shockingly expanded his range a tiny bit with 1 3P FG attempted a game. Pistons are 10-7, and they have 2 top 20 players.|
|20. Victor Oladipo|\-3|Has been injured, Pacers clearly have missed him the last couple of games. But he keeps a top 20 spot.|
|21. Jrue Holiday|\-7|20/9 averages, great perimeter defense. He had a bad week shooting wise though which takes him out of the top 20 (and career low 26% from 3 is not good). Still one of the more underrated players but needs to bounce back to stay in the top 25.|
|22. Chris Paul|\-7|He's regressed a tiny bit, and some players have jumped ahead of him, but for a 33 year old PG he is still near elite. 18/8/5 averages with 2 SPG and decent shooting efficiency. Has rested the last couple of games, and they need him because Michael Carter Williams gets playing time otherwise.|
|23. Jimmy Butler|\-3|A slow start to the week (5-16 shooting vs. NO, L to CLE) but bounced back vs. the Nets with arguably his best game of the season and a buzzer beater. He's playing better in Philly overall than he was in Minnesota, I see him moving up the ranking as the season goes on.|
|24. Karl-Anthony Towns|\+4|The result of JB leaving is an increased role for KAT, so far so good as he recorded a 35/23 game and is back in the top 25 (for now). There's still a lot to work on, but he is now the clear leader for this team and he won't have a lack of opportunity.|
|25. Rudy Gobert|\-2|An 18/15/5 game vs. Sacramento last night was probably his best of the year. He gets the last top 25 spot, this Jazz team has talent with 6 clear top 100 players still. Gobert is the anchor, and he's doing his part.|
|26. Tobias Harris|\+6|The emergence of Tobias continues. 22/9 averages, ridiculous shooting efficiency (57% 2 PT, 43% 3 PT), helps his team on the floor, and 34/11 last night in a big win on the road vs. Portland. Just outside of the top 25 but if he keeps this up he'll get in there, and at this pace is a serious all star candidate.|
|27. Ben Simmons|\-1|Playing consistent, 16/9/8 averages, on par with last year, nothing spectacular but is firmly in the top 30 right now.|
|28. Khris Middleton|\-4|21/15/21 points the last 3 games. 19/5/4 averages, game has progressed from last year. Was just simply passed by a few players this past week but still in the top 30.|
|29. John Wall|\-2|His contract likely has him stuck on the Wizards, but it's not all bad. First, the team looks a little better. Wall has a career high 50% EFG, 21/8 averages and he had a solid week, enough to keep him in the top 30.|
|30. Steven Adams|\+1|OKC joins GS and PHI as the only teams with 3 top 30 players, and Adams gets the last spot. This is likely his ceiling, and he struggled vs. Denver. But 16/11 averages and has been a steady force for the Thunder.|
|31. Bradley Beal|\+6|21/5/4 averages, at least 6 assists the last 3 games, just outside the top 30. Man there are some teams he would look really good on if the Wizards are going to trade him.|
|32. CJ McCollum|\-3|21 PPG, doing his part as the 2nd option, better than last year, but Blazers have slowed down a little bit and his efficiency was mediocre this past week. Overall a good season so far still.|
|33. Devin Booker|\+2|Booker continues to slowly progress, with a career high 7 APG and looking more comfortable. still just 22 years old, the 32% 3 PT needs to improve but it's been a good individual season for him so far.|
|34. LaMarcus Aldridge|\-4|Good: 18/11 averages, had his best game of the season with 33/14 vs. Indiana. Bad: Has regressed from last season and 42% FG PCT is really bad. Still, Spurs are better with him on the floor but he needs to stay consistent and although I can see him in the top 30-35 at the end of the year I think he's regressed from top 25 form.|
|35. Pascal Siakam|\+9|Pascal Siakam being a top 35 player seems like fantasy world but here we are. The talent was there early, but the consistency has remained as well. 15/8 averages, and at this point MIP needs to seriously be considered.|
|36. Clint Capela|\-2|29/21 against the loaded Detroit frontcourt speaks for itself. The man is continuing to show he has talent, but Houston's team success needs to catch up if he wants to match his number 28 ranking from last year.|
|37. Serge Ibaka|\+4|My finals prediction before the season was Raptors&gt;Warriors in 7 and I'm sticking to it. I'm going to say it, the Raptors have a better top 4 than GS and are deeper. Kawhi gives them the extra added push they didn't have last year, I think DeMar could have gotten them to the finals but not a serious chance to beat GS. Kawhi gives them that. And barring any injures I think they will.|
|38. Marc Gasol|\+8|This pleases me as a Grizzlies fan, Gasol (and Conley) have both bounced back. They have lost the last 2 games which could have easily been won, but Gasol is averaging 18/10 on efficient shooting and he gets a top 40 spot with his stock trending up.|
|39. Al Horford|\-3|It's been an iffy year for him. He's doing his part in the paint but his long range shooting efficiency has decreased and the Celtics have struggled. He is averaging a career high 1.7 BPG on the brightside and stays in the top 40.|
|40. Gary Harris|\-1|17 PPG, stays in the top 40 although his shooting efficiency needs to be more consistent to move up. Still a solid year overall.|
|41. Eric Bledsoe|\+2|15/6/5 averages, and man he looks incredible in the clutch sometimes. He's taken a backseat in terms of being a primary scoring option but he plays his role well and has a clear spot in the top 50.|
|42. Lou Williams|\-9|A slow week (7-27 shooting the last 2 games) falls out of the top 40, but on the year Clippers are doing solid and Lou Will is a big part of that.|
|43. Jayson Tatum|\-3|16/7 averages and individually has been consistent after a somewhat slow start. He's not the Celtics' main problem.|
|44. Mike Conley|\+9|What an insane bounce back year, and as a Grizzlies fan this makes me happy to see. 20/7 averages, 2 straight double double's, he's back in the top 50.|
|45. Draymond Green|same|Still injured, value the same.|
|46. Jusuf Nurkic|\-4|He's having the best season of his career so far, with 15/10 averages. Injured shoulder vs. Clippers, hopefully not serious.|
|47. Zach LaVine|\+10|I've steadily raised his ranking over the course of the season and he now has a top 50 spot. 26/5/4 averages. Extremely fun to watch. Honestly, the shooting efficiency is bad but I'll be fair it's not like he has much help and he has been a consistent scorer.|
|48. Donovan Mitchell|\-10|The sophomore slump has been real, and honestly it's not really a matter of talent. That hasn't regressed. It's whatever weird chemistry is going on in the offense. Kind of weird, but we'll see how he fits in once he comes back the team looked great last night.|
|49. Julius Randle|\+2|Should the Lakers have kept him instead of Kyle Kuzma for the long term plans? Tough call but Randle looks awfully good this year.|
|50. Aaron Gordon|\-3|Gordon has ""quietly"" made progression. Enough to keep him in the top 50. Shooting efficiency up and the Magic are better. 17/8 averages and the athleticism is still insane.|
|51. Luka Doncic|\+8|His rise continues, making clutch plays and at 19 years old his IQ, we haven't seen since LeBron.|
|52. Josh Richardson|\-4|Still getting buckets, clear number 1 option now, Heat have struggled a little bit and he falls out of the top 50 but a good year overall.|
|53. Nikola Mirotic|\-1|Nikola Mirotic averaging 19/11 wouldn't have been predicted before the year, but he is and is just outside the top 50 right now.|
|54. Nikola Vucevic|same|Vucci Man is in a contract year and he's making his case to get seriously paid. 31/15/7 against LeBron's team speaks for itself.|
|55. Kevin Love|\-6|Still injured, value down.|
|56. Domantas Sabonis|\+6|Sabonis jumps into the top 60, with tremendous basketball IQ and shooting 69% from the field.|
|57. DeAndre Ayton|\+4|Doncic is the obvious favorite on this sub but Ayton is improving as well. He's got talent, put up 25/13 last night, and his ceiling is higher than I thought pre draft.|
|58. Jonas Valanciunas|\-8|Has talent, his role has just changed with the Siakam/Ibaka emergence. But 13/8 averages on the 17-4 Raptors and still puts up solid performances.|
|59. Jamal Murray|\+7|Has been consistent lately, and 22/8/8 vs. the Thunder last night was big. Gets a top 60 spot, needs to stay consistent.|
|60. DeAndre Jordan|same|Mavs look good lately, Jordan still looks solid as well.|
|61. JJ Redick|\-6|18 PPG, making clutch plays, his shooting efficiency is down from where it usually is though. Maybe a sign of age but he still makes plays when it matters.|
|62. Goran Dragic|\-6|Has been injured, Heat clearly miss him.|
|63. Robert Covington|\+5|Dude had a 1-18 shooting night. So how does he move up 5? Still solid on the year and has been a huge plus for Minnesota especially on defense.|
|64. Brandon Ingram|\-6|Ingram&gt;Doncic was not popular last week. That changed, Ingram moved down. That being said, Ingram did look a lot better this week so I'm still giving him a chance to match my high expectations for him.|
|65. Dennis Schroder|\+8|Has been a great fit for the Thunder and is playing consistent, including 32/4/4 against Golden State.|
|66. Paul Millsap|\+4|Has been more efficient than last year and doing his part to help Denver succeed, overall a good season.|
|67. De'Aaron Fox|same|Up and down week (8-25 shooting last 2 nights) but overall still a great year for a player who could be a potential superstar in the next couple of years.|
|68. Derrick Rose|\+15|Stock Rising. And one of the most insane sports stories in recent memory.|
|69. Montrezl Harrell|\+13|Stock Rising. A truly unique player. 16/7 averages, the Draymond of the Clippers.|
|70. Joe Ingles|\-5|Good game last night, he's at least getting his buckets just not having the impact he did last season so far.|
|71. Jaylen Brown|\-7|Unfortunate that he was looking great vs. Dallas before getting injured. The talent is there, hopefully he comes back soon.|
|72. Hassan Whiteside|\-9|2 points vs. Toronto is not good and is on par with the consistency issues that have been there in the past. Overall though, he's been better this year than last still.|
|73. Willie Cauley-Stein|\-2|Started off the week with 23/7 but just 6 points each of the last 2 games. Still solid on the season overall, but he's in the top 75 and has to remain consistent to stay.|
|74. Danilo Gallinari|\+14|Stock Rising. He can be weirdly inconsistent at times (3 points, 0-8 shooting vs. Washington) but on the season he's been clutch with 19/6 averages for the winning Clippers.|
|75. Andrew Wiggins|\-6|Well it was not a good week. Still, 16 PPG and he keeps his top 75 spot for now.|
|76. Myles Turner|\+3|Not spectacular but consistent and solid.|
|77. Marcus Morris|\-5|14 PPG on efficient shooting, individually having a solid year despite the Celtics issues.|
|78. Tim Hardaway Jr|\+2|23 PPG, career high 3 PT FG PCT, steadily moving up the ranking right now.|
|79. Thaddeus Young|\-5|10 PPG, consistent, still solid but not as big of an impact that he had last year so far.|
|80. Otto Porter Jr|\+4|Had his best game of the season last one and solid enough week to move him up and stop a free fall.|
|81. Ricky Rubio|\-5|7-27 shooting the 2 games before last night, but then bounces back with one of the best games of the year last night from him. Doing just enough to stay on the ranking right now.|
|82. Derrick Favors|\-4|Got moved to the bench. Nothing sexy but has been consistent enough to stay here for now.|
|83. Kyle Kuzma|\-2|He's been a little more less efficient than I would have thought with him being next to LBJ, but still 16 PPG and showing off talent.|
|84. Eric Gordon|\-9|Stock Falling. 28 points vs. Cleveland helps but 33 FG PCT and 26 3 PT PCT is not good.|
|85. Caris LeVert|\-8|Still injured + value down|
|86. Jeff Teague|\+3|He had a really good game vs. the Bulls and helps the team on the floor more than hurts them.|
|87. TJ Warren|\+9|Stock Rising. 17 PPG on efficient shooting and has been consistent as well. The team success for Phoenix is not there but Warren is making a name for himself.|
|88. Enes Kanter|\+7|Stock Rising. 3 straight double double's, 21/26 last night, he jumps into the top 90.|
|89. Jae Crowder|\-3|13 PPG, entered the starting lineup and played well. Shooting isn't there efficiency wise but he does other things to help the team, which is why he was made a starter.|
|90. Buddy Hield|\+9|19 PPG on efficient shooting, 28 vs. Golden State, can be a little inconsistent scoring but he moves up.|
|91. Malcolm Brogdon (RE-ENTRY)|\+11|Has been hovering around the edge of the top 100 the whole season but with a solid week gets a nice push. 16, 22, 23 points the last 3 games making clutch plays with nice efficiency.|
|92. Rajon Rondo|\-7|Still injured + value down|
|93. Dario Saric|\-6|Very pretty 19/14 last game, but Timberwolves start has been up and down. Still, I think Saric will do very well.|
|94. Brook Lopez|same|7-24 shooting the last 3 games not good, but the starting C for the successful Bucks and has made a positive impact.|
|95. PJ Tucker|\-3|PJ Tucker has been a bright spot. 8/6 averages on efficient shooting. Team isn't where they were at but Tucker is doing just enough to keep a top 100 spot.|
|96. Jabari Parker (NEW)|\+15|A big week moves Jabari onto the list. 3 straight 20+ scoring games, 16/7 averages, and a top 100 spot.|
|97. Dwyane Wade|\-6|A slow start returning from being out of action but then 35 points off the bench setting a Miami Heat record. Still in the top 100 in his last season.|
|98. Rudy Gay|\+2|15 PPG, keeps his top 100 spot as a bright spot for the Spurs.|
|99. JaVale McGee (NEW)|\+10|I literally cannot believe this, but JaVale McGee is a top 100 player in 2018. But 13/7 averages, has been consistent, and got 7 blocks last game.|
|100. Spencer Dinwiddie (NEW)|\+5|16/5 averages, and a 31 point game last night vs. PHI helps him crack the top 100 for the first time all season.|

My and my friend Savion jumped a guy and got into a huge battle and we built a huge structure in like 7 seconds. My friend Omari stayed back behind a tree and my friend burntboii (don't know his name) hid in the shed. Eventually I dipped and hid with Omari. Me and the other 3 who weren't battling charged forward and Savion got knocked so the 3 of us hid in the fort. I tried to save Savion but right before a guy dropped down and killed him, the guy was running around behind the wall in front of me and eventually burntboii edited a window and killed him. Eventually we had to leave because of the storm and we got into a battle and eventually it became a 2v1, Omari died in the battle so it was me and burntboii against one guy.

Here is my next edition of Top 25 Rookies. There aren't any changes in the top 2 but after another 7 days pretty much everything else has been changed.

&amp;#x200B;

|Top 25 + Change from last week|Overall Ranking This Week/Last|Comment|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1. Luka Doncic (same)|58/62|Good week, in my overall top 60 now and trending up, playing clutch, 19/7/4 averages as a 19 year old.|
|2. DeAndre Ayton (same)|63/67|Playing consistent, 16/10 averages, held his own against Embiid.|
|3. Jaren Jackson Jr. (+3)|139/155|A surprise 3rd. The Grizzlies are winning and he's looking more and more comfortable each week. The learning curve for him is looking quicker than expected and at this current pace a top 100 finish is not out of question if Memphis continues the success.|
|4. Trae Young (-1)|146/143|He has the it factor, he's going to be a player long term, an average player doesn't put up 25/17. I completely agree with all of that. To emphasize though, his shooting averages are worse than where Lonzo was at last year. A top 150 player yes and ridiculously talented but he has to shoot more efficiently.|
|5. Marvin Bagley III (same)|148/147|Last 2 games: 16/8 + 15/13. Good sign. Not the flashiest rookie but in the starting lineup next year he can start making a serious name for himself, and with games like his most recent even this year.|
|6. Wendell Carter Jr. (-3)|151/144|Quiet week. Solid, showed his all around game, the gap between him and the players ahead isn't too big so he's right in the mix.|
|7. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (same)|157/166|Continuing to rise as he has pretty much the whole season and even took Patrick Beverley's starting spot last night. 16 + 17 points each of the last 2 games, and is starting to enter himself into the JJJ/Trae/Bagley/WCJ tier.|
|8. Miles Bridges (same)|172/167|Quiet week, nothing flashy but doing his part for the Hornets 2nd unit and in the overall top 175.|
|9. Collin Sexton (+1)|194/198|Stock rising. Cavs suck, but he's doing what he needs to do and if he can continue to be consistent he will jump up in the rankings. The slow start to the season evens him out right now but I'm noticing the solid play.|
|10. Mohamed Bamba (-1)|196/188|Quiet week, other than a nasty dunk last night. Doing his role in about 15 min a night. Magic doing well, but Vucci Man is too which keeps his minutes limited for now but he's been solid enough to stay in the top 200 the whole season.|
|11. Allonzo Trier (same)|211/204|Had a chance to jump into the top 200 but stays outside. Still the surprise of this class and a solid role player.|
|12. Landry Shamet (same)|229/220|Has still been a solid role player since JB entered the fray. Keeps his number 12 spot for now.|
|13. Mikal Bridges (+3)|240/251|Stock continuing to rise and he jumps up 3 spots on the rookie ranking. 13 + 14 points the last 2 games on efficient shooting and has been a bright spot for Phoenix.|
|14. Kevin Knox (-1)|243/234|Solid start to the week vs. the Pelicans but last 2 games 3-11 shooting and was bumped from the starting lineup. Talent is still there but has to be consistent.|
|15. Donte DiVincenzo (-1)|244/239|Has missed the last 2 games with a minor injury, we'll see if his role in the rotation changes when he comes back.|
|16. Josh Okogie (+3)|250/274|A weird week. Started off with a very solid game, and with the feedback I gave him a big bump. But he was then bumped out of the rotation the last 2 games. The way he's played he deserved to move up but we'll see how his minutes are handled.|
|17. Chandler Hutchison (same)|260/255|Has been up and down. Started off the week with a 0 point game but had 9/5 his last. Overall a good rookie season for him so far though considering where he was drafted.|
|18. Mitchell Robinson (same)|262/260|Kanter took his starting role back but he had a solid 6/5 game off the bench in response. The long term potential is clearly threre.|
|19. Gary Clark (+2)|282/297|Still playing a solid rotation role for Houston and he jumps into the top 20.|
|20. Hamidou Diallo (+10)|287/337|Diallo makes a 50 spot jump in my overall ranking. Has consistently played well and has been a very nice surprise so far.|
|21. Grayson Allen (-6)|289/249|On the flip side, Allen falls 40 spots. But with how the Jazz are playing it might not hurt to play him more.|
|22. Rodions Kurucs (-2)|298/290|Efficient 9 points vs. the Wizards but didn't play the last 2 games. With the Nets rotation, understandable, but when he plays he's been solid.|
|23. Elie Okobo (-1)|300/302|Not in the rotation, has shown talent and we'll see if he gets minutes going forward in the season.|
|24. Jalen Brunson (+2)|318/324|Brunson jumps into the top 25. A nice 8/4/4 game vs. Memphis and although not flashy, high basketball IQ and gets the job done.|
|25. Robert Williams (-2)|321/308|When he's played, has showed some crazy potential. But he's not playing considering he's on the deepest team in the NBA.|

**The Hog's Head, Starboard City**

**Barterville**

Lilith was not sure what a pair of flaming tits had to do with a pig's head, but it made for an easy marker for her new 'friend' to find. Barterville was built and run by inkura merchants and gravpunks in the early years of the magitech rush. The city was carved out from the corpse of an ancient vessel that was split in two. Though anything valuable was scavenged long ago, the inkura managed to make use out of the worn out shell. The city was split into two sections; Port Town where the majority of trading and other transactions take place, and Starboard City that housed the residents as well as the entertainment district. The inkura, themselves, were considered a barbaric species by the elves, but more intelligent than the orks. They resembled their savage cousins with sturdy muscles and large noses. But their ears were the longest of any species and they stood the shortest in the world. They were clever creatures that preferred to use underhanded tactics when fighting (no wonder why they were more known to serve as merchants and bandits). In exchange for a percentage of profits, gravpunks were allowed to utilize the camp to refresh and resupply themselves before returning back into the Orchard.

The Hog's Head tavern was filled with practically every species from elves and orks to the avish and the odd omari here and there. But a human? Lilith had never heard of the species before, and apparently neither did anyone in the tavern as they stared at Eli with disbelief. His features were like a mix of all the races. He was tall and muscular like the orks, but lacked their strong facial features and sickly skin tones (though Eli was not a handsome boy by far). His face had more softer features like the elves and the avish, but his ears were rounded, there were no horns on his head, and the fangs in his mouth were rather blunt. Most believed him to be some mutant changed by the magitech of the Orchard, others thought him to be a really ugly ork (which offended Eli at every mention).

“Alright, so here's my proposal. I don't care what you are, who you are, or how you got here. What I do know is that you know how to use magitech, and that makes you incredibly valuable.”

“Magitech?”

“Yeah, that machine you used when you killed the crew of the *First Dibs*. That's probably why the Empire's 5th Armada came rolling by. They want you. And they will probably cut, slice, dissect, and study you to unlock the secrets of how your magitech works.”

It was a lie, but one that seemed to work on the human. His eyes widened at the thought of his chest cavity being opened for a bunch of elves to take out his organs. And the elves could not care less about the comfort of their prisoners. Eli could survive on his own for a while but not forever. Eventually, he was going to run out of ammunition, he didn't know how to read the language, and Lilith was sure he was very adverse to trying the local cuisine.

“Work for me. I'll pay you an honest wage, I'll teach you about this world, and I'll even try to set you up with one of my friends. In return, you'll protect me and help me uncover magitech hidden out in the Jagged Orchard. What do you say?”

Lilith knew Eli had no choice in the matter.

“What's your goal?” asked Eli.

“To get the fuck off this continent.”

Another little lie.

&amp;nbsp;

**Chekwix Labor Co.**

**Altasia**

**Territory of the Yulji Empire**

&amp;nbsp;

He drank his sorrow away in the little bar underneath the company's trading building. What else was there to do? It was a miracle he made it back to the floating city in the first place. He did not care that his immediate supervisor was pissed he lost the contract as well as an entire *battlegroup*. The fact that something like that machine exists was an affront to life itself. That damned thing smashed his crew as if they were mere *ants beneath a boot*. Markus Franco had numerous broken ribs and a dislocated arm. Though, it was more his pride that hurt than his shattered body. Those men were not his but men hired by the company. Yet, he had to answer for their deaths. Provide hard answers to their wives, their sons, their daughters, brothers, and sisters. Then he had to explain to Ikorik, owner of Chekwix Labor, why he could not complete a contract when he was provided with a frigate and numerous crafts.

Franco waited for Ikorik to meet him in the bar, and as always, the merchant was right on time. He arrived into the bar sporting a simple coat made from the fur of a black beast, and his fingers were missing the usual studded gold and silver rings. Today, the merchant arrived in humble attire fitting of his outward persona. A humble and philanthropic man who practically ran a modern day slave trade. Franco attempted to stand to properly greet Ikorik, but the merchant motioned for Franco to stay still. It was obvious the mercenary was in a lot of pain, and though Franco preferred to show proper customs and courtesies, he was thankful to keep his comfortable posture.

“Mr. Franco, thank you for agreeing to this meeting,” spoke Ikorik.

“It's my pleasure. Where else can I drink myself to comfort?”

Ikorik let out a courtesy chuckle and got right down to business. He pulled out a holodisk and calmly placed the device on the table in front of them. The disk activated with a single touch displaying a similar machine Franco and the men under his command faced. But this one looked older and  damaged compared to the more sleek and pristine machine that assaulted him. However, just looking at the depiction made his chest hurt. He could feel the swing of that arm into his body all over again. Franco downed his drink and motioned for another.

“You need to execute that programmer,” grumbled Franco.

“Then I presume this is exactly what you saw. It is deadly, no doubt. This image is not a work of a wild imagination and programming expertise. It is a still captured from a helmet camera many years ago. Tell me, Mr. Franco, from what you have seen and faced, do you think it can be killed? Could it be neutralized? Perhaps, *pacified*?”

“Domesticated,” grumbled Franco.

Ikorik was playing a dangerous game. The merchant was way over his head and had no idea what he was dealing with. His confidence would be the death of him. Ikorik nodded his head seemingly to no-one and smiled devilishly.

“These metal beasts, these devil walkers, have existed since the beginning of the empire. Do you know the story of Tolland the Great?”

Franco nodded his head. He was not from the Yulji Empire, or even the Midlands, but he knew of the legend. It was an old one where the First Emperor saved the elves by commanding a great beast. Franco was not an educated man, but he was smart enough to know where this conversation was going. The crazy bastard believed he could take command of the devil walker. That thought deserved another drink.

“With all respect, I can't go hunting with you,” spoke Franco. The continuous drinks began to wear him down.

“You don't need to do anything drastic, Mr. Franco. But you have first hand experience. You know what this beast looks like, what it sounds like, how it moves, how it operates. I need you to track the creature. My men will take care of the rest.”

Another drink.

“And I will pay handsomely.”

If this deranged man wanted to go on a wild hunt for some damned devil walker, it was on him. But he was not going to go out there and face that-

“Aurums are nothing to me. I will pay you five times the normal rate now, ten after we capture it.”

Franco slammed his drink and nodded his head vigorously.

“Lemme lay down a bit. Tomorrow, we ride.”

“I need to gather my men first, Mr. Franco...”

“Then we ride!”

&amp;nbsp;

**A Marketplace Within the Starboard Half of a Derelict Ship**

**This Place is Pretty Dope**

**I Think it's Called “Barterville”...**

&amp;nbsp;

The market was absolutely *amazing*. It was not simply a long stretch of road going through the middle of a downed starship. It had numerous shops and vendors that stretched, curved, and *floated* multiple levels above his head, and in some cases, below. Some shops were only accessible by hovering crafts, others one would have to crawl through pipes and shafts, and one particular shop traveled by railway through large tunnels carved by a plasma torpedo. It was here that Eli learned of the different species on this planet and how they interacted with one another.

The orks were strong and muscular like humans. Their fingers ended in sharp looking talons, their heads blunted, and eyes typically sunken into their skulls. They were very barbaric in dress and their mannerisms. According to his horned employer, the majority of orks barely have a grasp on the most commonly used language in the world, “Common Tongue”, and generally exist to cause trouble. The more civilized ones gravitate to barely legal means of employment while the others keep themselves busy by raiding, pillaging, raping, and killing. Funny enough, the females of their species were more dominant than male counterparts. Their bodies were well toned, built beautiful and sturdy with thick muscles and strong limbs. Their faces generally had more softer features like the elves and avish, and their hair woven into fantastic braids and dreaded locks.

Then there were the inkura. Short little creatures that spoke slow and methodically. Their ears reminded Eli of dogs, their faces dominated by a small snout, and wild tufts of hair gave them all humorous mohawks running down to their backs. The human was not sure why Lilith warned him of them. When they spoke to him, they spoke slowly and carefully, always watching him as if they were studying him, always had their hands clasped together. Despite their size, they had their own warriors within their ranks. They rode upon oversized boars carrying electrified spears and axes, others with lever-rifles and some kind of plasma pistol.

The avish, Lilith's species, were the more interesting to him. And despite the inkura being the dominant race in this city, the avish were *everywhere*. They were pretty much humans save for their wild hair and eye colors. The furred tail that swished back and forth like a dog, various shapes and sizes of horns on their heads, and their damn fangs were long. Eli wanted to touch her tail and see if she reacted like a dog, but he figured that would not be something cool to do on your first day on the job.

“Lilith,” came a booming voice.

The pair was stopped by a looming beast of a creature with two heads staring them down. It stood a good fifteen feet tall, had ash colored skin, was absolutely *jacked*, and had two goddamn heads. It slapped its fist into its palms popping every single knuckle possible emitting a sickening sound like tree branches snapping. Its shoulder head slobbered all over the main body causing the main head to become annoyed with the burdensome tumor on it.

“Ahh shit,” mumbled Lilith. “Don't say anything, Eli.”

“Don't say anything?” whispered Eli as quietly as he could. 

“That thing's got *two goddamn heads*.”

Lilith took an innocent posture and looked up to the main head with a coy expression fixed on her face.

“Hey, Ukkon, uh, what can I do for you?”

Ukkon the Giant bent down and poked Lilith's chest with a massive finger.

“You. You owe Jurl'El aurums. You're going to pay Jurl'El aurums. Understand?”

Lilith cursed under her breath as she remembered the loan she took out from Jurl'El for her crotchrocket, then cursed again as her repayment plan was standing behind her gawking at the second head (something the fuhrtar take great offense to). Ukkor squinted at Eli with all four eyes and clenched both jaws tight as he was beginning to become annoyed at the human's rude behavior.

“Stop staring,” growled Ukkor.

Lilith looked to Eli, remembered he was basically an invalid, and quickly translated for him.

“Sorry...” spoke Eli. His eyes were averted for a moment, looked around at the shops, went back to Ukkor, went down to his feet, he glanced at Lilith's horns before returning his gaze back to Ukkor who was busy interrogating Lilith.

“Jurl'El sent me to... stop staring!” barked Ukkor.

“Sorry! Wont happen again!”

Lilith gave Ukkor a nervous shrug. It was obvious that Ukkor had no idea what the Hell Eli was, and Lilith was not going to explain that she had no idea either. Ukkor sighed, rubbed both faces and returned to what little intimidation he had left in this derailed conversation.

“Jurl'El sent me to bring you to the Tube. Come quietly or- STOP STARING AT ME!”

Ukkor raised his fists and roared at the top of his lungs. Eli grabbed Lilith and jumped out of the way as the giant slammed both fists into the ground caving in the cobbled stone. The duo sprinted down the middle of the market with an enraged giant chasing close behind. Lilith wanted to yell at Eli for being so careless, but trying not to be flattened by an offended giant was at the top of her priorities list. Anything that was in the way of the giant exploded as his massive body crashed through the stands and vendors. Eli grabbed Lilith by her jacket and pulled her into a more narrow section of the market where the giant could not fit his body through.

“Should I signal the Black Hammer?” asked Eli.

“No! Don't do that. You turn enough heads as it is. I don't need everyone finding out you can command a machine like that. And by the way, what the Hell was that?!”

“What the Hell was what?”

“Why did you provoke him? I had everything under control.”

Lilith could see Eli did not believe her. He crossed his arms, shifted his weight onto one leg, and gave her a look that read “oh really now?” And that really set her off. But she did not have the time to scold Eli as the sounds of inkura boots against stone alerted them to the front. It seems Jurl'El had sent his minions after them. The little bastards moved past the giant filling the alley with their electrified pole weapons. Eli grabbed his pistol, but Lilith quickly forced him to holster it. Apparently killing them would create more problems than it will solve.

From above their heads, Lilith's crotchrocket lowered itself close enough for both herself and Eli to grab onto the landing skids underneath. Lilith climbed onto the seat and piloted the crotchrocket upwards away from the alley now filled with barking inkura. With Eli still hanging onto the skids, Lilith piloted her way through the busy airways of the market looping through winding tunnels and passing in between heavy traffic.

“Can I sit behind you?!” hollered Eli.

“No. Hang on.”

“Hang on?!?”

Lilith placed her goggles over her eyes and pulled the crotchrocket nose up, its engines spewing hot fire as the antigravity pods overclocked into dangerous levels. Eli had to clip his harness to the undercarriage and wrap his entire body around the skid. Higher and higher and higher the two went passing through the numerous levels of the market until, finally, they breached the top coming to a stop high above Barterville. The human's eyes were fixed on the horizon taking in the sight. Eli had never realized how beautiful this world was.

Mountains that reached the clouds above were speckled with streaks of white at their tops, and at the base of the mountains were dense green forests that reached cascading rivers. Their waters reflected the sky above like thin mirrors that seemed like fissures in the earth to a parallel world. He saw herds of four legged creatures with tall necks grazing by the rivers, flocks of four winged birds whose long beaks resembled spears than anything else, and further to the north were giant stone beasts that lumbered about in a slothful gait. Eli reached out his hand to-

“Hang on... again. I'm out of fuel.”

The crotchrocket sputtered smoke and shook terribly as it began a rapid descent towards the ground. Lilith grabbed the handles and pulled hard in an attempt to bring the crotchrocket into a glide, but bits and pieces of the crotchrocket broke apart from the machine due to the stress it endured escaping from Barterville.

“I'm calling the Black Hammer!”

“No! I've got it.”

“No, you don't.”

“Don't you dare call that machine! I've got this!”

“No, you *don't* have this. You are far from having *anything*!”

The handles pulled away from the steering column. The fins broke apart sending the crotchrocket into a spiral. A fuel pod cracked in half. Oil sprayed from a lacerated tube. Lilith definitely did not have this.",True,False,False,HFY,t5_2y95n,r/HFY,92276,public,,self,,,[OC] Gravpunk (2),,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/9yflpl/oc_gravpunk_2/,,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

**Last editorial’s picks:**

**Kevin Huerter – 2% owned, now 1%** \- Only returned 257th overall value over past two weeks, and saw minutes dip a bit to only 20 mpg. Might need some time in the G-League (Sterling Brown been killing it over there).

**Shelvin Mack – 16% owned, now 18%** \- He's returning #79 overall value in 9 cat over past two weeks, playing in 7 games and averaging 14 points on 54% fg, with 3 rebounds, 3 assists, 1.4 steals and only 1.4 turnovers. Also chips in almost 2 triples a game.

**Terrence Ross – 14% owned, now 47% owned** \- Ross has returned top 70 value (62) over the last two weeks. Averaged 15.5 pts, 3.8 reb, 2 ast, 0.8 stl, 1.8 to and 2.8 triples. Shooting 50% fg. Important role as a leader off the bench.

**Wayne Ellington – 14% owned, still 14%** \- Really only helps in threes (2.6) but also had a steal a game. Ranked 141 overall over past two weeks.

**Aonzo Trier – 12% owned, now 10% -** Provides efficient scoring (13.7 ppg on 47% fg and 85.3% ft) with 0.7 threes, 3.1 reb and 1.3 stl. Also averaged 0.7 blk over past two weeks. Watch out for the turnovers (2.7). Ranked 140 overall over past two weeks.

**Quinn Cook – 6% owned, now 42% -** 77th overall over past two weeks. Helps in scoring (15.2 pts on 55% fg, 100% ft on only 0.5 attempts per game. Averaged about 3 ast and reb a game with decent TO numbers (1.5), and 2.7 triples. Will return to bench when Curry comes back, but that could be another 3-6 games.

**Willy Hernangomez – 5% owned, now 6% -** Returned 94th overall value over past two weeks. 60% fg, 77% Ft, 9 pts, 5 reb, 1 three, 1.2 blk and just 0.8 to. You could do worse.

**Richaun Holmes – 5% owned, now just 2% -** I like his chances to contribute, especially with Tyson out of town. Only 2229th overal value over past two weeks, but an uptick in minutes (\~20mpg) could vault him into usable territory. 55%, 5 pts, 5.6 reb, 0.6 blk, 0.7 stl and 1.6 turnovers over past weeks.

**Juancho Hernangomez – 2% owned, now 4% -** Still gaining speed, but now entered the starting line up instead of Craig. 1.4 threes, 9 pts (57% fg), 5 reb and not much else.  BUT. 25 pts, 9 reb, 1 steal, 1 to and 2 threes with 75/40/71 shooting splits in last game. More good stuff to come.

**Omari Spellman – 3% owned -** Talent is evident. Game is just too up and down so far. Ranked 119th overall over past two weeks, but got 23 mpg and produced 7.6 pts, 7 reb, 1.4 ast and just shy of 1 blk and 1 stl (0.9 for both) while only utrning over the ball 0.6 times a game. FT at 87.5% is great but FG (35.7%) needs to get better. Will keep value when Collins returns.

**Mikal Bridges – still 3% owned** \- Not getting loads of value from him yet, and Josh Jackson has even seen some more minutes these past few weeks. Yet, Bridges should be a big piece of their future, as he plays well with Booker and Ayton. 174th overall value over past two weeks, with averages of 1.1 three, 7.4 pts, 1.3 reb, 0.6 ast, 1 steal, 0.6 blk and 0.9 TO. 44%fg and 100%ft.

Here’s what I did right last night:

Tony Parker/Jeremy Lamb/Marvin Williams stack really came in and saved me. The three game slate is usually the most difficult for me to get a payday on, and these three guys really helped me out. They combined for 89.1 FanDuel points, and they were my value players. I really was only 5.7 points above my beat the score mark and I think I can thank them for my winnings tonight.

Here’s what I did wrong:

Not playing James Ennis. As I was prepping my lineups I was swamped with work from school, so I had to divert my attention and wasn’t back online until 8:30pm, so I missed my opportunity to play Ennis. I had set Omari Spellman, which, for lack of a better phrase, had a garbage game. Zero points and a turnover with just 14 minutes on the court?

Here is my updated top 25 rookies. The last update was 8 days ago, there are a lot of big changes. Also a new number 1.

&amp;#x200B;

|Player + Change From Last Edition|Overall Ranking This Week/Last|Comment|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1. Luka Doncic (+1)|62/71|Luka takes over the number 1 spot. Making clutch plays, 20/7/4 averages, efficiency improving, stock trending up.|
|2. DeAndre Ayton (-1)|67/61|Talent isn't the question, I do think the questions pre 2017 season about his motor are showing up a little bit. But him and the new coach, there's a clear disconnect, and considering that coach was hired under the old GM, he gone after this year. Or at least he should be.|
|3. Trae Young (+2)|143/154|The margin for the players 3-5 is incredibly slim, but Trae Young finally jumps up to number 3. Sure his efficiency needs to improve, sure the Hawks aren't the most talented team, but the long term tools are there for him to be special. He's far better right now than De'Aaron Fox + Dennis Smith Jr were last year for example.|
|4. Wendell Carter Jr (same)|144/153|Did move up 9 spots on my overall ranking and is playing consistent. I stand by my pre draft Derrick Favors with a consistent 3 point shot prediction, which if healthy is a consistent top 50 player in his prime.|
|5. Marvin Bagley III (-2)|147/141|Trae Young + WCJ finally jump ahead but Bagley has been a solid rotation player for the winning Kings and has overall helped his team on the floor more than hurt. Still 19 years old, and even more developed next year to combine with De'Aaron Fox that's a scary thought.|
|6. Jaren Jackson Jr (+1)|155/167|JJJ is creeping up on the ranking, only 8 overall spots behind Bagley. Let me emphasize this: he will have JUST turned 21 at the start of his 3rd NBA season. Would like to see the long range shot improve but his big man skills are far advanced for his age and he held his own on offense against Rudy Gobert last night.|
|7. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (+1)|166/186|Stock rising, big time. Up 20 overall spots from 8 days ago. Last 3 games: 18, 16, 19 points. Efficient shooter, at this rate depending on how the rest of the season goes he could even finish as high as 3rd on this ladder.|
|8. Miles Bridges (-2)|167/164|The Hornets are winning, he's only playing 21 minutes a game but don't get it twisted he is a HUGE part of this team's success. He brings a clear energy boost to this 2nd unit that they did not have last year.|
|9. Mohamed Bamba (+1)|188/192|It was a solid week. Although shut down last night, scored 15 points in each of the 2 games before and made a couple of 3's. This is a learning year, but IMO still has one of the highest ceiling's in this class.|
|10. Collin Sexton (-1)|198/190|He has talent as a scorer, is efficient (43 FG PCT, 40 3 PT PCT), still only 19, can be a top 100 ish talent by the time he is 21/22.|
|11. Allonzo Trier (same)|204/224|At 22 years old, he was ready for the NBA. He's up 20 overall spots from last week although the last 2 games his rotation minutes were reduced a little bit. Still, on the verge of cracking my overall top 200.|
|12. Landry Shamet (+2)|220/232|Good 10 point game last night, efficiency isn't ideal but he makes important shots. Although with the way Furkan Korkmaz is playing I'm interested to see who the odd man out becomes once Jimmy Butler enters the situation.|
|13. Kevin Knox (same)|234/226|Is healthy now and scored 17 points last game and 12 the game before. Still doesn't turn 20 until next August, some real potential here.|
|14. Donte DiVincenzo (+1)|239/246|Still a crucial rotation player for this Bucks team that is one of the best in the NBA. Even when he's not scoring he is helping his team out in other areas.|
|15. Grayson Allen (-3)|249/225|Stock Trending Down. I like the energy he brings when on the floor, but with the way the rotation is the other players are just better. Not to say Allen isn't talented, but Alec Burks/Royce O'Neale are simply just more advanced.|
|16. Mikal Bridges (+2)|251/273|Stock Trending Up. Up 22 overall spots from last week and despite the usual Suns mess, he has been a bright spot. I would honestly just go ahead and start him there is nothing to lose at this point.|
|17. Chandler Hutchison (-1)|255/255|I really liked him last night, 9 points/9 rebounds that was by far his best game of the year. He is a fun player to watch.|
|18. Mitchell Robinson (-1)|260/270|Did move up 10 spots on the overall ranking. A 9 block game will do that, he has serious talent and just needs to continue working.|
|19. Josh Okogie (same)|274/277|With Jimmy Butler gone I can see him being in a more comfortable role, and he has a nice game last night.|
|20. Rodions Kurucs (same)|291/299|With the unfortunate Caris LeVert injury I can see him potentially getting more minutes.|
|21. Gary Clark (+19)|297/NA|He cracked the top 40 last week, but when your the reason Carmelo is going to leave the team you've made a name for yourself. Anyone who posts on r/NBA_Draft knows this guy was the darling of their forum pre draft so this doesn't totally surprise me.|
|22. Elie Okobo (+3)|302/313|You have nothing to lose starting him over Isaiah Canaan.|
|23. Robert Williams (-1)|308/307|He is an athletic freak of nature, if big man injures happen he is ready to step in.|
|24. Kevin Huerter (-1)|317/309|I am still in love with his long term potential as a potentially elite shooter, but shooting 1-11 the last 2 games isn't doing any favors short term.|
|25. Jacob Evans (-1)|319/311|He keeps his spot in the top 25 for now.|

The current talent disparity in the NBA is extreme. Teams like the Warriors have 4 top 20 players while teams like the Nets and Cavs have likely no one inside the top 50 (sorry Caris you'll be there soon). It can make for a pretty lopsided league at times. This got me thinking, what would the league look like if it was completely even? And how do I go about finding out. Well simply put I conducted a snake draft using the entire leagues pool of talent, ignoring injuries to see what I might end up with.

Rules were pretty simple:

- This is for a hypothetical 1 season winner takes all year. No value is placed on ""potential"" or expected decline

- Draft for talent first, then fit. Most teams ended up with 1 all star/superstar and a whole bunch of role players. Trying to make everyone fit is very difficult but it worked surprisingly well. For example, a guy like Nikola Vucevic, who is a good offensive player, but a poor defender ended up paired with Covington and Thad Young at the forward spots to help try and compensate for his weaknesses

- The objective is to win a championship. Basically, there are a ton of good role players who just would never see the floor in a finals series because they either cant defend or space the floor alongside stars. When evaluating players, this is what I focused on

- This also meant I was only going to draft 8 players per team, to create a hypothetical ""playoff rotation"" for each team. I've added in the list of the most obvious players I couldnt find a home for, and there is some good talent there, but a lot of it was hard to fit

- Dont read too much in to the starters as some teams have some talented bench guys that I drafted before I filled out a starting lineup for some teams i.e. Will Barton is on the bench for team 14 but is undoubtedly a starting caliber player

- I ignored a lot of team chemistry type issues. Some guys have bigger egos than others etc etc but this is too much to account for in this kind of hypothetical

- Of course I should mention this is all based on my opinions, everyone evaluates talent differently and I'm sure everyones hypothetical drafts would end up completely different

- For most teams their bench is a guard a wing and a big of some description

- Here's what I ended up with:

**The Extras**

These were just a few of the names I considered for various teams at the end. Plenty of options and there are plenty I havent listed. A lot of these guys are easily talented enough (Hollis Jefferson/Udoh/Ntilikina/MKG) but also have glaring weaknesses that made them hard to fit in to teams.

Final thoughts

- I'm not posting a draft order (didn't record it either) because thats not really the point of the exercise. But I was very happy with the results in the end. Most of the teams are pretty good, but all have at least a hole or two that make them vulnerable.

- 2k is a pretty bad simulator at times but when I simulated a few seasons every team ended up with a winning % above .37 and below .61 which was kind of reassuring

- No surprise the Lebron team won the championship in most simulations. I expect this is how it would be in real life as well. Looking at what Lebron did with the Cavs team last year its pretty apparent that Lebron and shooters is a viable championship contender and I dont think any other superstar in the league can do as much as he can with role players around him

Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, West released his debut album The College Dropout in 2004 to widespread critical and commercial success, and founded the record label GOOD Music. He went on to experiment with a variety of musical genres on subsequent acclaimed studio albums, including Late Registration (2005), Graduation (2007), and the polarizing but influential 808s &amp; Heartbreak (2008). He released his fifth album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy in 2010 to further rave reviews, and has since succeeded it with Yeezus (2013) and The Life of Pablo (2016), as well as full-length collaborations with Jay-Z and Kid Cudi.",True,False,False,Kanye,t5_2r78l,r/Kanye,220604,public,,self,,,Kanye Omari West,,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kanye/comments/9vbyoj/kanye_omari_west/,,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,,,

They have a potential superstar in Trae Young and they could have another one if they nail the draft this year. They also have many really good young 3 point shooters in Kevin Huerter Omari Spellman Taurean Prince Deandre Bembry and obviously Trae Young. All of those guys could be 40 percent shooters from behind the 3 point line. Also don't forget about John Collins the perfect roll man to Trae Young. Plus they also have the Dallas Mavericks pick assuming it isn't a top 5 pick. The Hawks could pick a good wing (Rj Barrett Nassir Little Cameron Reddish) with their own pick and a big man (Bol Bol or Daniel Gafford) with the Mavs pick. Then their lineup would be Trae/Barret/Prince/Collins/Gafford with Huerter Spellman Bazemore and Bembry coming of the bench or they could go Morey ball considering how much shooters they have and they could trot out a lineup of Trae/Huerter/Barret/Spellman/Collins with Gafford Prince Bazemore and Bembry coming of the bench. Both of those lineups are good enough to make the playoffs in the next 2 years especially in a weak Eastern Conference.

For those who don’t know. Omari who plays Ghost on Power had a “feud” with a fan who wanted to take a picture with him . The fan turned to be a black woman. After that they went back and forth on instagram and all that and then Omari went in the breakfast and the fan situation was discussed. He talked about “acknowledging his wife” (who’s white) and how she held him down blabla. 

 
 

 
 See black men? When y’all do clown shit it come back and bite all of y’all (y’all, y’all sons, y’all uncles, y’all nephews, y’all cousins all of y’all. 
 
   

 I personally think that his “she held me down “ blabla was a response to what happened on Twitter where people dragged Tfk outta his wife. I ain’t gonna be mad at him defending his wife and be like “she’s there” because some women regardless of race really be soin the most. There’s women out there flirting with married people  in doesn’t of their wife and I’m sorry but 7 billion people on this planet there’s no reason for being thirsty. I ain’t gonna be mad at him for clapping back at the fan cuz sis this a human like you. With his family. Like, stop putting these celebrities  on a damn pedestal y’all ending up with y’all feeling hurt. 
 
 
 
 
 But I’m not gonna feel bad for black men in this situation. I’m sorry but the reason why y’all can’t date whoever y’all want it’s because y’all mad dit that way. White women  ne don’t go off on white men for dating outside because you don’t see white men putting down their own women. Like dead ass I saw a post saying « Dear Hispanic Men, Y’all never getting your  women back , sincerely niggas. ». Like where’s your dignity? Even other races sees it . I remember  seeing a post idk which one and there were black women going hard I think it was a post about some black man dating white woman or whatever and there was black women going hard i don’t remember if it as in a “another one dating a white girl?!” Type of hard or “you should do better than that” type of hard but I remember specifically seeing all the non black people asking “why do y’all keep hogging hard for them?”
Even non black women pointing out that black men don’t even like black women like that and they don’t understand why black women going hard for them. You know you’re wrong when everybody sees that sum ain’t adding up.
 
 
  Side note: I think black women need to stop putting these black men on such a high pedestal. Shows them that they ain’t the only snack in the world. Too many ugly black men feeling confident because they know that we put them on  pedestal. Yes Killmonger was nice and all that he was cute (him and Omari ain’t even that cute smh Christie was right when she said the media were conditioning us into thinking that average (average y’all not ugly) blakc men were all that) but at the end of the day he’s a whole actor and he ain’t irreplaceable. 
 
 
 
Side note2: I don’t think we should be that hyped when we see black or even non black men dating black women. But with the foolishness going around that became somewhat some sort of unhealthy habit I can’t even be mad.
 
 

 
 Side note 3: Stop supporting women who exploits you either it’s Cardi B (wether you think she’s black or not she still did a black Cardi and claimed black when convenient  ) or that non black girl who be acting like a stereotypical black women saying nigga and using you as “my black friend”.

They have a potential superstar in Trae Young and they could have another one if they nail the draft this year. They also have many really good young 3 point shooters in Kevin Huerter Omari Spellman Taurean Prince Deandre Bembry and obviously Trae Young. All of those guys could be 40 percent shooters from behind the 3 point line. Also don't forget about John Collins the perfect roll man to Trae Young. Plus they also have the Dallas Mavericks pick assuming it isn't a top 5 pick. The Hawks could pick a good wing (Rj Barrett Nassir Little Cameron Reddish) with their own pick and a big man (Bol Bol or Daniel Gafford) with the Mavs pick. Then their lineup would be Trae/Barret/Prince/Collins/Gafford with Huerter Spellman Bazemore and Bembry coming of the bench or they could go Morey ball considering how much shooters they have and they could trot out a lineup of Trae/Huerter/Barret/Spellman/Collins with Gafford Prince Bazemore and Bembry coming of the bench. Both of those lineups are good enough to make the playoffs in the next 2 years especially in a weak Eastern Conference.

I am writing to make a proposal, one that is essential. It concerns someone who is seemingly almost always in the public eye. An individual who has been in the headlines recently. This individual is none other than rapper, record producer, fashion designer and conversation starter, Kanye Omari West. While I was reading the coverage of his presidential meeting, something occurred to me. What if he just was no longer able to speak? Wouldn't that change everything? Not just deactivating his Twitter and Instagram accounts, but the man himself? He seems beyond help at this point. By removing his lips, one is doing a favor to not only the general public, but the man himself.
It is no secret that Kanye is a controversial figure. He always has been, going back to 2005 when he famously said the words ""George Bush doesn't care about black people"" on live TV. Then, at the VMAs in 2009, he caused a stir as well. While Taylor Swift was receiving the award for ""Best Female Video"", West rushed the stage, grabbed the microphone and proclaimed that the video for Beyoncé's song ""Single Ladies"" was one of the best videos of all time. This incident even got attention from then-President Barack Obama, who called Kanye ""a jackass"". Oh, how things have changed since then. After countless rants during interviews and concerts, we arrive at this year. It all began in May, when at TMZ's offices in Los Angeles Kanye West claimed that slavery was ""a choice"", and said other inflammatory things about black people in America and about President Obama. Later in the year, during an interview with the music magazine The Fader, he said that there were only 800 slaves in the 1800s. That number is closer to four million. He did these things all while wearing a ""Make America Great Again"" hat in support of President Donald Trump. Trump is a controversial man himself for his own reasons. Nonetheless, the two men met, along with NFL Hall of Fame member Jim Brown, in the White House in October of 2018. West claimed that the MAGA hat (and his support of Donald Trump) made him feel ""like Superman"". With all this in mind, would it not be better if Kanye West could no longer speak? Sure, it would render him unable to rap, but he would no longer be able to make harmful statements that add to the cesspool of a pro-Trump diatribe. Furthermore, his comments about slavery and the 13th Amendment of the Constitution intensify a white supremacist revisal of history. A pro-Trump Kanye contributes negatively to the cultural zeitgeist, which is as volatile as ever. A good number of Kanye's numerous fans and supporters take his word as gospel, which has become problematic in this year. As such, silencing him seems to be an enticing and necessary action. West can focus his efforts in other musical areas.
Throughout his entire musical career, Kanye West has always been an amazing producer. Think of all of the producing he has done over the last twenty years. Jay-Z would not be the legend he is today without Kanye making beats like the ones on ""Hova"", ""Lucifer"", ""Run This Town"", and so on. Jay-Z is far from the only recipient of West's fantastic production: Drake, Lil Wayne, Travis Scott, A$AP Rocky, The Weeknd, John Legend, and Madonna just to name a few. Just this year, Kanye produced five studio albums almost entirely by himself. Pusha-T's ""DAYTONA"", his own album ""ye"", a collaboration album with Kid Cudi ""Kids See Ghosts"", Nas's ""NASIR"" and finally Teyana Taylor's ""K.T.S.E."". Sonically, all albums were fantastic and received high praise from critics and fans alike. His producing chops are not to be questioned. Kanye receives the most praise when he says nothing, and lets the music speak instead. The best way for him to stay out of trouble and out of the news is for him to be behind the glass.
    Now, I'm sure people are worried we would miss out on more Kanye albums. His discography is essentially classic after classic (with the exception of Yeezus and 808s and Heartbreak, according to some). It is understandable to worry about new albums not being released. There is a reasonable explanation, however, to not fear this. West is notorious for his work ethic, once rapping ""lock yourself in a room, doing five beats a day for three summers"". He's been said to work for days on end, with little to no rest. If this is true, then there surely must be an absolutely massive vault of unreleased songs that he has. There's no telling how many albums could be compiled using all that music, but it is likely in the double digits. Once Kanye's lips are removed, he will certainly have enough material to release to the public.
    Oh, and there's no need to worry about Kanye's finances. With tens of millions of monthly listeners (nearly 40 million on Spotify alone), the streaming money will be more than enough to sustain his lifestyle. Not to mention West's high-end clothing line, which sells clothes for hundreds of dollars and shoes that resell for upwards of a thousand dollars. His wife, Kim Kardashian West has a beauty company valued at hundreds of million dollars, and a net worth of around 350 million dollars. Being unable to rap will not effect Kanye's life or his pocketbook.
A mute Kanye will do just fine for himself, and will continue to be able to shape the music world for years to come. Unable to vocally support Trump, he will lose interest in politics and immerse himself in music, taking his production talents to new heights. This procedure would only benefit the world. Removal or not, West must think about the impact his statements have on the young people of the United States.

For me I think it is fun I think it’s an exciting way to look at players. Along the same lines of filling out a March Madness Bracket. You can be completely wrong but it’s still fun to do.

I find the unabashed homerism to be annoying for every local broadcast for any team, but it's understandable, I suppose. Our announcers take it a step further by barely crediting the players who are on our own team and making huge contributions or out performing our expectations in big ways. 


Like when Omari and Kevin Heurter are having their first decent game against Cleveland maybe mention that for more than 2 seconds? Or how Taurean Prince has looked amazing so far and his ability to self create has jumped forward by light-years out of nowhere?

The 15th seeded Hwaks drafted Oklahoma phenom Trae Young in this year’s NBA Draft. Young quickly stole the hearts of basketball fans across the country with his Steph Curry-esque range and unworldly playmaking. The Hwaks also bolstered their shooting by drafting Kevin Heurter and Omari Spellman. With Taurean Prince and John Collins expected to take a step forward, this young team will surprise NBA fans and sneak their way into the playoffs in a weak Eastern Conference.

Klay Huerter

Trae Curry

Omari Green

&gt; Kent Bazemore understands why the Atlanta Hawks draw comparisons to the Golden State Warriors. The Hawks' general manager, Travis Schlenk, spent five years as the Warriors' assistant general manager and 12 years with the organization. In June, Schlenk's front office drafted a pair of guards with deep range -- Trae Young and Kevin Huerter -- in the first round. Atlanta's new coach, Lloyd Pierce, even spent a year in the Bay Area, developing a relationship with Stephen Curry when the two-time MVP was in his second season.
&gt; 
&gt; ""A lot of people have a hard time of looking where people came from and then they try to compare us to who they are now and see if we can get there,"" Bazemore told CBS Sports. ""And there are a lot of comparisons. Kevin is feeling his way around. Trae is a dynamic scorer. Omari Spellman may be the biggest steal of this class when we look down the road three to five years, and then you look at a Draymond Green -- we came out together, he's definitely the biggest steal in my class if you look at it. You can go down the list; you see a ton of different looks and a ton of different comparisons. Travis knows the model of what it took to get to where they are and I'm sure he's following it step by step.""",True,False,False,nba,t5_2qo4s,r/nba,1452576,public,,self,,,Kent Bazemore: I get the Warriors comparison with the Hawks.

**Trae Young:** Whew boy was this a welcome development. His passing is far and away his best trait - casual 33-foot game winners are just an added bonus. While it would be nice to see his finishing at the rim improve, he's already far more poised than he was in Summer League. He has the ball on a string and already has a great understanding of how to shift gears to keep defenders off balance (something that took Schroder several years to add to his game). 

**Taurean Prince:** So far Prince seems to have picked up where he left off last season. His offensive game just keeps improving. The question will be whether or not he can reach his defensive ceiling, where he struggled last season. The instant offense of Trae Young should help ease some of the offensive burden.

**Alex Len:** aka the 7'1 Kyle Korver. Len hit more 3-pointers in 5 Hawks preseason games than he did in 5 years in Phoenix. He also threw down some monster dunks, rebounded and protected the rim. When Dewayne Dedmon returns from injury he may find himself coming off the bench if Len keeps this up.

**Deandre' Bembry:** I ALWAYS BELIEVED! This is the player that Bembry stans like myself thought he could be. He's worked hard to improve his 3-ball and he looked great as a secondary playmaker. Now I just need him to stop fucking driving the lane and leaping into the air before looking for someone to pass to (I'm pretty sure he gets 2 turnovers per game like this). He should have a spot in the rotation if he stays healthy.

**Kent Bazemore:** Really just a solid all-around preseason for Baze. He looks more comfortable with the ball in his hands. In fact, I don't remember a single time this preseason where he dribbled the ball off his foot! He consistently made solid, efficient plays on both ends of the floor.

**John Collins:** It's hard to take much from this sample size (he only played two games), but the Baptist looks primed for a breakout season. He'll miss the start of the season with a foot injury, which is always scary for big men, but he's so bouncy that he should be able to bounce back no problem.

**Tyler Dorsey:** aka small Mike Scott. That boy will shoot the ball, but luckily he's a pretty good shooter. He'll have games where he scores in bunches and games where he'll brick 5 threes. He also averaged 9.4 rebounds per 36, which was behind only Plumdog Millionaire and Alex Len. He seemed quicker with the ball in his hands this season, which should keep defenses honest.

**Jeremy Lin:** He steadily improved literally every summer league game. He's a good player when he's healthy, and hopefully he can impart some veteran point guard wisdom to Trae Young. Maybe Coach Pierce will get weird and we'll see some two point guard lineups in the future.

**Alex Poythress:** Poythress is the first two-way contract signed by the Hawks that I'm actually excited about (sorry Josh Magette). He looked like a mini, pre-Kardashian Tristan Thompson. I'd love to see more small-ball lineups with Poythress playing center.

**Vince Carter:** V E T E R A N L E A D E R S H I P. Players like VC are invaluable in a locker room. Young teams like the Hawks need a guiding presence, lest they end up like the Timberwolves. We haven't had a veteran like Carter since Elton Brand gave us 7 minutes of diving after loose balls every game.

**Omari Spellman:** This guy is effort personified. He's a great rebounder and a surprisingly good passer for a big man. He's been touted as a shooter but his shots aren't falling yet. He may not have a spot in the rotation to start the season, but he already has a spot in my heart.

**Miles Plumlee:** lol

**Jaylen Adams:** Probably not going to see much time in a Hawks uniform this season. He looked good as a shooter but not much else. 

**Kevin Huerter:** Right now Huerter isn't ready for the NBA game. He's got good size and a proven track record as a shooter, but he frequently looked lost on both ends of the floor.

　　当“嘴炮了得”的美国总统特朗普，遇上说唱机关枪，会发生什么？一向只会抢别人镜头的特朗普，似乎被抢镜了。

&amp;#x200B;

　　据英国《卫报》报道，当地时间10月11日，白宫椭圆形办公室来了一位知名说唱歌手——坎耶·维斯特（Kanye Omari West，侃爷）。报道称这是为特朗普和侃爷在白宫举办的“名人兄弟情”。那场面，“有诅咒，有拥抱，还有一段奇怪的独白，感觉它永远不会结束”。

&amp;#x200B;

　　滚石杂志的网站将其描述为“有史以来最疯狂的椭圆形办公室表演”。

&amp;#x200B;

　　美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）表示，侃爷滔滔不绝的独白，连特朗普都无语了。

&amp;#x200B;

　　特别是当记者问到侃爷会竞选总统吗，特朗普好不容易插话说“很有可能”。但立马被侃爷打断，表示自己要选也在2024年选，不会在两年后和特朗普竞争。

&amp;#x200B;

　　

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

　　

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

　　侃爷一直是一个比较高调的特朗普支持者。11日，他被邀请到白宫讨论制造业、监狱改革和帮派暴力问题。他戴着特朗普标志性的“MAGA”小红帽（Make America Great Again），坐在特朗普的办公桌前，边上围满了记者和摄影师。

&amp;#x200B;

　　但媒体的大部分目光似乎都聚焦到了这次会面的“搞笑”，而不是正题。

&amp;#x200B;

　　侃爷几乎用了大部分的时间花式表达自己对特朗普的喜爱。

&amp;#x200B;

　　他在特朗普面前狂喷自由派：“自由派好玩的一点就是，自由派会用‘种族主义’的概念来控制一个黑人，因为他们知道我们是很有自尊有情感的人。如果我对一个自由派人士说‘我喜欢特朗普’，他会说‘哦，可他是种族主义者’。”

&amp;#x200B;

　　他几乎要咆哮了：“你认为种族主义这词能唬住我了？这可阻止不了我，这就是道空气墙。”

&amp;#x200B;

　　侃爷还打起感情牌，谈到自己的家庭：“我的爸爸和妈妈分开了，所以我家里没有太多的男性能量。我结婚后的家庭，你知道，也没有太多的男性能量，但是，这也很美。”

&amp;#x200B;

　　“我爱希拉里，我爱所有人，对吧？但是作为一个经常见不到爸爸的人，她的竞选并没有让我觉得，我是一个可以和儿子玩传球游戏的人。”

&amp;#x200B;

　　“但是当我戴上这顶帽子的时候，我觉得自己像个超人。你创造了一个超人。那是我最喜欢的超级英雄，你为我做了一个超人的斗篷。”

&amp;#x200B;

　　侃爷会竞选总统吗？

&amp;#x200B;

　　有记者问到，侃爷会是未来的总统候选人吗，特朗普回答说：“很有可能。”

&amp;#x200B;

　　不过，很识时务的侃爷突然插话，表示自己不会在2020年和特朗普竞争：“那得2024年后了。我们不要再为未来担忧了，我们真正拥有的就是今天……特朗普现在正站在他的英雄之旅中，他可能不希望有一个像坎耶·维斯特那样的疯狂的混蛋来竞选，但是，最好相信，我们要让美国变得伟大。”

&amp;#x200B;

　　我们能不能不要空军一号了？

&amp;#x200B;

　　更让人大跌眼镜的是，侃爷还在全世界面前暴露了自己的手机密码：000000！

&amp;#x200B;

　　

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

　　他掏出手机是为了给特朗普展示苹果公司支持的氢飞机iPlane-1，看来侃爷似乎很了解特朗普的喜好。他还给别人展示：“这才是我们总统应该坐的专机，你们看看。”

&amp;#x200B;

　　

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

　　

&amp;#x200B;

特朗普：“哇哦！哇哦！”

&amp;#x200B;

　　特朗普开玩笑地说：“我们能不能不要空军一号了？”

&amp;#x200B;

　　

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

　　

&amp;#x200B;

“我们能不能不要空军一号了？”

&amp;#x200B;

　　最后，侃爷猝不及防站起来给特朗普来了一个拥抱。他说：“我爱死这个人了，我要给他一个拥抱，让我在这里给他一个拥抱！”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; JERUSALEM - The United Nations agency that supports Palestinian refugees withdrew some of its international staff from the Gaza Strip on Monday, saying it was concerned for their safety, a statement from the organization said.

&gt; &amp;quot;UNRWA today decided to temporarily withdraw part of its international staff from Gaza following a series of worrying security incidents affecting its personnel in the Strip,&amp;quot; the agency said.

&gt; UNRWA said its director of operations and other international staff would remain in Gaza and that its operations continue there.

&gt; A source in Gaza said 13 international staff were withdrawn and six more remained in the Strip.

&gt; &amp;quot;Earlier today, a number of staff were harassed and prevented from carrying out their duties by individuals protesting recent measures resulting from UNRWA&amp;#039;s challenging financial situation,&amp;quot; the statement said.

&gt; Hani al-Omari, a local UNRWA employee, told Reuters that dozens of people whose jobs were recently cut or reduced had gathered outside a hotel where they heard UNRWA international staff were meeting, some surrounding the vehicle of one of them.

We all thought this was a date. It's not. It's a code and must be treated as such. Over the last 30 hours I've been doing an in-depth analysis in order to break the code and reveal the meaning behind the message. 

After spending too long trying to decipher the code behind the numbers I began looking for different routes to decipher the meaning. When all possibilities are equal, the simplest explanation has a high tendency to be the correct one, but that's not always the case. This is not a date, combination, or set of numbers. The numbers actually represent letters. 

The letters correspond to the numeric value of the letters of the English language. 92918, or alphabetically, I-B-I-A-H. After diving in to potential meanings I have landed on this:

Intergalactic

Brotherhood

Interstellar

Astronomical

Harmonizers

IBIAH is short for the Intergalactic Brotherhood of Interstellar and Astronomical Harmonizers. 

But it goes beyond that. 92918 requires a summation to reach 56. [Messier 56](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_56) is a globular cluster in the constellation Lyra. From this one can surmise, that the Brotherhood meets in the constellation of Lyra.

You might be thinking, okay that is pretty cool, but wait there's more. [In Greek mythology, Lyra represents the lyre of Orpheus. Made by Hermes from a tortoise shell, given to Apollo as a bargain, it was said to be the first lyre ever produced. Orpheus's music was said to be so great that even inanimate objects such as trees, streams, and rocks could be charmed. Joining Jason and the Argonauts, his music was able to quell the voices of the dangerous Sirens, who sang tempting songs to the Argonauts.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyra). 

I think it's pretty obvious that the above description also can be applied directly to Kanye. 

During more in-depth analysis, I realized Messier 56 was discovered in 1779. What historical event took place in 1779 that may be connected? 1779 just so happens to be the year [Jean Baptiste Pointe Du Sable established the first Non-Indigenous settlement of chicago](https://worldhistoryproject.org/1779/jean-baptiste-pointe-du-sable-establishes-first-non-indigenous-settlement-of-chicago). You know who else is a Non-Indigenous settler of Chicago. That's right, Kanye Omari West.

From all of the above information I believe we can draw some conclusions. First and foremost, the album has been delayed because Kanye is working to perfect the album with the IBIAH, the Intergalactic Brotherhood of Interstellar and Astronomical Harmonizers. Due to the vast distances of space, the final copy of Yandhi was delayed because communication took slightly longer then expected. Yandhi will also contain a connection to Earth and nature through the charming of inanimate objects, similar to Orpheus. So the album will represent inspiration for the future and the past, space travel, nature, and a throwback to Kanye's roots in Chicago.

It was all so obvious all along. We were just looking at it wrong. Yandhi will drop as soon as transmission is complete.

#The Short Rotation

**PLAYER**|POSITION|
:--|:--|
DAMIAN LILLARD|GUARD|
VICTIOR OLADIPO|GUARD|
JOE INGLES|WING|
AL-FAROUQ AMINU|WING/BIG|
DEANDRE JORDAN|BIG|

BENCH:

PLAYER|POSITION|
:--|:--|
TERRY ROZIER|GUARD|
JON SIMMONS|GUARD/WING|
STERLING BROWN|WING|
DAVIS BERTANS|WING/BIG|
TRAINING CAMP HERO|BIG|

This is the core rotation, obviously I need another big (see below). But in general, I aimed for a very switchy, very good to elite defensive potential, with a very good to elite offensive potential. See, the way I figure it, if you are really good at offense, AND really good at defense, you're gonna win more games. Here is my plan: 

Step 1: Get very switchy and versatile and deep team that has an elite offensive ceiling and an elite defensive ceiling. 

Step 2: ? 

Step 3: Spend a lot of time on DKC talking about them until I make sure everyone hates them because I talk about them so much. 

##PROBLEM!: BUT YOU NEED ANOTHER BIG!!

The problem is, I don't have room for him. I'm currently housing a lot of wings I think will be pretty damned good, so the bigs suffer. Also, DeAndre Jordan IS that 30 mpg 'Dunks N Defense' guy, and in today's NBA you really can't afford to have more than 2 of them on your team. I anticipate Jonah Bolden emerging as that 2nd big but if not, they're easy enough to come by. 

Other Guys On My Roster: De'Anthony Melton, Landry Shamet, Omari Spellman, Vince Edwards, Kenrich Williams, Davis Bertans, Torrey Craig, Ben Moore, Jonah Bolden, Juancho Hernangomez, Zhaire Smith

_______________________________________

##Some Thoughts That Matter To Me: 

**1) Damian Lillard Loves Portland But Everyone Loves Talking About How Someday He Might Not.** 

&gt; Lillard has embraced his role in Portland not just as the star player, but also its face. While Aldridge left the Rose City each offseason to return to his Dallas-area home, Lillard has moved his family to Portland.
&gt; 
&gt; “Dame is not a guy who abandons ship early in May when the playoffs are over,” Blazers general manager Neil Olshey said. “He’s got his family here, he lives here full time. He’s here 12 months out of the year.”
&gt; 
&gt; Lillard, who grew up in Oakland, has bought into Portland as a home in a way no star player has since perhaps Porter, whose children grew up here, and who remains in the city as the head coach of the University of Portland.
&gt; 
&gt; “My family is happy here,” Lillard said. “I’m happy with my situation here.”

That's who Damian Lillard actually is. But every month or so someone floats an idea (Lakers have been big lately). If the IRL Blazers don't come out hot, look for 'Is Dame seriously happy?' stories to become legion. 

**2) Victor Oladipo is perfect in every way and cannot be overestimated**

This one is worrying to me because there are so many 'Victor Oladipo is primed for another huge jump...', 'Victor Oladipo doesn't sleep, he just trains with his eyes closed', 'Victor Oladipo shits good gym sessions' stories out there that I'm starting to think we're cresting the wave of a public backlash to the not-so-young buck. Victor, I believe in you. 

**3) DeAndre Jordan in Dallas....What's Up With That?**

I'm extremely optimistic about DeAndre in Dallas. I think he's been miscast since CP3 left LA, and he'll get a chance to shine and be himself. I've got a lot of eggs in this basket. 

**4) Everyone Knows How To Shoot Until The First Game**

Look, just about everyone has awesome shooting videos from the summer. But like, I NEED some of these guys to improve. Sterling Brown, Jonah Bolden, De'Anthony Melton...these guys need to make bucks for me. 

_____________________________________________________________

##IRL Training Camp Battles To Watch

1) Jonah Bolden vs Mike Muscala
   
* Jonah is the frontrunner for my 3rd big position. I think he's more ready than other people. I haven't really got much of a backup plan. 

2) Jon Simmons vs Magic Youth
  
* Jon Simmons is the best player on the Magic. He's not really a great player though in the grand scheme of things. He's a good player, on a good deal, on a team that desperately needs its young players to develop. If he's shelved or benched or whatever for Gordon and company early on, that sucks for me. 

3) Landry Shamet vs all other Philly backcourt bench players
   
* Landry Shamet has a chance to steal regular season minutes from day 1 on a winning team. Most rookies can't do that. All Shamet has to do is run, shoot the lights out, and be better than Jerryd Bayless. Not that hard. 

4) Omari Spellman vs Hawks Youths
    
* I'm equally excited about this. Omari Spellman is drafted as 'the next Draymond' by the guy who drafted 'the actual Draymond'. Atlanta has a stud in John Collins but I think everyone can eat. Except Alex Len. Fuck that guy. 

5) Sterling Brown needs to be electric! 
    
* Not funny. You better not have laughed at that. But seriously, Sterling Brown by the numbers should be the starter in Milwaukee. If he can grab that, oh man! 

6) De'Anthony Melton vs the haters

* Melton was a highly ranked player on my board and was one of the best rookies in Summer League. He's also playing for a team without a starting caliber point guard. He's also on a 'prove it' 2 yr contract. To me...this means.....AWESOME

7) Juancho Hernangomez vs Trey Lyles, Torrey Craig, Tyler Lydon

* Juancho as a rookie was better than all these jerks and I hate Mono. But honestly, this is year 3 of Juancho. he needs to show up and seize the carp. 

__________________________________________________________

##FAKE DKC TRAINING CAMP BATTLES

Landry Shamet vs De'Anthony Melton

* While there is room for both guys long-term on my team, only one guy will likely see the floor this season. 

Kenrich Williams vs Vince ~~Staples~~ Edwards

Boots Riley's debut doesn't offer an easy answer, but through the absurd, he reminds people what normal is and that what people do in their lives matters.

Cassius ""Cash"" Green (Lakeith Stanfield) finds the only job he can get, telemarketing for RegalView, but, naturally he starts with getting hung up on. That is until this black man develops his ""white voice"" (dubbed by David Cross), starts hitting that quota hard, and the ball starts rolling.

Riley starts off with a fast script that pushes Cash from the cubicle to the private office quickly, but it's a fun ride as calls literally drop Cash and his desk into the homes (and dinner times) of his customers. Riley makes the smart choice of keeping the two parties on the line disconnected. They're not looking at each other, but at their phones, and in Cash's case his call script, just trying to get what they need from each other. A little commerce never hurt anybody.

Except that it could. As Cash moves up and starts getting supervised by a Mr. \[Bleep\] (Omari Hardwick and white voice dubbed by Patton Oswalt), the means of production are peeled back and reality sets in. It puts Cash and the audience in an understandable position. How long and how hard are people willing to work in an exploitive industry, in an exploitive, unjust world?

*Sorry to Bother You* will age gracefully, if it ages at all, but it is very much a Post-Trump film that examines what's been accepted over the last two years. For all the fighting on the front-lines people are doing, others are crossing picket lines because being poor is worse than being harassed by rioters. Cash is able to maintain his connection with the audience because of Stanfield's performance and those around him, especially his girlfriend Detroit (Tessa Thompson). She's a fully fleshed out character, with lines she will cross and lines she won't, and she knows what it takes to stand up for something. She's lights up the screen with a great look that reflects needed rebellion in times of modern, compromised-based, millennial hardship.

The costumes in *Sorry to Bother You* are very distinct, with standout suits, performance art pieces worn by Detroit, an eyepatch, the works. With cinematographer Doug Emmett, Riley speaks volumes through what's just in-frame. He's shouting, but not screaming, the audience picks up what they're comfortable with. For instance, some will notice that sets may have a *Get Out* vibe. Hallways often feel claustrophobic and there's rarely room for characters to breathe in these places. And when there is room, it's because Cash is in the center of that room, with all eyes gazing, curious about his next move. Others will have something else in mind. Sit back, enjoy it, but please come away with something.

On *Last Week Tonight With John Oliver,* after the 2016 election, Oliver said ""Keep reminding yourself this is not normal,"" knowing that not everyone would be directly affected by the coming policy changes. Riley is saying the same thing, but bringing it to the neighborhoods because it was only a matter of time until everyone was affected. After the madness passes, will things become and stay normal or will the cycle just restart?

For people feeling frustrated with the world around them, watch this film. If it stirs up anything more than the laughs it promises, run with that. At least talk about it with someone.

*Sorry to Bother You* is 4.5/5, a near masterpiece.

Okay enjoy here is the summary 


Also LP=Lloyd Pierce (head coach) TS=Travis Schlenk (Gm)

LP just said John will be at the 4 a majority of this season. Talked about that being his natural position and how that is important to his development. Said he wants to see Omari at the 5.


Schlenk said singing Len was because of his rim protection and his ability to set screens, as well as him being a 25 year old who can still develop.


 They just said measuring success will be based on constant improvement and development, compared that too John’s ability to shoot towards the end of the season.

Both said their is no pressure/pain onto them heading into the season


Patience is being preached by Lp and TS.


Positive culture is being preached, LP talked about only winning 10 games in Philly, talked about how growth is more important than wins for a rebuilding teams.



LP talked about how success starts at the top of the ownership all the way down to players.


TS said he expected to not be able to sign Len, said he was a target who “Fell through the cracks” and took the opportunity to sign him. Talked about he still believe Alex can contribute


LP talked about how all 3 of the rookies have worked hard on and off the court, said he was impressed on how receptive they were to staff, the city, and teammates.


Lloyd says Vince Carter has took Bembry and Kevin huerter under his wing


Vince carter is expected to bring veteran leadership while playing a little bit says he doesn’t want to gas him but vince will play this year.

Evidently the one of the worst teams last season (24-58), Atlanta comes into this year hoping for an improvement – or at least, I hope they are. It’s a different looking squad to that which the Hawks began the 2017 season with, featuring signings such as Jeremy Lin, Vince Carter, and Alex Len. More predominantly, the franchise also features a new coach in Lloyd Pierce – taking on his first Head Coach role after successful assistant jobs at the Cavaliers, Grizzlies, and 76ers. Will he be able to turn this franchise around? 



Yes, the Hawks have picked up some household names in Carter and Lin. Yes, the Hawks (for some reason) decided to trade down in the draft from the 3rd to 5th and chose to select a household name in Trae Young. Yes, they’ve got a new coach, plans for a brand new stadium, a young squad, and [momentarily had Carmelo Anthony on their roster](https://twitter.com/ATLHawks/status/1027589388547629057/photo/1). But in case you weren’t aware, let me be the first to tell you:

**The Atlanta Hawks probably won’t be making the playoffs this season.**

You could argue the point that the Hawks are a “team for the future”, and I wouldn’t disagree; however, they’ve picked a bad time to ‘tank’ when you consider that [this season is the first with flattened draft odds](http://www.tankathon.com/pick_odds). Essentially, this year, the top (or bottom depending how you look at it) four teams will have the same 14% odds of getting the #1 overall pick, compared to the top team having 25% in past years, whilst lower teams will still have a chance to leapfrog into that position. Being the worst team in the league no longer has the overall benefit that it once did, and unfortunately for Atlanta, that’s still roughly where their squad sits.

**Personnel Changes &amp; Free Agency**

The Hawks let go of one of the better coaches in the league last season in Mike Budenholzer, who’s taken up residence in Milwaukee – a team almost in the exact opposite position to 2018 Atlanta. Although they’ve taken a gamble on a potentially good rookie coach in Lloyd Pierce, it’s more likely than not that this staff turnover isn’t enough for immediate success. 

(On a personal note, I think it’s important not to judge a new coach too early on, particularly when taking over a cellar-dweller franchise such as the Hawks. Give Pierce a proper chance and reserve judgement – he deserves it)

Similarly, the free agency signings made by the Hawks aren’t anything to write home about.

* Once a star in the league, Vince Carter is a solid veteran presence who will probably get some decent minutes, but Carter signing with the Hawks is most likely the beginning of his long foreseen retirement tour.

* Alex Len was given a lifeline by Atlanta – his current two-year deal is a make-or-break in my books; he has potential, but there’s too many question marks over his decision-making and consistency.
Jeremy Lin’s become somewhat of a league journeyman. He’s on his fourth team in just as many years, and is coming off a season-ending knee injury at 30 years old. If he recovers some form, he’s possibly a decent rotation player.

* Possibly the biggest move of the offseason for the Hawks was waiving Carmelo Anthony. Great move, great decision. 

It’s not all doom and gloom though; if you’re looking at factors capable of changing a franchise, look no further than Trae Young – an entirely polarising rookie and contentious draft pick that most fans will have their eyes on this season. [Here](https://theunderhand.com/underhand-verdict-summer-league-edition/), I talked a bit about Young’s performance in his first scrimmages.

Young was pulling up regularly from DEEP beyond the three-point line without any semblance of hesitation. As a Hawk, his confidence was sky-high; it’s a matter of reining in that free-will in proper NBA contests. 
He shot 15/55 from 3pt territory (27%). If you take out his 7/13 performance against Chicago, Young shot 8/42 (19%). It’s a initial worry, but long-term shouldn’t be a problem.

Young was known for his scoring ability in college, sure. However, his ability to read the court and get the ball to the open man is second-to-none. Keep an eye out for his playmaking this season.

Quite honestly, it’s too early to determine bust status. Most fans are going to expect too much, too soon, and this year isn’t any reason to come to a conclusion. Let Young get some proper coaching and playtime with elite-level talent under his belt, running some more intricate offensive-schemes, and limit the deep three-point bombs. If he still can’t keep up with the game, is a liability on defense, and three seasons later still is a streaky shooter, then we can start that discussion. Until then, sit back and enjoy the highlights – he’s a potential franchise changer.

**Squad &amp; Player Development**

Looking at the remaining players in the roster, there’s plenty of room for player progression this season. 

Kent Bazemore is one to watch, and resides as not only as one of the most experienced players under contract, but also one of the most talented. Admittedly, averaging 12.9/3.8/3.5 isn’t exactly all-star quality, but he’s a nice piece for a team in rebuild territory. He’s generally quite consistent defensively, shot just under 40% from 3pt, and used his league experience to act as the leader of the franchise. For Bazemore, it’s a matter of continued improvement; a focus on playmaking and consistency in scoring would be good additions. To be completely honest, I wouldn’t be surprised to see him traded before the deadline – more specifically, to Houston. He’s a prototypical D’Antoni player; quick offensively, catch and shoot capable, able to play off-ball as well as on when needed. If not, then the Hawks still have a decent quality player on the books.

My personal favourite on the team has to be John Collins. He had a fantastic rookie season, averaging 10.5/7.3, and displayed an eagerness to compete. Collins is a fantastic athlete for his size, and showed plenty of hustle on court; most importantly, he showed progressive potential for stretch-big play in the future – something that Summer League seemingly confirmed.


Although he’s decent on-ball, he’s not a playmaker – but that’s fine. He needs a bit more polished post-play, and an ability to read the defensive switches, but he has time on his side. Expect some good play this season from Collins.

Dewayne Dedmon found some range in his game this past season. The 29-year-old big man shot 35.5% from 3pt range; regardless of the small sample size (only 50 makes), it’s a welcome addition to both his game and to the Hawks. We should see another solid season this year, probably again in the 10/8 range.

Taurean Prince is another interesting young piece on the Atlanta roster. He found himself in a position of seniority last year, and will probably have less of a burden this coming season. If he can keep playing intensively on the defensive end and hitting 38% from 3, the Hawks may have a solid 3&amp;D specialist on their hands.

Atlanta selected Omari Spellman with the 30th overall pick this year, and he has some good showings in Summer League. Although he looked sluggish at times, he showed legitimate stretch-four potential, and was solid on the boards too. Don’t expect too much this season, but look to the future.


**Biggest Off-Season Move**

To wrap things up, let’s have a look at the Schröder trade. In a three-team deal, the Hawks gave up Schröder (OKC) and Muscala (76ers), in return for a protected 2022 first-round pick and Justin Anderson. If you look at this trade from face-value, it sounds like a bad deal; let me tell you, it’s probably better than you think.

Although Schröder was the young starting PG, he wasn’t a true foundational piece, and in a league dominated by strong point-guards, he probably isn’t good enough to be a franchise cornerstone. He averaged 19/3/6, yes, but not the way you would’ve liked him to. The only competition he had for the offensive reins was Bazemore, who evidently settled for second, but Schröder didn’t live up to the opportunity. Too many of his shots were misses from close, he shot 29% (!!!) from 3pt, and although assist totals might suggest he knows how to facilitate an offense, there are plenty of better options out there. To top it all off, he’s one of the worst defensive guards in the league – you don’t even need stats to know that one. He’s much better suited to his potential role in OKC this season, but we’ll get to that.
Moving Schröder gives Trae Young all the room he needs, and in the eyes of the Hawks, that’s what matters most.

I’d be inclined to argue that the deal Atlanta had Muscala on was great value for money; unfortunately, moving him was simply a repercussion of moving Schröder, and to get a future first-rounder in return is probably a good haul. Sorry Mike!

Altogether, the Hawks just aren’t a solid enough squad to truly compete in the weak Eastern Conference; when your best offensive player averaged a shade under 13ppg, it’s a telling sign. Yes, there are some solid pieces and progression from players, but for Atlanta, it’s a matter of looking to the future, and this is one of the key rebuilding seasons.
