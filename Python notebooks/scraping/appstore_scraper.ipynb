       "  'review': 'Seeing a person\\'s profile on Vampr is such a repelling experience. As an actual music professional trying to find session musicians, Vampr makes it as difficult as possible in their UX. All the useful information (like audition video) is only visible if you tap on a card full of relatively useless info (like \"lives in some random town in Canada 3000 miles away\") and then scroll past a LOT of extraneous visual clutter that doesn\\'t provide useful info to collaboration seekers to finally reach useful content (audition video, services, bio). In other words, you have to tap and scroll on every single person as if you WERE proactively interested in them just to get to content and information that will help you discover whether you ARE interested in them. If Vampr ran Tinder, they\\'d have you go on a coffee date with everyone on the platform and then decide which one you want to go on a coffee date with once you\\'re done with that. It\\'s just such a backwards way of having people swipe through a stack of contact cards. The devs need to pretend they\\'re an actual musician trying to sift through the millions of people in the world who might be useless to them, and set a timer for 15 minutes, and pretend they have a deadline to record their song in exactly 15 days, and then look at a real live users contact card and look at every single piece of info on that contact card and ask themselves \"what does this info ACTUALLY help me to do right now regarding determining whether this person is a fit for my project?\" spoiler alert, the answer is \"nearly nothing\" for everything on the contact card except for \"view profile\", so we can conclude that it is backwards. \"profile\" should appear first (with all of the bottom sections on the top) and the profile page should have a tap button to view what is currently the \"card you swipe through\". I can\\'t believe i don\\'t get paid for this sort of advising.\\n\\n(p.s. i know there are people out there who are seeking \"nearby people to physically collaborate with\" and thats why you need a user question early in the sign up / swiping process that prompts the user to declare whether physical proximity is more important than functional compatibility. In the case of the former, the current card swiping pipeline is (barely) more user-friendly, but for the latter, it\\'s useless and requires every user to do three times the work of tapping / scrolling / swiping / thinking / analyzing than they should have to.\\n\\nBut they sure do make it easy to sign up and pay them money, which is fine, but i\\'m just saying if the information and connections that the app could provide its users was as front-and-center as its monetization hooks, Vampr might be useful enough to warrant a subscription.',\n",

This is the biggest thing holding this app back. \\n\\n- - - \\n\\n2) iPhone X support -\\n\\nNot very difficult to update and will go a long way in terms of professionalism and app support.\\n\\n- - - \\n\\n3) Improving the way you connect after swiping right -\\n\\nI have 412 notifications from artists who have \\'connected\\' with me, but only like 30 or so messages from those who have actually reached out. I believe it would improve the app if the list of \"connections\" and the list of \"messages\" were separated in the app as it gets pretty jumbled up mixing the two together. It would also be great to be able to separate the connections that you added with the connections who added you. \\n\\n- - - \\n\\n4) (suggestion) Replace the \"Favorites Artists\" tab with something of more substance -\\n\\nVery very rarely have I looked through this  part of someones profile when deciding to connect with them or not and yet this is the first thing you see. I think this would be a cool place to allow for a longer description of \"What are you looking for?\" or something similar. Just a suggestion!\\n\\n- - - \\n\\nHope this helped the app developer or whoever. This app is very close to be great and I\\'m excited to see it continue to grow!',\n",

The biggest problem I have is I get ghost notifications that people are replying to me and still not one person has responded to me nor sent me a message and I'm starting to believe that I'm getting responses and they're not appearing in the app, making this app completely useless.

Only downside is the lack of engagement among users and I think this entirely due to the swipe left/right UX. It really doesn‚Äôt encourage interaction among users and feels like a dating app. I think this is the wrong approach. Here‚Äôs some things that could help improve this app:\\n\\n- Rooms or groups to share music that encourage interaction would be awesome, like SoundCloud groups were back in the good days.\\n- Some type of reward system for interacting on the app that encourages users to be more active.\\n- The ability to post more than two songs on your profile would be great. The choice of one SoundCloud link and one YouTube link is not enough.\\n- A song feedback and follower exchange platform could be fun and helpful for a lot of people and could encourage interaction. Unfortunately SoundCloud closed their API long ago.\\n- Collaboration tools. A bulletin board with ‚Äúremix this sample or loop‚Äù, ‚Äúrecord a drum beat to this guitar loop‚Äù, ‚Äúput an instrumental to these vocals‚Äù where people respond with an example of their skills. You could virtually tryout for a band! Go a step further and put successful collaborations done by 2 or more Vampr users in a Spotlight where others can listen and comment and see ‚Äúsuccess stories‚Äù.\\n\\nI get that the swipe structure was a good MVP but Vampr could actually be really cool with some of these features, instead of just Tinder for musicians.',\n",

Thank you for noting that the app reviews are improving. If you have seen our crowdfunding campaign or read our regular blog updates you will note that we have addressed the need to fix some bugs and that in order to do so we need additional capital. It's chicken and egg stuff unfortunately. When running a startup with a small team and on a lean budget things don't always operate as smoothly as, say, Facebook. But we do our best, and thank you for noticing this. Addressing one of your specific points: you can indeed search through all genres. In Discovery Preferences simply remove or loosen your genre search restrictions. With respect to your comments about how a social network like Vampr might launch or operate, we thank you for taking the time to weigh in. The reality is we aren't experimenting on anyone. We are doing our best (the <5 of us who work on code) and respond to every piece of feedback on all forums. Vampr is free to use - this has helped us grow the largest platform of its kind, but it means we have limited resources. That you personally had a bad experience is regrettable however we could have handled this more respectfully and effectively over email rather than a negative review about our crowdfunding campaign on the App Store. Nevertheless, I remain reachable and would love to help resolve your issues at info@vampr.me. Of course I can't promise a resolution but I can promise to do my absolute best. As always, Josh\",\n",

So, I decide well I will contact them to let them know I‚Äôm getting nowhere. The contact page is blanked out grey and a throbbing Vampr triangle logo sits there over it. It‚Äôs been doing that now for about an hour. It‚Äôs locked up. I noticed 2 years ago you were getting buggy app reviews. The the more recent reviews seemed to be getting better but not for me. \\nMaybe there is an option for a feature to just scroll through every genre we want to and search on our own that would be nice.if there is I did not see it. You would have to impress me more than you did to get me as an investor. When start ups  realize their customers time is more valuable than theirs and experimenting with customers time could be detrimental to the future of the company and the product should work somewhat before it goes to market we will all be better off.',\n",
