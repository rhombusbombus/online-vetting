It's a small and intimate venue with a bar and a second floor. The staff were really patient and kind. I went to see Olivia Dean earlier this year and atleast when I went the venue and staff had an organized process going and everyone seemed to have a great time.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1665360000000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Cute small venue with friendly staff and bartenders. I love that you actually get a good view of the artist, and there's a tiered balcony upstairs.Bathrooms were super clean.$10 card minimum.Affordable drinks for the area!

Went here to see The Breathing Room on Aug. 25, 2023 around 8pm (amazing!) with some friends and the audience that it attracted was great.However, the bouncer was very rude. I, unfortunately, didn't have an online ticket and they only accepted cash for walk-ins. Thankfully, there was ATM inside past the bouncer. When I tried to walk toward the ATM to get my cash, he forcefully yanked me away and told me I need cash to pay for a ticket to do so.How am I gonna get cash to pay for a ticket if you won't let me walk towards the ATM? I had to ask others to go to the ATM for me just like this other girl next to me while we waited.Understandable that they want to ensure no one sneaks in, but invading my personal space with unwarranted physical contact was rude and unnecessary; a simple verbal warning or compromise\\/agreement would have been much more appreciated.Visuals were great and the venue was pretty packed but it was nice to have different levels to watch the performers! Bouncer overstepping boundaries definitely hurt my experience here.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1702166400000,\"ReviewContent\":\"I'm not sure they are booking or doing concerts?

Wtf???? I wasnt even attending the event. I was simply passing by and talking to my friends. I surely hope there's some sort of compensation to be had because that was $3.25 down the drain. I have never frequented this place and after the treatment I had, I will never come back. You have no respect for people or their personal belongings. You are disrespectful. I will never give this place any sort of patronage. I can literally see my drink on the sidewalk from this rogue bouncer.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1635638400000,\"ReviewContent\":\"It was a nice, intimate venue. Friendly bar staff. Spacious general admission area, cool balcony up top. My only complaint is the roof was leaky. I kept feeling drops of water from the ceiling while watching the show. Otherwise a cool place\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1634947200000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Just went for the Miley night. The dj wasn't very good. The workers were so focused on masks when their own staff wasn't even wearing theirs. Kind of annoying when they're tapping your shoulder every minute, but you look over and the check in people and dj weren't even wearing theirs. They should also focus more on the bathrooms and work on playing good music. Because that was trash. They had the opportunity to make it fun but focused on the wrong things. Hope next time is better\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1632182400000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Terrible experience. Poor communication from the venue to the customers. Flew out to San Fran, spent well over $1000 in travel costs to see my favorite band, showed up with my vaccine card (as required) and was denied entry due to my vaccine not being the preferred dosage\\/type of vaccine. Ridiculous, staff was unable to provide help besides contacting the ticket service. That can be understandable, but there was no sincerity in the miscommunication and lack of communication. I wish I would have known and been informed of the expectations before spending my saved travel money to come here. Not worth it and really wished for better service.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1627603200000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Decent music but terrible service. I've had better customer service from motels; the bartenders are horribly rude and snappy. I asked for a drink after just initially walking in and was immediately met with attitude from the get go. And it wasn't from a single bartender as 2 different ones i went to were extremely short with me. Not a terrible experience but the bartenders here wouldnt make me want to visit this place a second time.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1618876800000,\"ReviewContent\":\"We here for multiple concerts. They were both so sick and fun. These types of venues are 10x better than a big venue. I am under 18 and they let me in fine with an x on my hand. Really sick spot.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1582416000000,\"ReviewContent\":\"While I was waiting in line, the staff got into a fight with another customer behind me after the other customer made a comment about their ID\\/alcohol policy. He was not rude; just asked if he really needed to have X's sharpied on both hands to show that he was not allowed to buy alcohol. He was taken out of the line to the side.After my friends and I entered the first floor was packed, and there was no order. People were constantly pushing each other to get to the front. Then, half way through the show, a fight erupted on the floor where a man smashed his glass against a woman's head (I think because she spilled beer on him). Chaos ensued. The fight went on until the performer actually stopped and asked if something could be done. Then finally the security guard came to break up the fight....Police cars parked outside the venue as I left.Disgusting management from start to finish. I will never come back again.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1579910400000,\"ReviewContent\":\"A great place for a smaller\\/ more intimate show! Came here for a concert and was able to get right at the front of the stage. You can either stand in the lower area or stand\\/ sit in the upper area--the lower area goes very far back so don't arrive too late otherwise you will be far from the stage. The lower area has a bar, where they have beers on tap and they also had a cocktail special named after one of the performer's songs. They also have an upper area which is a decent size--the regulars seem to go straight up there and grab a seat on the couches and chairs. The seats are good if you don't want to be down below where you will be tight standing next to people.I like that a Rickshaw Shop is walking distance from Civic Center bart! Maybe a 10 min walk. As always be careful walking at night and try not to walk alone. If you are looking for a dinner beforehand, Cala is right next door to Rickshaw. I have never been but I've heard good things (you should make a reservation beforehand).Enjoy!\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1575676800000,\"ReviewContent\":\"I have been living in SF overtone Year now but this place never showed up on my radar even thought it is pretty close to my crib. Never the less, yesterday \\\"The Make Up\\\" die a show there and it was super rad. The venue itself is just the right size, got a nice Balkony and a good cheap(for SF) full Bar, they accept all kind of cards but it will be cheaper if you pay cash. The whole interior is very chilled and feels just right burning you want something posh, this is the wrong place! I will devinetly check what bands are playing there in the future, cause I definitely come back. Ohh one word of advise, the cocktails are strong like really strong !\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1574121600000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Been here a few times for several different shows, so it's finally time to write a review.Rickshaw is definitely one of my favorite venues considering how intimate it is. Since it's a smaller venue, you'll be close and cozy with other folks. The bartenders are chill and the drinks and strong(and reasonably priced). This place has a divey and gurngy vibe, and I wouldn't want it any other way.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1573344000000,\"ReviewContent\":\"A smaller venue that doesn't feel claustrophobic. We came by when doors opened for Emo Nite but we were told that they weren't quite ready and to circle back later.When we did come back, there was a small line but it moved by pretty quickly. Once in we were stamped to indicate that our tickets were checked and we had wristbands placed on us for being 21+. Once you're inside you can pretty much see to the end of the venue with the main stage at the back. To the right as you walk in are the restrooms and there is a bar on this floor as well. There are a set of stairs to the left and there was a sign indicating that there was a bar upstairs that was open and that coat check was also located up there.When we got up there the bar was definitely not functional. There was a rack where you could hang up your jackets and take a ticket but there were no staff monitoring that so someone could in theory take your jacket. The upstairs area has some couches and has a lower level where you can watch from upstairs.I didn't drink that night but they did have a spout with water to the left of the main bar so you could help yourself.All in all it was a pretty intimate venue. The event didn't seem too packed so maybe that's why there was still a decent amount of room to move around. I think some of the hiccups may have had to do with the event organizers rather than the venue.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1568678400000,\"ReviewContent\":\"The grungier the better! I dig small intimate venues. It can get packed like sardines on the main floor so if you're short like me, head to the second floor for the best view of the stage! Also there's a few lounge chairs upstairs if you're into sitting. Saw one of my favorite artist here and it was lit!! LOVE YOU LOLO ZOUAI!! She is a Bay Area native and a rising star so don't sleep on her!!\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1568332800000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Had an absolute banger of a night, atmosphere, sound and lighting were all top notch.

If you looking for a venue, this is the place.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1563753600000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Chill quaint venue but very SF.  Went there to support a buddy's band - which was basicallly a compilation of 9 different musicians (yea the stage was a bit crowded) but the music was on point!  Drinks were VERY reasonable and the Bowie & Prince renditions were surprisingly REALLY good.  Id go back.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1561507200000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Four stars for the interesting rotation of events they put on, from Nerd Nite to live music. Bar is quite basic - nothing too positive or negative to say about it.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1555286400000,\"ReviewContent\":\"This is a great intimate venue. It's just a short walk from BART. I saw Crywolf and would come back to see another show.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1549584000000,\"ReviewContent\":\"This venue had pretty good acoustics and a really chill vibe. We went to see Badfish, a Sublime cover band. This place has a full bar, and I found the bartender to be pretty friendly. They had ADA seating for us, but it wasn't very comfortable. I appreciate that they gave us a good view of the stage. Overall I liked this place, but didn't like what people were doing inside of it. I hate to sound like a weenie but smoking of all kind should be outside. Some of us are really sensitive to smoke and wish ordinances would be followed. Otherwise, the casual seating was really cool and the bathroom was really nice compared to other divey places. There is room for improvement with the decor, but I understand it's supposed to have a certain look. I'd go back if it weren't for a stoner band!\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1549152000000,\"ReviewContent\":\"What a terrible experience! The most rude and cold blooded bar tender ever. I was there Friday night, and the bar tender was serving whomever she wanted, while completely disrespecting the fact that some people got to the bar earlier (much, much earlier) and were not served. Then she takes a shot with of her friends, makesSome jokes while the rest of us were still waiting. Then went on to serve a guy who just jumped to the bar, i told her we have been waiting for a while and we got there earlier, she said with cold devilish smile \\\"you will have to wait more\\\". So we simply didn't buy any alcohol\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1547424000000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Came here to see 4th Ave and the staff here kept everything organized! They were really kind throughout the day. The venue was smaller than I expected but I had no problem with that, and I love the sound system as well!! :) Definitely one of the best experiences I've had with a venue and their staff.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1545264000000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Love this spot. The vibes feel like a really well thought out drama club party. I have come here for both a concert and Nerd Nite and both seemed worth the price for me :) The venue is really small making the events intimate--at Nerd Nite, someone even got on stage and read a speech for her husbands anniversary present. It's nice to have a space in the middle of a city that feels like a tight knit community.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1542412800000,\"ReviewContent\":\"I had such a great night at the Rickshaw Stop! It was a little bit drama-filled, but I really appreciated the staff and their devotion to maintaining a safe atmosphere. I was pointed out by the bar staff (let's face it, probably with good reason) for having one too many, and then was asked to take a break outside. From there I had a small discussion with a couple members of the managerial team and they were the very best, super understanding and allowed me to go back inside and dance as long as I rein it JUST A BIT (I'm a talented and spirited dancer). Anyway, this team is fab and I appreciate all of them and I look forward to visiting again with less drama next time.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1539648000000,\"ReviewContent\":\"DO NOT SUPPORT THIS VENUE. The bouncers were horrible and rude. All my friend did was throw away an EMPTY beer bottle and they refused to let us in. We literally didn't even drink it there. They were incredibly rude about it and they didn't even provide us with a reasonable answer on why they couldn't let us in or provide a solution\\/refund. My friend and I were so sober and they treated us like garbage since they had no empathy from kicking us out. And then one of the bouncers started YELLING at us and I told him yelling was unnecessary since I'm just talking to him and then literally 3 other guys who worked there started YELLING such rude ass shit at us. There was no need to gang up on my friend and I when they were  already ruining our night. Nothing bad would have happened if they let us in, they just wanted to be bratty and ruin our night. They were all middle aged old cis white men who clearly didn't care about people or the music scene. They prob just enjoy pissing people off cuz they have a sad job of standing next to a door all day.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1539648000000,\"ReviewContent\":\"WORST EXPERIENCE I'VE HAD WITH A VENUE Venue bouncers\\/management didn't allow my friend and I entrance inside, even though we had our tickets bought in advanced, because he saw us throw away an empty beer bottle in the trash?!??? He insisted we were intoxicated when we actually sober. Had 0 proof we actually drank the empty bottle. Security and other employees also yelled at us basically attacking us. Provided no refund or other alternatives. Completely unreasonable. Nothing but ASSHOLES who are unhappy with themselves and their jobs who feel the need to talk down on young girls\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1535760000000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Attended the Mahalia show fri 8\\/31.STAFF: not quite the horror show that they are reputed to be, just the typical gruff venue employee typesINSIDE: stage in back of room, bar off to side. there is a small upstairs balcony. it's a small space but didn't feel overly crowded. good set lighting. BATHROOMS????: YES. there are men+women bathrooms. women's had 2 stalls, decently clean for a hole in the wall venue. PARKING: we were able to get street parking on franklin very easily-and bc it was so late we didn't have to pay! Mahalia and Kiah both put on great sets, and it so cool to see them in such an intimate setting. I would come back to Rickshaw again. *one thing I will note is that if you're a person that has any type of issue w\\/ smoke or asthma or just breathing, a lot of people were smoking\\/vaping. and in such a small space, it was kind of heavy-so that wasn't too fun.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1533686400000,\"ReviewContent\":\"I saw a sold out The Hold Steady show here.  Bad experience.  I've been to 100+ venues around the country, and I've never been so crammed into a tiny club that to watch the show I had to stand in the back of the club, literally 5 feet from the bar's center, directly under bar lights shining down on me.  Talk about a terrible way to see a show.  All lit up, constantly bothered by people trying to maneuver to buy a drink, and with all the bar noise.  There was no way to move forward--the place was that inappropriately packed.  Also, the temperature inside was too warm -- running one large fan in the balcony area doesn't cut it, people -- and the small balcony has some stupid garage door-type thing pulled partially down that blocks much of the view of the stage from the balcony.  Awful, like nobody gives a sh!t who works there.On top of the issues I mention above, the staff lack common sense.  After showing my ID, they stamped a VERY large \\\"HOT\\\" stamp on the inside of my right wrist.  It took me 1.5 days to scrub this off of my skin, and it looked far more like a \\\"HOT\\\" tattoo than a club stamp.  Thanks, guys--how about using some discretion in your stamp selection.I ended up leaving the show after about six songs despite being a big fan of the band, as I just didn't feel like dealing with the nonsense.  The show two nights earlier at GAMH was night-and-day more fun to attend.  The Rickshaw Stop may be a decent place to see an unpopular, uncrowded show, but I will never return for a show that I feel might be sold out.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1532390400000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Went here last night for a concert. Unfortunately, my phone died so I couldn't take any pictures. This place is very white and very cis. The bouncers are rude and the space is small.

The bartender told me it's sometimes open for a half hour after gates open and they serve what they might have left over.I had to run to subway during the show.  Wish the website would have said something about kitchen hours.Otherwise, this is a great, intimate venue and Ted Leo was awesome.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1520467200000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Idk why this revue is sooo sketch. Not sure why an independently owned company has such corporate-like policies?? My friend was not allowed in simple because her EMPTY canteen smelled like wine and she was not 21(at least not for less than a month longer.) She bought a ticket in advance and they refused to let her in. I'm thinking this place once had a lawsuit on their hands that made everyone who works there now a narc. There is one good thing, though, the manager gave our friend $12 back for the ticket price she paid (disregarding service fees) while she was crying on the sidewalk outside of the venue waiting for her uber.  She would not have even gotten that refund if it weren't for my friend and I heckling the manager.

Reminds me of the places I loved in high school. If I were an 18 year old kid again I'd go to this venue every week. Now I like a few tiers on the floor or in the balcony.

A hip yet unpretentious, dive-esque bar packed with a lot of character sets the stage for 3 'talks' roughly 20 minute each  about interesting and exciting topics. Talks- they are funny, they have character, they are animated speakers giving a run down of their respective field with purpose. This night we got the history of SF's Trans culture, 20 math mysteries with graphics and dancing in 20 minutes, and how a physicist is working to understand dark matter. Each was beyond entertaining, captivating, and educational without feeling talked down to or watering down the content to much. And you walking away learning some really cool stuff.This happens the 3rd Wednesday of each month and this was the 92 hosting. Great date night, or solo event, don't bring a crew this thing fills up.

Came here for Popscene\\/Frenship  on the hottest night ever (75 degrees at 7pm?!) and I happened to have a water bottle in my purse with like 2 ounces of rose left (from earlier in the day) in it.The bouncer asked to see my purse, I said ok, totally forgetting about the rose. So he saw my water bottle, took it out, and said \\\"THIS IS PINK\\\". Right, ok, so...? I said \\\"can I drink it? I can step out of the line\\\" And he didn't care at all that I said anything.He then threw the water bottle to this scary looking possibly homeless guy in a wife beater across the sidewalk and the wifebeater guy dumped the rose on the sidewalk, then threw the leftover bottle to a nearby trash can. Bouncer then said to me \\\"you can purchase alcohol inside\\\" Yeah, really? two ounces of rose would have cut back your revenue by how much? $2?Normally bouncers would give you a chance to drink it or go to back of the line or like, give you a chance to even respond. Obviously I wasn't trying to sneak it in.. the water bottle is a huge Dasani bottle! thanks for treating me like a criminal. Btw, you didn't even check the rest of my purse after you made a scene out of my water bottle.

Came here last night to see the early A R I Z O N A after paying a premium on the resale market for the early 7pm sold out show. My friend left his ticket in our Uber on the way over, so we spent the first half of the show outside trying to get that back. By the time we made it inside, we were only able to catch the last two songs. On our way out, I found myself venting to guy by the door about what had happened and how I was disappointed we missed the majority of the show. Turned out, he was the owner, and asked me and my friend to come over. He pulled out wristbands for us to attend the 10 o clock show, and told us to have a good night. We were the first to enter, and caught every song from the very front along the stage. The opening act Glades pointed the microphone at us at one point, asked us our names, and gave us a shout out.

The front is a huge purple mural and you won't actually see the venue's name outside. The venue has a general admission floor and a balcony upstairs with sofas and stools. I would definitely say that the center front stools on the balcony are the best seats in the house. For someone 5'0\\\" tall, it's always godsend to be able to see the entire set. With two bars on each floor, you won't have to struggle getting drinks either. What I love about this place the most is the intimacy you'll find here, watching your favorite band or whoever. The place can still hold a good amount of people, but the intimacy factor of it isn't reduced. If you're familiar with other venues in SF, this place is larger than Brick & Mortar, and similar to The Chapel. Also, Aaron Axelsen is here on Fridays and he seriously made the wait before the concert and in between bands poppin'. He's also on 105.3, but I'm not too sure when he's on exactly. Usually later in the evening. Anyways, I feel like he's always bringing out the dopest remixes and he's such a good source for new music.

My friends who are over 21 ordered drinks, and even though I didn't get a drink, he took the first chance he got to kick us out. He was very rude and aggressive about it and so were the other workers on duty. They didn't even want to hear our side and were acting like power hungry assholes.

Worst experience I've ever had at a show.

I drove 20 hours from Colorado to see Rainbow Kitten Surprise in San Francisco on spring break. I have followed the band since their first album in 2013 and couldn't have been more stoked to see my favorite band on their first tour. I purchased my ticket months in advance for the show. When we showed up at the door my ticket wouldn't scan. The manager came over and told me I bought the ticket for the earlier 5 o clock show they had and that I'd have to buy another ticket to get in. Ticket says 5pm-2 am. Never have I heard of a venue playing 2 shows in the same night. After pleading my case and telling him how far I came to see the show he told there was nothing he could do.

I like the small intimate size. And I like that the restrooms are by the door and there's hardly ever a wait. Drinks are pretty cheap and I like that the water is self-service at the end of the bar.\\u00a0But the shows start late and go really long. The doors don't open until 8 o'clock, and the first act doesn't usually go on until 8:45. And don't expect the main act until well after 10. At the last show, there was a half hour wait between the two. The place was full, the stage was set, and everyone was antsy and ready to go. Is it a ploy to sell more drinks? It might not bother me if it a was the weekend but on a weeknight when I still need to take public transportation home and get up at 6:30 the next morning to go back to work, I'd like to wrap up at a reasonable hour. Subsequently. every time I've been here, I've had to leave before the main act was over which sucks. Another thing is that sound system isn't very good. I didn't realize how bad until I saw a couple of shows at The Independent for a few dollars more on the ticket price. I could hear every word the singers were singing. At the Rickshaw, the bass is really low and throbbing sometimes to the point of ridiculousness. Even in the intimate moments of songs, when the artist is playing the keyboard and singing, the sound is muddy and distorted. Not OK! They do have a balcony with a few seats but they'll be taken early by people who know they're in it for a long haul.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1482624000000,\"ReviewContent\":\"I saw Mako here.

The crowd, thankfully, isn't too unruly. The tickets were also very, very cheap - $36 for two tickets after taxes\\/fees and everything!I only have a few minor complaints. The sound system could have been better -- when a violinist was playing, I could barely hear that part, which was sad, because the violinist is a big part of the song. Though I'm not sure how much of that is the performer's fault vs. the venue's fault.The ticket also said 8pm, but Mako didn't start playing until much later -- probably around 10. I was a little annoyed at the time, as I didn't know how much time I was allotted to skip the opening act to finish up a task I needed to do. I'd have liked a little more transparency in terms of when the acts started\\/finished.But those are only minor issues.

After his set we waited through another 45-minute nothingness for the headliner, who performed for barely an hour.This kind of entertainment ratio is insane.

Bigger venues like The Fillmore and Bill Graham might have some of the bigger names, but whenever I discover a really great new indie band and see they're playing in SF, it seems like almost every time they're playing at rickshaw. I go to a concert at least once a week, and over half of them have been at Rickshaw, and it's not like I try to go there I just kind of end up there after looking for shows I'll like. It's a small, intimate venue, and much more relaxed than places like the fillmore. I've seen people standing on benches and even sitting on the piano (down on the floor, not the stage) and no one seemed to mind. This could be handy if you're short, especially since it's a fairly low stage so if you're shorter it can be a little harder to see (it's not too bad for the short folks out there though, in addition to standing on the furniture you can pretty much show up 10 minutes before the music starts and secure a spot in the front, or go off to the side if you don't mind the awkward angle but still want to see).The sound system sounds great, though I'm not audiophile so I cant really say much about the quality other than it seems perfectly fine. I can say though that they've probably got the best lighting system of any similarly sized venue in town, and they've just put in four brand new high tech led spotlights that look fantastic, and this is in addition to what was already a really nice looking set. Once the music starts it looks absolutely gorgeous on stage, and unfortunately your phone camera will never do it justice.The shows always are listed at 8, but they always start the music 40-50 min after, it seems to be a rule that the artists wait until at least 8:40 to start. The headliner will usually start at around ten.I don't drink, so unfortunately can't tell you much about the drink quality or pricing. They do always have a drink themed on the band that'll be playing, so it's kinda fun to see what kind of drink related puns they come up with.My biggest complaint is the lack of box office hours, you can only buy the tickets online or at the door of the specific show (can't buy tickets for a different show). I've heard you can buy the tickets for there at the independent and some other places, but I've never tried it. Also it's cash only, which is kind of annoying. But hey, buying the ticket is always the worst part of a concert right?This is a great venue, very conveniently placed (right smack in the middle of town and two blocks away from bart\\/muni underground), cheap tickets (usually around $14 at the door), great sound and lighting, and most important of all always having the best acts, I plan on returning often\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1470960000000,\"ReviewContent\":\"This place is the best.

Plus there will likely be a long line forming anyway. The location itself lacked seating leaving many on the floor and uncertainty whether there was a clear escape route (say if I needed to visit the ladies room). Thankfully people at the floor sat down and my view from a chair was perfect. They serve food and drink if you are hungry but I personally didn't feel like throwing $8 for a grilled cheese.

Thanks to Dan, Harp, and their team, we had the best corporate holiday party our staff has ever had! Dan was incredible to work with and made sure we got a great deal. He was easy-going, helpful, and genuinely excited about the event which made planning so much more enjoyable. They made setup and cleanup a breeze, allowed us to move things around to fit our party's needs, and even helped decorate with the holiday vibe we were going for. You could tell everyone wanted to help us have a good time and keep things running smoothly. The drinks were good (they let us have 2 custom drinks on the menu which was fun and popular among guests), the bar service was fast and easy (we used the drink ticket approach), and Dan was fast and easy to communicate with throughout the entire process. Parking and safety were non-issues, there was plenty of space for our 150+ guests, and again the vibe the space lends itself to is just right for a trendy mingling and festive atmosphere.If you're looking for a hip, cool place to throw a party, this is it! Seriously, give them a call.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1450137600000,\"ReviewContent\":\"I loved the vibe, I loved the band, I loved the venue.....except for THE SOUND. It was so loud that you could not distinguish one guitar from the other...the bass was this huge thumping drone, and forget about understanding any lyrics. At one point (on 12\\/14\\/15) Murray Lightburn from the Dears was onstage with just an acoustic guitar doing a beautiful song with quiet dynamics, and it was still so loud that everyone kept their earplugs in. It's just ridiculous. In an intimate atmosphere you should be able to hear EVERYTHING. I actually went up to the guy at the booth in between bands and politely said it was too loud. He just shrugged. The same deal at the Bottom of the Hill...volume to the point of mandatory earplugs and total quality distortion. Disappointing....because the venue is great otherwise.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1449964800000,\"ReviewContent\":\"If a new band books a gig at Rickshaw, you can bet they're going to start making it big in due time (Ellie Goulding, Lily Allen, Bastille, Sam Smith, The Wombats, etc.) Overall, i love this venue and the hidden crazy gem that it is. Rickshaw is small enough so that if you get there early, you can literally be inches away from the performers, but it's also large enough so that you can get down and groovy upstairs and in the back. However, it does get insanely packed, so be warned if you're going to a sold out show. If a show is sold out and you are kicking yourself in the butt for not getting tickets in time, have no fear! They usually sell a limited number of tickets at the door, so get there early if you want to score tickets. There is also an open dance floor after the gig is over, which is always fun. The performances are always fantastic and if you're from the bay, I highly recommend seeing a show during your time here.

In truth, you don't know what you're going to get at this place, but it'll probably good.  In truth, I had a friend whose purse got stolen here and that was kind of a bummer.This city needs more venues like Rickshaw Stop.  However, beware dear reader that some shows are 18+ and some are 21+ and you might not be sure which one you're about to go see (gasp)!  If you're a 21+ kind of person then double check before you agree to get down with that musak.One of the major pluses of Rickshaw is that you can get so close to the stage you can practically smell the sweat of the performers, if you're into that.  It's intimate, small, with good acoustics and great acts.

Instead, you've got some great tunes to go crazy about.Been here just a few times now. Saw the Fratellis and Monarchy here. Sound for each band was pretty great.

When we walked in, we decided to take a look upstairs, where there was a small bar and a balcony with a view of the dance floor and stage. The ceiling was pretty low on the second level. Back downstairs, we bought a couple drinks (there's a minimum if you wanna use a credit card) and made our way toward the stage. The sound was pretty good. Props to the lighting guys too. There wasn't much decor except for the velvet curtain that wrapped around the venue and the visuals that were projected onto the screen behind the stage. Ladies room had 2 stalls..it wasn't super clean, but we survived. There was one spot on the floor where a fan was blasting..good if you need some air, bad if you're trying to keep your DO in one place.The cool thing was that the performers could only access the backstage area by walking through the left side of the dance floor, so we were able to say hello and grab a photo with Brodie as she walked by.

While their sound system is not absolutely amazing, it's more than adequate and the space lends itself to some pretty intimate experiences. I shook hands with Penguin Prison before he went onstage and thanked him for playing. I saw an amazing set by Tesla Boy (their first ever in the US) and was about five feet away from the stage the entire time. The Drive Tour was fantastic with Anoraak, College and Electric Youth all playing full-length sets.Rickshaw Stop has already provided me with memories that will last a lifetime and I hope there are many more to come. Definitely check out their regular Popscene nights where you'll be sure to discover a hot new act before they go on to play much bigger (and lamer) venues.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1388361600000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Wanna hear some live music from your favorite indie band?

The venue isn't exactly the prettiest place - it looks rather sketchy from the outside actually. Even on the inside, it's rather austere, though the rickshaw is an interesting, nice touch.I cannot comment on the food or the drinks, but as a concert venue, it's amazing. The ground floor is rather large, so it's well-suited for the acoustics. If the show's ever too wild, there is also a second floor viewing deck. Though it may be case by case, when I went, DSLRs was allowed, so as a photographer, that was definitely a plus.I came here to see Boris and Deafheaven, both of which were amazing acts. For groups that had a really powerful sound impact, the venue and setup did them justice. It was an intimate affair, and I much preferred the atmosphere compared to a larger venue.The lighting of this place is also amazing, so props to whoever was manning the lights that night. My pictures turned out well, the atmosphere of the concert was chill, and even the people were very relaxed - much unlike what you may find at a more typical concert.If Rickshaw Stop ever hosts an act I'm interested in, I'll be sure to come back.TIP: DSLR Photography is allowed (or at least at the concert I went to), so feel free to shoot away!\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1372118400000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Fun little spot, for a younger crowd, staff is ok, sound is solid.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1371600000000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Here's my tip for you: go for the sangria.  It's the alcohol value ratio by far.  Backing up:  went to the cool Movie Video Race event last weekend and loved being washed over by the hippity-hip-hip-hipsters. Even standing in line was awesome - \\\"hey - I went to a silent disco on twin peaks last night\\\" etc. Damn, the things you learn when you get out a little.  Got inside in time to actually get a spot with our backs to the bar to hold us up as the place filled up....and up.....and up. And we were right next to the free water station so once we were packed in like sardines, we got our body rubs free as people moved past us to get their free H20.Anyway, started with a drink special with tequila because they don't have a stout that sounded interesting. It wasn't so great and definitely teeny, so went for the sangria.  Hallelujah, I hit the motherlode!  $5 and the wine is laced with a hefty portion of brandy, so by the time I was two sangrias in and my friend showed up, I'm sure she didn't recognize my sentences as english.The bartenders were very friendly and the place reminded me a smidge of New Parish, for you Oaktown folk.  I could see the band that played fairly well, and the video screens were high enough up that even the amazonian people in front of us didn't block them too much.

Not fair man, not fair.Oh - final stamp of approval for the Boffo cart out front that sold the Yams. Holy sriracha sauce, them puppies are delicious!  And spicy enough that we shamelessly drank someone's open and forgotten bottle of IPA that we watched sitting there on the bar for 20 minutes with no one claiming it.

The staff was nice, and, although I didn't order a drink, the bar seemed organized and moving along at a good pace. This was a sold-out show (Sky Ferreira, How To Dress Well, and The High Highs) so I was pretty surprised we snagged a spot at the stage. Everyone was respectful..no cursing, drunken fools pushing up against us like at other venues. Sound system was amazing. Speakers took everything the bands could dish out with no distortion. Volume was loud, but not obnoxious. Watching each band set-up and tear-down inches away from us kept the 'down time' interesting.

The male bartender scoffed at me and preceded to take 4 other orders before even trying to close my tap.

I don't know whether they are the performers' photographers or the venue's, but every time I have been at the front they end up jumping and standing right in front of the other concert-goers and I. They love to move their arms around to get every possible angle taken on their cameras, blocking the view of the people who were standing in the front originally, and it's an extreme disappointment for those who have stood in line outside and stood right in front for an hour waiting to see an artist that the photographer could care less about.I have had more than one photographer talk down to my friends and I, and I've even had one elbow me in the face--with no apology--while he was taking pictures at extreme angles.It's very unfortunate for everyone who paid to be there, and one could only hope something could be done about this.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1361923200000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Recently came to Rickshaw Stop for the first time to see CAMPER VAN BEETHOVEN & it was an interesting eveningThis venue is super small & reminds me a lot of Red Devil Lounge.

I really wanted to see Paloma Faith, love her music, so a friend & I drove two hours to SF for the show.  It was supposed to be my birthday present to him.  I saw three different promotions for the show, they all said 8PM show.  It also said it would open with DJ music, so I guessed Paloma wouldn't start at 8, but hopefully not too late as we had to drive home the two hours so my friend could go to work the next day- but we figured if the show lasted til 11, we could get back home by 1.  Well, we stood in line out in the cold windy sidewalk for an hour, they finally opened the doors at 8:25...some guy kept coming out to look at the line, but wouldn't say when the doors would open.  OK, so we get inside at 8:45, get settled in upstairs and listen to the DJ play Motown 60's, which was great.  By 9:30, my friend is getting stressed about how late the trains run to get back to our car, and after 10 more minutes, said he isn't really in the mood to wait any longer.  The place had filled up long ago and we noticed some people were giving up their seats and leaving (mostly older folks, it was a really mixed crowd.)  It wasn't so much we minded losing out on our $15 admission, but we really wanted to see Paloma perform and felt like the 8pm time was really misleading.  As we left, I asked the doorman when Paloma would actually  play, and he said 10pm.  I guess my biggest gripe was the lack of clarity of the schedule- if I had known the show didn't really start til 10, I wouldn't have bought tickets.  I liked everything else about the Rickshaw, I only wish the venue would be more transparent in their timetable.  It gave me the feeling they wanted people in two hours early to buy more drinks.

Granted, they had their own sound engineer, but all the levels were perfect and the songs sounded so crisp--even a bit better than my other favorite little SF venue, Bottom of the Hill. The only drawback to the live show was being stuck behind a bunch of obnoxiously tall people--I wish more small venues like this had sloped flooring for us shorter people. If the opening band sucks (like this one did) see if you can snag the big comfy red couch by the merch table--and if that's full, traverse upstairs for somewhat limited \\\"mezzanine\\\" seating. Apparently there is a smoking room up there, so be aware if you're sensitive to that. They have a good drink selection and have cute specials that are themed after the performers (the \\\"Van Etten\\\" consisted of white champagne grapes and other yummy ingredients). I stuck with an Ace cider. This place is in a weird area, but it sounds like people actually don't have too much of a problem parking around here?

Rickshaw Stop is just NOT my scene. I didn't even know this place existed much less was located 1.5 blocks from the office. In theory, it would be the perfect spot to Party Like A Rockstar then crawl underneath my desk, wake up the next morning, and hope no one remembers what I wore the previous day. Ok, maybe not because I'm a lady after all.Rickshaw Stop is a club that has live band performances specifically Indie music. They also have Bhangra nights which is some sort of Indian folk dancing.  When we ended up here last night (not by choice) for a Popscene party, I pretty much sobered up after seeing shirtless men doing interpretive dances. A guy next to us then started throwing up all over himself while no one even seemed to care. That pretty much sealed the deal for me.

I've only been here once but I truly feel that the rating for this place is way overblown. I went here back in July for a concert during the week. Everything as far as the staff, bartenders, and overall atmosphere were really nice. I especially liked the upstairs chill area - a nice place to go to get away from the bottleneck that is the entry way. Now for the bad. First off, this place was RIDICULOUSLY HOT INSIDE. It was retarded... no AC, and although they have tons of fans on the ceilings, they wouldn't turn any of them on. I've been to countless overpacked venues and this place was stupidly hot beyond all others. Secondly, the sound system SUCKS hard. sucks so hard that it's just laughable. What's with the arrogant DJ not turning down the sound for a second so the band can do a decent sound check? The band had to ask multiple times and the dude would NOT turn it down. They had to just start the show without going through a full sound check... which probably let to the multiple problems with the sound throughout the show. The tremble would knock out the speaker ever so often and the speakers would constantly crackle from the vocalist.

This is a great venue.  The staff is friendly and relaxed, the ambience is great, and the shows are darn cheap!If you are looking for a cheap show and you don't care who the band is, then do I have the place for you.  Generally the most expensive show they have will cost around 12 dollars, no service charge at the door.  The stage is a bit small, but the venue is a bit small.  You can get as close as you want because the floor is pretty big.  I saw Miniature tigers and Neon Indian here and that was the most packed its ever been.  So no worries about sweaty drunks shoving their elbows into you.  There are about three rickshaws around the place that you can sit on, along with more comfortable furnishings.  There are plenty of couches and chairs upstairs for people to sit on, but they get snatched up quick.  I do wish they had some more seating up stairs for this reason.  It is nice to watch the show from a comfy green couch or stare out over the crowd. They have Bhangra Dancing once or twice a month, but I have not been yet.  The shows they have here are generally pretty small, indie bands, so don't expect a huge crowd to show up.  The drinks are pretty varied and well priced.  (Jack and Coke $6)Parking is on the street, but i've never had a problem with it.  This is a great venue.  I've loved it from the big shows to the small.

The upstairs was pretty cool too, with the bike and the couches. The bar served reasonably priced and creative drinks (the special is always themed with the evening's features.) One of the staff asked me for my I.D. because I fit the description of someone who had apparently stolen someone else's purse, and then, unlike in most situations, when I tried to inquire and help, instead of being a jerk, he was cooperative and instead of what could have been a terrible experience, it was a pleasant exchange, and i made sure to let him know that and thank him for handling the situation so well.I came back for a bunch more shows, all of which were also satisfactory and beeming with good vibes.Lastly, I was so elated to find that Nerd Nite not only exists outside of Boston, but is so well attended in San Francisco!I loved living right across the street from the Rickshaw Stop for the brief time that i got to do so.

Needless to say, despite the near concussion and other injuries, it was a great time.Also helpful: I found the bartender to have supernatural hearing, an admirable quality when attempting to shout my drink order mid-song.

There is also plenty of seating upstairs including ones where you can still see the stage. I don't like the smoking room upstairs, considering there's ins and outs anyhow, but I think it's convenient for smokers. However, there is now a SKEEBALL machine inside!! If you break 200 pts, you win a free drink! I also like the 2 rickshaws they have as decor! They make for fun, drunk photo opps. The sound system is decent and the red curtains on stage and around the venue are nice. The drinks are average priced and the staff are nice.

I was amazed at the amount of close parking for a Friday night as well.  Lot's of really cute chicks, many single, some a little too wasted, friendly bartenders (when it was time to sober up and stop drinking, they gave me free Cokes), and just a really laid back, chill crowd. Only negative was the jackass who was so drunk he could hardly piss in the urinal.  I actually stood behind and to the side, as I was not in the mood to be saturated in urine.

Space is intimate, sound carries well. Coat check upstairs. Smoking room has foosball and skee ball. I didn't go in, but I eyed the smokers with envy as I'm a sucker for skeeball. Well, maybe it wasn't even skeeball.. I don't know. Looked like it from the outside looking in.If you like to sit, like I do, then head upstairs. No seating on the main floor.Upstairs has two levels. Both with various seats. My man and I snagged a love seat couch and yea, we made out. It was fun watching couples cram into rickshaw seats. If you want to ensure that you can actually SEE the band\\/stage then make sure you are on the lower of the two upper levels and bellied up to the rail. Because as we found last night (Freelance Whales and Miniature Tigers, vg btw) when the main acts come on stage people will come stand between you and the rail thereby blocking your view if you are seated. Upstairs bar has no tap and only bottled beers\\/Bathrooms were nasty! But that's normal in these venues.Crowd was very young. Lots of high school kids with back packs. Upon entry I joked with the bouncer that we (me and my main squeeze) would probably be the grandpa and grandma in the club. He took one look at my ID and said \\\"I think you already win that award by a long shot\\\". I would like to note that I saw at least 3 men in their 60's here. So we did not win that prize. There were also dads chaperoning their underage kids. That was funny, watching the kids ignore their dad as dad tried to engage said children in conversations.As far as local venues to see up and coming acts in a small setting. This one was pretty good.

I have no idea what it's like as a club, but from some of the pictures posted, it looks like a lot of drunkies dancing with brightly colored beverages.As a music venue, I've enjoyed Rickshaw overall.  The place certainly has personality including random rickshaws placed around the space.  The bar is conveniently located on the side and is cheap.  The venue itself is a good size with a smaller balcony in the back for people trying to avoid the standing room crowd.My only complaint about the venue is the crowd sometimes errs toward the young'uns side, which can make me feel like an old creepy dude scouting.  Once I went to a show where the opening band was clearly from the local high school as the front of the room became heavily populated with kids with backpacks.  They began moshing to music that probably shouldn't be moshed to.Another time, I went to watch a Wavves show and a young man jumped on stage and started dancing like a chimpanzee on crack.  He tried to fend off a bouncer who was about 3x his size and ended up getting choke slammed off the stage.

The girl at the door was really nice (she later on came to us when we were taking a break outside and offered us gummies!).Inside, the music was pretty good.  I danced crazily because I figured, well, no one's gonna look at me anyway - it's a lesbian night after all.

Not only was I dismayed to find the cover at the door for the night was 50% higher than was advertised on their website, but the night got worse from there.I was invited by some friends to come out and see\\/hear this apparently great DJ, but when I got there the club was nearly empty, but my friends were there, and I guess that's what really matters.  I had one drink and then switched to consuming little plastic cups of tap-water.  I hadn't been at the club much more than a half an hour when I decided to go outside to check the BART schedule on my smartphone (due to crappy reception in the club).  I carried an almost empty little plastic cup of tap-water with me to the door.  The bouncer, or at least this very non-official-looking skinny guy by the door informed me that I couldn't take my drink outside.  \\\"It's okay, it's just water\\\", I said.  \\\"You can't take alcohol outside.  There's an open container law\\\", he replied.  \\\"No, it's just water\\\", I said again, thinking he hadn't heard me, and I attempted to walk past him.  Suddenly, he swiped the cup from my hand so violently that it tore in half and he started shoving me.  Of course, at this point I began to protest, yelling \\\"What the h*ll\\\", and insisting that I was only carrying water.  The 'bouncer' escalated his violence in turn, yelling and shoving.  He was quickly joined by a short young woman (who I believe was the one who had collected my exorbitant cover charge) in the yelling.  The 'bouncer' demanded that I leave and threatened to call the police.  I freely admit to yelling and hurling a few expletives at these two, but at no time did I do anything improper or touch either of them.  I demanded that they \\\"get out of my face\\\", but the shoving and cursing from them just continued.  Suddenly, they were joined by a third small young man in the yelling match.  I demanded several times to know who all these people were.  Only the small man answered me, claiming to be the club owner.  I was shocked by this, as he was clearly much younger than I.  He appeared to be not far from college age.  The yelling and shoving continued, yet at no time did I raise a hand to any of these three, despite my outrage.  I haven't been in a fist-fight since middle school, and I certainly wasn't about to stoop to that level again.  Finally, I turned and walked away.  I suppose the entire altercation couldn't have lasted more than one or two minutes.In conclusion, you should not give these aggressive a**holes any of your hard earned money.  The owners and employees of this club are the dregs of humanity and should be avoided at all cost.

So that new knowledge helped me appreciate the night's cleverly named drink special: Clarissa's Wired, containing gin, Grand Marnier, grenadine and lemon. I sipped it while exploring the upstairs seating area, envying the people who scored a spot on a bench with a snake face carved into one end.We took ownership over a wooden structure to the left of the high-up stage on the main level. When I leaned back far enough into the lush, red curtain, I was relieved to discover a wall. Usually when I have a few drinks, I don't act stupid or anything--I just become uncontrollably tired. Thus, after one Clarissa's Wired and two sangrias, I passed out on the wooden structure.

This has to be the WORST club I've ever been to !!  Expensive, rude staff, aggressive crowd, and their bathrooms are less than sanitary...I came here last night (Non-Stop Bhangra) for a friend's birthday, and I have never had such a bad clubbing experience - in any country!  Summary on the night's events...-- $20 cover-charge for everyone!  Doesn't matter if you're with a large party or rock up late - it's $20!  I don't normally believe in paying a huge cover to enter a club, because they overcharge you on drinks once you're in there, but because it was for a friend's b'day, I didn't say anything.-- $3 to check anything into the cloakroom, and $2 each time you want to retrieve anything!  My friend was buying drinks & he was $1 short, so I asked the girl who had just checked my bag in, if I could access my wallet - she was going to charge me $2, to get $1 out of my bag!!  No way!-- The guys there are aggressive!  I don't know what was in the air, but my friend (John) nearly got beaten up trying to rescue me from this guy who kept trying to dance with me, even though I'd already politely refused him earlier.  I think the guy thought John was cutting in on him, so he started getting really pissed, until I assured him that John was a friend of mine.  Even so, the guy was like, \\\"Let's take it outside\\\", and wouldn't leave us alone until another friend stepped in to pacify him.-- The best part of the night was when they (temporarily) lost my things at the cloakroom when I went back to reclaim them... Not only that, but the girl was really rude about it!  First, she pretty much ignored me for 5 min., even though I was standing right there holding my ticket, and started tidying up\\/rearranging stuff inside; then when I asked if I could please get my bag out, she pretended not to have realized what I was waiting for.  Next thing I know, she starts texting on her phone!  What the?!?So I asked again (more directly) - \\\"Err... could I please have my bag - now??\\\"  And she said, \\\"We're having a little trouble finding it - I'm just calling the guy who was minding the cloakroom earlier - maybe he moved it.\\\"  How stupid!  Why would he do that??So then I asked if I could please come in to take a look, cause I'd recognize it - but she wouldn't let me and continued texting.Finally she asked me what it looked like; I described it; and after taking a 3rd look, she found it - it was right there the whole time!!But she didn't say anything or apologize for wasting my time - and my friends had been there waiting with me the whole time!Anyway, the night was saved by the fact that I was in good company, but I vowed NEVER to come back here EVER again!!! - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - EDIT: The next day, I discovered huge reddish-brown stains all over my JC velour handbag!!

Overall a very good night would go there to see a show again.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1269993600000,\"ReviewContent\":\"I went to the Rickshaw Stop for the first time to watch Zee Avi on February the 25th. [rant]Event Organizers know people are coming to see someone who's musical genre we probably prefer, so why do they always pick openers that play a completely different type of sound? For my sanity and physical health (the ears were about to start bleeding) I had to step outside plenty of times between openers and even DURING a few. [\\/rant]It's smaller than other places, but for the size of the crowd that night: ideal. The rickshaws were cute, the ambiance much like the old-school dive bars I've seen in Bali, and the bartenders friendly. I had a few cocktails - two people made them delicious (strong yet sweet), another guy used the cheap stuff that tasted like mouthwash without the minty freshness.If you get there early, you could save yourself a seat in the loungey zone upstairs and hang out while all the openers do their thing. We got there at 7:55 and 4 bands + a little over 3 hours later, we heard Zee Avi. The highlight of that night was Zee Avi's performance, then running into her in the restroom and chatting with her for a bit.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1269907200000,\"ReviewContent\":\"This place was great when they had club BLOW UP there.

I've been waiting for this band since last year after a cancelled show due to visas being denied. Finally last night, I got to see 'em funky fresh in the flesh! To be brutally honest though, I didn't really care too much for the opening acts. The first guy sat there playing his acoustic guitar damn near had me ready to swallow razor blades. The next band, Lumerians, were pretty dope but I wasn't in the mood to hear anybody but Garotas Suecas, since that's who I came to see. They brought the fuzzy spaced out funk straight from Sao Paulo son! I met the guitarist who was real cool and he gave me the set-list (I'm such a nerd). Rickshaw's a dope venue coz it's got a nice sized main floor and the extra-dope upstairs with a balcony that has a perfect view of the stage, if you don't feel like punching out the next idiot who steps in front of you after you've been posted up front waiting for the band you been wanting to see. Real talk! Why does that shit always happen though.Big up to Chris the security guy for being a real genuine dude! I got nothin' but respect for security guys who hold it down without being douchey, nah mean?

My completely sober 125 pound boyfriend was standing to the side waiting for Glass Candy to go on while me friend and I were chatting with each other. We each payed about 45 bucks each, a heafty amount for a venue like the Rickshaw Stop, just to see the band play, then leave and go to friend's parties.Some guy rudely bumps my boyfriend to move, despite the amount of space around him that the guy could walk through easily. Then the guy tells him to walk outside with him because he was a sercurity guy. My boyfriend refused at first because they guy was going to kick him out then agreed to sort out what was going on. They go outside and the guy walks away. My boyfriend walks back in confused then the guy picks him up and forcibly carries him outside (RE-bruising an old rib injury my boyfriend had last year). This all happens AT MIDNIGHT.I'm demanding to see the manager and demanding for my money back. What could a 125 pound, well behaved man do to get him kicked out? Standing still isn't grounds to kick someone out. He wasn't drunk (like everyone else), he wasn't high (everyone else was) and he definitely wasn't harrassing people. All he did was refuse to move when someone was rudely pushing him instead of simply tapping him like everyone else does at a show.  The \\\"manager\\\" caves after listening to me complain about how his worker is bullying my boyfriend who is clearly sober, no threat and the last person to pick a fight with. He even agreed that my boyfriend didn't look like a threat. The worker even LIED and said that he did tap him on the shoulder to make it sound like his actions were justifiable. We think he was pissed about something unrelated and just wanted to pick on someone smaller than him.Me and my boyfriend have been coming to this venue since we were teens (between 10-14 years). Between us, we have gone to hundreds of shows over the years without any drama and we have NEVER been kicked out of any venue.We are tempted to go back to the venue and tell them that they re-injured my boyfriend's rib. We are also seriously considering talking to the owners about this (we know people who know them). I feel like we spent 90 bucks between us just to have a shitty time at their venue.We used to love this place. It used to be awesome where you could watch indie bands play. This was pre-Blow Up club nights when it really was about listening to good music and not about getting wasted, watching girls do tons of coke in the bathroom and where the people who worked there didn't pick on the wrong people.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1262736000000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Solid 3 stars, through and through.

This is my first, I made an account JUST to review BLOW UP @ The Rickshaw Stop.I went this Friday with a few friends. Had a TERRIBLE time. We're all in our early twenties but I felt like I was at a high school dance. HALF of the people there were children. Wasted, drugged, annoying, rude, obnoxious high schoolers. How do these kids get in?!It was Blow Up's \\\"100th Anniversary\\\" or something. It started off with some HORRIBLE 'performance' by two rapping lesbians. They were terrible. Despite the boos, they finished their act.I can't count the number of times I was pushed, shoved, and ran into without acknowledgment. At one point my friend and I were dance-attacked by some savage teenage girl on E. I had to push this bitch off of me numerous times!! Gays, forget it. I've been here about a dozen times and have never met any nice gays worth knowing. Oh, and I can never tell who's straight and who's hipster. HIPSTERS. Oh god! Don't get me started. So many weird, wanna-be indie hipster kids. So many v-necks, lense-less thick framed glasses, and skinny jeans, I wanted to kill myself.Also, if you DO happen to be underage and drinking, watch out. The bouncers here are ROUGH. I witnessed one of the male bouncers SCREAMING in this girls face after catching her drinking without a wrist band. He was yelling at the top of his lungs and screaming profanities for her to get out. And then a long brown-hair female worker there (bartender? female bouncer?) GRABS THIS GIRL BY THE THROAT and pushes her to get out. I couldn't believe what I was witnessing! Hardcore stuff.So yeah, in a nut shell. Don't waste your time on Blow Up. The ONLY saving grace of this event is the music... Not going to lie, its the only reason I lasted longer than an hour... Love the tunes!

You really have to come into this place with the right mentality. You have to know that a.) You will sweat like no other. I'm talking, you better be wearing your good deoderant\\/antiperspirant. None of that crystal stuff. b.) You have to have your dancing shoes on. Read: flats, sneakers...NO heels. c.) You have to expect your clothes to smell like cigarettes. Although, there is a smoking area upstairs, the smoke makes its way downstairs. So why was I surprised that I left my rainjacket underneath the lit christmas tree downstairs to find that it completely stunk of cigarette smoke? d.) You have to expect to be somewhat sore the next day...that and maybe a combination of sore and hungover. PLUSES:-I have never been disappointed. I have been to Blow Up, Cockblock and Rebel Girl.

True, lots of 18+ kids who party here probably attend the local art school wearing their most expensive & trendiest outfit that mom and pop financed but if you ease up a bit most of them are just looking to get to know others with the same interest. It's what some would call a 'hipster' scene, but who cares? That doesn't stop most people from partying in SJ's Motif or Suite 181 when I call it the 'ghetto' scene.Expect the young, fabulous, trendy, tattooed & pierced type here! If you don't like this type, then obviously don't come here to ruin everyone else's good time with your negativity and sniveling. What I love about partying here for Blow UP is they constantly have different artists & DJ's coming here to bring you some fresh indie & electronica beats to dance to  a la Steve Aoki, Dan Oh, Skeet Skeet, Designer Drugs, Micky Avalon, etc. Richie Panic & Jeffrey Paradise are the usual DJ suspects here.Once when I came here with friends during the summer it was so hot we literally left the place drenched in sweat. I know it wasn't the weather that evening, but rather it was caused by everyone's dancing and enjoying themselves.Definitely worth it imo.

I heard about this place from a few friends who had yet to turn 21. We checked it out and it was like being at a hipster kid's house party. I swear, this is far the most i've seen in one place of cross over guy-girls (sometimes its hard to tell ;T )  in skinny nut hugging jeans, make up and faux-hawks. We go in and order drinks. I let one of the minors hold a drink while i get some thing from my purse and next thing you know some security guard flashes his pointer and is like you're not 21 and takes MY DRINk!! and kicks my friend out just like that? WTF YO!! he's 21 in like a month. WACK. So he's kickin it outside, and im like F that i paid a 20 cover. Me and my girl bop to some techno rave scene while observing these could be girls making out with hot girls..ugh weird.  I get another drank my infamous AMF, once again i let my friend hold it for a sec, and out of anowhere i another mother frodo vagina KICKS US BOTH OUT!!! it's a fricking hipster scene, it ain't even 21.

The overall turnout of events could have went better (thanks Lady Sovereign, you rude cow). Doors were supposed to open at 9pm, but the line was still moving pretty slowly to get in; but major props to the ID checker at the front for trying, constantly screaming for everyone to get their IDs out and ready. Upon entering, you might have to fight through the bathroom queue to get anywhere. Ceilings are pretty low, but don't worry they shouldn't cave in--just keep walking, get your drinks and shake that thang! What I loved about the venue, was wether upstairs, downstairs, bathroom or bar, the ambiance was very home-y, almost an intimate gathering of friends (don't worry, I'm not an emo or a hipster). Drinks were awesome: great Tokyo Iced Tea. AND woot woot for the upstairs smoking room! The openers were fun--they really got the audience going. Then Ms. Diva Sovereign managed to get through four songs before walking off for a second and final time. Needless to say, everyone tried making the best of the situation, but one of the guards did not like it when a friend walked on stage and grabbed the rest of the Diva's crate of beer (Dos XX's but free is free). I understand that the Diva just wasn't feeling it, but come on. So, the jerk of a guard huffed and puffed and through us all out, even though the DJ said everyone could split her beer. Still managed to have an awesome time though. Glad\\/Proud we got kicked out of a place we no longer wanted to be. So, to reiterate, Yay for Rickshaw and poo on the Lady Sovereign (you should put that in your pipe and smoke it before your next show you sorry twit--oops, might still be a bit angry with her).\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1243036800000,\"ReviewContent\":\"cute intimate indie music bar club scene i guess i'd say. loved the red glowiness and few strings of big bulby velvety orange lights, made me feel like a carnival lounge scene from city of lost children (that old great fairytalish french movie).  zee avi was great, but this whole early show business ends too early and walking out into the cold grey light of dusk is kinda a let down after a cool show and big drink. but i'm not whining.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1243036800000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Ew, smelled like all bars with wooden floors smell like.

The behavior of the employees here Saturday night was honestly shocking and really took me aback.Let me preface this by saying I was not that drunk. I know that sounds like the \\\"drunk girl's motto\\\" but I was very clear headed when dealing with the staff. Now, I had been dancing in the middle of the club with a friend, who, to put it simply, dropped me and I fell hard in front of everyone. I mean hard. Super embarrassing and probably made me look a lot drunker than I actually was. After my moment in the spotlight, I scurried away to the bar to avoid the stares, and that's when the fun started. I went to get my 2nd drink of the night (the first of which I shared with my friend), and essentially got cut off. He probably saw my fall. He didn't even say this, or anything for that matter, and when I asked for a drink he basically scoffed and said \\\"don't think that's happening,\\\" turned his back, and ignored me. I didn't understand what was going on.But whatever, it wasn't that big of deal and I didn't make a fuss. When I came back later in the night to close my tab (for the 1 drink I had bought), I asked him if he really thought I had been that drunk, to which he responded, \\\"yeah, drunk or on roofies, something is going on.\\\" Who says that? It was the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard, and he was clearly just trying to be insulting. When I asked him what his name was, I again got the silent treatment, and he went in the back room. The other bartender was also ignoring me and nobody would give any names. Maybe they knew I'd write a bad review? If you're going to treat somebody like shit, man up and give them your name.The place was closing down, and having been there with the band, I was waiting on the stairs for them to get the car and load up. You know the face that women make, and that tone of voice, where someone is pretending to say something nicely but really they are trying to be really mean? Kind of a like a little tilt of the head\\/smirk\\/raised eyebrows look? This little asian chick employee comes over to me (I'm donig absolutely nothing) and tells me I need to leave in the rudest way, with that face. I told her I was with the band and that I was just waiting for them, and she essentially said, again in a really venomous way, that she didn't care who I was with, I needed to get out. To which I replied, \\\"fine but you don't have to be such a bitch about it.\\\" Yes yes, I know I should've just held my tongue, and I am generally quite tame, but it was the culmination of the entire staff marking me and treating me like !@#$ for the duration of the night that did it. Of course she, and the 3 other employees at the bar immediately start screaming at me, 'YOU need to get the !@#$ out of this club NOW!\\\" Which, at that point, was warranted.And here is how you know it wasn't just me. The guys were loading up the van in front of the club, at 2:25 or so, and one of the angry bartenders (who was leaving to go home, not knowing that I was in the car), yells at one of the band members for parking in front of the club and having all of their shit around. He tells him to have some respect. HE'S PACKING UP! He just finished a show! It was crazy.It's unfortunate that the staff (at least, I guess, on a saturday) is so horrendously rude because otherwise the space as a music venue is not bad at all.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1237852800000,\"ReviewContent\":\"The Rickshaw is a pretty cool place for live music and dancing.

We got our drinks, posted up in the corner and put on our dancing shoes, ready to be taught some of the elegantly simple and artfully infused dance moves that are, well, Bhangra. I had never heard of it before, although I had seen that style many times in Paris. Nights flew by listening to raj music while in underground clubs by the Louvre as the locals went mad. The people that frequent the small club with an upstairs are die hards. It was incredible to see the different flavors of people jam packed in there literally letting it all go and getting their groove on. I sweated through my clothing, and for once, wished I had worn kicks instead of heels so that I could have really gotten down and dirty in it. No drama, no problems, just a ton of people all there with a common thread, they love to dance. The beat inspires them. What could be more perfect than that? I didn't get skeevy men dripping on my ass for once, no one attempting to take the two of us home that night. It was refreshing. Just make sure you're not claustrophobic, as it's as tightly packed in there late at night as sardines in a can.

In my experience the people that work at the Rickshaw Stop are great people, it just seems like its something about the Blow Up promoters that get under my skin and here is why: It was pretty dead earlier in the night but soon the trying-to-hard-hipsters started to make their way in. The DJ was moderately good the entire night but much to arrogant. Its hilarious watching these young girls hang on to these guys like rockstars. They didn't like the fact that I went up to them and asked them to play a song. Okay DJ's maybe you don't have to play it, maybe you don't want to play it, but don't be an ass a simple \\\"I'll try to get it in there\\\" would be awesome. Don't be a pretentious fuck just because I'm not a coked out whore asking to blow you.The more packed it got the more the temperature started to rise. It becomes unbearable by midnight. I was with a group of friends but I instantly noticed how people here are not as friendly as I have encountered at other places.It also took way to long to get a drink at the bar which surprised me because on other nights I would be served rather quickly.So, on Blow Up nights, the standard for this place is lowered. It becomes much to chaotic and the people who run it don't seem to care about the patrons. However, the crowd doesn't seem to care how they are treated for the most part either. The young kids, some probably with fake id's, are much more concerned with getting their picture taken making out with a stranger or with their left nipple hanging out.Maybe I am just much to old for this?I def want to attend a Cockblock or other gay\\/lez night and hopefully make up for the experience on this night.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Rickshaw Stop\",\"ReviewDate\":1231804800000,\"ReviewContent\":\"I didn't really enjoys it.

There's also an upstairs bar + balcony with vintage decorations like old school bikes and 80s looking tables. The crowd was dressed uber trendy. For some reason I noticed a lot of boys in fashionable hats. A good handful of girlies were wearing party or cocktail dresses. Their best threads for the friday night school dance.

Met the owners and found out they love to support the local artist\\/music scene.  They were able to squeeze our 2 hour film screening party on a Saturday- which is very hard to do.  My top reasons why you should go there:1. Bartenders are quick and slick.2. They offer my favorite pear cider there. 3. If you love live music- this is the place to go.4. The people are mixed, hip, and good-looking5. If you are short, and cannot make it to the front, there is an upstairs floor where you can lounge on sofas and watch the show.6.

Its got a backyard patio feel to it with the lights hung on the ceiling and an upstairs balcony with adequate seating if you dont want to deal with the mosh pit that downstairs will eventually become.

I saw Buck-O-Nine and Mustard Plug here. It had been so long since I'd been that I totally forgot what the stage looked like and even where it was.

You save like two bucks for pre-buying. Plus the pre-buy setup is old-fashioned. They email a bunch of people, and you're on a list. I love it.The crowning glory on this occasion was they were looping a Killer Klowns from Outer Space DVD on the small TV on mute above the bar. In between sets and at other times, I found myself unable not to watch. It's scary even though it's not even though it's terrifying. Like utterly bone-chilling.

Yet I always had the desire to visit here one day. Well that day came recently when I was able to see one of my favs from back in the day, Sicko, play a show here along with locals Mr. T Experience and the Pathogens.I don't really know what I had drawn up in my teenage mind when I first heard about this place many years ago, but like most things we imagine when we are that young, they usually don't meet up to our lofty expectations. For whatever reason, I had imagined BOTH to be a large club, similar to maybe the Troubadour or the Whiskey in LA..however it is actually a lot smaller and more intimate than the majority of the rock clubs in Hollywood. For those from LA, it's closer in size to the Echo or the Smell.On this night, the place was decorated in a Halloween theme since we were close to the holiday, which I was delighted to see. There were also past show posters framed alongside the walls which highlight the rich history of the club. If you walk towards the back there is a tiny room which was set up to sell merch.They do have a bar, but I'm sober so can't say much about that other than they do have alcohol.Tickets can be bought onsite or reserved through their website. There is will call out front where the guy basically just checks your ID to make sure it matches the person who bought the ticket online. If you're over 21, they put a wristband on your hand and if not, well I guess they don't. It is all ages though because I saw a bunch of kids inside. There is no coat check here but leave your jackets at home since it gets pretty warm indoors.The sound was good and the crowd was fun, mostly nice and not too intense on the night I went.Parking seems limited, with street level parking and a small lot out back. I took a lyft so it didn't affect me one way or the other.Overall, it was a fulfilling experience and the teenage me would be so excited that I got to go here. Heck, the current me was also excited about it too!\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1569715200000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Great venue for live music! Major points for easy, free street parking in S.F. Good size dance floor, indoor seating in the back and outdoor patio, and bar featuring self-serve water. The sound was well balanced and loud without being headache inducing. Two stalls in the ladies room with purse hooks, and kept clean and stocked with TP the entire night.

I thought the venue was just ok. The sight lines are not great as the ceiling is low and the stage itself is small and also not too high. If you are at the front to the right of the stage, you end up blocking the walkway which means people walking into you.

The place is cash only but they have an ATM by their front door. The bathrooms were interesting: women's restroom has 2 small stalls but the door to the bathroom was left open so people on the main floor could look into the bathroom.

There's a giant neon sign outside, and usually a line that goes down the block. The interior of this place hasn't changed much in the past twenty years. A tiny stage, abstract art on the walls, and small bar in the front, which gets pretty crowded. They have a nice patio area in back, perfect if you're a smoker; if not, they do have some nice vegetation to admire. The place isn't near any muni or BART stations. This venue is tiny and there's no real room to move around or dance. The place is cool for a first concert experience but can be a bit annoying if you want to try to enjoy a show.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1537833600000,\"ReviewContent\":\"I've been to Bottom of the Hill twice. Once for an incredible 60s\\/70s themed wedding with an amazing David Bowie cover band, and once for a show with a band featuring men dressed like orcs from Lord Of The Rings and the headliner, a heavy metal Arnold Schwarzenegger parody militia style band that played songs about the movie Junior, Twins, Kindergarten Cop, and more.Needless to say, Bottom of the Hill has A LOT to offer. It's cash only and you'll need to check online to see what show may be going on as ticket prices\\/cover can vary greatly. The drinks are extremely affordable and the bartenders are so so so kind and do a great job of seeing everyone who may be in need of a drink and\\/or safety earplugs and servicing them stat. The venue isn't huge but I think that's kind of perfect for a show where you don't want to get crammed in and pushed around. There's a back room that I've spent about 20 seconds in but I think it's a good area to hang in if you order from their small kitchen menu. There's also a back outdoor patio with some limited seating, tons of gorgeous plants, and a pack of adorable kittens that do not want to be pet.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1537056000000,\"ReviewContent\":\"If you enjoy multiple car break-ins, this place is for you!!. I should've heeded the warning of the people that said be wary of parking your car here. However, since they were only two of them, I figured it might not still be an issue. I was wrong. It's really insulting that they have warnings about break-ins posted as a small flyers on the window, because that shows they see and KNOW there's an issue, but their only solution is \\\"check your bags with us for free!\\\"Listen, if I thought they couldn't afford some security or at least a parking area to patrol, I might be more sympathetic. But with what their drink prices were, and that it's cash-only, I know they have enough. It's simply ridiculous. Don't even go to this place. The fact that people keep returning despite these issues is just not giving them any incentive to fix anything. Now I'm out $1300 in belongings and my car has a permanent breeze. Cool. It happened to a few cars in the area it seems, too. One car was missing a gas cap after. So they will literally f*ck your sh*t up just to do it. To end on a positive: Sound system was nice inside the venue. It was a nightmare navigating to the restroom though and the lack of seating was weird. Overall literally no reason to Come back here ever. Oh. I guess there weren't many positives.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1535846400000,\"ReviewContent\":\"This place is a great live music venue.

Besides comfy furniture, good lighting, and a useable mirror, it has a shower and a minifridge, and they put a cooler full of ice cold beers up there before showtime. I've only been in one better green room! The back patio is pretty nice too.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1532131200000,\"ReviewContent\":\"For the most part, I would give this place a 1 star; however, there were a few redeeming factors of this place: The sound and acoustics were good, the merch table was easily accessible, the bar is. . simple, and the headliner selection is incredible. On paper, this should be an excellent venue. Heck, they even let the artists play their full setlists, and each artist with the exception of the headliner started on the minute and promptly. There's even a warning sign talking about people leaving valuables in their cars. Thoughtful if you ask me.Now, that was the good, but what boils down is this: Just how responsible are these people? I can predict that they say that they are responsible for nothing unless something illegal happens here-then they just don't want to be on the short end of the stick. That's the problem here: They're in it for themselves with greed, and their attitudes show it. The door opening time for last Thursday's (it's Saturday morning now) show was 8:30 while the show was supposed to start at 9--1 headliner and two opening acts. As each opening act played for almost an hour, the artist that I'm sure we all came to see did not take the stage until 11 PM, and had a setlist that was twice as long as the others. It apparently was scheduled for the headliner to perform at that time, but I had no idea that was the case until I was there. I took public transportation to get myself to the venue. I was driving from Vacaville to the El Cerrito Plaza BART station and got off right at 16th and Mission station. Now, this venue is not the closest to the 16th and Mission station, but then again, it's not the farthest (about a 20-25 minute walk) and it isn't that far from some of the SF Peninsula's precise bus stops. Problem is, when the main event begins at 11:00 PM, don't expect it to end before midnight (or better yet 11:30 so we can have time to catch the last couple of East Bay stops at BART). Now in some ways, that's just the icing of the non-tasty cake. In line in front of me, an older gentleman and the older middle aged man who greeted said a quick \\\"hi\\\" to one another. After the the older gentleman in front of me asked the greeter how he was doing in a genuine manner, he said something among the lines of \\\"I want you all to bring your ID cards out so we can match your names.\\\" The greeter's vibe and insensitivity was very curt and off-putting for me. He then asked me specifically if he could see my ID as if I was underaged. I've been working in the professional industry for some years now, don't look like I'm under 21 anymore, and haven't been carded at all in recent memory except when people must card everybody just for the sake of policy--so I was carded twice. That too was unpleasant. Also, when I was in the venue and looking on the website, I couldn't help but remind myself just how narcissistic this venue is: From a long list of every performer who played in there from 1997 to present day, to the in house staff using a professional camera with flash taking constant pictures of the performance likely for that same purpose.So to conclude this review, if the event started two hours earlier, I wouldn't have to debate which I wanted to do more: Go home safely and at an affordable price or see the full show of the headliner that I bought the ticket to see in the first place. As I really didn't want to miss the main artist's 20ish song set, I had faith that I could just walk fast enough and catch the 800 all nighter route AC Transit bus between South Van Ness and Market by a few minutes after 1:00 AM when the event ended about 15 minutes after midnight. Unfortunately since it's my first time trying to take that late bus and ever going to this venue, not only did I miss the BART's last departure but also this bus by apparently a few minutes, and just to learn that the next bus wouldn't come till at least an hour or so later. So to avoid panicking, uncertainty, and being worried, I just shelled out a pretty penny I didn't account for on an Uber to take me back to the El Cerrito Plaza station. Wow could that all have been prevented had it started and ended earlier. Considering all of these vehicle break ins I hear about, public transit is the wiser choice in SF and throughout this district, and if they don't start the events and end them at earlier times, I simply cannot justify going to a show out here again. That plus the rude vibes and narcissism they all seem to be emanating, unfortunately it is not acceptable to be a part of all of this or see another performer here until lots of that stuff (especially the times) get better. Thanks for reading my experience here.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1531180800000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Lovely venue, great staff and inexpensive tickets.

It's kinda famous and it is easy to see why.I've seen plenty of bands here.

It's pretty much always in-out with this area which is good news if you're coming into the city. Just be prepared for the never-ending construction on the Bay Bridge on your way out.

Every worthwhile act has gone through Bottom of the Hill at some point in their careers. From Arcade Fire to Mike Park to True Widow, if you are on the way up, chances are you're going to play here when you come through San Francisco.It's a dive. And that's a major part of the venue's charm. It's also tiny, but that just means there isn't a bad view in the house. If you're feeling crowded you can step out to the back patio and still be able to hear and see the show through the window. Oh yeah, and bring cash. That part is important. You gotta bring cash.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1445212800000,\"ReviewContent\":\"This is my FAVORITE venue. Period. I have been visiting this venue for nearly 9 years now (still do even though I live in Sacramento now) and I'm sorry it has taken me so long to write this review guys! This place hosts an array of artists both big and small, which is honestly a treat, like an ice cream dipped in chocolate and then dipped in more chocolate kind of treat. The place is big enough to pull in a crowd, but small enough to feel intimate. You can actually see the band perform from almost every angle and feel like you're a part of something. BOTH stays down to earth by making shows accessible to all ages and keeping ticket prices reasonable. The people are usually awesome whether it be the crowd or the people that work there because we're always there for the same thing. THE MUSIC. The acoustics are solid, which is probably the most important thing. If you can't hear the music or if it isn't fine-tuned, then what's the point, am I right? It does have a dive bar-esque feel, but it's definitely open and clean and has a cute little patio in the back to breathe. First tip: bring CASH if you want to drink. Second tip: Be prepared to be awkwardly intimate with people in the bathroom. It's usually clean, but they fit 2 stalls and a sink in what I feel could be a bedroom closet. I just wanted to say that this place makes me happy and I hope you get a chance to check it out for yourself :)\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1444435200000,\"ReviewContent\":\"The Appearance:While the outside of the venue may not have the greatest curb appeal, the inside certainly packs a punch. The main floor is decorated with vibrant posters for upcoming shows and calendars displaying the rich history of bands that stepped foot on stage. The dim lighting almost gives the vibe of a jazzy night club you would see in the movies. Just beyond the stage is a nook for bands to put their merch on display and get in touch with the fans. Outside the double doors is a patio to get fresh air or have a cig. The patio has some size to it, but if it is a sold out show the patio can become quickly congested. Especially in between bands when everyone is sweated up from moving around on the main floor. The Bar:The bar is fairly proportioned to the size of the venue. The staff is very friendly and seems to enjoy what they do. Service is very quick and drink prices seem to be below average for the San Francisco area. The Experience:The size of the main floor is absolutely perfect. It is big enough to pack in a sizable crowd, but small enough to provide an intimate musical experience. Anywhere you stand seems to provide a great view. You wont have to worry about a pole or crazy fixture blocking your vision. The sound is always crisp and never overpowering (something that may occur in a tight venue). I cannot recall an instance where the volume was too loud. The area closest to the stage tends to be a place for those who want to dance\\/ skank\\/ rage (depending on the music). It allows those who want a place to move around some room, while providing those who don't, space to watch comfortably. There may be moments things get tight, but overall it is a very chill venue to see a show.For Bands:The first major drawback is the lack of storage space for instrument cases. The majority of them needed to be stacked against the wall near the merch area. Not that anyone would ever mess around with your stuff, but these days you never really know. Members do receive a free drink which helps to get the night started. The sound guy is extremely professional and takes the time to do the job right. This includes taping down cords, adjusting mics, and other minor details some venues over look. The sound guy proactively adjusts the levels to ensure your sound is the very best. This is a venue that takes shows very seriously. The payoff is always a great time with plenty of memories. The Verdict:Highly recommend you give this venue a shot, whether you are an artist or an audience member. Can't wait to play my next show there. June 2016 cannot come soon enough!\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1444176000000,\"ReviewContent\":\"This venue is definitely for a younger crowd.

Grab some dinner at either location, then head over to this bar for good music in a relaxing setting.We came here on for the 10th anniversary of Mae's Everglow tour. The bar is cash only but there is an ATM machine. The layout of the bar incorporated a bunch of themes that somehow works when all thrown together--i.e. Christmas lights, skulls on the wall, and potted plants. It makes you feel like you've found an intimate, cozy hipster bar that was too hipster to judge you because you discovered their new hangout spot.There are tables in the back where people had their Macbooks set up. The window treatment is also interesting, reminding me of a house straight from a Dr. Seuss book. The patio area is relaxing as well. There is a staircase but it leads to storage space. No one seems to know that so occasionally you'll see people walking upstairs, thinking they're heading to a cool spot.

Was there to check out a band, Sick of Sarah, who were performing for the night. A small and cosy venue space ideal for smaller bands. The bar only accepts cash, likewise cash payment for the entry fee if any. They do have an ATM just next to the entrance if you didnt carry cash.Though the place appear kind of old and rundown, the sound system was good. The bar carries the typical alcoholic drink and a limited list of beers. Drinks are cheap, beers were at $6\\/bottle. Tried to request for Mojito but they do not have any mint. So ended up with two Strongbow cider which worked out well too. Two girls next to us ask for their \\\"special shots\\\" listed on the wall, the bartender whispered to them that he got no clue what it was. Thought it was pretty hilarious, apparently he was just stepping in before the real bartender comes in. The streets were pretty dark by the time we got there, it appears to be located in the midst of an industrial area. Ideal for a music venue so there wouldn't have much sound\\/music limit restrictions. There are plenty of parking along the streets so that's great for those who drive.

It's small and charming, stuck in a random spot in the city, and if not for the huge blue sign they've got blazing up the front of the building, it'd be nearly forgotten. But, it's my favorite music venue in the city because of the intimacy you get with being so close to the musicians, and with the great sound they have here.Just to show my concert cred, I've been here for Seeking Empire twice, Asobi Seksu, and the Colourist. Every band I've seen here has been incredible, and I've been literally footsteps away from them performing. It is the best sounding venue I've been to in the city. Everything just feels crisp, and loud as well. Feel like I need ear plugs sometimes when I'm here, but that's a good thing right?The venue itself is small, but not small enough to feel claustrophobic. They've also got a nice little patio right behind the stage that you can go out and grab some fresh air or a smoke. Their bar is pretty stocked, and they've got all your typical favorite beers on tap. It's rare that a venue will sway me into going to a concert, but Bottom of the Hill has that unique effect on me!

The minute I saw this club I knew I'd like it. It's really tiny, probably the smallest one I've been to in SF. It's in a seedy looking neighborhood, but that just lends to the charm (and the upside is that there's plenty of street parking). Inside, it is exactly how a rock and roll club should look. Lots of cool lighting and posters all over the place, and the acoustics are excellent. The front part of the club is the main floor, stage, and bar, and there's a nice little lounge with a fireplace in back and a Patio just outside the lounge for smoking. Some reviews said there were no ins and outs, but when I asked if I could go put something in the car they had no problem with it. The staff was great, and when I requested some reserve seating at the bar because my wife is on crutches and can't stand for long periods of time, they were very helpful and accommodating (Thanks Lynn for hooking us up!).The bar is cash only, but not terribly expensive at all. The Liquor assortment is pretty standard and there are no specialty cocktails, but the ladies behind the bar were willing to make anything I requested as long as they had the ingredients on hand to make it. The place is so small that band members can be found hanging out before and after their set, so I got to meet Kam from Chain Gang (super cool dude), and it was just a very chill, laid back place. I think my only complaint was that they opened kind of late (doors 8:30, first band at 9:00), so with 3 bands playing and a cutoff at midnight, it felt kind of rushed. I would have liked to have gotten a longer set out of Chain Gang, but they did awesome with the hour (barely) that they had. I think if they had just opened an hour earlier it would have been perfect. Some people also said in their reviews that the bands played way too loud, but I didn't think the noise levels were excessive. All 3 bands sounded good, but none of them were painfully loud, but always a good idea to bring some earplugs anyway.

Be sure to bring a jacket or have a Lyft coming to get you so that you're not roundhouse kicking everyone else out of the way for flippant taxi drivers who accidentally wander out that far.  Other than that, over-priced drinks (as expected with any venue), cool patio in the back to smoke in (and you can still see the back of the stage and hear the music), and a bunch of creepy old masks and seemingly ceramic heads that line the top of the bar- you aren't tripping they're actually truly there.

And boy was everyone and my random brain right about this place!It is a bar\\/restaurant, and they do all ages and 21+ shows. My friend being of that annoying almost-but-not-quite-yet age, we went to an all ages show and it was surprisingly not overpopulated with teenagers. They've got a front room with the bar itself and a few tables and chairs which widens out to the low stage, where you as the audience can get up close and personal with the artists if you so choose. Bathrooms are just past the kitchen (a long window in which you order their decent sized food menu from) and as the night goes on, get grosser and smellier. Following the stinky bathroom corridor is another room with more chairs, tables, a fireplace (not lit during my visit), and doors leading to their outdoor patio for smokers or lovers of the fresh air, which also has some seating. I enjoyed going to the back room and relaxing but still enjoying the music.This place is cash only, bar and food, and while they do have an ATM it charges you $2.95 for each withdrawal so I recommend bringing some cash along.Drinks are pretty average, slightly overpriced bar drinks. My first drink was kinda yuck (but that is more my taste, I decided to try a new drink and it had ginger beer in it and apparently I do not like ginger beer) and my second drink (that I knew I liked) was good, but crazy strong, I couldn't finish it because I wanted to be able to drive home later. I got a quesadilla to sober up and it was perhaps the best quesadilla I've ever had. But I was drunk, so everything probably tasted delicious.The bands: I saw Young the Moon, The Districts, Big Tree, and Guy Fox. All some pretty bomb dignity indie bands whom I greatly enjoyed. All of the bands mingled with the crowds before and after their set, so it was great to be able to interact with them and tell them how much we loved their tunes.

Great show.As 1am neared (not 2am, as they list their hours onYelp! AND their website shows), an announcement was made that they were closing.  My two friends went to the restroom, and N and I waited for them where we had all been standing.  When they started ushering people out, I was going to find them to tell them we needed to get going, and one of the waitresses (older, scraggly blonde, hat) condescendingly said, \\\"oh, you need to move this way, sweetie ... \\\" pushing me to the exit.  I told her I was looking for two friends I had been waiting for, to which she responded, \\\"oh, okay, well ... I guarantee they'll get out, so you need to go this way,\\\" and proceeded to try to push us out the door.  RUDE. One friend came out of the restroom (I also had her wristlet which she inadvertently left on the counter - probably because she thought we'd be there waiting for her), and she wanted to wait for our last friend in the restroom (her GF).  Same scraggly haired lady emerged from the kitchen and tried to tell her, \\\"Yeah, you need to move THIS way, Sweetie,\\\" to which my friend replied, \\\"Well, my girlfriend's in the bathroom and I'm going to wait until she gets out!\\\"  Scraggles, shocked, says, \\\"WELL, I guess you just made a statement!\\\" and went off somewhere else.After a cover charge and *hours* of drinks, these people act like complete idiotic jerks to their patrons.

The crowd is young and cool and way hip, so you get to feel younger by proxy. There are like 5 chairs total in the whole place, but if you are geriatrically inclined like me, you could easily grab one because all the cool young urbanite indie lovers are standing to watch the show.

They have some extra \\\"breathing room\\\" in the back with plenty of seating to eat, drink, or have a chat -- you can still hear the music, but can't see the stage from there.  They also have a little outside patio -- popular with the smokers, so I don't use it much, but it's nice that it's there.My favorite things about this place are the kitschy 60's B-movie\\/beatnik vibe (hard to describe... sort of a Lost in Space meets Kerouac meets Beetlejuice kind of decor), the offering of local and indie\\/underground bands (sometimes very popular in their own right, though -- Black Moth Super Rainbow and School of Seven Bells, for example), and the low prices (tix about $8-15 usually -- no crazy Ticketmaster style \\\"service fees\\\" for advanced purchase, just a couple bucks extra), with reasonable drinks but cash-only bar. I like perusing their calendar and in any given month I can always find a new up-and-coming or under-the-radar band I dig.

Great music and it sounded great at the venue.  I like the feel of the bar and how it's decorated, but I'm not too fond of the bartender I had.  Perhaps she was having a tough day or something, but she wasn't very friendly and kinda just shoved the drink at me.  I still made sure to tip her, but her attitude didn't really change the next time I came back to get more drinks.  Weird.One thing I love about this place is they have food.  It makes things super convenient--you don't have to go elsewhere to find yourself a drinking snack.  Make sure you have cash though!  This place doesn't accept credit cards, and the ATM has a surcharge of $2.35 or something to withdrawal money.Lastly, I'm not sure if it's the neighborhood or the people I met were just unlucky, but a poor family came out after the show to find that their SUV had been broken into.

There's also a back patio which is great because it has a high window from the back of the stage.  You can hear the muffled sound and usually see the drummer a little bit.  The bathrooms could use some work, but it's not surprising compared to the place.  They also serve food here which is great because there's nothing around.  I've never ordered from there, but the menu sounds pretty good for bar food.  They showcase a lot of local talent (and some un-talent), which always makes for a good time.  At the last concert I went to, the sound guys seemed to be having a hard time getting the band's monitors right, and the mic even shocked one of the singers.

If you like indie rock music, experimental or sometimes even electronic, or any non-mainstream music in general, this is the place for you. The ambience is chill, and the lighting is nice. There's a  cool patio outside if you want to  relax or have a conversation. You have to remember that the ambience is kind of random -- the bands who play really attract a specific kind of audience, but you will be surprised in a good way.Typically there's a cover of $8 - 15, but it also depends on the artists who are performing.  It doesn't get too busy, but again this all depends on the show.  Parking is usually not an issue.I highly recommend this place if you want to get a real taste of urban music scene, but of course it's very diverse as well.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1324339200000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Really cool, intimate venue with awesome shows.

This place was meant for the punk rock scene, but it'll rock to indie alternative too every now and then.  Enter this dark room, pay to the left, then grab a drink to the right.  Drinks are affordable, and main floor is pretty big.  This place, I always need to wear ear plugs.  Make sure to pay the bartender a buck to get some.  Lounging is in the back and the very back is the smoking area.  They have this stairway outside that goes up to the rooftop for additional partying, however, its exclusive so I have yet to venture up there.  Make sure to say hi to the local Bottom of the Hill kitty in the smoking area, and pray that he\\/she doesn't get lung cancer.  Street parking is readily available, and its away from the downtown madness, so its low key and ideal.  All in all, a great venue to check out up and coming artist, local bands and just to have a rocking time.  No doubt!\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1316995200000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Cozy little spot that makes for great band-enjoying. Though I didn't see the point in getting a hand stamp in addition to the paper bracelet, the logic torment it caused was eased by the strongness of the drinks. Holy cow, did I get my money's worth! I had to stop enjoying my drinks after the second round and was grateful that they replenished the complimentary water as often as they did. The bathroom left much to be desired but it's not like I really go out of my way to watch bands in places with pristine bathrooms. The stall doors closed (sort of), there was plenty of TP, and the toilets flushed- so it was adequate.

The place is small, though bigger than other venues I've been to in the city.

Generally, the sound guy does a great job. (Although some times it's just too darn loud--bring earplugs if you value your hearing!) Bar service is okay too, though on a busy night getting to the bar is nearly impossible and you'll have to wait for a while. It's a popular destination, and thus comes with all of the benefits and curses of being one.I almost always have a good time at this venue. However, I did have an incredibly infuriating experience ordering tickets online. I went through the incredibly shifty-looking ticket ordering page (that's linked through paypal) placed by order and received a booking number. Ostensibly, I had tickets! I even took a screen shot of the order page for good measure.However, when I showed up at the venue I was told I was not on the will call list and that I couldn't get in. I showed both the door man and the manager my booking number, and showed them the screen shot. But it was to no avail. I was told that their online ordering was a \\\"foolproof\\\" system and that I should have checked my credit card statement to confirm that the tickets were purchased.After checking my statement it did turn out that I had NO tickets, despite what I was led to believe on the website. Shame on me! Clearly their website not so foolproof, but since it's the bartender's pet project she's awfully defensive of it!My beef is that it's uncharacteristic for a web site to imply that you've booked your tickets without being billed, and that the bartender was so unsympathetic and uncompromising to a loyal customer.To Bottom of the Hill: fix your \\\"foolproof\\\" website, and I'll fix this review.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1304121600000,\"ReviewContent\":\"The prices were pretty good here on drinks and they have a good selection.

A lot of small band coming through this place on their way to bigger and better things, and a lot of bands come that you discover that you would otherwise have never heard before. The venue is intimate, small, cozy, and you can go over and give the band members a high five right afterwards. In terms of the other parts of the venue: the drinks are decent (they have guinness on tap, which always makes my day), and the staff are friendly, and the crowd is always fun and not usually too douchey. (I'm also completing this review just so I can mark the shiny new \\\"hipster\\\" checkbox that yelp has now)The only downsides are that the the sound system could be (a lot) better. One band I went to see had a female vocalist, who was completely blown out by the sound system. As a bonus, from the vantage point of on top of the hill that this venue is on the bottom of of, the stage is beneath ground level, therefore, you can check out bands while they're still, literally, underground\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1302393600000,\"ReviewContent\":\"This place is my perfect music venue.

They have a small outdoor patio that you can go hang out on and there are table ledges on the walls for your to pony up a seat and eat.

They have Anchor Steam and Pyramid on tap. Worries = none. There's also a patio out back if you need some air. They have food that I haven't gotten to try yet. Don't know too much about that.

So we just waited until we saw other civilization to get out and get in line. Parking is also weird. Hopefully you can find some on the street near the venue, but you probably have to get there significantly earlier than the show itself.When we entered, I was surprised at how narrow the standing room was. Scared that I wouldn't be able to see the performances, lo and behold I was right at the front even though I hadn't been the first in line.I was afraid the sound system would suck, given that I was right in front of the speaker. It turned out to be just fine, and the sound quality was pretty good. Maybe it was just the artist herself, but set up did take a long time and we all got pretty anxious.My friend got a beer and I think it was reasonably priced.

If I get the hall pass on that one, rest assured one of the first items I'll work on is seeing more live music at Bottom of the Hill.There's a litany of reasons why I strive for more face time at this legendary Potrero Hill music venue, and for ease of reading (or maybe a carefully constructed mirage to mask the fact that I'm afflicted with a mild case of the bottle flu this morning and not feeling overly creative at the moment), I'll supply a short but steady list of why it's one of the greatest places in town to see art in motion:1. It's such a warm room with fantastic acoustics. Most definitely one of the best sounding venues in SF with a continually stellar line up of both local and national acts. 2. It's super easily accessible via the 22 or 10 Muni lines (sure there's more I'm missing as well).3. Some of the cheapest drinks that you'll find in a live concert venue. $3.50 for PBR on draft and other American staples in the bottle. 4. They have an awesome staff who never seem to wake up on the wrong side of the bed before coming into work.5. A great patio for having a smoke break (if that's how you roll), or just getting some fresh air if you're not feeling some artsy fartsy, shoe gazer opening act.6. They have some pretty damn good food as well! Even a few vegetarian options by way of veggie burgers, veggie hot dogs, hummus plates, and a gourmet option of grilled purple potato tacos marinated in their al pastor spicy broth (obviously before being drenched atop a pile of swine). Heck, you might even ask if it's vegan, as it very well might be if you exclude the sour cream and cheese that comes along with it.I'm sure there are way, way more notables to add in the future, but really - if this doesn't convince someone to want to stop what they're doing to take a peek at their concert calendar, they're better off just staying at home.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1297814400000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Had THEEE best time at a show here.

That said, I saw the same band two days apart both here and at the Troubadour in Hollywood and (strangely) they sounded much better here.Keep in mind that this venue is not really in the most awesome place in town and if you scare easy either have a rental or call a taxi and wait inside.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1292371200000,\"ReviewContent\":\"So there must be some disconnect here between what I'm seeing\\/hearing and what other people are seeing\\/hearing. Surface level stuff: They get great bands to play here, ticket prices are reasonable, parking is sketchy, venue is small and intimate.The sound, however, is awful. I've been here twice: once for the Polysics and once for Kate Nash. I understand that the Polysics are all about distortion and noise. I get that. That's why I came back to see Kate Nash. When the Polysics and Kate Nash have the same sound quality, something is up.The music was deafeningly loud. Unrestrained, distorted, impossible to enjoy without earplugs (which I definitely prefer to go without at most places, but here it was necessary).  I had a seriously difficult time convincing myself to go see Kate Nash at the Warfield, but I'm glad I did because everything there was fabulous. The problem wasn't Kate Nash, it was Bottom of the Hill. How can a concert venue get away with sound this horrible?I will not be coming back. What's the point in spending money to see someone you like get completely distorted and skewed by noise?\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1291507200000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Bottom of the Hill is a rockin' good time.It's a great venue: not too big nor too small.

I applaud them for booking as many shows here as they do, even if some are not of the quality I would attend. I love seeing pop-punk bands here because it creates a small atmosphere that lets you share the night with the band you're seeing. You're almost certain to meet the members (unless they spend the whole night upstairs), but for the most part they have to walk through people in order to play the show, so if you wanted to, and if they were willing, it's easy to talk to someone here, although it's typically pretty loud.The sound here is okay, not the best, but definitely up there for the type of place it is. The stage is a good height and I'd be surprised if there's one person in the whole place who can't see what's going on. Not the best on parking, and my friend once got her car broken into while parked for a show there, but for the most part it's best to get a spot on that street, in front of the venue, because if you're parked down an alley, those are the sketch areas.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1286150400000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Great venue with a \\\"neighborhood\\\" vibe.

They are a kick ass band that rocked the place.  If it weren't for the Band of Brotherz and all of the other great music that this place books I would NEVER come here.  In fact, I probably won't go back to this place again.  Why?  Well, when my girlfriend was ordering her drink from one bartender, the other bartender was clearing the bar of drinks and took her money that she had laid down to pay for the drink from the other bartender.  When she asked why he just took her money, he said \\\"what money\\\".  When she persisted he shrugged and took $5.00 out of the register and just laid it down in front of her and walked off.  Then when she got her drink, she took a sip and while she was putting her change in her pocket, the same dude cleared the bar again and poof - her drink was gone.  Again, she asked what the hell he was doing and he said, just clearing the bar.  When my other friend was at the bar to order drinks, same dude bartender skimmed him on his change.  When my friend called him on it, the bar manager came over and defended skimmer dude.  When my friend didn't drop it, bar manager tossed my friend out of the bar.   Bottom line for Bottom of the Hill, DON'T leave your money on the bar, because the bartenders assume all is fair game.   Be aware of what money you're giving them and count your change and finally DON'T leave your drink on the bar.  I think that these guys are counting on the patrons either being too drunk or too high to notice that they're being fleeced.  I didn't see anyone else mention this in all of the other reviews, but after the show, when word got around about my two friend's experience, other people piped up that they thought the same thing had happened to them, but that they must have been mistaken.  Too bad.  Pretty sweet deal for the bartenders, not so much for the patrons or the owners of Bottom of the Hill.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1281571200000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Good viewing from any place in the room and great accoustics, also the people are usually very chill here, my favorite place to watch a show\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1281052800000,\"ReviewContent\":\"A place where you can go to a punk rock show and actually have reasonably priced, decent-to-good mixed drinks?! Yes! And that's only one of the reasons why I love you so much, Bottom of the Hill.Seriously, this is my favorite venue in the city, with thee Parkside coming in second now that Annie's Social Club is closed. Bottom of the Hill is nearly perfect. You can have good drinks if you're not a beer\\/shot person, there's a smoking patio so you never have to leave the venue (good for those under 21, who aren't allowed ins & outs), the ventilation is good, parking is super easy, it's easy to drive to, fairly easy to bus to (but not so easy to bus away from late at night), the people who work here are amiable (one of 'em sang \\\"Let it Be\\\" this one time I was wearing a Beatles shirt), all sorts of good bands play here for usually less than $20, and the sound is decent.I've been to over two dozen shows here - probably a hell of a lot more than that - and even when the bands sucked, I still enjoyed myself, which might have something to do with the fact that the bartenders can mix decent drinks, unlike other places where I've been to shows. There was a good deal of confusion the first time I got up the nerve to ask for an AMF here, which was a few years ago, but with a little discussion, they got it right. I've since realized that it's probably not the best idea to drink a toxic-looking, aquamarine concoction while seeing, say, the Dwarves or No Use For a Name or something, since at least a quarter of it will end up sloshed onto my person when it gets rowdy, but it's nice to know that you can have one, right?Oh, and if you're not planning on getting a tasty, albeit usually greasy, snack at the venue, definitely eat beforehand so that you don't end up down the street at the Connecticut Yankee like every other schmuck who goes to Bottom of the Hill with an empty stomach, and then ends up having an absurdly named (who wants to say \\\"I'd like the pee-wee herman\\\" when they could say \\\"I'll have a pulled pork sandwich\\\"?), mediocre meal at a sports bar.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1280275200000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Good music and the booze is also cheap out here, we had a great time spending our free time out there after our hard day at work, its has become our pass time to go out there and listen to some good music and have our drink, they select good musicians to pay out there,\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1280102400000,\"ReviewContent\":\"This is a great small venue!My hubby and I saw the Toadies.

The huge downside of this club for me is how crowded it gets. I'm 5 foot 2 so if I want to see the band I need to stand near the front or to the side of the stage. If you stand to the side people will pretty much constantly walk past you and\\/or bump into you. The plus side is the food. I was pretty stoked the first time I went to be able to order a hummus plate. As a hungry vegan I wasn't expecting to find something I could eat on their menu.

Wow. Places just don't seem to have the staying power they used to, but BOTH has been doing something right for a LONG time and I hope they are here for twenty more years at least! They have become an institution. I've seen so many amazing shows here, I don't even know where to begin. Most notable, to me, was the last Guitar Wolf show in the Bay Area before Billy died and one of the last Bay Area performances by Morphine (1991 or 1992, I think) before Mark Sandman died. Those performances will stay with me always. Billy even gave me his bass pick which I keep in a special place on my night stand. RIP, Billy, you are missed. Man, what other shows have I seen here? Polkacide, Dead Hensons, Thee Coachwhips, Polysics, Acid Mothers Temple, Three Day Stubble, Lord Loves a Working Man, The Billy Nayer Show, Faun Fables, Mermen, El Vez, Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, this list goes on and on. They know how to book good music, that's for damn sure! The ticket prices are always reasonable, the drinks aren't too over-priced with a good selection of beer\\/liquor, they have food to coat your drinking belly, and they have a nice back area to smoke in. My only complaint is the tiny ass bathroom. Two stalls for the entire ladies room. It can be quite the back-up in there on busy nights and it is here that I came up with my brilliant idea of Depends for music fans but they would be called something cheesy like 'Rockers!'. Don't want to miss your favorite band's next set but have to piss like a racehorse?

I have had a few problems with drunken douchebags who don't know how to act in public and who flail their elbows around wildly without care to the craniums of those around them that they land upon, but a return elbow in the gut and a fierce look usually works. Back the fuck off, I'm an old school punk bitch and will TAKE YOU DOWN. I'd give them five stars except for the drunken idiot factor. They don't really seem to deal with people acting like jerks and ruining everyone else's good time very well.

Granted, I wouldn't suggest doing keg stands or anything like that because you do want to respect the artist(s) that are performing.

The bartenders are really good at getting to everybody in a timely fashion.  I never had to wait more than 2 minutes at the bar.

That sounds weird, but its true!The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because it is so far away from everything.  If you are coming from the freeway, it is close, but if you live in the actual city, it seems soooooooo far!

The venue is small but they don't pack the place super tight, there's an area in the back that has some restaurant-style seating and you can still hear the band well from there. I ate some chicken tacos that were very generous (for 6 bucks it's a good thing they were), and had some pints to enjoy which were also well priced. I just saw two great shows two days in a row here, on the first day was Vivian Girls, which was a group i've never heard of before but sounded great! The second day I saw the duo Eyedea and Abilities doing what they do best, and they did! When I got up this morning my head was still ringing with beats, they threw down some fresh shit!

The most exciting time to see a band is right when they're on the verge of breaking out and becoming well known. Bottom of the Hill is a smallish venue that aims to book lots of bands, many local, while they're still on their way up.The result is usually an intimate show, with bands that enjoy performing and want to make a name for themselves and a crowd that's more involved with seeking out new artists and live shows.The setup here is pretty sweet as well. I could pick out each instrument in a 6 piece band without even trying, and there's a sizable lounge and back porch where you can spy on how far along the set rotation is.The people who work here are totally sweet also. Here's an example: after last night's show ended there was a dude out cold on the sidewalk around the corner. The door guy happened to notice and immediately began to fret over taking care of the poor dude and getting him inside and taken care of, in spite of the fact that the show ran late and everyone was trying to close up and this was no small passed out dude.I've seen: Battlehooch w\\/ Judgment Day, Gliss w\\/ Morning Ater Girls,Fuck Buttons, and These Arms are Snakes here.Great bands, small space, excellent acoustics, clever setup, cool crowd, employees that nurse you back to health, good times!\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1264291200000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Definitely one of the cooler small venues I've been to in San Francisco. At $10 to see a Swedish swing hip hop plus two decent opening bands (and $3.50 for a PBR) it's not going to break your wallet either. The area seems a bit sketchy, so drive if you can (ample parking) or take a cab.  If the show I went to was any indication, openers start at 10:00pm, so don't expect the headliner to finish until 1:30am or so.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1264118400000,\"ReviewContent\":\"The bands were good. not great, but good. They were fairly famous, but more of the grunge indie rock and less of the folky or popy indie rock that I prefer - that could have just been due to the night we went. By the time it got late, there were too many people. People were closer than elbow to elbow. My girlfriend and I had to push and shove just to get to a different part of the floor, then a group of drunk people were yelling at me and my girlfriend all night. Regardless of those lame guys (which we saw there again the next night), I felt that it was so crowded that in a fire, I would probably get trampled before reaching an exit, and I'm not usually a claustrophobic guy. Although we didn't know the bands, I had heard \\\"of\\\" a couple of them. This place is said to get a lot of good bands. It was a fun place full of people from 21-35. It would be even better if it wasn't so crowded, but it was still pretty good. The food isn't great, but it's better than going hungry :).

I've seen some great bands here (local favs like my friends in Mi Ami, Deerhoof, Brilliant Colors) and other indie acts (Outhud, Cause Co-motion!, Crystal Stilts). This place is a venue where bands can play loud and you can still chill out and have a non-shouting conversation with your friends on the patio or over a game of pool.All you need is less than 20 bucks in your pocket and you can have a super smooth bike ride out here where the people aren't pretentious and you can catch a great, local live show.Even if the band playing that night sucks mad donkey balls, this place would still be awesome.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1260662400000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Why haven't I written a review of this place before?

The venue is intimate, but not too small.  (Although, I've been at sold out shows where it DID feel small when I was being crushed against a wall.)  The bar has a good selection of beers on tap and there's a kitchen if you feel like ordering food.  I also love the decor...posters from old shows on the walls and holiday lights all around.Best of all is that there's ample street parking, so you're not going to have to circle for a half hour.  If you don't have a car and have to rely on MUNI to get around, the 22 Fillmore stops just a block away on (across from the Connecticut Yankee).As always, I wish there were more barstools, but I'll have to settle for getting to shows early to nab a spot to park my rear end for at least part of the evening....\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1258675200000,\"ReviewContent\":\"I saw the last 20 Minute Loop show here!!!Plenty of street parking.

I try my best to go to around two shows a month so I can safely say I've seen a good amount of what San Francisco has to offer.  I saw Jens Lekman here a few months ago and it was one of the best shows I've seen in a long time. True, Jens Lekman never disappoints, but it's the intimacy of this venue that is its strongest point. Even if you come late to the show and find yourself in what would be the back row behind the tallest dude in the place, you're still close to the stage (and closer to the bar).  I'm not sure of the capacity, but it can't be anything over 200\\/250, which makes for a cozy collective. Besides the main bar area, there is a great space in the back in the back if you're just hanging out, along with a medium-sized patio for those Potrero Hill sulky evenings.An experience at a music venue can definitely depend on who the act is so its difficult to gauge the venue from night to night.  For instance, Jens Lekman, an adorable-Swedish-native-chamber-pop-charmer's show will be a lot different than say, the Everytime I Die show.  But I look at it for what it's worth: Bottom of the Hill is a classic, small, divey joint that's all about music, be it big names to the virtually unknown, jingle-jangle to supersonic boom.  So if you're going to see the likes of GWAR, well, prepare to be pushed around a bit.Oh, and the beer is cold and cheap and delicious.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1257120000000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Awesome venue.

It doesn't quite have the history of the Gilman, but in falling just short of that, it has a great reputation all its own. It's probably one of the 5 coolest clubs around and being tiny as all hell that means a lot. You can see everything from a Girlfriend Experience show to the latest Airborne Toxic Event show. Lots of bands make a pass through the city still being relatively unknown and when they sell this place out they sometimes are forced to play larger venues just to fit more fans inside. But, when you want an intimate show featuring your favorite band the Bottom of the Hill will surely be the spot to look. Whether you're searching through Myspace music or just going directly to the Bottom of the Hill website, you're sure to find at least one thing you'll want to go to each month.

No one wants to be spending time waiting in line for something when they could be watch a show. When a show becomes too rowdy you can find refuge the outdoor patio or seating area behind the stage.

It wasn't like a regular show, where you're kind of far away from the stage, and the band is behind-the-scenes all the time except when they're onstage...it's more like you're hanging out with your friends who happen to be playing music there. I talked to my favorite musicians, danced with them, saw them eat dinner at the table next to me, etc. The stage is small, and pretty low, so you feel a closer connection with the band. Everyone there was very friendly, and I enjoyed myself. (And only $12 at the door for my ticket!)There's a smoking patio, seating for dining, bar, plus the area in front of the stage for dancing and general mingling. Slight downside: the bathroom is tinyyy. I think it was only one stall (maybe two), and barely room for the sink. So if you feel like you'll have to use the restroom at some point and see that there isn't a line, take the advantage and go then.

The Bottom of the Hill had a very relaxed and laid back atmosphere which I like. It doesn't have all that much seating except for in the back, but you can't see the stage. My friends and I hung out in the back and had a couple of beers and then headed out front when the second opening band came on stage. It was nice to hang out in the back because we had space to move and some of the band members were hanging out back there too. Once we moved out front it was shoulder to shoulder. I definitely liked that the bar was fast. We never had to wait more than a couple of minutes to order. Bottom of the Hill also had drinks in every price range starting at $3 for a beer. I really enjoyed both of the opening bands that played the night that I went, but the sound was off with the main band that played. The mixture between the instruments and vocals with the opening bands was really good, but the instruments in the main band were so loud that I couldn't hear what they were singing and it was killer on the ears. All in all this place was pretty cool and I enjoyed the music. The calendar on the website lists the bands that are playing and the cover charge for that night.

Limbeck was playing their \\\"Delicacy of Living Modestly\\\" stuff and it was real good.  Despite the weird San Franciscans (no offense) and obscure location, the venue is pretty okay.

I usually go when there's a good post-rock band playing but there are occasional metal bands as well.  No matter what bands I've seen, the crowds are always pretty diverse from my experience (no certain \\\"scenes\\\" or whatever dominating the place) and you meet interesting people. Sometimes they'll have some neat publications around, which I read while the next band is setting up. I like how they have self-serving water, you could get dehydrated at shows sometimes (I wish more venues\\/clubs did this!). Parking is rarely a problem in this part of the city (another plus!). I just noticed for the first time last night that there were a whole bunch of Jesus and Mary stuff when you look up near the ceiling, not sure how long those have been there, I never expected to see that ever so it gives the place a weird charm.  One last note, I'd recommend buying your tickets online asap if a popular band is playing an all ages shows or else you'll be one of those annoying beggars asking everyone in line if they got an extra ticket.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1226620800000,\"ReviewContent\":\"This place is the real deal.

If its your first time to Bottom of the Hill you might think its nothing special but after a few visits you will no doubt fall under its spell. Its got that way of making you feel real comfortable like its the home you grew up in and you are visiting for a good home cooked meal in the form of some great bands. The atmosphere of the place is generally made up of people that have been to many shows at Bottom of the Hill and love going to shows in general. The drinks are pretty cheap and the bartenders are always nice and generous with the drinks. The patio in the back is great for relaxing with friends and sitting out some of those bands you might not be into while waiting for the ones you are into. Parking is no problem at all.If you go to a lot of shows in the city then no doubt this place will always be on the top of the list as favorite places to see a band.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1214697600000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Besides the location being a little scary on a cold dark night, it's fun once you're inside. It a really raw, ear-pounding, intimate experience to come see bands play at this venue. Depending on the band, it can fill up quick. It's definitely all about the music here. If you're just a couple of high school girls like we were, just make sure you have a ride back home.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1214265600000,\"ReviewContent\":\"They just might have the best soundsystem in the city. The people here (employees and patrons alike) are generally great.They get great music from all musical orientations.But... I hate their decor. Oh look that thing on the wall is crooked! AMAZING!

The sound is great, the bartenders are veterans, and its nice to cool down outside on the patio after rawking out. If you're in a band, however, the backstage is actually just a tiny room upstairs with a couch,  bathroom, and a fridge with some cold beers in it.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1213142400000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Got an email from friend in LA that the band he's in is performing here.

The band before them was cool too and they were all caravaning together on their tour.Great patio, but only because it was pretty empty. I'm anti-crowd.Decent sized medium venue, no air flow, too hot. There is lots of parking around here and it doesn't feel like a good area because it's pretty dark and mostly industrial. I definitely recommend driving or taxing home at least. People are around outside nearby bars, but our cars were fine.

It fits a few hundred, max, so you get a very cozy feeling with the band even when you're closer to the back. And if things get too crowded, there's a little patio area in back where you can chill and grab a quick smoke... very nice.The only problem is this place is somewhat in the middle of nowhere. No public transport nearby, so you're either taxiing it or someone's DD for the night.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1212278400000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Rockin'... That's all I got to say.Venue is nice and cozy. Doesn't have that grimy, dirty, little hole in the wall feeling even though its kind of on the small side in terms of the main floor, but that doesn't take away from the music and atmosphere. Everything just melds together decoratively. The acoustics is great. The speaker system is up to par in terms of straight up blasting.The neighborhood its in feels very safe. Its kind of in an industrial area so there's not too much around in terms of city folk. Only locals and the fellow fans of the bands playing that night. So I felt safe parking my car outside.Smoking area is in the back and to the left, which leads to an outside area. Rad thing about that is that the outside area is where the main dressing room is for the artists. I was lucky enough to meet the guitarists for Fall of Troy, and Foxy Shazam. Along with the pianist for Foxy Shazam who is a total character himself on stage and in person with his crazy looking beard.Overall, this is a great venue.  Will come here again for another show for sure!\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1211587200000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Unpretentious venue where the focus is on the music, as it should be.  It may be small, but it has a lot of heart.  I like small, it lets you get closer to the music, the action, the soul.  Great place to see and support local acts as well as the touring ones.Parking was a breeze! And I felt safe going back to my car after a show when I was alone.  It may not be the best part of the city, but its not the worst.  Be careful of course, but you should be fine.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1211068800000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Reminds me of The Empty Bottle back in Chicago.

I went to see Dillinger Escape Plan, and security was great. When they realized that we had 2 more tickets, and weren't going to use them, they set us up to sell our tickets to some of the kids freezing outside. The show was sold out, and some kids had been waiting all day. I got to make some kids' day, and they paid for my drinks at the show. We were able to stand RIGHT at the front of the stage, and had an AMAZING time!!! Parking was also unbelievably easy, but I realized later, that it's because I was one of the few 30-somethings there. Apparently, I listen to the same music as most teenage boys. And their moms drove them......\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1209772800000,\"ReviewContent\":\"I had a great time checking out Audrey Sessions at the hill last night.

This place usually feels really unpretentious, with the staff, the crowd and the kinds of bands that play here and I'm all for that, because the LAST THING THIS EFFING CITY NEEDS is more pretentiousness.But minus just the one star for last night when I went to see XBXRX and my 23 YEAR OLD AND NOT UNDERAGE friend having his REAL AND VALID driver's license turned away because the holograms were a bit off?  REAL anal-sauce* about IDs apparently, because he didn't even know his ID was weird (IF it really is) until last night.They still let him in, they just x-ed his hands.

For every four shows you attend here, one of them will have the next band that explodes onto VH1 or MTV. I love that when its jam packed, you can just watch the group from the side of the stage. Even when its full it only feels like no more than 100 people. Waaaaaay better than Slim's. Avoid that place. Anyways, from nu metal shows in 96 ( Stuck Mojo) to hipster bands like IAMX in 2007, this place is consistent, a good time, and you def want to get tickets in advance.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1208304000000,\"ReviewContent\":\"I have only been living in the city for 3 months, and it's possible I've been to this place the most.

You close your eyes and are magically whisked away to a better place where someone is singing just for you. For me this is Justin Timberlake, Love Stoned, where the song slows down about three minutes in. Anyways...So I've recently been to a place to go and see music that might make you feel the same way. The band I saw was Say Hi to your Mom. They were pretty good. I think that this has so far been my favorite music venue in San Francisco, and I love the Fillmore, so this is a really big complement coming from me. I like this place because its small, but not trashy, the people in there are nice and not pretentious, the bartenders are fast, the cook is the same guy that cooks at Zeitgeist, (did not try the food I imagine it's a fried), the best part is that the stage is right there. You can see and hear every thing that is going on unobstructed, and the acoustics are very good, not too loud, and $10 for a show. Can't complain about that.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1206489600000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Went on a Sat. The performance was great. I brought my friends there to give them a new environment that does not involve music through a DJ but through talented musicians. I got 1 of my friends to go because he has a g\\/f still under 21 and I told him of this place when they allow underages to come in and enjoy the music. No dress code is needed which I prefer. On one occasion I saw someone bring a cat, so they're animal friendly. When your there, you should also try their hard cider. Alcohol prices are very reasonable.

Oh and it is STUPID loud in there.And their negative attitude to the local musicians is so ridiculous, even if you are not a musician I recommend reading their snot-nosed guidelines on their website.

Back outdoor smoker's lounge is much appreciated, if a bit hard to get to when the place is crowded.  The bartenders are some of the nicest, friendliest people I've ever encountered in their service position.

I had never seen anything like it and of course thought the whole thing was a life altering experience. I was so deep back then.

My friends and I were totally bummed but felt really cool about our story about trying to \\\"break into the Bottom of the Hill\\\" and that listening outside was just as cool...... of having some drunk b*#ch pour a pint of beer over my dorky 20 year old black bob w\\/blunt bangs head during the middle of a Murder City Devils\\/At the Drive In show. I was totally drenched but my friend insisted on staying through the end since At the Drive In were known for setting their drums on fire. Ten years later and I'm still annoyed she didn't drive my soaked self back to the dorms right then.

They have a variety of both 21 + and all-ages shows.  Although, I recommend avoiding the all-ages shows if you can.

Cheap beers, a smoking patio, easy street parking, friendly staff, all ages admittance. Only downside is the tiny bathrooms. And perhaps the tiny dance floor\\/audience space, which angers the asshole jocks and punks who want to come in there and mosh and slam dance and beat people up.

What.  Well, you have the concert posted to open at a specific time and why the heck are the doors open then?

Even San Diego's Casbah can't beat BOTH's parking ease.The id checker and will-call guy are super friendly instead of having that cooler than thou attitude that seems to persist at many clubs. The sound is pretty awesome in there, thanks in part to its small size and wood walls. There's not a bad place to check out the band, and if by chance the band is not as stellar as one had hoped, there's a pool table at the back to amuse oneself. Even on busy nights, I've never had to wait more than a few minutes for a drink. And maybe it's partly because of the fans of the bands I like, but the girl's bathroom line is mellow, usually entertaining, and never takes forever. And it's directly off the left side of the stage, so you don't have to walk to Egypt and miss out on the band whilst you go. On busy nights it can get downright hot in there, so remember to layer layer layer. But you're San Franciscans so you're used to that.  Casbah, I will always love you, but Bottom of the Hill gets me most nights now.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1200096000000,\"ReviewContent\":\"I have been to two shows here and I really like this place. Bottom of the Hill reminds of places I used to go when I was in college.  The thing that I like about venues like this place is that you know that the people that are going to these shows are going for the music. The place has a nice feel to it, as you walk in you see the bar and then a nice open floor for dancing, standing or the occasionally skanking or circle pit. It is a great place to hear both local bands and a few bigger bands  that come through. There is a nice little spot outside for smoking if that is your thing and then a space to sit in the back. If there is a band that you like that is there don't miss the chance to come to a great venue. There needs to be more places like this in SF.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1200009600000,\"ReviewContent\":\"badass intimate venue.  because I'm lazy, I'm deducting a star for standing room, but get there early and stake out a spot at the front left (too many people walking through the right side).\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1199750400000,\"ReviewContent\":\"This place is just great.

It's quite a small venue and I truly believe that who ever built this place forgot about the bathroom and just pretty much placed it whereever there was extra space (keep in mind that the space here is already limited). The restroom won't accomodate for more than 2 people just so you know.Upon entering you see the stage.. and yes there's also the dance floor where all these dumb hxc kids kill the mood. Luckily for me that night, I was sitting in the front on top of the ginormous sub woofer and didn't have to fight the rest of the night. Towards the back, past restroom is a pool table and a few couches where you can sit and babysit your alcohol, but it doesn't entirely tune out the deafening music. Alcohol here is pretty basic from what I remember, I recommend pre-drinking so that way none of the lame hxc dancers knock the drink off your hands. FInding parking wasn't as bad as I'd anticipated it to be, but becuase it's located in an obscure place, I couldn't help but wonder if my car had been broken into or not. I like the venue, I just don't like the location.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1199577600000,\"ReviewContent\":\"FUCK THIS PLACE!!!!!!

So being currently bicycle-bound and living in the east bay, I was trepidacious about trying to catch a show there.  Turns out, it's not an issue.  If you approach the venue from 7th St, continue for a block on Mississippi, and loop around 17th St, you're there without combating any inclines.

It's small, which I like; you can actually relate to the music as opposed to it being blasted to you. The bands that come here want the fans\\/listeners\\/etc. to feel the music versus the capitalistic drive to sell high-priced tickets. The stage is a little high for this size of a venue, but it kind of works out if you're in the back or stuck behind some insanely tall person. Bar-wise, they have a good selection of beers on tap and make strong drinks, all reasonably priced. Also, the bartenders are attentive and polite, something that I've rarely experienced at such places. In the back is a pool table and there is a patio off to the side where you can smoke. The bathroom is tiny and usually flooded to some extent, but this seems to be the case for every place that has live music. Oh, and because it's out of the way, parking is super easy.

They walk a masterful line of being hip yet unabashedly fun, retro yet fresh.As for BotH itself, well, I've heard favorable things from so many different people that I think I out-hyped it a bit in my mind.  Not that there's anything wrong with it--it's small, no attitude, and has a funky, cartoon-retro decor (am I the only one who was reminded of a Dick Tracy set?).  All in all it's certainly in the top tier of SF music spots.  But still, it doesn't top Cafe du Nord for that perfect atmosphere.  But there was an added bonus for a tired old man like me: a nice back room with plenty of couch space and a pool table.  I have to confess we sat back here and drank through both of the openers, partly to keep our feet fresh for Honeycut and partly because the openers weren't very good.  There's also a patio to get some fresh air in, which is a nice touch, but for God's sake bring a jacket if you're going out there.Oh, and while I'm admitting to being old, could they have started the show at 9 instead of 10?

BOTH will not give you fresh breath, however.There is nothing classy about the joint, but it isn't a hell-hole either. The bar is cleverly located near the door and serves cheap drinks as long as you know to stick to the bottom of the shelves (aka BOTS). If you want Kettle One, expect to pay 11 dollars and have the adjacent hipsters snicker at you as you help subsidize the PBR keg. The booking is top notch and somehow manage to get bands that you'd never think would still play at such an \\\"intimate\\\" venue. The stage feels close even from the soundboard at the back of the room, but if you want to be off the beat, you can sneak out back for some pool in the back room out have a smoke out on the porch and peer in the artsy peephole of a window to look at the bands' butts.

Since I'm underage, I got the permanent marker X on both my hands and have no experience with the bar.

It was a pretty safe area though.The club is TINY, and the stage is even smaller, although that's part of what makes it so great. The atmosphere is very up close and personal, and if you're in the first couple of rows you're close enough to grab the setlist after the show, or even grab the band members (although I would highly advise against that). It's also pretty easy to find the band after the show (depending on how nice the band is).

This means you don't have to deal with throngs of fans and having to watch your favorite indie bands from a pair of binoculars.- Acoustics.  The sound in this place is I-N-C-R-E-D-I-B-L-E!- Cheap.  I've never paid more than I think $18 admission.  Beat that, Fillmore!- Intimate.  Clubs like this remind me why I became a fan of indie music in the first place.  This is the kind of place where, after the band plays, usually the band members are there at the back table, selling their cds and schwag to you ($10...way cheaper than most record stores) so they can pay for their beer, or next meal, or transport to their next gig.  Depending on priorities.  The point is.  You can chat them up.

Lots of great bands trek through here, and if there's 3 bands on the bill, you're almost guaranteed at least one excellent set. Although I like the ambiance, the space itself is awkward: inconvenient pillars block views toward the back of the room, the merch booth is set up in an inconvenient place, and getting to the bar may require a guide and\\/or path-clearing machete. The space is small enough that (presuming you're not behind a pillar) you'll have a decent view, if not necessarily elbow room--but hey, you're at a show, so leave your personal space issues (and your coat) in the car (which, by the way, is sadly the most convenient way to get here as it's off the major public transport routes.) Oh, and if you're like me and already losing your hearing at a terrifyingly young age, be sure to pack earplugs...it can get hella loud up in there.

I walked in, got a drink and took a tour of the place.  Walked into the back room by the pool table and pinball machine, and there was a girl there with a button maker.  She didn't work there, she wasn't charging, she was just offering up the use of her awesome machine, and sharing her ability to make buttons.  She had magazines, maps, people were using transfers, and i had a button on my jacket of the neighborhood i grew up in on my jacket for years afterward, only to lose it in a tragic laundry machine accident.  Whenever I looked at that button, BOTH was at the top of my thoughts.This place gets great small and decently sized bands to play, and although its not the most convenient venue in the city, its still worth the trek to Potrero.  With a smoking area out back, and the back area with the pool table, the space is decent, but unfortunately the good acoustics come with standing in front of the stage.  The oddest show I saw there was Captured! By Robots, http:\\/\\/www.capturedbyrobots.com\\/ , a band made up of one man and his machines.  He has robots playing instruments and during The Wedding Tour, this band rocked out to some of the most popular wedding tunes in their own bizarre way, and then proceeded to marry couples in the audience.  Some bands like the Mountain Goats prefer to play BOTH, but since getting bigger have to move on like all bands eventually do.  It helps that our good friends live upstairs in the house we have actually come to know as the BOTH house, and an evening in Potrero usually means an evening with them.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1177027200000,\"ReviewContent\":\"My favourite venue ever, hands down.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1176854400000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Have I mentioned how great it is to live in San Francisco, particularly in the Dogpatch\\/P Hill\\/Mission corridor?

What I WILL say is that the first show I saw in San Francisco was at the BOTH, & it has since been my favorite small venue in this or any city. Mostly because of the high quality & variety of the acts they bring in on a consistent basis. It is also arguably the least pretentious venue in the city. I've also got friends who live upstairs, & so most shows usually involve good times with said crew.It's not like Bottom of the Hill really needed another review. It's not like anyone but the infamous Lauren S (my esteemed roommate) is going to read this or find it more useful, funnier or cooler than another review. I'm just another dude in a long procession of loyal BOTH concertgoers. And that's what makes this venue so special.

So, if you are automotive-inclined then you are in luck.  Favorite BOTH moments (in no particular order):1.) Performing my only interview during my short lived career as a music critic with the SF band the Pleased (feat. now-producer Noah Georgeson and now solo-artist Joanna Newsom).  During the interview Joanna Newsom told me that she likes to \\\"knock the boots\\\" to the Jackson 5.  I thought, and still think, this was a rad answer.  After witnessing this show I developed my first crush in this city (on Joanna Newsom).2.) Seeing indie-rapper Atmosphere perform with a full band including a cover of the Queens of the Stone Age \\\"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\\\" but changing the lyrics from drugs to rock-stars (i.e. stuttering out \\\"Cobain\\\" instead of \\\"Cocaine\\\").  I've always wanted to find a recording of this.3.) Two Gallants stealing the show as the opening band for Rogue Wave: they set up their instruments in the dead center of the crowd - going mostly undetected so that people near the bar and in the back couldn't figure out for the life of them why the rest of us were hushing them.  The clinking of pint glasses added to the music.4) Bribing a door guy at a super sold-out performance by Interpol so that my ticketless friend could walk in with me to enjoy the show.  5) Halloween (my birthday) a few year back drunkenly stumbling in just in time to catch the entirety of Metric's Halloween performance after leaving what, in my mind, was the last great Halloween in the Castro.  Emily Haines became my next \\\"celebrity\\\" crush (I always crush on cute indie-rock musicians instead of actresses).Mmmm... I'm totally feeling nostalgic now.

The beverages are really expensive and everywhere you turn is a wall of people. The bathrooms are ill located in the small hallway next to the stage, the prime area of movement between the dancefloor and outside smoking patio. Behind that is a pool table, even that is always busy. The patio does stellar summer BBQs that are like $5 complete with an afternoon band, those are always good times. The kitchen serves up some good food too and the staff are super nice.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1171843200000,\"ReviewContent\":\"I imagine Bottom of the Hill to be of a design rooted in someone's childhood dreams of the perfect tree house.  To walk into the place is so immediately energizing.  The layout is vast and enticing to the eye, with bar, counters, windows, hallway, and low walls all sweeping you back past the stage and bathrooms toward the little back room and smoking courtyard, with it's forbidden stairs of temptation up to a place where only performers, pretty girls and VIPs dare tread.Tragically, this is the only place in San Francisco I have encountered a mosh pit, and both times, I left a little confused and a little concerned.  I've been hurt in Hartford, beaten in Boston, and assaulted in Albany, but never before have I been the most dangerous guy in the pit.  I can hold my own, but these guys were just feeble.  Is it always like this at punk shows in the Bay?  I really don't mind being a little bit scared for my life once in a while.  It's healthy.The last time I saw the Phenomenauts play at BotH, they must have been hosting a convention for anorexic men.  I'm not exactly brawny, but these guys were just bouncing off of me.  I felt bad that throwing a little weight around could move the whole crowd, but they just kept coming back.  The pit got five stars for spirit and stamina, but a single star for ability and conviction.  I deeply appreciate that you can find a diverse array of local and touring acts at the BotH, and that their ticket prices are totally affordable, as are the drinks.  The courtyard can get really crowded between sets, but it is a great little oasis when you need some time away from the speakers.  If Bottom of the Hill were closer to the heart of the city, it would rank five stars for sure, but then again, it would probably not be able to maintain the character that it has garnered sitting at the edge of civilization.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1170979200000,\"ReviewContent\":\"The best venue around for shows, period, for a few reasons. No matter how damn crowded it is your always nice bartenders will serve you with the quickness. And although it gets super packed and stuffy, you can just go out back and chit chat with your pals through crappy opening bands. \\\"Did she say chit chat\\\" you ask? Why yes I did! BC for some magical and mysterious reason, a conversation really can be held out back without screaming over blaring music so the only headache you have the next morning really has to do with how much you drank the night before. While the sound systems here is pretty schizophrenic and it's anybody's guess as to why the headliner sounds horrible and opening band sounds crisp, I'm assuming this is a band equipment issue and not so much the club itself (I admit I know nothing abt PA's and such). Even when packed beyond what you expect it to be, people are cool and down to earth and even NOTICE when you're a midget like moi and will voluntarily move over a bit for ya without you even asking --- major score.

Too bad the show wasn't on time for us. We looked like major dorks hanging out with our hands all X-ed up just waiting for the first band to start, but if there's any place where people won't give you shit for looking like a dork, it's the Bottom of the Hill. Being Little Susie East Bay I was a little tentative coming here, especially since two girls from our group couldn't come along at the last minute. Upon stepping inside I realized that the uncomfortable public transit journey was well worth it. First off, the staff was pretty friendly, which may not seem like a particularly necessary quality to hardened city people, but for a shy girl like me it makes the whole being underage thing a lot easier. The bartender was cool with holding my winter coat in the back and didn't even get pissed when I realized I'd left my earplugs in the pockets and needed to retrieve them.Aside from the fairly nonjudgmental staff, the atmosphere was relaxed and the decor was cool, blah blah blah. Other reviews suggested I would need earplugs which is why I brought them, but I guess the sound guy hadn't had that many because I found the sound levels quite comfortable. Yeah, I know, I'm going to be hooking up my stereo to my hearing aid when I'm 60.My only gripe would be that this place is seriously in the sticks, and a little unnerving until you get inside. I'd suggest knowing beforehand how you're going to get home. If you don't want to eat there, eat before you make your way down, and take a friend if you've never been there before.

The BOTH offers great sound, decent drink prices, an intimate environment, and occasional barbecues on Sunday which offer great food and good bands at an affordable price. There is only one reason that the BOTH doesn't get five stars....Most night clubs can be a gamble when it comes to the quality and level of the sound coming out of its speakers. Be assured, the sound at the BOTH is almost always loud and the mix is almost always good. BOTH is probably the most consistent club for sound quality and mixing in SF.Recently, a friend and I were lamenting the $6.50 whiskeys at a club in the Mission, which led us to the topic of 'which venue in the city has reasonable drink prices.' The BOTH came up and we both agreed. The venue is small- probably only fitting a couple hundred people. This fact makes it that much better when you are seeing bigger national acts or your favorite bands. Sure, you need to squeeze through here and there to get a good view, but in the end, there isn't much space between you and your rock gods- whether you are standing at the back of the club, in front of the stage, or outside smoking. The only reason that I wouldn't give BOTH five stars is the LOCATION. 'Off the beaten path' could be one way to describe the club, but I prefer to say 'a pain in the ass to get to.' In a town that revolves around public transit and taxis to shuttle its people to and fro, you're looking at a major investment of your time and\\/or money getting to and coming back from the BOTH. This should not discourage you, but warn those who don't already have that expectation.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1168473600000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Great place to see a show (I love small, intimate venues), within walking distance of my place, and strong drinks.

The venue is also really cool, and if you're under 21 you can get a straightedge X on your hand and get in anyway.The only complaint I have is that the volume can get turned up to deafening levels.

You can cut lose and not worry about being judged or worse, being kicked out.  If you ever want to see a good rock show, this is the place to be.

Oftentimes you get to experience not one but up to three or more bands in a given night.  What a perfect way to not only see your favorite headliner but to get to see similar music and open up your horizons to other great music.  If you are a smoker, the outdoor patio is a great place to mingle with friends, hipsters, scenesters and even the bands as they make their way back from a performance.  My favorite aspect of the bar -- one of the few locations that you can order both a Guinness and a Strongbow.  Concert + friends + new people + Strongbow = great night.  I always look forward to a show there, only downside is transpo can be a bit sketchy given the remote locale.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1138147200000,\"ReviewContent\":\"From what I remember, this seems like a pretty good venue. I wasn't overly excited to be attending a pop-rock concert, but I was suitably pacified by a lot of beer. Good beer, at that. This is a smallish place and therefore you can get 'up close and personal' with the bands. Or you can stand sidestage and drunkenly heckle them, which is what I did. And when you get tired of that, you can migrate towards the back and play pool or air hockey. There are also several soft and cushy benches near the pool table, which come in handy when you are no longer able to stand upright...Oh, hi mom!Beware of the hipsters.

It actually is a very humble place where you can find one of the most interesting groups of people; young and old, goth, punk, scenester, emo, blah blah blah.  But we saw this band called the Groovy Ghoulies or something like that and they were a lot of fun.  The atmosphere was a-ok.  Lots of piercings and tats, but a step back into the early 80's.

So the sound system sometimes is off, the noise from people chattering by the entrance can be deafening, it can be unbelievably cramped when a show is sold out, festivities may end at 1 or 2 in the morning (which ain't necessarily a bad thing).  For all of its shortcomings (I'm sure people can and will drum up more), there isn't a better place to see a show in SF.  Bands seem to play their best here, and you won't be far from the stage in this tiny place to miss any of it.  They always book great stuff.  Drinks are pretty cheap.

The place is mostly a dive bar, with little tables \\/ seats and a stage, from what I know, since they mostly focus on shows. the acoustics are alright, definitely fine for seeing someone you enjoy. I read previous reviews stating parking may result in break-ins, but parking about a block away had no issue, it didnt even feel sketchy, though I would still hide or take valuables.

Cool area in the back of the club for bands to set up merch tables to sell records and tshirts...etc.... Cover charge is decent for a medium capacity venue. Bartenders are usually prompt...I feel the prices for drinks are on the higher side. The vibe can be a little cold as far as friendliness is concerned. All staff seem a bit standoffish, but it is not a big concern to me in the grand scheme of things,as no one is militant or helecoptering over me. I can relax here and it feels adaquately spacious inside and out. Parking is okay...I usually find a space.

Its easy to get up close to the stage and there is a bag check option at the bar. You can typically buy tickets in advance or at the door, at least, I had those options. The sound as good but the lighting is pretty dark, even for a club. I would recommend bringing ear plugs, especially if youre up close. There are mens and womens bathrooms but theyre not clearly labeled to the right of the stage. Theres a picture of a little girl on the ladies door, which has 2 stalls and 1 sink. The bathroom was small but clean. Parking in the area is a bit of an issue, so Id recommend arriving early and parking on the street. Just pay really close attention to street signs and parking restrictions because some areas require permits so be prepared. I usually like parking in pay lots because of safety but the neighborhood seemed ok. It is in San Francisco, so if you dont like parking on hills (which I dont), just try to be there early to look for your ideal parking.

The Lillingtons were in town and I did not want to miss out on this! Doors at 8:30, show at 9. I arrived at 9:10 and the place was already packed. Friendly staff checking IDs and tickets. I did not order food or beverage while there, but saw others enjoying spirits and eats. It gets pretty warm inside, but theres a back patio you can escape to. Clean, stocked restroom. Attended another (sold out) show on 2\\/17\\/18, my car was broken into. While they do post notices on their door and windows stating to leave nothing in your vehicle, my car and several others were hit sometime between 9pm -1 am. This venue does not allow in and out privileges for patrons.  With that being said, perhaps they will consider posting security OUTSIDE the venue to deter things like this from happening.  People will be less excited about coming to a venue when their vehicle is likely to get vandalized or worse.  Luckily, there was nothing in my car to steal, however the damage they did to the vehicle itself is costly. If you have a hatchback, I recommend removing your rear deck lid so thieves can see you have nothing back there.  Hopefully it saves you a broken window, or worse.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1522328601183,\"ReviewContent\":\"Best of the best\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1522328601697,\"ReviewContent\":\"Went to a concert here.

Was there to check out a band, Sick of Sarah, who were performing for the night. A small and cosy venue space ideal for smaller bands. The bar only accepts cash, likewise cash payment for the entry fee if any. They do have an ATM just next to the entrance if you didnt carry cash. Though the place appear kind of old and rundown, the sound system was good. The bar carries the typical alcoholic drink and a limited list of beers. Drinks are cheap, beers were at $6\\/bottle. Tried to request for Mojito but they do not have any mint. So ended up with two Strongbow cider which worked out well too. Two girls next to us ask for their special shots listed on the wall, the bartender whispered to them that he got no clue what it was. Thought it was pretty hilarious, apparently he was just stepping in before the real bartender comes in. The streets were pretty dark by the time we got there, it appears to be located in the midst of an industrial area. Ideal for a music venue so there wouldnt have much sound\\/music limit restrictions. There are plenty of parking along the streets so thats great for those who drive. Its also a short distant from the 22nd Caltrain.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Bottom of the Hill\",\"ReviewDate\":1459256610957,\"ReviewContent\":\"I like this venue, though its a bit out there and hard to get to.

Theres something fantastic about live music in a small venue.  If you get there too late and you end up in the back and youre short like me, you cant see much.  We were lucky to be about 6 deep from the stage.  Also this venue brings something out in the artist where theyre wanting to be part of the audience and theyre more than willing to come down and sing on the floor. The used the back room to sell merchandise the night we were here.  The wait is long since we had to make a line against the wall and wait for the meet and greet and then by merch all in the small back room.  But it was cool because everyone hung out and chatted with fans.  The guy that worked there was very good about keeping things organized, keeping people from cutting the line and really just a cool dude.

I went for my birthday as I LOVE jazz and live bands. I loved the vibe here. Everyone came to listen to good music.  But seemed like most of the people there were regulars and for the most part knew each other.  This is a non-profit organization supporting local bay area artists. However, the audience was not very diverse.  As a Black American, I couldn't help but notice there were fewer than 10 Black people in the room, including the singer (we actually counted about 8).  We arrived just at 7:30 pm when the show started, so we didn't try the food.  But there was a separate area near the entrance where you could order and pick up your food and beverages and bring to your table.  We ordered a bottle of rose that was pretty good, and reasonably priced.  There was no table service, which was fine considering what you got with the cover charge, which was 3 hours of live performance.We had the pleasure of listening to Chloe Jean who was phenomenal. If all the artists are of her caliber, I'll definitely go back again and again.

The owner Karen, an appropriate name for sure, claimed she had no choice. I said their is always a choice. She offered to refund my $$ for the tickets and I said no since I had already purchased food and drinks.The refund wasn't the issue, the issue was selling me a table for two and adding unknown\\/unwanted people because the performer wanted it.Then before the show started, they moved us to a table for 2 in the back by the bathroom door.

The gentleman doing the seating and the lady   owner were very cordial and very professional.  However The male owner of the venue was outside throwing f bombs at a patron and totally out of control.  He was bartending afterwards.  He was extreemly rude, yelling at customers and being disrespectful and angry towards nice paying customers inside the venue.

They played with the intensity of true professionals at the top of their game. Their sound is as fresh and diverse as Cachao or Miles Davis in the 70's. The band featured Fred Randolph, on bass; Erik Jekabson, trumpet; Sheldon Brown, sax and alto sax and flute; Greg Wyser-Pratte, drums; and Dan Zemelman, piano.   My favorite piece was entitled, \\\"Song with no Singer\\\" and was inspired by Salif Keita and aptly had neither lyrics nor a singer. The hosts Karen and her quieter husband, Robert, were wonderful storytellers and I was able to order bruschetta with cheese and figs and tapas of olives and peppers, for nine dollars!  The scene was intimate and my friend and  I shared a table with a nice Dad and daughter duo from Portland, Maine. If the Sound Room is at capacity with 55 souls it feels packed. The lighting and sound were impeccable and the temperature in the room was warm. It was a memorable show, which makes us wonder what this talented composer, Randolph and his quintet will have in their repertoire for next show's set on August 2nd, which is in Walnut Creek.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Sound Room\",\"ReviewDate\":1497139200000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Here's a customer service take, as opposed to an assessment of the quality of the music or location. I'm thousands of miles away from The Sound Room and have never been there - I just wanted to get a gift for my sister, who lives near it in Oakland. There's a phone number on the website that I tried a bunch of times, but no one ever picked up. I emailed and got a reply running through some gift options that weren't quite what I was looking for, and the note that \\\"we do check messages frequently and return calls if contact info is left on the recording.\\\"So I said I would call and got an emailed reiteration of the same options from the earlier email. When I called and left a message ...\\u00a0it was never returned.(The email from The Sound Room explained: \\\"We are a non-profit run on volunteer labor. Our presence at the Sound Room is focused around scheduled shows.\\\" But I left *more than a month* between leaving my message and giving up. I figured even \\\"volunteer labor\\\" could make a phone call *guaranteed* to bring in money, given several weeks in which to do it.)So instead of giving several hundred dollars to The Sound Room, I surrendered and gave it directly to my sister. Much less fun and surprising. And she's now planning summer travel, so I don't think much of that money will wind up going to this nonprofit.The Sound Room can do what it wants, how it wants. But if they're going to put a phone number on a website, why not, you know, let people use the phone?\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Sound Room\",\"ReviewDate\":1487548800000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Going to a jazz lounge, having drinks, and enjoying great music has always been a dream of mine, and I was happy that my first experience happened at The Sound Room. I purchased the V.I.P tickets for only ten dollars more than the regular ticket price. That extra ten dollars got us into the club a half hour early, giving us time to buy drinks and food, as well as get priority seating. They opened their doors promptly at seven, so we didn't have to wait too long in the rain. While waiting in line to get checked in, I couldn't help but notice the food at the counter. It was glowing, and even though I was here for the show, my stomach needed to be appeased first. The food was very affordable, much more than I thought it would be. For two Moulin Rouge drinks (champagne, hibiscus, and ginger), a cheese plate, a crostini with pecan pate and mushrooms, a lavash roll, and a shrimp skewer, I paid $40.00. Everything tasted great. We also indulged in their version of spinach dip, which looked good, but lacked in flavor. Enough about the food. The real show is the actual show, which was everything I wanted it to be. The room is fairly small, only seating 70 people, and every seat is the best seat in house. The small room crams everyone together, but you abandon any sense of claustrophobia once the show starts. The show for the night was performed by Marina Crouse and Garth Webber, along with their band. The music they play is like no other. I have always been a fan of Jazz and Blues, but to hear it live is a whole other experience. The music was very soulful. It made me truly listen to what's being played, what's being sung, and the stories that are being told. The band was full of life, especially the drummer, and the vibe was just incredibly warm and fun. The venue is small, making the sound incredible. The staff are incredible as well, especially the owner, who clearly has a passion for this type of music. Even the other patrons are incredible. While we were waiting in the rain, at least four different people offered to share their umbrellas with us. The Sound Room has it's usual members, and it's clear they are a tight knit family, but no one made us feel unwelcome or left out. Parking can be a bit of a hassle, so I would recommend arriving early, so you have ample time to find a spot. Overall, I can't thank The Sound Room enough for providing me with a very pleasant first experience into this world of live Jazz and Blues.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Sound Room\",\"ReviewDate\":1481241600000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Came here for a Wine Tasting & Jazz & Magic event. bought tickets ahead of time, and was expecting to show ID at the door, but all I did was give them my name and they checked it off the list and let me in. weird heheVERY cool magic! the dude had lots of charisma, was funny, and his magic was also astounding!

This is a friendly and truly intimate setting, with a casual, but always interesting and delicious, collection of tapas and other small plates - almost all vegetarian or vegan.  They also offer a small selection of well-priced, usually local, beers and wine.  Recently, The Sound Room has begun featuring Flamenco performances - dance, guitar, rhythms,  and songs. These shows usually draw from the deep and excellent Bay Area flamenco community, which I'm told is among the best - outside of Spain and Mexico.  Occasionally, Spanish visitors perform.

Nothing less than a 105 db in the back row !!! Often 120 db for a Jazz Sextet playing intricate composotions, Great musicians and compositions ruined by over amping and low fidelity eqjipment.Forthe  second set the sound man left the board on while connecting the new band. A loose connection in Sheldon Browns rig caused explosive snapping crackling and popping at a deafening volume for at least 45 seconds before the ear assault ended. This sent everyones hands to their ears and as I kooked around it looked like Edvard Munchs Painting the \\\"Scream!\\\"!!  In all directions.!!!!  Could be a nice venue with a professjonal sound man with a quality board.To the owners you have a very live room only the piano needs a mic. The Bass brings hi own.Everyone else should be amped for balance not volume. A sextet shouldnt sound lime a marching band. You should hear the instruments sound come from the instruments not the monitors and side speakers . Also the low quality amp does not allow the subtelies of tone through that are generated by the grear musicians wjo play at your venue.

I bought the ticket on October 21, 2023, and I requested the refund on the day of the event due to illness, which was October 27, 2023.  Today is MARCH 8, 2024!!!  I finally got an email saying, \\\"Sorry but we paid the band before this request was made.\\\"  So you paid the band on the morning of the event?  I would hope you'd have paid them by the end of the night, at the very least, but to email me at this point and give me this load of BS is inexcusable.  I figured out back in November that I wasn't getting a refund, thanks for that.  Why bother at this point?  My health is still in decline months later, so I sure didn't need the reminder that I missed yet another event thanks to long COVID!

Thankfully a very friendly bartender saw my bewilderment and helped me out by directing me to the far counter with the register where I could order. There was a hockey game on TV and I think background music. The Irish was all over the walls and other than bar seating, there were a few tables and chairs.My food came out pretty quick, but I was the first to order before a ton of people showed up for the poetry slam later on and they looked like they had a wait. The veggie burger was black bean and I think quinoa based, but had so much jalapeno in it I found it mostly inedible (was pretty hungry so I had just a small amount of patty and lots of bread, leaving 3\\/4 of the patty on the plate). The fries were on-point! Loved the crisp, skin on fries, but didn't appreciate the dregs of the bag being included (little strips of fried potato skin). While the poetry slam was advertised for 8pm, which I waited for and then passed, it still hadn't started by 8:35 and I gave up. The lady in front collecting funds noted they should have started already, as 8:30 is more typical but I had to get going with my night and the organizer was not looking like it was going to get started for a bit despite expectation setting with announcements. They had placed a bunch of chairs in front of their stage, which were mostly filled by the time I left, so popular event for sure. Unfortunately the sound people didn't really know appropriate levels for 10-15 minutes and the bass made me sick to my stomach.Good fries, beers and popular events await you at the Starry Plough, but come prepared for waits and maybe stay away from the veggie burger if you can't handle the inferno.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Starry Plough\",\"ReviewDate\":1666915200000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Best bar ever!

Thankfully a very friendly bartender saw my bewilderment and helped me out by directing me to the far counter with the register where I could order. There was a hockey game on TV and I think background music. The Irish was all over the walls and other than bar seating, there were a few tables and chairs.My food came out pretty quick, but I was the first to order before a ton of people showed up for the poetry slam later on and they looked like they had a wait. The veggie burger was black bean and I think quinoa based, but had so much jalapeno in it I found it mostly inedible (was pretty hungry so I had just a small amount of patty and lots of bread, leaving 3\\/4 of the patty on the plate). The fries were on-point! Loved the crisp, skin on fries, but didn't appreciate the dregs of the bag being included (little strips of fried potato skin). While the poetry slam was advertised for 8pm, which I waited for and then passed, it still hadn't started by 8:35 and I gave up. The lady in front collecting funds noted they should have started already, as 8:30 is more typical but I had to get going with my night and the organizer was not looking like it was going to get started for a bit despite expectation setting with announcements. They had placed a bunch of chairs in front of their stage, which were mostly filled by the time I left, so popular event for sure. Unfortunately the sound people didn't really know appropriate levels for 10-15 minutes and the bass made me sick to my stomach.Good fries, beers and popular events await you at the Starry Plough, but come prepared for waits and maybe stay away from the veggie burger if you can't handle the inferno.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Starry Plough\",\"ReviewDate\":1568246400000,\"ReviewContent\":\"This bar is good, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

Yes, there are Irish themes (and actual Irish clientele), but also a variety of other folks (I'm assuming from the neighborhood) who frequent this cozy little spot. Since then I've came in a few times for happy hour, and have tried a couple food items. Earlier today, I had a regular ol' cheeseburger, and I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was.

But once we got to the pub, we were told that that was \\\"in no way possible\\\" and that \\\"someone must have been trained wrong or something.\\\" Honestly, getting cash last minute wouldn't have been such a big deal if the bartenders and woman letting people in weren't so rude to us. In an aggressive and abrasive tone, we were told to either pay or leave and they were in no way apologetic for spreading misinformation. It definitely seemed that they thought we had made up the whole thing, which we had no reason to do. Asking for clarification on something we took the initiative to inquire about earlier in the night, should not merit disrespect. We turned around and are never coming back.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Starry Plough\",\"ReviewDate\":1518048000000,\"ReviewContent\":\"I love that there is always something cool happening there.

Seemed like they were friends that do this often.We were originally planning to eat dinner here, but it turns out the kitchen was closed. Probably remodeling. That's too bad. We did enjoy a beer before heading to our next destination. They have a decent selection of beers, though I wasn't too thrilled about the cleanliness of the seating areas.

One time I ordered an apple bread pudding dessert and the entire bar was in awe with the amazing, glorious piece of culinary perfection they whipped up. As for the setting, the plough has the perfect \\\"casual, local bar\\\" vibe mixed with the exciting event atmosphere.

It is a very short walk from the Ashby Bart and they rotate their taps every once in a while and always have a good and full selection. Their happy hour deals are not bad either as you can get a pint for $4 at that time. In terms of their bar food it is not more special than any other bar food with the usual things being offered like burgers, sandwiches, and mac and cheese. There is also only one TV that isn't accessible everywhere in the place but they're always playing the most relevant sports that day.What is really cool about this bar is that fairly frequently they have live bands perform and different shows. Usually the cover charge is $10 but that does also get you a beer.

It's very much a friendly neighborhood bar with a community feel. They have live music and lots of cool social justice\\/activism oriented decorations. Because of that though, it's definitely a bar you go to when you're looking for social interaction and music, not when you're looking for somewhere to watch sports (there's only one TV). Food is average-above average bar food depending on what you order. I've had fish and chips there that were kind of bland and I've had mac and cheese with rosemary and a few kinds of cheese that was quite good. Happy hour is long which is a plus, but the deals aren't great which is a minus. You get a dollar off a drink but the drink has to be under $6 to begin with, which doesn't leave a great selection.

The beer selection here was really solid. Not the best I've come across, but a solid B at least. There is enough of a variety to please everyone. The food was where they started to loose me. I ordered a nice salad, and it was meh. I know salads aren't generally seen as very sexy or fun, but we are in CA which is known for produce. The salad was also supposed to be seasonal, so I had high hopes for some fresh flavors. Everything just felt sort of flat and drab. Again, I know it is a salad and a poor choice to make, but it just did not live up to the potential I saw on the menu. The service was friendly enough and the atmosphere was very kid friendly.

The gentleman who took our order was extremely sweaty, kinda twitchy, and kept scratching his butt. We kept an eye on him to make sure he wasn't preparing our food. Turns out he was and we didn't see him wash his hands... ever. He cooked our pizza and then cut it into tiny quadrilaterals and triangles. Eating this pizza was one of the most awkward dining experiences I've ever had. To make matters worse, the pizza wasn't even good. The dough was undercooked and tasted like it was from a can.Prior to getting our food, we had to go to the bar to order drinks because drinks can't be ordered with food. We also had to wash the plates which were provided because they were dirty. The bands did an excessively long sound check 2 hours prior to the show - like they each played a few songs in their entirety. It was super loud and we were not able to talk during dinner.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Starry Plough\",\"ReviewDate\":1446336000000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Fun little place to get beer and great pizza.

I visited on a Monday aka Dead-day (in the night life industry). Surprised to see a full house at 8pm. They were hosting Irish dancing lessons- How clever!- and fun. I enjoyed their Rotating Taps which included a number of local brews. (+4pts). They also have the standard Irish-bar beers on taps for those whom have married their brands.In efforts to see if this place was legit I ordered the \\\"Shepherd's Pie.\\\" The place operates an \\\"open-kitchen operation,\\\" which allows patrons to see the chef prepare, and cook the meals (+2 pts)\\\"Samoe\\\" was my bartender and I felt she was informative and provided others at the bar with quick and friendly service.

We regretted placing that order less than a minute after sitting down. There was a young man on stage setting up to play. As soon as he began sound checking it was clear that this was his first live gig and the 10-12 people there to see him were obviously his family. When he actually began playing everything got much worse. The food seemed to take forever but that could have been because the torturous sound coming from the stage.

Then when our food was served the door man came up to us and asked for 7 to 10 dollars for a cover charge. We politely told him we were just there for dinner. So he walked away. Then 5 minutes later he came up and asked us again for the 7 to 10 dollar overcharge and we politely told him that we were eating dinner then we were planning on leaving. Every 5 minutes after he would proceed to ask us for the cover charge. So we finished our food and left. When we got to the car I realized I had left my card on tab so I went back. The doorman was joking with his friend and noticed I was walking in when he asked me again for the cover charge. I just politely told him I was there to close my tab and be on my way. So I did and started walking back to my car. Then I noticed the guy that was hanging out with the doorman was following behind me. I got to my car and quickly turned around and went down the street but not before I saw the door mans friend reaching for something in his belt. I assume he was trying to intimidate me but 2 days later I was charged 22$ to my card from The Starry Plough.

First off, the food is amazing.  It's not necessarily healthy, or incredibly varied (and there pizza can be hit or miss), but the many burgers and fries are truly exceptional and a massive improvement on the previous options (5+ yrs ago).  The people who work here are not surly or mean and the bartender and head cook are both incredibly nice guys (the bar tender must have been having a bad day or something when those below came to visit).  The music and Irish-themed dancing and jam nights are one-of-a-kind in the east bay and deserve praise by themselves, but on top of that they give bands that are just getting into the bay area music scene a place to showcase their talents and provide a venue for poetry (really, you didn't like the poets, so you bashed the bar!).  Open mic usually draws a large and young crowd, so avoid Tuesday nights if you're into a more intimate setting and thur-sat band nights often has a cover.I will agree with a couple reviewers that its difficult to get a table on a busy night, but I recommend playing some darts (rarely being used) until one opens up.  The decor is awesome (if you're into Ireland) and the prices are very reasonable.  The only other thing I will concede is that a whiskeyless Irish bar is a bit laughable, but this is one of my favorite bars in berkeley and not to be missed.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Starry Plough\",\"ReviewDate\":1402185600000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Seen all the pics from prior patrons.

The performers are all regular peeps who come to share their voices\\/words with others. It's great, I love it. There are sometimes live bands\\/djs too. Pretty great place to enjoy live entertainment.Not to mention the food here is pretty darn good. Everything is prepared fresh daily, or from what I observed they seem to be. The fries were cut on the spot. You know this isn't your typical kind of bar food cause they actually take time preparing the food. The burgers here are fat and filling. I was very pleased. Their cheesy pulled pork fries were pretty tasty too! Oh, and the bar is pretty awesome too. The beers are about $5 a pop. Pretty decently priced for a bar.If you're ever in this area, and love poetry etc etc check Starry Plough out!\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Starry Plough\",\"ReviewDate\":1389139200000,\"ReviewContent\":\"The best thing about the Starry Plough is that it's constantly booked with eccentric performers. In turn, it draws very eclectic audiences. Open mics, 80s cover bands, celtic music, americana singer\\/songwriters, poetry slams, funk, local band album release parties. Chances are, if you wander in here, you'll end up being entertained by something. It's walking distance from Ashby BART, but also pretty easy to find street parking out front. The venue is relatively dive-y, the walls are covered with posters, both musical and political, and they typically charge a cash only cover on a sliding scale. The stage takes up a nice portion of the room, but there aren't an abundance of seats facing it  since a lot of space is claimed by tables. If you're not in it for the long haul, there's plenty of standing room and stools along the bar. Sound is usually decent. I wouldn't say that cleanliness is their strong suit, but they undoubtedly have a vibe. In the way of alcohol, your main options consist of draft beer, more draft beer, and some bottled beer - everything from Guinness to PBR. If you were wondering, they've got deals on pitchers and pints during happy hour\\/until 7 pm. If you don't like beer, you're left to choose from their house wines. Weirdest part? It's an Irish pub that doesn't serve whiskey. Yes, you read that correctly.I've never eaten any of the pub fare, but I've seen them serve up huge cheeseburgers and fries, piles of saucy wings, giant sandwiches, fish and chips, even calamari. The last time I was here, one of my buddies ordered some burger monstrosity with jalape\\u00f1os and blue cheese. I think it's safe to say that if you're looking for greasy eats to accompany your brew, you won't have to look far. I'd come back to see a friend play a gig here, but otherwise, I'll leave the whiskey free zone to the troubadours and world music buffs.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Starry Plough\",\"ReviewDate\":1387756800000,\"ReviewContent\":\"The Starry Plough is truly a great venue for intimate live music events with a wide variety of talent, room to dance without being judged, and great acoustics.  This past Sunday, I caught two musicians that will keep me coming back to Starry Plough again and again:Into the Pacific: http:\\/\\/tinyurl.com\\/intothepacific (My favorites are \\\"Hold Fast,\\\" \\\"From the Start\\\" and \\\"Sunrise, Sunset.\\\"  Esteban's voice is amazing and he plays the bass and foot drum while singing the songs he wrote.)andI.R.: https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/user\\/IRfiq1 (My favorites are \\\"Driftin\\\" http:\\/\\/tinyurl.com\\/l2vjvzq and this other song I sadly can't identify but really enjoyed.)I've been to Starry Plough a few times before this and have always enjoyed the vibe, but I was always a little unhappy with how long it took to get the food.  Now I just try to plan better and order food way before I even think I am hungry.  Another minor complaint is that the Starry Plough only offers beer and wine, but that is really just a minor complaint because the beer selection is solid.To summarize, if you catch a great live music act, you will absolutely have a 5-star experience at the Starry Plough. Otherwise, it might be more of a 3-star experience, which is A-OK to me.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Starry Plough\",\"ReviewDate\":1387324800000,\"ReviewContent\":\"I came here on a Tuesday evening for the weekly poetry slam.

Came here last night for a concert (only $5 cover and a GREAT show!) and I wasn't expecting good food. For whatever reason I have found the best concert venues often have substandard food. So after grabbing drinks and wanting to fill my stomach I cautiously ordered a Big Kahuna Burger (bonus points on the name!) and some Calamari for my wife. We got given a number and only a few minutes later our food arrived! Impressive considering the huge crowds of people there for the show that night.Oh my gosh was that Big Kahuna Burger ever AMAZING! It was juicy, perfectly cooked (not too dry) and bursting with flavor. My wife had a similar reaction with the Calamari; it was crispy batter and juicy on the inside. I think she said it was the best she has had in months. The atmosphere is hip; posters on the walls from past and present, and just a cool place to hang out. There were lots of beers on tap and the prices were more than reasonable. Also the people there had personality! For instance when the runner dropped off our food he said we were number 3, and now he was making us number 2, and should we get lucky we might even get to be #1. It was quirky and fun.

Great vibe and music. kinda random, but in a great way.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Starry Plough\",\"ReviewDate\":1369785600000,\"ReviewContent\":\"The response from Starry Plough is hilarious. The guy writing this seem to be the cook who jumped out of the kitchen and called the woman a 'Bitch' in ear of all surrounding tables including ours.  He cooked our food too and was wearing a white apron. When told to go away after pouncing in and swearing and yelling at the lady, he puffed up his chest and practically stomped his foot saying 'I'm the OWNER! I'm the OWNER!' He wasn't there, didn't know anything that was going on first hand yet was frothing at the mouth to support the weenie in the Jeff Campbell band's version of things and to play at power tripping. Any woman is entitled to push someone away who is inappropriately getting in her space as that asshole from the Jeff Campbell band was. She was sitting in HER seat minding her business when he harassed her while she was trying to listen to the guy on stage. He didn't like her asking him to shut up and she wasn't even the first one that had that night. The Jeff Campbell jerk had a totally different lady ask him to shut up earlier as he talked through the entirety of  Freedy's set and all the Jeff Campbell guy did is get up from his table and go chat more at the bar where the other lady eventually asked him to be quiet. The Jeff Campbell musician was an asshole to another musician as well as the people trying to listen and 100% provoked the situation with the second lady by hassling her at her table, and then was a big drama baby about it. Nobody was hurt and the jerk deserved to be pushed.  I gotta think he's embarrassed how this went down as both he and the bar look really bad. I gather even the cops laughed about being called. When I and other customers suggested this was not a big deal to this cook guy when he was threatening the lady sitting in her chair with cops he would not listen to us or any other patrons. The offended little Napoleon cook 'owner' was hell bent at that point on pulling his power trip to evict her. Many customers were appalled and one even got up and gave a speech to the crowd about how wrong it was before HE was threatened with being thrown out.  None of these people knew each other before but I've got to say, I feel like I made some friends. Its the old adage when good people stand up to a wrong and all that.  A long time customer of the bar  who was a local neighbor was also trying to intervene,  and told us that the real owner, this dude's father, was home in Walnut Creek that night and if he'd been at his bar none of this would have happened as the real owner was in the habit of habitually yelling out  'Quiet at the Bar' when necessary.  The local guy also mentioned that there had been some 'trouble' with the son being too big for his britches before. This bar is a nightmare of cacophony and only very loud bands should ever consider gigging there.  All these people were trying to help solve the problem that was becoming more and more apparent to everyone was the bad call of the bar in supporting the bad behavior of the Jeff Campbell guy. In any case, lets hope there is someone in charge over there soon who knows how to run a bar as this cook not only doesn't even know how to cook well but along with the guy from the Jeff Campbell band was the only one that night who was vulgar, rude and disrespectful and certainly didn't know how to defuse a ridiculous situation in an appropriate and professional manner - his ego appears to have  seriously gotten in the way. Maybe he has a future in Daddy promoting him to door man where he can have folks thrown out to his hearts content. There is a blow by blow account of this silly melee  being circulated to music fans by the guy who made the impromptu speech to the crowd that is the funniest thing I've read in awhile - neither The Starry Plough or the Jeff Campbell Band come off well and neither are making friends or fans from this night. Yelp could have been an opportunity for the Bar to save some face and apologize but instead they've stupidly doubled down.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Starry Plough\",\"ReviewDate\":1369785600000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Starry Plough is definitely a one of a kind spot!

The pub had quite a few folks for a Monday afternoon, mostly local, and as evening approached, the weekly Irish dance lessons got underway, which was fun to watch.The best part was the food -- perhaps because it was so unexpected. I had the chicken burger, which was a grilled chicken breast on a soft and crispy bun, with fresh lettuce, pickles, and tomatoes. I mean, who'd expect a chicken sandwich at a bar to be very good? But it was delicious. The chicken was seasoned and cooked well, bigger than the bun, and covered with Swiss cheese. (FYI, cheese is extra.)

I had so much fun dancing by myself (with a crowd of others) that I completely lost track of time and missed the last bus home. Luckily, I was able to find someone kind enough to give me a ride. I highly recommend this show, different bands perform each month and so far, all that I have seen have been great.They had a sliding scale $6-$10 cover, which was great for me as I am currently unemployed and cash flow is a major issue. For this same reason I didn't order any drinks, but from what I saw, they do have an excellent selection of beer on tap, domestic, microbrew and imported in the $3-4 a pint price range-- when I have some extra cash I will certainly grab a beer. They did have a pitcher of water out for anyone to hydrate, which was great as you dont have to stand there and try to get the bartender's attention just for a glass of water like most places. Inside, there is the stage and dancing area on one side, and the tables and bar on the other. It was very crowded, but a warm atmosphere, I can safely say that most if not all of the people there seemed to be having a really good time as well. The location is very convenient to get to by public transportation, right off the 18 bus line, and not far from the Ashby bart and next to another venue I have yet to check out La Pena Cultural Center.On the walls are protest posters and Irish pride splashes here and there, and with the high ceilings, I didn't get the stereotypical  dark cave-like Irish Pub feel, which wasnt a bad thing, it simply had a feeling all of its own.I will for sure come back here to check out their Irish Music, Open Mic, Poetry Slam, Art Bazzar and other such repeating (every # day of the week) shows.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Starry Plough\",\"ReviewDate\":1328486400000,\"ReviewContent\":\"There was a debate going on between friends about whether Starry Plough was a dive or not.

But don't let that scare you away! The anti-government\\/ Irish pride paraphernalia gives it a charm all it's own. I feel pretty darn lucky to have this happenin' little hideaway within stumbling distance from home. They've got an interesting line-up of live music virtually every day of the week. I haven't been to their infamous Open Mic night yet, but the Friday night shows have been fun, drawing a lively all-walks-of-life crowd.  You'll see old folks dancing tenderly, tripped out hippies with their eyes closed and their arms flailing, and tame observers tapping their toes. At least, this was the case for \\\"Petty Theft\\\", a seriously spot-on Tom Petty cover band.Speaking of covers, the bigger shows are usually $10 so you'd better plan to stay awhile, call some friends, and make a night of it.

Adorning the walls are a fleece blanket with multiple portraits and profiles of Obama, vintage posters in both Spanish and English protesting neo-colonialism and supporting socialist uprisings in Nicaragua, Zimbabwe, and Chile, quotations from famous Irishmen, and the Starry Plough itself.I came to the pub in about as low of spirits and energy as one could be, and I left raving about how much fun it was to hear the Irish folk music, the grandma who hopped up on stage to sing an old tune, and the dance instructor who taught everyone to dance.

The crowd is varied, the people I go with are all early to late 20's, but there are also quite a few older regulars as well. It can be a bit crunchy, but not in a bad way and the bar just smells slightly musty not hippie stinky. The main bartender (Shaheen?) is a riot, he always has fun stories to tell and is fun to talk and laugh with once things wind down after midnight. The drinks are good and average priced, and he knows how to pour -best tasting Guinness in Berkeley is here! The rest of the staff is great too, and everyone is super friendly.

They were charging $10 at the door which is pretty steep, but I wasn't about to leave because the trek involved two wrong buses and way too much walking.  The venue was practically empty, but it was still rather early (around 10pm).  After the opening band was finished, they left and so did their parents, leaving about 5 people to watch the headliner.  That's cool; I came to dance, so I still boogied down and had a great time, but I noticed large groups of people turned away at the door because they didn't want to pay $10 for a band they've never heard of.  Reduce your cover charge Starry Plough! Don't you want people to drink your beer??..at least there's no line at the bar or the bathroom, I guess.My second visit was quite disappointing.  Came here straight from work one day to meet up with some friends, ordered a pizza and waited about an hour for it to come!  I understand that it's made fresh and takes time to cook, but after I ordered I watched the cook chat with one of his friends for 20 minutes before getting started on my order.  The price is reasonable, but the pizza is forgettable, and the service was just painful.Apparently they were hosting a poetry slam that night.  We weren't planning on staying much later, but certainly would've had another pint if not for the rude lady collecting money for the slam.  She came around several times to take our money, even after we told her that we were just finishing up dinner and would be leaving shortly.

Perhaps because of the night I went, poetry slam night, there was an overabundance of underage high school kids. While I have nothing against high school kids I'm in my late 20s and have no interest in hanging out with them socially. I guess that just comes with the territory though.I was happy that the Starry Plough had my favorite beer on tap, Smithwicks, because not too many places I've been in this area have Smithwicks. Because it was poetry night there was an emcee but it was impossible to hear her over the music in the background and the talking of the other patrons.

Decent food, good grubbage for a night of drinking. Their fish and chips are pretty damn good and their burgers hearty. Yum. I have so many great memories from this place.

They're my neighborhood night spot and and I'm so glad they're here. One thing I'm unhappy about? When they remodeled their bathrooms, they painted over over twenty yeas worth of latrinalia (bathroom graffiti) and my favorite bathroom graffiti EVER is now gone. I have saved it to memory, though. Someone wrote: Some jaded miscreant sat here and thought about life for awhile... And directly under it someone responded: Thanks for hogging up the bathroom! Haha! Fer reals!

Other nights may be different, but every time I'm here I notice more than 50% of the crowd drinking juice, Snapple Iced Tea or water, which is not a bad thing. You wouldn't want belligerent drunk during a show.

The parking is just impossible whenever I come out.  Then when I go in, it's a little dingy and depressing, so maybe it's authentic Irish that way.  They do have dancing classes on certain nights so you can learn how to do the riverdance, then its followed up by live music so you can practice your newly learned moves.

Then it all makes sense. This place should get 3 stars for being what you think it is.

They could significantly increase revenue if they had cocktail waitresses to bring you drinks, instead they compensate by sticking you with a COVER CHARGE OF UP TO FIFTEEN (15) DOLLARS.

I wasn't much in the drinking mood, but the bartenders were nice and there is a $10 limit if you want to use a card to pay.

This being yet another \\\"passed it a million times for the last 10 years but never went in\\\" establishments, I am actually glad I never went or else I may not have kept my waifish figure for so long. *note said waifish figure no longer exists on me.*I wanted to be immersed in sweet music, rich heady beer, and savory brined meaty deliciousness (from the oven, you dirty birds). I was on the hunt for corned beef and cabbage. All hands pointed to here or Becketts. It was closer to home and not the insanity madhouse (well, almost, but not quite) of Becketts so two of my bestest friends fell prey to my promise of beer and briny meat to partake in St. Paddy's Day, Starry Plough style.The corned beef, cabbage and potatoes were great, as a return trip w\\/ JR reminded me. The Irish have a good thing going with all that salt and spices cooking up a pinky slab of beef. Being piggish as we always are, we tried to go for seconds but they ran out. Not surprising since it was around 9:30, so we tried their fish and chips. Too bad I don't remember how good it was, because my focus the entire day was seeking out the corned beef and cabbage so it looks like I'll have to go back and have a rematch. JR and I also had their chicken pot pie on another occasion, which was less desireable than the corned beef but on Sundays they apparently don't serve the full menu, they just make one veggie and one non-veggie dish. The crust was more biscuit-like than pie-crusty and most notably a good number of the potatoes in the pie weren't cooked throughly (there's a reason why chefs try to make everything uniform). We were starving however and ate around the uncooked potatoes, too busy listening to the reels, jigs and ceilis to care too much.  Many, many beers later, some spilt due to brimming pint glasses and inebriated jovial folks, an ear full of Irish tunes and two happily fed friends, we left the stuffy, humid building with good memories of good  food, good beer, good music and great friends.

I was slightly interested in going to Berkeley last night & seeing Wayward Sway perform at a bar similarly named to one of my favorite Clement St bars. They usually rock whatever venue they enter, but this was definitely an exception & not even their fault. From the start of their set, the sound was horrible. I'm not over exagerating, either. It sounded like the audio engineer was deaf--the instruments were about the same level as the vocals. A friend in the band mentioned that he didn't have stage monitor the entire time.For a \\\"live music\\\" venue & pub, this place horribly fails.

What can I say after my first foray into Berkeley nightlife?I'll stay in San Francisco, thank you very much.Went to the Plough last night to see a friend's band play. A folky, bluegrassy, hand-clappin', foot-stompin' crew. We were prepared for a good time; we'd heard good things about this place. That it was a great little pub-venue for local acts. We were expecting, well, um, FUN.But alas, this place was a real dud. First off, the kitchen was closed when we got there, at 10:00. Um... okay. What now? We'll get something to eat in the neighborhood! Only there's NOTHING in the neighborhood.But hey, it's not the Plough's fault the neighborhood is a snore. Also not their fault is the lame crowd that gathers there. The place was full. Full, alright. Of people drinking coffee and water (and one guy SLEEPING) and engrossed in conversations that I'm sure were way too sophisticated for us SF hoodlums to join in on. Because the joint had the most unfriendly vibe of any bar I've walked into in the Bay Area.They listened politely enough when the music started -- TOO politely. But they also never smiled. I kid you not. There was no smiling in this bar. I felt mildly retarded, grinning and swiveling to Martin's music.And they golf clapped. Once again, I kid you not. Golf clapping. To bluegrass.But again, that's a product of the people and not the bar. What IS the Plough's fault is that their sound guy SUCKS. Maybe it's because it was 4\\/20. Maybe he had a little too much wacky tobbacky, if you know what I mean... But he clearly was not hearing the same music we were hearing. Dude, vocals up. Stage monitors, perhaps? Seriously.

The food is greasy (but fairly decent) and dirt cheap ($2 burgers! Even dirt isn't this cheap!), the bar keeps BOTH Guinness AND Murphy's on tap, and is often tending by a charming 30-something dark-haired Irish lass who taught me a few words in Gaelic (ga ha mahagith to you too, darlin'). Their website calendar isn't updated frequently, but know this: weeknights you can expect a local cadre of regulars to bust out their fiddles, mandolins, and guitars to work up a feverish jig while patrons  nurse their stouts. Weekends usually feature a line-up of newly minted bands straight from their garages--not a good time for a quiet conversation. And here's the biggie--a dealbreaker for some--Wednesday nights are Slam Nights, when the Plough charges a cover to support bad poetry. The only time I was ever impressed by the quality was about five years ago when Mike Cirelli dominated the local poetry slam scene with his odes to waitresses and Point Reyes (dude even published a chapbook called \\\"My Tarnished Heart Still Blings\\\" before getting out of the inbred Slam scene for good).Still, for a local hangout with no pretense, no meat-market, and  good vibes (a good thing, in vibe-friendly Berkeley), the Plough is a Brokeley favorite.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Starry Plough\",\"ReviewDate\":1169683200000,\"ReviewContent\":\"This pub is a Berkeley institution, with a nice beer selection and a fantasticly simple grill serving the best cheese burger in the Bay Area.The vibe is VERY laid back, friendly and neighborhood-y.

If you yanked the place up by it's foundations and plopped it into any other city, it wouldn't work in it's current form.  It can only work in Berkeley...and it works well in Berkeley.\\r The soothing sound of  Rhythm + Blues greeted my ears as I walked into the most well-preserved stronghold of old-guard Berkeley culture I've yet to encounter.  An aging bar with a  feel of history sits up against the South Wall, while a sizable stage sits off to the side of the entrance facing Shattuck Ave.  Adding to the Berkley theme, a sizable collection of aging political flyers announcing protests, rallies, and varying political statements graces the area around the door.  A fair amount of seating sits in front of the stage, gracefully blending into an eating area near the kitchen in the back.\\r Several windows near the entrance enhance a pleasant daytime vibe. The incoming sunlight  creates a natural glow around the end of the bar, then slowly fades to an appropriate cafe-like subtleness in the dining area.  The Starry Plough's layout is truly interesting.  It incorporates the elements of a bar, a performance area, a kitchen, and a restaurant into one space...and does so without any one section stepping on the toes of another. It's very old-school....and very Berkeley.\\r I sipped an ale and looked around the Starry Plough, glancing about at several young couples as I chatted politics with a collection of middle aged men.  At the same time, I could easily image being transported forty years prior to another time, where the events advertised by the antique posters on the wall were taking place.  I could envision the place filled with long hair, tie-die shirts, and peace-sign medallions.  It was easy to look up on the stage and envision idealistic voices from the last generation attempting to rile the masses to support the passion of their choosing.   In this day and age, countless memoirs of local culture have perished at the hands of the hip and trendy, and few remain.  Finding the Starry Plough was a refreshing experience.

On top of that, the bar has the best collection of protest propaganda from the past 30 years, yellowed from hanging on the wall in a formerly smoky bar. They really ought to restore those.

The night I went, Kid Beyond (the ultimate beatboxer) was a featured guest he was way cool (although some of his numbers were a bit on the long side).  The event is judged by the lottery picked members of the audience who hold up numeric scores after he poet goes, and the best part is that each of the 5 audience judges get a free beer for their services.  The host of the event was witty and entertaining, the talent on stage was impressive, and the crowd was down to earth and respectful of the poets.  The house jazz band, 3 Blind Mice, was surprisingly REALLY good and weaved in and out of the poets quite well. The show starts at 8:30pm, there's 2 rounds of poetry, and it goes till about 12:30pm. I had a great time and would definitely go back.  \\r http:\\/\\/www.starryploughpub.com\\/poetryslam.html  http:\\/\\/www.daniland.com\\/slam\\/\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Starry Plough\",\"ReviewDate\":1114128000000,\"ReviewContent\":\"It's true that the Starry Plough is mostly a folk-oriented venue and is nominally an Irish pub, but they're pretty loose in their booking policies and will gladly take rock bands that lean toward the cabaret\\/acoustic\\/folk\\/art side of things--hence my memorable times here seeing Ramona the Pest, Mark Growden, Charming Hostess, etc.  Their open mic night is also one of the better ones I've been to and attracts some respectable talent while keeping the mood friendly and congenial.

Not saying that the behavior of an employee defines the business, but my experience there was terrible when I went there with my older sister and some friends back in June 2015. I have been having trouble finding the bar, but I remember how it looks like and I just found it, so here it goes: I am a vegan, and employees in this restaurant won t give a single hoot accidentally fooling a vegan. Hecks, they didn t even apologize! I asked for a vegan burger, and then I either asked if the cheese or if everything is vegan, and the lady said yes. Then I noticed mayonnaise. I asked the male employee if the mayonnaise in the vegan burger is vegan and if the cheese and bun is vegan, he said no. Then they were taking a while to remake it, and then the guy just jumped to saying that they don t swap it for another order and that they give no refund, and that they re not like McDonald s giving the refund and it seems like they reserve the right to refuse checking for the ingredient. Safe space? When they fool someone with food allergens, they will be shown to not be that much of a food allergen friendly area on the news. Maybe they already did, which is maybe the reason why they are temporarily closed! Vegans, do yourself a favor and do not come to this restaurant when they reopen. They will most likely not give a single hoot about your diet and will fool\\/fraud you. Just because this place is a safe space for LGBTQ, it doesn t give them any more right than others (not the special exemption) to fool vegans. Just a note, veganism is not the same exact same thing as vegetarianism, and chances are if someone is trying to order something vegan, they are vegan, so don t play any bets with feeding them non-vegan stuff. Is Berkeley not supposed to be a progressive city? This business has shown that it doesn t belong in Berkeley, nor in California, nor in the United States, nor in any republic or democratic nation.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Starry Plough\",\"ReviewDate\":1648559059167,\"ReviewContent\":\"My ex used to work here and its awesome.

ONE Irish beer (Guinness). Irish music sessions on Sundays do provide Irish music, but the band is a crowd of 20 or so amateur musicians, and it only takes one or two of them to be out of tune or off rhythm to make it baaaddd Irish music.  Walls are festooned with sayings and pictures of heroes of the Irish resistance like...Che Guevara?!?  On the plus side, the burgers are very good and and there are vegetarian options.  The sad thing is this could be a 5-star Irish pub if they just put more Irish beers and food on the menu, took down the Che poster, and insisted on the band auditioning its members.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Starry Plough\",\"ReviewDate\":1522328713690,\"ReviewContent\":\"Small place, but I was there on open mic night.

The comic book shop looks very empty with shelves up against the wall instead of forming aisles, cute seating on the border, and it's very spacious inside, whether this setup\\u00a0is due to special events or due to the pandemic. The music hall in the back where the concerts are held looks more beautiful and inviting than I remember (or maybe it's just the person I was with that made me feel that way).\\u00a0Lots of colorful lighting, great posters on the wall, plenty of seating (with just a few tables), and of course the tiki-themed decor everywhere. The food and drink offerings are limited here, but it's better than nothing.We visited this past weekend, and got to enjoy performances by\\u00a0Tuz & The Sound and Social Justice Collective, talented musicians who were just extraordinary, poets performing beautifully with rhythms of different music on stage. The drummer was particularly outstanding, and\\u00a0the artists on stage were all smiles and seemed to be having such a great time the entire night, which made\\u00a0the perfect atmosphere for the crowd as well. The show ended around 10pm, so it was about 2 hours long. But you don't need to arrive at the start time, which made it convenient for us as we opted to take our time having dinner on a Saturday evening before attending.Art Boutiki\\u00a0does live music the way it should be, with great sound quality and lighting, professional setup and equipment on stage, and no messy wires creating a distraction for audiences. And of course, great bands!\\u00a0I did get a bit warm in there (it was a hot day in SJ), but they had the fans blowing, so it wasn't too bad.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Art Boutiki\",\"ReviewDate\":1575763200000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Best venue for music in San Jose.How many placed have a comic store in the front. A music venue in the back and a hidden away printing shop for all your t-shirt needs and shenanigans?!Probably the most versatile place ever. I've been a huge fan of this place since they were in downtown San Jose and I continue to love this place til this day. Its been awhile since I have been there (due to life complications) but I always recommend friends to check out music even if they are unfamiliar with the band. You won't be disappointed.

They really do the SJ music scene a huge favor around here by showcasing fresh or seasoned talent without ego :)\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Art Boutiki\",\"ReviewDate\":1573430400000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Great small venue for listening to live music or performances.  We saw the Top Shelf Big Band there and the sound and lighting were wonderful.  Their website warns you that parking is not great, so we had UBER drop us at their door step, easy-peasy!  They had a decent selection of wine and beer.  They even have food, which they call small bites. No fresh fruits or vegetables were available as far as I know. You go up the bar to get your drinks and order food.  They give you a restaurant pager that lights up and jiggles to let you know when to pick up your food.  The food was served in paper plates, but it was a normal wine glass. Periodically, I gave the bar empty beer bottles, dirty napkins, dirty paper plates and dirty wine glasses. The seating includes about 10 dinner tables and various upholstered chairs behind that.  The music started at 7PM on a Sunday evening with a crowd of 50-60 people. Starting at 6PM would be even better for us as so many places start at 8PM or 9PM for music which is too late for us.  We bought the tickets on line for about $16.xx including an on line surcharge.  The food items and drinks were all under $10 each.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Art Boutiki\",\"ReviewDate\":1569974400000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Great atmosphere here! Dan is awesome, fun and friendly.

The sound is incredible complete with a real sound guy that knows his craft.   The front room is a comic shop that sells all sorts of books and shirts and trinkets and stuff. The back room with the stage has a bar that serves beer and wine. You can also order food from their limited menu.   I would love to give them 5 stars but they sell food and it's really bad. My wife ordered a chicken bowl and I never heard the end of it. The white rice was crunchy like it was cooked and reheated and her chicken was still frozen in the middle. Ugh, I didn't get any food but she was quite disturbed.    I think ultimately this is a killer music venue and all the other stuff is just a bonus. I say go to the taqueria across the street then come see the show. Rock'it!\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Art Boutiki\",\"ReviewDate\":1549065600000,\"ReviewContent\":\"SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery reminds me of mullet: business in the front, party in the back. The front part of Art Boutiki is a store, and the back part of Art Boutiki is a legit music venue.Art Boutiki's front store has a small selection of comics, statues, toys, pop culture art, clothing, and other miscellaneous items. I must say though that Art Boutiki isn't the kind of comic book store where I would go for my weekly comics pull. You'll mostly find trades. During nights when there are shows, this area becomes a great mingling space for bands and their fans since bands have their merch tables set up in this part of the establishment. So far I've been to Art Boutiki twice. I went to a show a few years ago to see a Seattle band called General Mojo's, and the latest show I saw was with the SJ local band, The Pounders. Art Boutiki's music venue is perfect for small, intimate performances. They do serve alcohol, but I believe only beer and wine. It's got a decent size general standing area, but there are lounge chairs and couches in the back. The sound and acoustics sound great at Art Boutiki. I like how Art Boutiki carries out the tiki theme. You'll find Polynesian art and tiki masks throughout the entire place. Even the bar at the corner of Art Boutiki's music venue is a small tiki bar stand.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Art Boutiki\",\"ReviewDate\":1548374400000,\"ReviewContent\":\"I've been coming to this venue for 2 years now.My friends play here, but I've come for other events, although primarily for the folk\\/indie scene.It's a small place, seats maybe 50-60 people comfortably. They have an easy to see stage from all angles and it's decently lit. The ambience lends itself to an island feel - Art Boutiki, emphasis on the Tiki.They serve drinks of all kinds, coffee, tea, beer, and wine.Their beer is more on the IPA side, but still a couple other varieties. The wine is a bit short, just a few selections, but enough to appease.Their sound board is on point - never too loud and they are dialed quite well for the size of the room.You can preorder tickets usually online for a few bucks cheaper, walk ins are around 12 bucks for the night.Usually it's 2-3 groups for a total of 3-4 hours of play. Almost always worth the time.I'll keep going here and I always look forward to their events. An absolute gem of San Jose.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Art Boutiki\",\"ReviewDate\":1545782400000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Dan is the man for all your DTG printing needs!

I've seen several locals play this venue and brought my Wife and teenage Son.A couple that's lived in San Jose has owned and operated the place for a long time and is highly respected by the bands and customers that frequent it.I've seen a lot of great local talent here.They serve alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages and an assortment of appetizer type dishes. Pizza, chicken fingers, that sort of thing.The only con is that it's in an area where the zoning goes from commercial to residential so they tend to close around midnight. They are also in a part of town that honestly looked a little sketchy to me but I've never had any problems.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Art Boutiki\",\"ReviewDate\":1530489600000,\"ReviewContent\":\"The best place in San Jose for local live music.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Art Boutiki\",\"ReviewDate\":1519430400000,\"ReviewContent\":\"I've been to this place a few dozen times over the years and it's never the same place twice.

I was absolutely blown away and will definitely be back. First off, the venue:The place itself has a deliciously cool warehouse feel - without the terrible acoustics. The stage was impressively setup and for once, the soundboard was in the back, where competent sound guys were manning the board. The staff:Extremely friendly staff, utterly lacking the smug hipsterism too often seen at other venues and events. They were genuinely glad to help their customers and treated me - and the rest of the musician rabble - very well. The open mic:This was, hands down and by far, the coolest open mic that I've been to, and I've visited from Dallas to Detroit to LA, to everywhere in between.  Why?It was perfectly eclectic. Although there was a hip-hop overtone, ALL were warmly received. I played an acoustic set. I was followed by numerous comedians, rappers, and a couple of monologues. The environment was one of community and not competition - a sentiment felt and experienced at most other open mics that I've been to. In short, in a single evening, this place earned my respect and my business.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Art Boutiki\",\"ReviewDate\":1478476800000,\"ReviewContent\":\"Tons of fun here at this all ages venue.

Its roomy and spacious, with seating to accommodate large parties. The kitchen specializes in tasty comfort food. Think burgers, sandwiches, fish and chips, and things that stick to your ribs. They do have a couple vegetarian options, if thats a concern. You order your food at the bar, and staff brings it to your table. Prices for the food are very reasonable. Most of the money youll spend here will apply to the drinks. If you see a show here, its a standing-only venue, though staff can make special accommodation for seats if you are injured or have a disability if you notify them ahead of time. They have a bar in the back, if you want a drink during the show. The sound system is great.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Cornerstone Berkeley\",\"ReviewDate\":1709762394003,\"ReviewContent\":\"Its a large support full bar and restaurant with many screens and projectors around. Great for sport watching, groups, casual hangouts and meetups. There are big runs for private parties with screen in the back. Not kids friendly on busy game days but could still be nice on regular days! Service is great with many responsive attentive staff. Foods are petty good American. Id recommend burger fries sausage tri-tips pulled pork pretty much everything is good after couple pitcher of good beer Parking: Kind of difficult but possible paid street parking. There is public parking around too.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Cornerstone Berkeley\",\"ReviewDate\":1709762394003,\"ReviewContent\":\"A lot of taps and choices of beers, live music once in a while.

Ill have to visit sometime for a beer.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Cornerstone Berkeley\",\"ReviewDate\":1707256794530,\"ReviewContent\":\"Ok so we went here to see Foreverland (a Michael Jackson cover band) and this was my first time here. I have to say they kinda hide the concert venue in the back and up the stairs beyond the bathrooms. First impressions, new, open space tall ceilings big ol tap bar and sweet outdoor back area. Kudos in the design as you cannot hear the noise from the game in the concert area and thus cannot hear the concert in the bar area, they did a great job of sound proofing. Also the outside area in the back is walled up so its open at the top but with a few umbrella style shades and gas fire for warmth, I like it. The staff were friendly and helpful, the drinks were tasty especially the Apple chai hard kombucha (amazing). We really were excited to try their food n dessert offerings but were a few minutes late to order. Parking can be an issue as its limited so go early and take note that their kitchen closes around 8-830. I will definitely be going back, this time to try the food n another drink.

Looking through my photos, I m going to review places where I ve been, in reverse order. First up is Cornerstone, and I have to say that I m proud of this photo. A basket of fries and pint of Death & Taxes, sitting on my table in the evening light, took on the gravity and artistry of a masterwork by Vermeer or Degas. Anyhoo, after a solitary start with my beer and fries, it ended up being a big group   a post-lockdown work reunion   and I think everyone was pretty happy with their night. I like Cornerstone because it s one of those bars where you re more likely to mix with more people (within your own group or randos) rather than somewhere like Jupiter where people tend to not leave their seats. Not that I don t love Jupiter   the two places are similar in some ways but Cornerstone adds a level of chaos (but in a good way!). Good selection of beer and food, spacious and pretty   what more do you want? I m also giving the Cornerstone 3.5 out of 5  Green Stars  for social and environmental impact, based on this: Large emphasis on local draft beer, which is so much better than packaged beer from afar. On this visit, the staff ran out of clean glasses and switched to plastic cups. Generally that doesn t happen but hopefully it won t become a trend. The food menu caters well for vegetarians and fairly well for vegans. No info is provided on social and environmental impact (e.g., food sourcing, staff benefits, etc.) According to Glassdoor, a server\\/bartender earns around $16\\/hr plus around $10\\/hr in tips.

He told us he would take care of us and he did. We showed up right before the time we were told it would get crowded. We had a table outside near the fire pits, in ear shot of the DJ. It was awesome. The food was great, drinks were yummy and strong ( for me but Im a cheap date My husband said they were perfect). Delicious German beer that my husband loved. Staff came around often to check on guests. As the night went on the crowds got bigger. All wearing masks. Im glad we stayed outside, inside was a bit too crowded for me as the night went on. But it made me happy to see people dancing inside. I was worried this was another club like atmosphere full of 20-30somethings and we would look out of place, but not at all. People of all ages were present ( we are in our 40s). The DJ played music from 90s Era to present.. Bar tenders were attentive. It was all around great business. Cant wait to go back.

The notice with the ticket said to let the venue know if you had a condition that needed seating; however, there was NO ONE to speak with.

Ordered a salad, charcuterie board, and sausage... boy did they deliver! Very generous portion sizes, and all very delicious. The grilled bread is a great side, pairs well with everything and has enough flavor and texture to stand on its own. The condiments that come with the sausages and board were varied and fantastic, added a lot of fun to the meal. They offer 3 tasters per person for drinks of which my party agreed that SLO Brew Cali-Squeeze (Blood Orange Hefeweizen), Moonlight Black to Reality (Czech Dark Lager... very dark!), and Mission Trail Aqua Dulce (cider... not too sweet) were the favorites. Our server was very very kind and accommodating even though he was just about to clock out. He made really great, descriptive suggestions and was very knowledgeable on what they had available. Made sure we had all the tasters, drinks, and food we needed before seeing us off for the night. Could not ask for more considerate and cheerful service. One note is that this place can be very popular with students so we had our IDs checked and partway through the night we were informed that a party of college students was coming in so we had to put on wristbands to order more drinks past a certain time.

When I told her I didnt like it she took it back no problem AND not telling me about their policy. I asked her can i get another beer and again  no problem. Then the bartender JOHN came up to me and gave me my new beer and rudely and awkwardly asked me why dont I like the beer, and whats wrong with it,  didnt you order this last time (never been here before) , just questioning why I didnt like it as if he was offended. He then told me he had to charge me for the first beer (even tho I sipped it once). Me and my friends are bartenders and have never seen this before. He said its their policy. Which is fine but dont interegate your   paying customers and go about it in a rude way. This policy is ridiculous, plus next time have the waitress have the balls to tell her own table the policy and everything could have been avoided. You guys should rethink how you go about telling people about your policy. Never will be back to this place!

Went here with a group of a about a dozen folks and we were able to reserve a couple of long communal tables. On a Tuesday night it was plenty quiet enough for conversation among us which is a pleasant change from bars that insist on making you shout. They had a good selection of craft beers and a full bar for the non-beer drinkers. Food that I tasted was good and a nice variety of smaller plates often being a twist on more traditional pub fare. For instance I had pork belly nachos - very tasty and good to share. There are some larger seating areas a big group could congregate although not as convenient if you wanted to eat anything that want finger food. The outdoor area does not have heat lamps so in the winter (which is most of summer here too) you will need to dress warm or huddle close to the fire.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Cornerstone Berkeley\",\"ReviewDate\":1525644075567,\"ReviewContent\":\"Beautiful rooms,  great beer, but conversation is next to impossible because of poor accoustics, and indoor music.

I visited to try the food twice: once when they first opened the kitchen (which is when you would expect them to put their best foot forward), then again recently, because I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt. The music venue is cool. The recreational activities are fun. The liquor selection is nothing to write home about. The owner is only passionate about filling his pockets and getting chummy with college girls in the VIP section during shows. But hey, what do you expect from that super classy old guy who runs Pappys?

The host was friendly and greeted us promptly and offered us menus. We chose to sit at the bar and the bartender greeted us quickly and gave us food menus. She made our drinks while we waited for our food. She was incredibly nice and patient with my friends dairy allergy. The music was loud enough to hear but subtle enough to talk which was great. Our bill was pretty low even though she waved a drink off for using rum instead of tequila, which we didnt mind. The only reason I put 4 instead of 5 is because the food portion was a bit small. Normally we get anything and share fries and be stuffed but we ended up eating somewhere else after too. This place has big tables for larger groups and a wide selection of beer on tap and alcohol.

However the staff for the music venue need to seriously rework their policies. I went to the Offspring show last night and was ejected for crowdsurfing onto the stage, along with several others who did the same thing. When I tried talking to a few of the staff at the door, they told me I was done and needed to leave. Firstly, its a punk show; crowdsurfing is going to happen whether you like it or not. If you dont want people reaching the stage, then put a barricade up. Second, if people do get onstage and you dont want them there, SAY SOMETHING. Give warnings and escort people back to the floor. Resorting immediately to ejection without willing to discuss what happened is ridiculous and unprofessional. There was also an incident where I was thrown out (attention to the word thrown) after falling on somebody and not being able to get back up, but that was more confusing than anything and less of a problem since I was able to blend with a group re-entering with no trouble. But still, that could be a lawsuit waiting to happen if someone seriously injures themselves being man-handled like that. Those tickets were not cheap, and having my night almost ended over something as trivial as crowdsurfing is absurd. I would have been willing to tone my actions down if I knew it was prohibited, but there was nothing that indicated it was, and no one was willing to talk to me about it after it happened. If this is how the staff at the venue are always going to be then I will take my business elsewhere.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Cornerstone Berkeley\",\"ReviewDate\":1494108083507,\"ReviewContent\":\"Ping pong!!!!\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Cornerstone Berkeley\",\"ReviewDate\":1494108083507,\"ReviewContent\":\"Great new hangout and game spot in Berkeley.

Rock n Roll that is. The environment is a little tight but cozy. They have some nice guitars hanging high up on the walls. Bartenders are the best. The Wednesday open mike is fun because the crowd that hangs out there is non-judgmentally enthusiastically warm and inspiring to do your thing. I loved the place.

Service was prompt and friendly, food was decent (margherita pizza had a lovely crispy crust but was a bit too salty).  Halloween decorations were creative and fun, almost everyone was in costume, which was super fun. However, a very disappointing opening band - Ledbetter and His Best Bets.  They bragged about not having rehearsed, which felt like a slap in the face after we paid a cover for the live music. And their lack of effort really showed in their performance.  The band used the same arrangement and rhythm for every song - i.e., all six musicians played together at medium-high volume throughout every song, creating a monotonous similarity.  Only one person sang, which added to the monotony, and he forgot the words several times, even on songs he himself wrote.  Their cover of Joe Cockers Feelin All Right was competent, but all the other covers sounded the same, and the original songs were uninspiring.  We had to leave before the second band played so no comment on them.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Fireside Lounge\",\"ReviewDate\":1699311899797,\"ReviewContent\":\"Its not my favorite place, but they have trivia on Tuesdays!\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Fireside Lounge\",\"ReviewDate\":1696633499800,\"ReviewContent\":\"Excellent beer selection and friendly service.

The spa is very good, however the mattresses on the beds in the cabin we had, 109, are expired making the night uncomfortable. In addition, the restaurant inside the Spa closes at 9 pm, limiting the possibility of eating when it gets late on the days walks. If you visit in summer, with nightfall starting at 8 pm, it becomes difficult to get to eat after spending all day in the park. The good thing is that since it has a kitchen, if you expect to leave the park late, you can cook in the cabin.

The private rooms are better than the shared rooms, but theyre still pretty dated and not really comfortable. They attempted to play up the aesthetic, without really understanding how to decorate or choose linens or anything. Its like a teenager with a very small budget was behind the entire construction and decoration of this place. Staff arent great, they have basic customer service skills but spend a lot of time hanging out with their friend\\/boyfriends when they should be focusing on answering phones or caring for customers or cleaning perhaps.\"}]"

For those of you who don t know, kava is a sacred plant to many people, used in ceremonies with the chiefs to dispel arguments. I enjoy kava because it connects me to the root of my existence, of all of our existences  it connects me to the ocean. I miss swimming in the ocean, kava running through my blood. If I could advise anything, go to Hawaii, get kava drunk, and swim in the biggest waves you can brave. It s a life changing experience. I hope everyone who comes here can learn a little bit about the people of the ocean. Along those lines, it s best practice among many to dip your finger into the kava 3 times, and each time flick the kava droplet over each shoulder, and then in front of you. As far as I ve been told it s a way of honoring of those by your side, seen and unseen, and those in front of you, seen and unseen. Then, drink the whole shell (if it s not too cold).

They stopped us from playing our game intentionally,  When we asked why they were acting this way, they didn t even giving us an proper answer. They even took our drinks away from our hands forcefully. They are asking us to leave the place using very offensive words which is very unfair.

We went with some friends and it was incredible. It was a Sunday night, acoustic open mic night. The place was full of musicians and music lovers. As a musician myself, not of any great talent, but nonetheless able to put together a guitar strum and sing a little song, I was interested in trying the place out. What I discovered there was a Mecca of amateur guitar songwriting talent. I was warmly welcomed and encouraged to try my hand there. There were even guitars available for me to use. In the end, I declined because I didnt really have anything ready. Now I regret that decision. Nonetheless, the beer was great, the people were lovely, and the experience was overwhelmingly enjoyable. Next time I go there, on a Sunday night, rest assured Ill be playing!

Excellent beer selection. Bartenders are fast and friendly. Theres also an outside enclosed smoking area with TVs. The problems I have is that some of the IPAs they have they dont serve you a full pint. Its like 8oz or something, but they still charge you full price.

My only reason for not giving 5 stars was being on the receiving end of a business policy with which I strongly disagree and hope will change. I was 10-15 min late to the 9am yoga class and wasnt able to get in the building. I waited outside for about 10-15 min and was about to leave when an employee walked by outside and noticed me and let me in. This was only half the battle and I also needed to get the attention of the people inside the yoga class via an open window to get in the next door. Once let in I was initially met with some friction, and was told that the doors lock 10 minutes after the start of yoga class out of respect for the teacher, and was told adamantly that thats the businesses policy. Now I certainly agree that students should make every effort to arrive on time. However, this is the real world in the SF Bay Area. People can be making a tremendous effort to get there, waking up at 7:30am, driving from 45 min away from the peninsula or Silicon Valley (as I did), people can get stuck in traffic, have trouble finding a parking spot. In my opinion turning such people away and leaving them locked outside for not arriving on time is cold and unfriendly, and not an approach that should be adopted by a healing center, whose goal is hopefully to spread love in the world. IMO doors should be open and customers\\/patrons should be welcomed with open arms. If certain people habitually arrive late each week, they can be talked to about it separately. I think this kind of balance and open mindedness is important in finding creative solutions to problems. Solutions that are uncreative and inflexible are usually rooted in some kind of fear, and should be what any kind of healing or spiritual center worth its salt should seek to transcend. I hope that in the future the policies of this center will be kind, accepting, and welcoming to all members, regardless of some occasionally poor punctuality ;)\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Center SF\",\"ReviewDate\":1696646462187,\"ReviewContent\":\"a refreshingly genuine experience.

I attended an intimacy event with Victoria and it supported growth in my marriage - and thats huge. On the negative side, the Jasmine tea was the most Ive paid at $13 for a pot of tea, took 10 minutes to arrive and was not as good as any of the tea I have at home from three organic brands. Parking was a challenge. The door person for the event first refused to take cash, then could not read the card automatically and had to enter it in, then said her machine could not process our credit card and finally asked us to buy the ticket (with the same card) on event-brite and asked us to step out of the way from holding up the line. If you dont want to hold up the line its simple: accept peoples money, starting with cash. Stepping back, I think most relationships fail because of this protocol, expressed in various forms along these lines: Person A) I am not equipped to connect with you in a way that would be easy and graceful for you. Nor do I plan to fix that. If you want to relate to me you have to solve my incompetencies or leave. Person B) Why should I have to solve your problems... Im leaving. I do think its mildly paradoxical that a center to facilitate relationships and community is the least capable of accepting energy in the form of money of any business Ive encountered in many months, particularly in a context where most community enterprises fail due to lack of money and money competence. When I went to pay for my tea something similar happened: My first card did not read when I tapped it (it works everywhere else). They said that happens often so I tried another card, which did work, making it hard to pay for tea and very hard to pay for an event. I think it is far more important that centers for community exist than how well they accept money. I also think that community is a phenomena that succeeds or fails based on competency. The easiest way to measure the competency of flow objectively is around money. All communities in our culture require some amount of money to be sustainable. So money is important after all for what it tells. I would not expect the social competency of a group to be higher than their competency for managing money, which is 100 times easier than managing psyches.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Center SF\",\"ReviewDate\":1683427262717,\"ReviewContent\":\"An absolute hidden gem.

The people at the centre went on to apologize and stated they had laid 8 rat traps and were befuddled how the rat managed to escape those rat traps and managed to go up my partner s shirt and bite him. They also did NOT inform the remaining guests of the rat which was still very much there running around and continued with the concert as though nothing happened. Being a cafe, this is gross negligence and a health violation so an inspection is warranted.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Center SF\",\"ReviewDate\":1651891263767,\"ReviewContent\":\"I was at a Sofar concert yesterday at The Center, and I was attacked by a WILD RAT. We were all sitting in the backyard. Out of nowhere, a rat just ran up inside my shirt, ran all over me, and bit me until I pulled it out. I was wriggling around for half a minute with a wild rat inside my shirt. I had to go to the emergency room right away. Multiple people saw this happen (including the venue organizer), and yet the concert was not stopped. No one else was informed that there was a wild rat running around. The person from the venue said they had 8 rat traps in place and couldnt understand how this had happened. Maybe hosting an event with over 50 people sitting on the floor wasnt the greatest idea if you have a known rat problem? No one bothered to call up later and check on me (despite having taken my friends number). The one silver lining was that the person at the venue offered me a first aid kit right away. I cannot believe something like this is taken so lightly. Having a wild rat running around which attacked someone is a huge health hazard to the audience. I cannot believe the event was organized in the first place, and even worse, continued despite the venue clearly knowing about the rat problem beforehand.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Center SF\",\"ReviewDate\":1651891263767,\"ReviewContent\":\"What an incredible space!

If you need a nice place to get away and relax from busy city life, this is the place for you. Its literally tucked away. You need to walk down a little alley and walk down the stairs to get to it. Once you walk in, take your shoes off and put them in the shelf to you right. Then walk up to the desk and order the tea you like. When I came here, I had a cold so I ordered the ginseng detox, recommended by one of the workers, and it cleared my sinuses right up. There are plenty of coxy little spots for you to cuddle up and read a book, or have an intimate chat with one another. The lighting is low and really makes the mood comfortable. I think its well worth it. If I lived here, I would definitely buy one. The workers that are here volunteer their time, they arent paid. The focus of this place is to create a community, make connections, heal, and transform yourself. I really wish we had a place like this where I lived. Everyone in here was so kind.

I walked by randomly in a furious haste to get home in order to calm my frustration from a recent phone call.

The tea lounge is beautiful and worldly with a great combination of people from all walks of life. The business person taking a break from their busy day, to the writer who looks centered and focused on every written word. The travelers who just met but seem to share a special connection, embarking on a possible friendship. Everyone from all walks of life should stop in and take a moment for themselves.

They also have these AWESOME cushions on which you can sit and they are REALLY comfortable, offer great support, and are probably good for posture. Im actually going to look into getting one for myself. Lastly, they have a separate room that can host classes which I find unique, great for individual and community betterment, and cool. *Disclaimer: I was offered a free pot of tea in exchange for a review.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"The Center SF\",\"ReviewDate\":1525660866410,\"ReviewContent\":\"Peaceful atmosphere, bit of trouble to find.

Firstly, theres a lot of art and desiderata over the majority of the interior, and secondly, the place is very intimate and hardly ever banging (i confess I dont go there at night too often, because why would I?), and Thirdly, its got a great customer area out back, with pretty cool\\/chill people, lots of succulents and, even though its not a huge space, it does offer nice spread out seating and plenty of elbow room for those of us in need of such stuff. Oh, I almost forgot: the barkeeps make good drinks, are no-nonsense, generally very chill, earnest and friendly, it all adds up to more than the sum of its parts. Id rate it higher but thats a tall order, probably an interior update, floors and all (including the stage, bathrooms and outside - maybe I missed it but a music on demand system and wifi thats accessible would be transformative and probably make it my goto for a simple place to go where everybody knows your name), and it honestly wouldnt take much.

The drinks are reasonable, I dont think theyre overpriced. The music can be hit or miss, so its good to check out the lineup and see if the bands have a website with music. The staff was friendly and the service was decent. A little bit of sound absorption on the ceiling and walls would be a huge help at this venue. Some of the bands can be too loud, so bring ear plugs just in case. Parking is a bit tough to find, so carpool with your friends. Got a chill patio in the back that is a nice place to chill between bands and get a bit of fresh air. Overall, Id say this is a great spot that needs to get a little bit more support. Music venues seem to be disappearing and this one tends to have some decent shows, so go out and listen to some music.\"}]"

I order a coffee and without waiting or asking if theres anything else, turns the screen to me and walks away to start my drink. I ask for the drink for here a few seconds after she started (she didnt give me the choice when taking my order) and proceeded to, without a word, stomp to the glasses and aggressively pour the espresso into it, spilling some of it. Proceeds to loudly bang spoons and such around aggressively as she finishes up. I say sorry my bad and once again silence. She puts my drink on the counter, the sides of the cup dripping, and walks away. I was stunned. I dont know what shes going through and I have been there myself working in food\\/customer service for nearly 10 years, but maybe take a day off if youre going to treat customers like a burden for a simple request. Id understand if it was busy or if I had some complicated request, and even then, like no offense girl but its your job? Life is hard and once again idk what this girl is going through.

I am here nearly everyday.  The decor has rich dark woods, a long bar, stools and tables (and a larger lounge space), and is balanced with artisanal lighting and a wall displaying forgotten pages from hundreds of books.  Living in the neighborhood, it has quickly become more than a bar\\/cafe, but a community gathering destination.  People stop by here from the neighborhood, from walking around nearby #LakeMerritt, or between #GrandLake & #Lakeshore and the #Oakland #Uptown neighborhoods. The bar has some of the best staples of #beer on tap, and always with creative rotation.  The bartenders are friendly and funny, the house drinks are creative and well-prepared, and the crowd cheers the local teams among the 3 monitors.  The liquor selection is deep and varied to cater to your specific taste.  With DJs spinning on different nights, live Gypsy Jazz on Mondays, trivia on Wednesdays, there is truly something for everyone here. By morning, it is a GREAT coffee shop serving boutique Oakland coffee roaster by individual pour, #BicycleCoffee, and pastries from local bakeries.  The music and baristas are always inviting, and with free wifi, the cafe has the perfect balance of buzz, solace and caffeine to create a healthy relaxing or work environment.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Room 389\",\"ReviewDate\":1367894630500,\"ReviewContent\":\"I came here for Trivia Night. It is not a good venue for trivia night if you ask me. Hard to hear, no tables for sitting at. I dont think I would come again for trivia. That said, this place rocks as a bar. Theres a cute outdoor eating area in front and its just got a great bar vibe. This is the place that folks who live in this neighborhood hang at, and its easy to see why.\"}]"

Yes, its inside of a hotel so you definitely need to go through the right entrance, and my friend walked me to the exact spot that we needed to come in through, maybe its the actual interest of the hotel but I dont know. All in all it is absolutely beautiful as a space! Very close knit, but still comfortable. They have a QR code for you to order drinks and a lovely cheesecake. Since I was the DD I decided not to drink and because we were going out to eat right afterwards.

Thanks to iconic Michael in the booth, the sound is always flawless. And the lighting is stellar. All other concert venues are forever ruined because no one sounds as good as they do in Feinsteins. The venue is so intimate that you walk away knowing how your favorite singer smells. You might even get a hit with nasty look from Seth Rudetsky, or nicked by an errant sequin from one of Broadway Barbaras fantastically high kicks. Never heard of the person performing? Not to fear: legendary tastemaker Randy Taradash doesnt let anyone on that stage unless theyre a brilliant performer.

There isnt a bad seat in the house, very intimate and small so you can see and hear everything quite clearly from anywhere in the house.  The food is decent, for a while they didnt have some variety but I think it has gotten better.  Lots of great artists with really fun shows they put on.  Often times there will be a step and repeat after the show and you can meet the artists which is always fun.  The bathroom is located in the hotel lobby and they do unlock it during showtimes, but sometimes if you get there really early they will not have unlocked it yet.  The hosts are always great and quick to seat you.  Service is great and they do their best to bring the food out before the show starts so that it is not disrupting anyone.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Feinsteins at the Nikko\",\"ReviewDate\":1525661075920,\"ReviewContent\":\"Great supper club venue with service to match\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Feinsteins at the Nikko\",\"ReviewDate\":1525661075920,\"ReviewContent\":\"Saw Mary Wilson from the Supremes there Fabulous!\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Feinsteins at the Nikko\",\"ReviewDate\":1525661075927,\"ReviewContent\":\"Lovely bar - food not so great.

Recently took my 16 year old daughter here for her birthday to see Adam Pascal & Anthony Rapp. To keep this review from getting to be too long, I will list the things I would want to know if I was considering buying tickets to an event. Facts: Feinstein s is located in Hotel Nikko in SF and is owned by singer Michael Feinstein. The venue holds roughly 120 people and is set up in a cabaret style. It is very cozy and I doubt there is a bad seat in the house. I    bought tickets 8 months prior to the event online. I found the event on Goldstar, but opted to upgrade to better seats and bought through ticket fly. Ticket prices vary per event but there are three sections to chose from. The back and far sides being the most economical, then the middle, and front. The seating is set up with small round tables that seat 2, down front and the center, with bigger tables on the sides and bars with stools around the edges of the middle section and back. You can chose your specific seats when purchasing online, but what you are really choosing is your price tier or section. That is because when you check in with the maitre d, you are then assigned a seat. The earlier you arrive, the better your seats. Doors open 90 minutes before the show, and it is definitely worth getting there around this time, or earlier if it is a hot artist. If you are disabled or have a large party you want to seat together they recommend calling their maitre d days and at the very least hours before doors open. You will find this number on their website under FAQ. There is a 20 dollar per person food\\/drink requirement, regardless of where you bought your tickets. This is easy to spend buy purchasing a few drinks or a light meal, or both! My daughter had their burger and a diet soda, I had a cup of tomato soup, and a thin Margarita Pizza and one alcoholic beverage and our bill was roughly 90 dollars. They do automatically tack on an 18% gratuity. All shows run roughly 60 minutes and there is no intermission. Parking is available either at the hotel via valet (they will validate you for 1 free hour) or on the corner of Mason & OFarrell there is a garage that will run you around 20 dollars, and I hear there is a cheaper garage farther down Mason, just past H & M. The Hotel in near Union Square so you can also take Bart to Powell and from there it is only a couple of blocks away. You must enter through the front of the hotel located at 222 Mason Street, San Francisco, California 94102.  If you are driving and planning to use their valet set your GPS to 180 Ellis Street to arrive at the driveway. Overall the club has a classy upscale feel to it. Dress would be date night, cocktail or business attire. No need for formal wear, but you dont want to show up in jeans either. Pros: You are so close to the artist that you feel like they are putting on a private show for you. Strawberry Fields alcoholic beverage is one of the best Ive ever had My daughter says their Kobe beef burgers are amazing. Contrary to other reviews Ive read the staff was very friendly. While the seating was definitely compact it was comfortable. After the show most of the artists will come out and take pictures with the guest. This is done in an organized manner with a line set up directly outside the door of the venue. Acoustics are great for one instrument and vocals, any more than that might be overwhelming. Minors are allowed in the venue, however I would recommend it for age 13 and up (or mature 10 to 12 year olds who love Broadway) Cons: With the tickets drinks and food and cost to park this can be a pricey night out. At 60 minutes the show seems a little short for the price you pay for the tickets. Tip: Ladies bring a small purse only as space is very limited. However their is a coat check need be. Make sure you visit their website for more info. Overall we had a great time, and my daughter left so giddy that the hotel guests probably thought she had been drinking.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Feinsteins at the Nikko\",\"ReviewDate\":1494125076457,\"ReviewContent\":\"Really cool intimate concert venue.

The band are VERY talented musicians and they work hard to give each guest singer a good experience. The crowd at the IVY ROOM was very supportive (and forgiving!) and the staff was enthusiastic,and charming as usual. Aside from the live band part, it differed from regular karaoke in that the lyrics you are reading do not alert you to a starting point where you should start singing. They ARE on an Ipad, but its pretty much just the same as holding a piece of paper with lyrics printed on it. I suggest going to the bands website, finding the link to their list of Karaoke covers and practicing a little with a YouTube karaoke video of that song beforehand-if you dont know the song you want to perform really well already.

It is the only place that hasnt made me want to commandeer control of the board. How do they do it? It remains a mystery that I dont need to solve.

From the door manager to the bar staff and everyone in between, it is welcoming, friendly, and absolutely fabulous as a gig venue.

There isnt much seating, just one large booth in the back.  Bathrooms were clean, well stocked.  They literally let people hang out and talk until they were locking the doors.  The guests and artists intermingled after the show which was great, and we got to chat with bay area notables that we havent seen in ages.  Seriously, I feel like the show I saw on 3\\/12\\/22 was one of the best gigs I have ever attended, and the cloud-nine feeling still is with me two days later.  I loved going to the Ivy Room.  In fact, just the name made me think it was an old-school type of place, and indeed it is.  The Ivy Room opened in 1943 in the middle of World War II.  The original neon sign is still on the building.   You can picture sailors and soldiers on leave, filling the place with laughter and hearing music.  There are multiple restaurants nearby for a delicious dinner.  We went to the White Lotus across the street, Thai food, and had a fabulous experience there.

I called ahead to ask about disabled seating and they said let them know at the door. I had a chair at a table for the whole night. Doing gigs at small places like this is a gift to the local fan base. The tickets were ridiculously cheap, but different shows charge differently. I wasnt thrilled about going with the hubby because I wasnt a huge fan like he is. But, after that show, I came away with a satisfied grin because you could sit 20 feet away from the stage and understand every lyric. The 2 warm up groups were also good. It reminded me of the 90s when places like The Omni and The Stone got decent names but tickets were reasonable.

The entire concert area was basically an open floor with about 7 chairs lined up against the far wall. the website says that, if you call them beforehand, they can make accommodations and reserve a space for you. I attempted to call the venue no less than four times within a two-week period to attempt to reserve a space. Each time I found that their voice mail was completely full and I was hung up on (via the system) because I couldnt leave a message and at no point did an actual human being ever pick up. Therefore, I was forced to take a chance and hope that there would be a space or at least a chair for me the evening of the show. I know now that if I hadnt been the first person to arrive for that show there would not have been a space for me at all.

Theyre move Uptown to this new location brought with it a loss of some of the old vibe, but the sound is better, and their booking is excellent. Again as with the Repertory Theater across the street, this is fast becoming the spot where Berkeley Elite come to play, since the door charge and drink cost are at this point more than any actual Working Class People in Berkeley can pay anymore. This is how this entire area is turning out, it puts on the face of being about the working class, while having left those actually in the working-class behind years ago. So I love the place, and I cant stand the place. It represents something beautiful, and it represents something sad.

And yeah, theres no alcohol sold but, sheesh people, must yall drink *every time* you go out?  Have a coffee or juice fer cryin out loud and just enjoy a natural mellow without the booze and whine, eh? ;) Other stuff:  easy parking, reasonable ticket prices, not far from the freeway if I remember correctly and not too hard to get to via public transit.\"}]"

This simple and humble wooden  gratitude  center contains a prayer wheel and walls filled with portraits of renown leaders, heroes, and devotees from so many loving traditions. Of particular interest to me are the handwritten dedications and offerings from people who guide my thoughts and actions so often they feel like (affordable) gurus and therapists who live in different rooms  inside  my head. The silence, peace, and compassion in the pagoda was so profound I felt firsthand what I can only term as the opposite of the Stendhal syndrome! My heartbeat slowed, my thoughts ceased, and even *I* had nothing left to say! I have no words that can convey the honor and grace of setting foot in a place of such deep restfulness and humility! My only thought upon reflection is    These are all simply human beings, just like me!   Right?

It used to be a beautiful place of refuge many years ago where you could learn the Dhamma of the Buddha and practice meditation - one of the spiritual jewels of the Bay Area.  Unfortunately, now it is becoming inauthentic and obsessed with the ego promotion of teachers.  Their embrace of McMindfulness (Google this) by exploiting the Dhamma for financial gain is a big turn off, and has kept me away from Spirit Rock in recent years.  Wake up folks!  Buddhism is NOT a play thing for your own sense and ego gratification, it is a serious, egoless practice to help us liberate ourselves from suffering in samsara.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Spirit Rock\",\"ReviewDate\":1683449330687,\"ReviewContent\":\"I really wanted to go to one of their retreats. However, they make it mandatory to be fully vaccinated with AT LEAST 1 booster shot. Im tired of being bullied\\/coerced by organizations and government into getting this vaccine, when vaccines are not for everyone; even dangerous to a small population. Tired of these inclusive groups being so accepting on the caveat that you share their beliefs, ideals and opinions about what is right for YOUR individual being; i alone am in-tune with my body, i know what it needs, nobody else can\\/should make that choice for me. Im sure they are Pro-Choice and yet they dont want to give people the freedom to choose whether or not they wish to take a recently developed drug, before longitudinal studies can be conducted. There is plenty of data showing that the vaccine is not the ONLY way to build immunity to this very real virus. Some of us have very valid reasons to decline this drug. Still, those of us who do decline, arent forcing\\/coercing others to follow suit; do what you will with YOUR person. They are; LGBQT+ allies, BIPOC allies, Pro-Choice allies, etc. I praise them for accepting and empowering these communities and individuals, this is all good and wonderful; aligned with spirit as it should be.. They are accepting of everyone. Everyone that shares the same world view and disposition as they do. If you dont agree with that position, then you arent welcome to their facilities. Spirit Chains, psilocybin should be the next substance on your list of mandatory drugs for entry.

I actually feel different in my own skin, which is quite amazing and as I look through my eyes I feel that Im looking through a different pair of lenses. I consider this place my Spiritual Home and I cant wait to go back. The simple daily rhythms could actually be difficult at times, but I never felt better. My body, spirit, heart\\/mind were nourished and filled up in a beautiful way. The combination of sitting, walking, working, eating on repeat, and going back to the absolute basics had me feeling alive and deeply connected to myself and the beautiful Coastal Miwok lands I was so honored to roam everyday.

It was my first time and I wanted to experience the center in more ways than just sitting in the small room with so many people.  During the silent walking meditation period, there were so many people and we werent allowed to go to the main building area, so even though we were walking outside, people were too close to one another and had to spread out to parking area which wasnt very serene! I was really hoping that I could enjoy a serene and quiet space while attending the retreat but it was too crowded and restricted. The retreat itself was nice, but maybe it could be a little smaller and more intimate?  Also, the fact that we werent allowed to move around the ground in silent meditation felt too constricted.  It seems like a nice, spacious place but I felt too confined to one area. It would be really nice if one could just visit the spiritual place without so much confinement. I am used to visiting temples in Asia where everyone is welcome at any time because no matter how many people are visiting, it is always very quiet. I wish Spirit Rock could make itself available to people who seek a quiet place any time, even if they are not paying participant to any of their retreats.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Spirit Rock\",\"ReviewDate\":1367916536937,\"ReviewContent\":\"A great place for a weekend retreat to center yourself.

Quite frankly I had one of the worst experiences of my life. First of all my dingy little room was not worth the $2000 I paid. At all. Ive stayed at better inns and beds\\/breakfasts for less. Second, I witnessed children pushing laundry carts which to me seems like child labor? Not ok. Also as soon as I was arrived I was literally screamed at by a staff member for crossing a bridge on car that HAD NO SIGNS. When I explained that it was my first time, I was lost, he continued to yell and scream, handling the situation completely inappropriately. Also the class I took is founded on theories of Eugenics? Especially as it pertains to those with Autism. I found this to be unprofessional at best and disturbing at worst. There was language in this course in regards to fixing or curing those with Autism. At the very least this is a dated ignorant viewpoint but it also very disturbing and dangerous. Individuals with autism are people, not science experiments, and are whole and complete as they are. Any language around fixing or curing autism is a red flag at best. I am hugely disappointed the institution would allow, support and endorse a course like this?? I will be pursuing options to get my money back this was frankly one of the worst experiences I have ever had. Overhyped.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Esalen\",\"ReviewDate\":1683449370220,\"ReviewContent\":\"Breathtaking landscape, and theres an energy there that makes your feel expansive.

For years I have tried to schedule a visit but could never find an open availability or COVID shutdown cancelled any plans. Upon arrival we were denied entrance because apparently we could pay for services but not have a day pass. Apparently the website was not clear or allowed a purchase for a couples event. The massage was only 1.5 hours but the $400 couples session required another $400 for an additional Day pass for me if as they put it was a favor since we traveled all the way. $800 for only 1.5 hour couples massage just didn t seem appropriate or helpful. The woman at the security entrance was nice but could not explain why we were sold anything scheduled after 4pm given we were not staying on the premises. The whole experience was not professional or well managed. For years I wanted to experience the wellness and historical significance of Esalen. We were told that because of our trouble and this special circumstance they would make a special concession and refund my wife s anniversary gift as I was not interested in paying the additional $400 for an extra day pass for only 1.5 hours. No concern or option to reschedule for another day. As we sat in our car for over 15  to 20 minutes while the security person and management would call and try to understand their website and scheduling problem we watched as 3 or 4 old dented dilapidated cars exited the property. We watched as people walked to our entrance guard and interrupted repeatedly for towels and told they could have 2 towels only if they returned their towels or left them somewhere in  the system ? At that point I just wanted to leave. I am sad for my Wife who was very disappointed and left with her special anniversary surprise an absolute debacle. I was happy save the day with an excellent 4+ hour anniversary dinner at Post Ranch Inn. It is a shame Esalen could not honor our scheduled 1.5 couples massage and fix the issue with their reservation system. FYI bring your own towels if you do get the opportunity to experience this place. At this point I don t recommend the trouble or experience of going. My expectations have been severely diminished. Good Luck.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Esalen\",\"ReviewDate\":1683449371333,\"ReviewContent\":\"I used to frequent Esalen during the late 60s and 70s,  yes, the Murphy days. Moved out of CA only to return to Big Sur decades later on a cross country road trip. My plans included a pre booked two day retreat at the Institute, I wanted to come back so bad. Unfortunately, this time I was completely disappointed. Right off the bat and based on the prices charged, there is nothing about being a non-profit organization. Okay, I can live with that, but lets make it clear and dont mislead. Reception wasnt precisely warm or inviting, but rather rude and robot-ized. Bad start. I also noticed quite young staff with little or no true hands-on credentials, portraying an ambience of fake friendliness and rehearsed speech, only comparable to a car dealership. And that really bothered me. There is also a very strong sense of disregard (I will omit using the term discrimination) towards golden age folks, especially those of us who originallly contributed to the accolades this place currently enjoys. To add more insult to injury, vax is required, quite a baffling contrast to the natural healing concept the Institution strongly preaches, not to mention the mushroom ceremony. During my 2 day stay, I was never tranquil, much less in peace with myself or with the place. Instead, I was totally in disbelief and frustrated. Sure, the facilities and scenery remain spectacular, but unfortunately Esalens main core and unique magic are long gone. In summary, todays Esalen rides more on name and past glory than true fulfillment. It seems their priorities now focus on profits than actual healing.

Esalen helped me achieve this in many ways. The grounds are truly jaw dropping and gorgeous. The baths were magical with the natural heated spring water. The massage offering was wonderful and much needed. The other guests were all open and friendly and the views from my premium room were incredible. I arrived expecting a retreat center so I wasnt surprised to see the sparsely appointed room and tiny shower. I also expected a cafeteria style dining hall rather than a sit down restaurant. All good! Im sure some expect a more hotel like experience- this is not that. I was on a solo\\/ self-guided retreat alongside ten other folks. All of us there for various reasons. I appreciated the light programmatic options and that there was zero pressure to attend or not attend. During the week there was a massage training workshop and a womens retreat and those folks would pop in and out of the shared programming as their schedules allowed. I certainly left with a couple of new friendships and a much clearer head on my shoulders. JJ, one of the teachers, was warm, good humored and wise. I enjoyed my time with him and certainly left with new insights about life from him. On a more practical note: I also appreciated the free Tesla and EV chargers available for guests. Super helpful and pretty easy to access despite a full campus of Tesla driving guests. Also- Im glad I brought layers of clothing as they recommended. The weather was perfect - low 70s during the day but cool and damp at night being right on the water. This is why there are hoodies! A few negatives: They need to work on their cleaning- my room was littered with the last guests hair- an easy thing to remedy if the crew is trained and given the right tools. Im vegetarian and only one lunch or dinner the whole week didnt feature Tofu as the main option.  I am glad I brought snacks. Despite their website saying no kids under 16, three of the five days I was on campus there were kids running around. Not quietly in the corner- Im talking racing through the dining commons and bath house being loud and energetic. A huge reason I chose Esalen was to find tranquility so it was really disappointing to see that there are children running around on a frequent basis- even at the baths! When another solo-traveller brought this up to the Esalen team during the orientation, we were assured that it was an off day due to the Memorial Day Holiday and kids are never around.  Apparently he was too optimistic. I hope that in the future Esalen will work on diversity and inclusion. Theres a whole world of people who would benefit from this experience besides white women in leggings. It will require direct outreach to communities that may not resemble the staff or leaders at this organization. I hope they will be brave and figure out this key component to make Esalen stronger and the world a better place.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Esalen\",\"ReviewDate\":1683449371887,\"ReviewContent\":\"Stop trying to outsource your healing to bougie overpriced places like this.

If they took spiritual enlightenment seriously they would be honest with themselves to see that they are acting entitled to, and taking something, that does not belong to them. If they actually cared about the Esselen people, or took their own spirituality seriously, they would have humility. They would step up and be serious about reflecting on their own actions. They wouldnt play fast and loose with the tribes traditions; and they would be serious about wholeheartedly respecting the wishes and concerns of the Esselen Nation.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Esalen\",\"ReviewDate\":1557218976527,\"ReviewContent\":\"This is going to be something to remember for quite some time.

The large majority of the group was nude in the springs and it was not uncomfortable at all.  They also have indivudal tubs if you dont want to be in the group.  The quiet side is definitely a better view and if you can go on a clear night it is truly stunning.

I was worried that I would be able to see the ocean from the tubs, but they do a great job lighting up the ocean so that you can watch the waves crash on the rocks down below. Clothing is optional. Most people seemed to naked. There is something magical about being so calm in the hot springs water and listening to the chaos of the ocean below. Totally worth the middle of the night drive.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Esalen\",\"ReviewDate\":1557218977173,\"ReviewContent\":\"For such a revered, healing-centered entity, there is a glaring disconnect between Esalens stated mission and history, and the attitude of the staff we encountered there. Another reviewer commented on their experience of the staff here as: extremely rude; seemed not to care one bit about what had happened. Accurately describes the experience I had as a night bather at Esalen just a couple of weeks ago. Bear in mind that the night bathing takes place from 1 - 3 am. We (including my partner and her cousin) showed up early, as we were camping not far from Esalen. When it was time to walk down, we asked the gentleman leading us down the hill where we could get towels. He said they prefer not to give out towels, but that we could ask at the entrance kiosk. Hmm. Once we got down to the kiosk, we asked the woman there, named Tony I believe, if we could have towels. She refused, responding with a pedantic and dismissive, we dont give towels to night bathers, in a tone that indicated we were somehow both undeserving and foolish for even asking. As if she was doing us a favor. As if it were already charity to let us use the facility, and not $35 per person, and that giving us a towel was just going above and beyond. Yes, you read that right: An establishment that charges $35 a person for two hours for the express purpose of *being in water* refused paying customers towels. I suppose we could have just left at that point, but we had paid our money, waited around to walk down, and gotten our hopes up...so, we decided to brave it without towels. What else were we supposed to do? After making a reservation online, by the way, this is *verbatim* the text regarding towels on Esalens website: Please support Esalens sustainable practices and if possible bring your own towel and consider towel usage on the planet, thank you. Note the words, IF POSSIBLE. I have attached a photo and circled this statement on their towel policy from their website. One would infer from this that Esalen has towels for those who forgot to bring one, or in our case, for those who came from camping and dont necessarily have all of the amenities of someone staying at a hotel or coming from a home. The next phase of our experience is truly mind-blowing. To our absolute shock and dismay, we discovered a couple had brought AN INFANT along with them. Tony was all smiles and sunshine with them, though, as we waited to walk down to the baths. It gets worse. There are two areas of tubs: one marked, Silent Room (an actual room) and another Quiet Room (which is outdoors). After changing, we made our way into the Silent Room. Guess whos in there? The couple and their crying infant. In the Silent Room. At 1 am. WITH A CRYING INFANT. This meant everyone else (probably around 20 - 25 people) were forced to crowd into the Quiet Room while the couple and their infant held the so-called Silent Room hostage. When we were done (and we made sure to get out by 3 am since they were adamant that we get off the property, in their words, promptly by then) we put on our clothes, and walked back up the hill dripping wet. Ever put dry clothes on after a shower without toweling off? Lovely. Im still scratching my head wondering what we did to deserve such awful treatment. God forbid we ask for a towel for an experience that revolves around water and that we paid $35 each for. To add insult to injury, we were celebrating a birthday, and though we had never been to Esalen, were excited and talked the place up to our visiting guest. Perhaps it goes without saying that we will never return.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Esalen\",\"ReviewDate\":1557218977177,\"ReviewContent\":\"place wish I could live here!\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Esalen\",\"ReviewDate\":1557218977177,\"ReviewContent\":\"Signed up to take a week-long program here, was put on the waiting list for sleeping bag quarters, and if nothing opened up, was told I would have a bunk bed reserved.

I was told the Director would call me to figure something out, but was never called back. The woman taking the reservations is extremely rude, seemed not to care one bit about what had happened. I looked in to staying off-site, but you still have to pay almost $600 in facility fees even if you stay off-site, so I had to cancel my trip to Esalen and the training course I was registered in (I was coming from Canada).Will never register for a course here again or visit the site.

The retreat center is nestled in the beautiful redwoods outside Santa Cruz, and the natural surroundings are breathtaking. From the moment I arrived, I felt a sense of peace and tranquility that I had never experienced. The staff was incredibly welcoming and accommodating, and the facilities were top-notch. The accommodations were luxurious and comfortable, and the meals were delicious and fresh. What sets 1440 apart is the quality of the programming. The retreat I attended was focused on mindfulness and meditation for nonprofit leaders, and the instructors were some of the most knowledgeable and inspiring people I have ever met. They led us through various exercises and practices that helped me connect with myself and other leaders in ways I never thought possible. I cannot recommend 1440 Multiversity enough. Whether youre looking to deepen your teams spiritual practice, improve well-being, or take a break from the stresses of everyday life, this retreat center has everything your organization needs. The beautiful setting, top-notch facilities, and expert instructors make it a truly unforgettable experience.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"1440 Multiversity\",\"ReviewDate\":1683449681060,\"ReviewContent\":\"Literally everyone we met was warm, friendly, kind, helpful and listened with heart. I was absolutely blown away by the supreme level of customer service at 1440 Multiversity for our retreat. Each interaction with people wasnt just high quality- I felt truly connected to each of the staff. They remembered what we shared with them. They were proactive in giving me a wonderful experience. If only health care could operate like this- we would literally change the face of it. The experience was genuine. AUTHENTIC service orientation- human to human. It didnt feel check the box. It felt like they were all passionate about serving and that is truly unique and a gift. Specific shout outs to: Carrie- front desk at check in who walked us around the upper campus when we arrived Wednesday. The folks at Common Grounds for always welcoming us with friendly smiles, asking if we wanted special coffees, and offering us blankets, cookies.. whatever we needed. They always had full stocks of La Croix sparkling water- I cannot tell you how happy that made me. That was like the best special treat. Keep offering that!!! What a treat!!! The events and logistics folks- specifically Irena, and the AV gentleman who helped us on Thursday for our workshop in Outlook 102. They were there early to set up with us, make sure everything worked and get us anything we need. The room was set perfectly. They had thought of EVERYTHING. The kitchen staff and chefs. WHERE DO I EVEN START- GOODNESS THEY ARE LIKE A GROUP OF MAGIC FAIRY GODMOTHERS. They went out of their way to get me an english muffin at lunch on the second day because I missed breakfast and wanted to try it. They were all amazing. They asked about our dietary restrictions every time and remembered. I felt seen and welcomed. Their desire to help was genuine and authentic and that is a truly one of a kind experience. The fact that the chefs also served was so cool. I felt like I was peeking into how the magic happened. Kim and Brianna- absolute gems. SO helpful. went way out of their way to accommodate us. Bri booked us a shuttle for Sunday at 4am and SHOWED up to pack us brown bag breakfasts and make sure we had coffee as we were departing. She woke up before 4 am to do that!!! That is beyond outstanding customer service- THAT IS HUMAN KINDNESS AND GOODNESS. Give her a raise, promote her and DONT LET HER GO.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"1440 Multiversity\",\"ReviewDate\":1683449681063,\"ReviewContent\":\"1440 is a place apart from the everyday world, a place of peace, beauty, nurturing, learning, where you leave feeling better than when you came.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"1440 Multiversity\",\"ReviewDate\":1683449681067,\"ReviewContent\":\"An absolutely beautiful, friendly learning  retreat environment.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"1440 Multiversity\",\"ReviewDate\":1683449681070,\"ReviewContent\":\"An experience that will stay with me a lifetime.

Currently, they are changing the lives of others who serve their communities--healthcare workers, teachers, first responders.   As a physician, I participated in a weekend program called Healing Our Healthcare Heroes along with other physicians, nurses, physical therapists, hospital managers, social workers.  It was an incredible experience, with 4 amazing workshops led by true change makers and addressing issues that healthcare workers are dealing with after a year of Covid care--trauma, moral injury, grief, as well as hope, growth, joy.  The caliber of speakers was reminiscent of TED Talks.  The accommodations are gorgeous, with buildings nestled in a redwood forest and hiking trails all over.  Id describe the rooms as glamorous rustic--clean, spacious, extremely comfortable, but also simple, minimalist, elegant.  The kitchen is gourmet, and the head chef creates so many healthy, colorful, and delicious meals, often from vegetables grown on the property.  They have > 100,000 bees!

What manifested in reality is most often facade, unfortunately. The campus is pretty, but the values are zero to none in praxis here. Some things could have changed since and, I saw a lot here. I am a queer, trans person who practices Buddhism. I thought coming to work here I would be relatively accepted.  Instead I was met with mundane violence by the institution. I was denied access to a proper bathroom for months while fighting for it. When it was finally approved, it took them months to buy and put up a sign. I was misgendered, met with fear and a few acts of hatred by my co workers, I was essentially gaslit by management. This happens all the time in work places to trans people and, it did happen here. In a spiritual center, that claims to truly embody certain neo liberal high ball dreams of open mindedness, acceptance and diversity. It is not ok to treat people the way I was treated, even if it happens in so many places. I eventually realized they were not able to offer me a work environment in which dignity would be attainable so I left. (I currently hold a job where I am fully afforded conditions in which I can retain my dignity.) The people highest up were so disconnected from the materials reality of others in America. The same problems were everywhere and people were socially dissuaded from speaking about it through negative social reinforcement, again in ways typical for institutions like this. The people who made the most money loved this cute and novel  idea  of altruism. While the majority of people were underpaid and overworked. While being expected to smile at rich white clientele and never say the word no, or cause them to have any bad feeling. They called it deep hospitality, it didn t play out well in real life application. This place left me with the impression that it serves, even if it s not intended to, as a front for people with money to feel good without addressing the discomfort needed to actually shift change in self and cause then social change. That requires radicalizing, which means radically accepting that your wealth does mean things about the way you move through the world and your ethics that you don t like or want it to. (I ve gone through this process myself\\/am still making changes so I can see my values in the way I occupy my privilege, knowing the material reality of others.) Sometimes they bring in good teachers, but I saw them, at that time at least, book anyone who will make money regardless of integrity. You can give your money to this place, but you might leave short 1.5 grand looking like a clown.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"1440 Multiversity\",\"ReviewDate\":1588841696387,\"ReviewContent\":\"1440 is an AMAZING organization and I couldnt recommend their facilities and programming enough.

We also booked spa treatments. I booked a 50 min Crainosacral Therapy which was described as a gentle session which encourages the body to release stress and pain by light touch to the bones of the head, spinal column, and sacrum. This treatment began by hot towels to wash my feet and then the therapist lightly held the soles of my feet for at least 15 minutes and ended by doing the same. Besides additional light touch there was no other treatment to release stress and pain. This was at a cost of $145 in addition to a required 15% tip.

To top it all off, its very reasonably priced.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"1440 Multiversity\",\"ReviewDate\":1525683299477,\"ReviewContent\":\"1440 Multiversity offers an amazing blend of opportunities to meet your every need.  Located right outside of the always operating Bay area is a space for reflection, growth, and to take a step back from the busyness of our day to day lives.

You wont regret it. *Lodging, food, Spa and Infinity Pool, the beautiful redwoods forrest, and the onsite facilities are absolutely stunning.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"1440 Multiversity\",\"ReviewDate\":1525683300067,\"ReviewContent\":\"5 out of 5 for 1440.  As someone who had stayed in all top 4 wellness centers in US (Omega, Kripalu, 1440, Esalen), I think I have some ground to make a fair comment.   As an educational retreat destiny for personal growth, core product we should be looking at is program quality and the facility around it, which I would say 1440, despite the newest among the 4, maintains at least equally high quality - I took SoulMotion class with Arjuna, a renowned spiritual dancer leader with over 40 year experience in this field, in Outlook workshop building, and many other sampler morning & evening classes such as drumming, improv, Yoga, and Qigong, in Sanctury, renoovated from the old chapel, with heating floor.  Beside this, the Redwood-facing hot spring is soothing and healing - though its different from Esalens cliff one, this is something I went to every evening connecting to the sky and smelling the redwood.   The campus itself is designed in a very warm and cozy style, and all staff are very kind and compassionate.  I can tell 100% that as a new center, theyre not inheriting the strength from the other established centers, but also innovating on their own - what struck me most is that I do NOT have to compromise food taste while seeking for nutrient & organic ingredients (the soup, the curry chicken, the dessert, the curated salad bowl, I attached some photos, I didnt gain any weight there but I surely enjoyed eating every bite of my food there, which is a rare experience in other centers esp. Omega), neither do I have to compromise accomodation quality for healthy living, the room is new without smell, sound proof is good so Im not waken up by people walking\\/talking in hall way, which happened in most of other centers).  I can write a long article about my experience in 4 centers, but I would just summarize in one line that, 1440 provides the best holistic expeirence for someone like me who has a no compromise attitude (were aggressive on our personal growth as well as food taste&living quality). I will definitely recommend my friend seeking their frist time wellness center experience to come here (with one more advantage of 1440 is its located 20mins drive from San Jose, bay area).   P.S. to be fair, if youre looking for experience prioritizing the best Yoga school with the most diverse workshops offerings, you want to try Kripalu, 3 hours drive north from JFK; and if youre looking for the rustic, cliff, hippie experience as most important, you want to try Esalen at Big Sur.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"1440 Multiversity\",\"ReviewDate\":1525683300070,\"ReviewContent\":\"Beautiful location, great food and friendly staff.

The grounds and buildings are absolutely beautiful and they offer some amazing courses on fitness, self-improvement, relationships, and new-age philosophy. However, their systems are not up to the task of dealing with the volume of visitors. Check-in involves almost 2 hours of waiting in line. Because of a room change, they double charged my card and it has been over a month without a refund. I have called 3 times and they are always very apologetic, but still no refund. I really wanted to write a good review of 1440, but must be honest here.  On the plus side, while I was there, I enjoyed my stay,  despite the disorganization and incomplete facilities.  The food, in particular, was excellent and meals were well organized and well-planned. Update: 1440 looked into the situation and issued a refund.

The food was great, and the staff was friendly. For that they get two sars However the first night I got there I noticed an off smell in my room, it smelled like some kind of chemical, but I did not really pay attention to it. I went about my business and the training. The front desk staff told me that the place uses only non-toxic material. I have to say that it is hard for me to believe that given the smell I experienced (it smelled almost like a glue or adhesive.)

Now the neighborhood looks great - the work they have put into the facilities to make them top notch... the old Bethany - there was no top notch - there was a blue tarp on the top of the spot, and i-beams that were to make a cafeteria.

The space was perfect for what we were looking for. Its rustic and a bit rough around the edges, but it has all the creature comforts you would need in a glamping getaway (power, heated showers, a HOT TUB). Janelle was very easy to work with. Venture got hit pretty hard by a mud slide earlier in the year and Janelle was working hard to make sure that we had a good experience and had everything we needed. We catered one of our meals through Loma Mar (and loved it). Venture is a beautiful space, surrounded by a ton of beauty. We hosted a field trip to the beach with a geology talk\\/tide pool viewing, a crochet circle, karaoke. It was just a lovely space that helped us facilitate community. Janelle had set up a number of bell tents for our guests, which were super clean, and spacious. The yurt provided the perfect heated, powered activity room for our guests when it got cold. The large tent with bed + fridge, coffee, made for the perfect honeymoon suite.

Then our friends who have a converted van have also been refused access on the grounds that they cannot rent an RV lot because they cannot connect to sewer and water.

Facilities and location left s lot to be desired for the price. For $150 more a day I could have been staying in the Ritz Carlton instead of in a canvas bungalow with shared bathrooms. Bathrooms were updated, but dirty when I used them. I also had a chubby old dude yell twice at me while I was unloading my car in the campsite, because supposedly having more than one car in a 20 foot wide parking space is a sin. Most of the other staff was smiles, but this one particular guy was out of pocket. Location has walking access to a beach, but the property is very isolated from any hikes or other landmarks. Kids playground was nice and well kept. Beer garden pub had run of the mill food, but nice atmosphere. Wifi was intermittent.

I feel compelled to share my thoughts, especially considering some negative reviews I came across. Its important not to judge this wonderful place based on a few isolated incidents, as my encounter with the staff was absolutely delightful. First and foremost, I want to express my gratitude to Tammy at the check-in desk. Her great sense of humor immediately put us at ease, despite our near mishap with her plant while maneuvering our RV. She handled the situation with grace and professionalism, making us feel welcome right from the start. I also want to address the negative reviews about Dale, the head of security. Tammy assured us that he was a genuinely kind-hearted individual, and we were keen on meeting him. True to her words, Dale visited us during our stay, and we found him to be an incredibly friendly and helpful person. Not only did he take the time to chat with us, but he also shared fascinating information about the Blue Heron we had spotted earlier. It was evident that Dale genuinely cares about the guests experience and goes above and beyond to make them feel at home. During our stay, we had the pleasure of meeting Allan, the Facilities Manager. Allan was incredibly friendly and approachable, making us feel like valued guests. He even allowed us to walk our adorable Cockapoo, Cooper, into the grocery store a gesture that made us feel like part of the Costanoa KOA family. One aspect that truly impressed me was the cleanliness and maintenance of the facilities. Everywhere we went, from the well-kept grounds to the sparkling clean bathrooms, we were met with an immaculate environment. Its evident that the staff takes pride in their work and ensures that guests have a comfortable and enjoyable stay. We had the pleasure of meeting Evan, a super cool guy with dark hair and dreadlocks, who made a point to stop by and greet us. Its encounters like these that make a stay truly memorable, as they foster a sense of community and camaraderie. Overall, I cannot recommend Costanoa KOA enough. This hidden gem offers excellent amenities, a pristine environment, and most importantly, exceptional staff members who genuinely care about the guests experience. My stay was nothing short of fantastic, and I hope the management recognizes the outstanding employees they have. Dont let a few negative reviews deter you Costanoa KOA is a must-visit destination for anyone seeking a memorable camping experience. So pack your bags, bring your furry friends, and prepare for an unforgettable stay at Costanoa KOA.

She then showed up with security minutes later and we were getting kicked out for not having our dog on the leash. I understand if this was an honest mistake and she just did not see the wire leash, maybe she needs glasses. either way, defamation is nothing to be taken lightly, and I will not be letting this go without an apology.

The huge problem is the ridiculously high prices. They are charging 5 diamond prices for 2-3 star accommodations. We stayed in the glamping tent for $200 a night. My boy scout summer camp tent 50 years ago was nicer. Tent was tiny, with hard, steel frame beds, a small table, a small chair. I guess they thought it was luxurious because they provided electric blankets that shut off randomly during the night, causing you to wake up shivering and forcing you to get it restarted. Pushing the 8 hour sleep button did nothing to help this. The only place to plug in my CPAP and phone chargers was an outlet strip zip tied to the bedframe UNDER the bed. Our friends stayed in a cabin and a lodge room, each more outrageously priced and underwhelming. The bright stars of the place were the restaurant and the snack bar. Great food and service.

Just over an hour from San Francisco and 25 minutes from Santa Cruz, you are in an idyllic setting about a quarter mile off the Pacific Coast Highway and have views and sounds of the ocean from the park. Older growth pine and eucalyptus trees, great landscaping, coastal trails, light houses, and a myriad of activities for families (on the weekend off-season). Sites are nicely laid out and there is space between you and your neighbor. Some nice grass areas including the dog park. Initially, leveling was an issue as it was off 4 degrees to the front of the rig. Have not used the facilities other than the washer\\/dryers   only knock is how few there are. Have not interacted with many of the staff but the registration couple is friendly and the maintenance staff and house keeping always smile and wave. Would recommend this park and rate it a 4.5. The public wifi was weak except mid-day. During peak times, it was a struggle to pull up emails and basic social media. There is no T-Mobile service at all. Verizon 3.4 down\\/0.1 up at 5:45 pm.

Third is tough.  The KOA itself is amazing. We came out from Denver and ended up getting a cabin and a camp site. The father in law had the camp site while the kids and I had the cabin. What ever you do, do not drive across the KOA to offload the family unless you want the security on you about having 2 vehicles at a camp site. I understand that you are trying to maintain a great property but my 2 kids are under 4 y\\/o but when I cant even drop the kids off without being harassed, it took the vibe right away. Then security was giving a friend of ours a hard time about his converted camper. They questioned whether it was a true camper. It was, they eventually let him in. Then, the next morning, wouldnt you know it, good ol security came cruising up in their fancy little security golf cart and started harassing our friend AGAIN asking if it was a legitimate camper.

The grounds were beautiful, the amenities were great, and most of the service was excellent.  However, the camp security came to our campsite multiple times per day and at night checking on us and remind us that quiet time will begin at 10 pm. In addition, while packing to leave, a man visited our campsite three separate times.  Once to check if fire ash had been removed and remind us to return the fire pit to its original location next to the picnic table, it would be too much for his wife to manage.   Then again, to remind us to reposition the picnic tables back in the original position and to verify if we had an elbow to connect to the RV to the dump.   The constant oversight and monitoring of my family ruined our camping experience at this lovely location.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Costanoa\",\"ReviewDate\":1651913851310,\"ReviewContent\":\"The park was an awesome place to stay.

But it was fun for our family to switch it up. We stayed in a premium tent site - mostly gated grass pad that holds 4 spacious sites with fire pits, however fires were not allowed the days we went. We got a text daily letting us know if we could start a fire or not. We had three young kids with us and our 1 year old stayed within the boundaries of the grass pad well so we appreciated the gate. It does keep you feeling a bit more private from the road, too. Its close to two bathrooms, as well. We will pick the same spot, returning next year.

We stayed in the premium first loop and the sites were truly exceptional with pavers in the patio area, excellent quality outdoor furniture, raised fire pit, landscaping, etc.   Hiking trails to the beach areas are superb.  When on the beaches, particularly during weekdays, we had them to ourselves. A+   \\/\\/  Cons:  Very expensive.  You also must be prepared to leave your ego at the door...there are extensive rules that never end and are enforced making one feel less than human\\/frustrated at times.  Most staff are generally nice but some treat you like just an annoying RV-er with average at best intelligence.  At all times it felt like one had to walk on eggshells.

We left to escape her intrusive gaze and when 6 of us returned at 8:30 this woman actually got out of bed and turned on her lights to watch us.

There are also many hiking trails and a few bike trails near by, as well as some sightseeing. The Pigeon Point Lighthouse isnt far and a nice drive (be sure to check hours if you plan to visit).

However you can walk to a hot spot for limited service. Second, we were surrounded by 5 RVs of family and friends that partied loudly all day and night.

First, know that Pescadero is remote. As such, Costanoa has a monopoly on goods and services. Expect 5-star prices for 1-star goods and services. Cascade Restaurant is a circus of untrained clowns: metal shavings in food, cheese wrappers on burgers, wrong orders, and routinely under-cooked and over-cooked food are the norm. Youll take your wrong orde and like it. Costanoa buys cheep eggs from Oregon, and chicken off a box truck rather than from the best farms literally across the street. They advertise as local and seasonal, but dont support either one. They resent the local community but portray themselves as integral members. This location could absolutely be a 5-star location. But they are 1-star owners with 0-star service. What they need to improve is obvious, but the owners are too cheep and egotistical to do it. Its a sad place on beautiful grounds.

They began vacuuming while we ate our dessert 30 minutes before closing... we promptly left. We went back to our cabin and suddenly the power went out. We shivered all night and had no power to charge our phones and no way to read our books. We spoke with management in the morning and they said power would be back by 2pm. So we left to find some coffee and kill time to stay warm and dry until then. We returned at 1:30 to be told that now the power wouldnt be on until 8pm. The Yoga that was scheduled and included was cancelled. We had to cancel our friends birthday massage as well since there was no way to heat the towels\\/room etc. They let us cancel our 2nd night without a fee but would not give us any sort of discount on our initial night. We spent nearly $300 to freeze all night and spend no time on the property doing the stated activities. I would have given this place another try, however without giving us any sort of reimbursement or even a little empathy, I wont be back. The staff was cold and short with us.

The only possible drawback is that the campsites are just kinda rows of plots without individual charm, but the overall scenery is 100% and even with a tiny swell you can hear the waves all night.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Costanoa\",\"ReviewDate\":1683449835877,\"ReviewContent\":\"Great for birdwatching.

Wonderful nature-filled resort! Yes, RESORT! It balances nature and comfort with activities, family-friendly hospitality, and beautiful sunsets and stargazing! Sure, its a little pricey, but its worth it. Had to leave a day early because my family member got injured and they refunded us the last day! So wonderful! Will come back. Right on the beach and just a short drive from stores. Its almost as if we were living in a small town with their own restaurant and store right in the KOA!

Clean and neat. The staff is super helpful. Come and sit with nature while keeping your phones and laptops miles away. Try to get a place in Outer Pine. Rooms: Clean and cozy rooms. Varieties of lodging options available. Nearby activities: Hiking Safety: Safe overall but keep an eye for insects and snacks when you hike nearby. Noteworthy details: Its a really beautiful place to spend time and relax. No Network coverage for Google Fi but they got nice WiFi.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Costanoa\",\"ReviewDate\":1683449835887,\"ReviewContent\":\"This is a private KOA campground. Although it is in a beautiful location and well maintained, it is totally overpriced. We got the glamping tent cabin at $200 a night. It wasnt as good as my boy scout summer camp tent from 50 years ago. See pics. It was tiny, had 2 hard, steel frame beds, a beat up small wooden table and a beat up small wooden chair for a place that can sleep 3. There were 2 Adirondack chairs and a picnic table outside. Its one claim to luxury was it had electric blankets, which shut off randomly during the night waking you up freezing cold. Had to restart each one 2-3 times a night. Hitting the 8 hour night button had no effect on either one. The only place to plug in my CPAP and phone chargers was an outlet strip zip tied to bedframe UNDER THE BED. Our friends got a cabin and a room in the lodge at $350 and $500 a night. These are 5 diamond prices for 2-3 star accommodations. The good news was the restaurant and snack bar were excellent. We ate and drank very well. It is quite beautiful and had great hiking in woods and to beaches. Very kid friendly big playground and lots of activities for them too. It was not worth it to me, but it is close to San Francisco and was almost full, so it is worth it for some people.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Costanoa\",\"ReviewDate\":1683449835887,\"ReviewContent\":\"I had an amazing weekend here.

When I checked in at the spa desk, everything seemed fine and I was shown the mens locker room entrance. But when I finally settled and got myself ready (after being frustrated with their non-functional lockers), I noticed that there was a sign on the door of the sauna that it was actually closed for repairs. No mention of this at all when I was at the front desk by staff nor on the front door of the locker room before I took the 10-15 minutes or so getting myself prepped. I get that things break every so often, but I found it bizarre that the staff would omit telling me that the thing I was specifically there for and wanted to use was non-functional before I even got past the meet and greet. After getting dressed and being very annoyed, I walked out and told the front desk about the closure. The gentleman at the desk then told me that its been broken for months and they have no idea when it would be fixed. Great. Thanks for the heads up. So if youre male, dont bother with the spa \\/ sauna here. Despite hearing really good things about this place previously, I had a really disappointing visit and can not recommend this place with its current staff and amenities.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Cavallo Point Spa\",\"ReviewDate\":1712480344867,\"ReviewContent\":\"I loved my massage. She was a great therapist. I was given a voucher for my Birthday and when I checked in I asked how much the massage was. Deep tissue was $240, I had a $250 voucher, so I said  that s great I have $10 left to spend in the shop! I was immediately reminded that gratuity was not included. After my message I went to settle up and I was told that they add 20% gratuity and included by $10 on my card so the bill was $48 on top of $240 massage! I was told they could change the tip amount manually if I wished. It did not sit right with me. Everywhere else allows you to enter your tip on the card machine. I felt ashamed to ask to leave less but had to as I am out of work at the moment and had a voucher. She had to cancel the transaction and do it again which made me feel like an inconvenience. Customers should NOT be made to feel guilty over gratuities and it was mentioned to me at check in. A 15-18.% gratuity should have been an option like everywhere else and made easy without feeling you have to leave  a 20% gratuity, all in all almost $300 for a 1  hour massage is just way  too expensive.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Cavallo Point Spa\",\"ReviewDate\":1709801944867,\"ReviewContent\":\"We got 90 minutes massages. Our massage therapists were great and the massage was very relaxing. With taxes and a tip the staff had fixed, the massage cost an absurd $400 per person. This felt criminal considering how subpar the facilities were. The locker rooms were crowded and did not have enough showers. Considering how much nice massage spots in the area cost, this was overpriced by over $200 per massage. Do yourself a favor and avoid the Cavallo Point Spa.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Cavallo Point Spa\",\"ReviewDate\":1709801944870,\"ReviewContent\":\"My experience at this spa was difficult to articulate. The massage I received was a blend of different techniques, including Thai massage, Swedish, and Lomi Lomi. However, as a licensed massage practitioner, I found the combination of modalities in the 55-minute session to be overwhelming. Perhaps the 90-minute version would offer a better experience. While the practitioner was skilled, the flow of the massage felt disjointed. Additionally, the facilities were not well-maintained, with a band-aid in the outdoor hot tub, dust bunnies, and cobwebs in the lobby, and mediocre staff. Overall, the experience did not justify the high price, and I wouldnt consider returning unless the cost was significantly reduced.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Cavallo Point Spa\",\"ReviewDate\":1707296345983,\"ReviewContent\":\"The shop at the entrance and the waiting room are nice (although not super cozy). The complimentary hot herbal tea is tasty too. But the more important things are really not great. The locker\\/bathroom\\/jacuzzi area feels more like a public swimming pool\\/gym than a high end spa. The showers in particular were terrible. Massage was subpar. Too much talking, sound of the air purifier was louder than the music,  firm  pressure is too mild and no attention given to uncovered tension areas. It was maybe just bad luck, but the facilities are not nice enough to encourage to come back and give it another try.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Cavallo Point Spa\",\"ReviewDate\":1704617945987,\"ReviewContent\":\"Magic.

The whole experience was super painful and my scalp now feels like it s on fire (not in a good way).  What s worse is that my masseuse never even asked me how I felt during the treatment. After 20mins of pain I had to just tell her to stop the massage. The way this masseuse handled my body was like she was roughhousing a slab of meat. There s definitely no quality control at this spa and it s embarrassing.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Cavallo Point Spa\",\"ReviewDate\":1699347546533,\"ReviewContent\":\"Love everything about the Cavallo Point spa.

They had so many amenities after my deep tissue massage. Customer service was amazing. The place is so zen and calm. They have a tea bar which you can sip near the meditation pool as you sun bathe. Perfect zones to relax outside. Theres a steam room and jacuzzi in the bathrooms where you can zone out completely. The bathrooms were clean, with many towels and accessories you need to hair dry yourself, combs, lotions, sprays, etc. I would recommend it to couples seeking some time together or for anybody looking to treat themselves after a long day.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Cavallo Point Spa\",\"ReviewDate\":1686128346543,\"ReviewContent\":\"Great massage followed by steam room and hot tub.

The spa  called me 10 hours later while I was at dinner with family asking for me to  settle up  my payment for the tea.

Womens Jacuzzi was perfection with both temperature and jets. Lots of spa water and cucumber washcloths which were a refreshing relief. My massage was a good old fashioned elbow centric Swedish. I just assumed they were 50  hours but my gf s came out 10-15 minutes later so I clarified, and I was indeed shorted 10 minutes. Ok all and all but doesn t leave a patron with a  good taste .

The total for the couples massage was $370, which seems quite overpriced when Ive gotten better massages for far less. And when I wanted to tip my massage therapist less than my wifes, the clerk at the front desk seemed to turn sour and unfriendly on me. We also had access to the heated pool, hot tub, and other spa areas. The pool was in a pretty setting, but there were leaves, dead bugs, and a sheen of oil floating on top. The hot tub was very small and the glass tiling around it had unsightly mold growing under it. The locker room was very nice, though, with good skin care regimens available as well as a nice steam room. Overall, though, this place was not worth the price. At all.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Cavallo Point Spa\",\"ReviewDate\":1588841949453,\"ReviewContent\":\"Really wanted to like this place!  Ive been to a lot of spas, but was super excited to try this one.  There are some really good points, but the negatives are too much for me to return.  Overall it felt like a high volume place, where people cycle in and out on que. Pros:  Staff is very friend, massage was good and masseuse very communicative.  Overall location is great and the seating area is very large and open.  As per all spas, they serve flavored water and hot tea.  The steam room was good, but again, small - maybe 4 people could fit without being crowded - see below....... Cons:  Crowded!!!  All the massages begin\\/end at the same time, so the locker room is filled with the next group, or those that just finished.  And its a small locker room, so about 8 ladies are all changing next to each other.  Only 2 showers.  Outdoor jacuzzi is small and can only hold 4 people comfortably.  The outdoor pool is also small with a lot of loungers surrounding the pool.  Maybe 6 people could be there; 8 would be crowded.  No reading material in the seating area - very odd for a spa. At the end of your massage, you exit your room, where all the masseuses are outside their room, waiting with a glass of water in their hand for their client to exit. This felt too commercial, high volume and not relaxing.  The area is beautiful, but too many people.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Cavallo Point Spa\",\"ReviewDate\":1588841949463,\"ReviewContent\":\"Great massage and relaxing environment.

My friend and I spent 4 nights there, and we found the entire experience totally AMAZING. The staff were kind, friendly and respectful, they provided us with a safe space to feel comfortable, be ourselves, and completely restore our energy. The grounds are very well maintained,  breathtakingly beautiful, with meadows, woodland, and the Navarro River nearby. The Soul Stretch, and Yoga classes were revitalizing, and without exaggeration, the food for every single meal was absolutely delicious, they were very well thought out, and catered for everyone s needs. With out any doubt, I would recommend staying at the center to any member of my family and friends, and I personally would like to visit again soon. Many Thanks.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Eros Monastery\",\"ReviewDate\":1709801979400,\"ReviewContent\":\"Ahhhh! This place is heaven on earth. I went to Winter retreat in December and it changed my life. The Land is nestled in the woods and offers a secluded sanctuary for those seeking respite from the chaos of daily life. The retreat exudes an aura of tranquility from the moment you arrive. I stayed in one of the cozy cabins and was greeted by deer almost every morning. I had some of the deepest sleeps in a long time. The Land offers a diverse range of activities which include yoga, Tibetan Buddhist meditation, nature walks in the RedWoods, and mindfulness workshops. Every meal is made with love and the highest quality ingredients. The staff are attentive, welcoming, and dedicated to ensuring everyone has a memorable experience.

Highly recommend for anyone in need of a retreat from the hustle and bustle of modern life.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Eros Monastery\",\"ReviewDate\":1707296379403,\"ReviewContent\":\"My husband and I went for a couple of nights and stayed in a cabin. Its really beautiful with nearby trails for wandering in nature. The community that works there was very welcoming and the shared meals were healthy & delicious. Its just outside of the tiny town of Philo where theres a winery, small grocery store and Mexican restaurant, but youre likely to stay on site at the retreat center most of the time. Theres a massive garden and a pool (which we didnt use since its more of a cold plunge in the winter months). Depending on the day and week you ll also find activities on site like meditation and yoga.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Eros Monastery\",\"ReviewDate\":1701939579403,\"ReviewContent\":\"Reflecting on an unforgettable experience at The Land!

They balance professionalism with personal care seamlessly, ensuring everything I needed was just a request away. Their friendly presence added warmth to my entire stay.

Warmth, laughters, knowledge, and so much organic and fresh food. I stay at the tent every time I visit. I feel I am sleeping in nature. Quiet nights and tweets and sunny days.

I was amazed at the beauty of the land, the facilities and the warm receptive container of connection that greeted me! I stayed in one of the very comfortable and well appointed glamping tents in a cozy grove of trees and partook of the scrumptious meals in the community lodge just a short walk away. There are multiple opportunities for hiking if you are so inclined but the best part were the classes, yoga and meditation offerings to be had in each day. I spent time in the gardens - 2 acres of flowers, orchards and veggies with places to sit and enjoy the quiet in contemplation, or get your hands dirty in the soil. All in all a splendid week that wasn t nearly long enough and I already have plans to return! Cherry\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Eros Monastery\",\"ReviewDate\":1686128379950,\"ReviewContent\":\"I spent a glorious week on The Land this spring. It was so magical, from the wildlife to nature, to home-cooked meals and the activities offered, such as yoga, meditation, and sutra studies. I never wanted to leave! I was trained in OM in 2020 but have been out of practice. When I arrived, it was explained that I could choose to OM or not. I have loved my experiences with the practice so far, and I wanted to explore it. It was great. I felt safe, comfortable, well-held, and cared for every step of the way!\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Eros Monastery\",\"ReviewDate\":1686128379953,\"ReviewContent\":\"I have had the privilege of many long stays at The Land over many different seasons. From swimming in the cool clear Navarro River in summer, to cozying up by the fire during the torrential rains of winter, to harvest time and planting time- The Land offers full spectrum beauty. I could feel the care in every corner- if you search closely there are little altars tucked away that remind you to pause and appreciate nature and the moment. The accommodations are simple and clean. Matthew the chefs food often left me speechless. Which I guess is ideal when your mouth is full of his food! I could go on and on- its literal heaven on Earth and I cannot wait to go back.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Eros Monastery\",\"ReviewDate\":1686128379957,\"ReviewContent\":\"The Land is the antidote to every crazy thing going on in the world. It s a throwback to everything that is meaningful in life that we ve sacrificed at the altar of productivity and commerce. I had moments of sublime happiness at the Land that I haven t experienced anywhere else. I don t know if it s the immersion in nature, the sense of community or the deep teaching that is part of what happens on the Land, but it is a transformational experience that begins literally as soon as you cross the bridge onto the property. Until you are there - it s hard to quite grasp the magic that wraps itself around you and adjusts the frequency of your nervous system to a place you once knew but barely remember. It s the incredible, organic nourishing food and what it does to your body. It s seeing a sky full of stars at night and thinking  is this here ALL the time? How have I NOT seen it? It s the natural beauty and feeling like a steward of nature. It s being around animals. It s the programs and the practices. It s the people you meet on the Land.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Eros Monastery\",\"ReviewDate\":1686128379957,\"ReviewContent\":\"I spent a week at the Eros Monastery and it was exactly what I needed. I was welcomed with open arms even though I  chose not to participate in the OM practice. There was no pressure to participate and everyone was willing to answer all my questions. Also, I have spoken with my wife about going with me next time. It felt like home and I will definitely be back at least one a year!\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Eros Monastery\",\"ReviewDate\":1686128379960,\"ReviewContent\":\"When first arriving on The Land, the magic of the property is palpable, morning dew on the grassy fields  cats, ducks, and goats roaming  the smell of a hearty breakfast cooking in the lodge and the rare experience of silence and stillness in the air. The Land provides the physical space to go internal and be in deep meditative practice as well as opportunity for community and connection with other committed practitioners. Adjacent to the Hendy Woods, the Land backs up to miles of hiking trails, is bordered by a flowing creek, and has a luscious flower and vegetable garden, giving the nervous system an array of natural landscapes to soak into. During the stay, let yourself be nourished by a rainbow assortment of seasonal local foods cooked with love. Fill up your body and soul with this generous offering. The cabins and houses are both rustic and pristine, with white bedding and comfortable beds, allowing for physical restoration and holding. I have had the opportunity to spend time on the Land for retreats and for my solo-practice and always leave feeling more physically and spiritually connected and restored.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Eros Monastery\",\"ReviewDate\":1686128379963,\"ReviewContent\":\"Time moves differently here. I m writing these notes from my cosy cabin, watching the wild deer  wander unhurried through the property. From some of the best sleep I ve had in years, to the morning yoga, my stay at the land was all I hoped for and more - as a psychotherapist, it s crucial that I find places for deep rest and I really found it at the Land. I ve been lucky enough to visit a few times over the last few years and never get used to the stars at night and just before dawn. This last visit, it even got warm enough for a dip in the pool. And the food, oh my goodness.. so nourishing and grounding. Even made good progress on my work - yes there s unbelievably good Wi-Fi in the middle of the woods ! I will definitely be back. And I leave reminded that slower is a real possibility.\"},{\"VenueName\":\"Eros Monastery\",\"ReviewDate\":1686128379963,\"ReviewContent\":\"I m a current guest on the land who came to recover from a chronic illness.

The last time I came, I brought some friends because Ive loved my experience spending time on the Land so much. None of us wanted to leave after our week there.
