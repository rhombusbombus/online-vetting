We weren't sure if there was a set cocktail menu (it seems like there isn't), so we ended up getting some Long Island Iced Teas. The drinks were strong and smooth, and I got served pretty quickly at the bar. However, it wasn't ideal that the bartender didn't even ask if we wanted to keep a tab open. We had to pay and tip right away, so we actually left after one drink. Overall, this seems like a fun, neighborhood bar, but because there aren't any signature drinks, I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to come back.",

For YEARS I have come here to study/write during the day (everyone needs their work space with a full bar) and kick it during the night. When I say years, I mean over 10 years. This is THE neighborhood bar, like Cheers \"where everybody knows your name\"Service is always great. No matter time of day or amount of crowd, I feel that the bar crew do their best to be attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. Courtney, Lalo, and Tyler stand out , but all have been super nice and make cute quality drinks. Feel free to ask them to make you something special, even a snazzy water. Although there is not an extensive food menu, the empanadas, chips, and salsa are delicious (the salsa is fire). They do not mind if you bring in outside food. May I suggest that good good Round Table across the street. Very cute atmosphere, a little hipster vibe. DJ some nights, good playlist the other nights. Plenty of board/card games to keep yourselves occupied in case conversations get slow. TVs for spots watching. Clean. Clean! bar and bathrooms, plenty of seating in and outdoors. Plenty of on-street parking. Overall just a chill vibe, chill clientele. Remember; cashless bar and, my favorite, drinks to gooooooo!",

Went straight to the back by the bathrooms and saw all tables pretty much empty. No indication of reserved tables. Our group of four settle in and go up to the bar and grab drinks. As the night goes on, the bar starts to fill up. We grab some cards and start to play. About 45 mins after we are playing cards the bartender (woman with braids) comes up to our table and begins to talk to one of our party members. I am sitting within vicinity so I can hear the conversation. Bartender says she's made a mistake and forgot to reserve the table we've been at for 2 hours at this point. That the party is waiting for the table so she has to clear it for them. My fianc\u00e9e mentioned to the bartender is she could find us another table and if we could wait at that table until she does. Mind you three out of the four part my members still had half beers left. The bartender rudely switches up her attitude and snaps back I have to move you it's non-negotiable. As she says this she quickly starts snagging everything off the table except the half full beers. We grab our things and proceed to cash out our tab. She rings us up and took a beer off the tab. The issue was that a mistake was made. I understand we are all human. I felt as though it was mishandled very unprofessionally. Although, I initially apologetic at first, when question about alternatives we were met with an aggressive non-negotiable like we were being unruly. Will not be returning.",

Out of nowhere in the middle of our second round the bartender came to rush us off of our table because she had forgotten to reserve it earlier. No one had come up to us before to let us know they needed the table. Instead they decided it was the best course of action to immediately  begin picking up drinks and cards from our table because she needed us to move right now and it was a \"non-negotiable.\" In her favor she offered to comp our next round but when we told her we were already on our last round (we weren't staying after how we had just need treated) she said \"oh well, we'll keep it in mind to get you next time\". That was our first time there and most definitely going to be out last.",

We all cheered the warriors despite their loss and I really got into it despite not carrying about basketball. I took a star off mostly because the bouncer kept asking my group of friends to move even though there was no where to stand without clouding the view of the TVs for other patrons. We were standing in the corner near where I took this picture and 100% not interrupting the flow of traffic nor the entrance... so I don't know what the deal was there.Look forward to coming back!",

They have made great alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks as well as offered rewarding suggestions when asked. One of the best lattes I've ever had, which I was a pleasantly surprised by since I wasn't really expecting coffee there at all there on my first visit just walking by.*Atmosphere*It seemed like quite a few people go there to work and I can see how it could be a productive environment in that it's generally pretty peaceful with reasonable distractions - it's the kind of place people might bring their dog inside but it's a pretty mindful atmosphere and doesn't get too loud. It's a really versatile space because not only could you come alone, meet with friends, go on a date, read or do some work but they also have TVs for you to watch sports for example I recently watched the 2022 World Cup there.",

I'll be right with you.\" She ignored me (and the other guests) waiting to get drinks completely until she came over and said \"What can i get you?\". No hello or any niceties, even though i went out of my way to say \"Hello, how are you?\"... She was looking and acting totally bothered that i was ordering drinks. If you don't like people or being a bartender then find another job. We drank one drink then decided to go to Heart and Dagger where the bartenders are kind and who want to be there.

We were looking forward to getting some drinks in to kick off our day in town, and were really excited but we walked into an empty bar with one bartender who didn't even bat an eye at us. The menus were void of any food or snacks that would be worth buying and when we finally got our drinks, we weren't very happy with them. My sangria, which I expected to be rather sweet, was the strongest sangria I've ever had. I couldn't finish it and had my friends help. One of my friends got a grapefruit drink that sounded delicious but when we tried it, we just tasted salt (and not just from the rim).Service is definitely lacking here and the bartender didn't seem to put much care into our drinks. The only thing she didn't mess up on is the ros\u00e9 because it just comes from the bottle. If you plan on coming here, don't do it on a Sunday afternoon. I'm assuming it's better at night.",

We went back today and there was a sign saying if you bring back the glasses they give you they'll take $2 off of your drink. Since we had been there a couple times we felt like we missed an opportunity because the glasses are just at home. I asked her \"is that sign new?\" with an attitude she says it's been there \"forever\" then also claims it was written at the bottom of the menu. I'm writing a review about this so clearly I would have remembered either of those things. Overall she's just not polite.

Plenty of seating inside and by the time I left around 10PM, it wasn't super busy for a Friday. Their cocktails from the menu are actually tasty as I tried a friend's drink but they made a good moscow mule too. They had 2 TVs playing basketball games and a DJ playing music in the background (it kept on going between reggae, instrumental, and some old school hip-hop tracks). You can actually have a conservation here too as it's not too crowded. They have some tables in the back where you can play card or board games, if you wanted to.",

I've come here for years but last night, instead of just looking at it, they SCANNED it. Total shock at the invasion of privacy and illegality of recording my driver's license information. The doorman simply pointed to a sign high up on the wall that said they were doing this. When I asked him questions about WHERE OUR INFORMATION WAS GOING, or what app it was, given this secure information, he admitted to not knowing. Enraged by this violation, I decided to write this post. After years of going to 389 Room, I'm hoping the owners stop this highly upsetting activity. Handing one's driver's license to a doorman is totally normal at a bar, but having your highly sensitive personal information recorded for NO REASON is bullshit. For a cool neighborhood bar this privacy breach (especially in the Bay Area) is unbelievable, not to mention opening up their patrons to identify theft. Again, I hope they stop this ridiculous practice that they just started. A bar should be a relaxing place, a fun place, not a creepy place. I'll update if/when 389 Room aborts this practice that violates the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). 389 Room is OBLIGATED to inform patrons of data collection, must tell us where exactly our private information is being stored, who it's being shared with, and they must delete our information on request.(Update: 389 can apparently soon be fined for not upholding the CCPA.)Other than this practice, 389 Room is wonderful.",

He has been known to be an asshole to people; he drinks heavy on the job and is just a shady person! For example he allowed his staff to steal a phone, lied about it, and acted like he didn't know what was going on. Some of the staff at Room 389 are decent, but they are cliquey and if you want a cocktail right away forget about it-the bartenders are usually real slow to serve you. Generally there's always lots of unnecessary drama going on at this bar, from the owner, to management and on down to their aggressive doormen... so enter into this bar's insanity at your own risk. Believe me, there are far better establishments in the Oakland area to spend your money at. It's never a good idea to support an establishment like Room 389 or their sister bar Mad Oak, especially because the owner doesn't really care about the customer. He's THE local douchebag!",

You're allowed to take food inside the bar, but not from that one specific taco truck that has been parking there for years.  Just recently this all changed because I have been eating those tacos inside that bar for quite a while.  I overheard one of the bartenders saying it was because they don't want them parked directly in front of the bar...which makes no sense because people loved getting food right outside and coming back in for a drink or to watch a game.  It was good for both businesses.  Then after a while they get different people to make tacos on the patio, and it came across as a petty and anti-Oakland maneuver.  Drinks are a bit pricey for the lack of customer service.  Do yourself a favor and walk a little further to Heart and Dagger.  Good people, good drinks, affordable (esp. the happy hour!), you can bring ALL food inside, always an interesting movie being shown, and you can just pass by 389 and it's crew hanging out on the low road.",

Bartender was busy on the other end of the bar so we waited patiently for about ten minutes. A tall older man walks over to the bar and stands about 3 feet away also looking like he wants to order a drink. The bartender comes over, passes by us and says \"I'll be with you ladies in a moment\" and b lines for the guy for his order. At first I'm thinking, huh? Does she know this guy?The guy tells her to let us go first, so she comes back and says, oh he's letting you go first. What would you like?I'm glad the guy told her to serve us first, but why does she assume he was there first? Do we need his permission for her to defer to us? Why does she assume a taller white man was the one \"in charge\" or the one first in line? Is it because he's a tall white man? Is it because she didn't see us because we're short women? I don't know how that's possible if we were already standing there for 10 minutes and she had to pass us to get to him. You're told that bartenders have a third eye and to not be pushy to get their attention. From this experience I'm going to conclude that's bullshit. Assert yourself everywhere, esp if you're small, a woman, or a minority. It's this sort of behavior that makes getting credit for your work, getting acknowledged when you're standing in line for service, so much harder for certain people just by virtue of how they look and the assumptions people make about them, based on societal bias. If this is unintentional subconscious bias, it's even worse.Side note: we had to proactively ask for popcorn that everyone else had after we paid for drinks- and to top it off the popcorn was stale. Yeah, not coming back. See my post about a similar experience at Drakes.",

A couple hours later, we were talking about ordering something more, when a male employee came up to us and said, very rudely, \"if you're going to sit there you need to spend some money here.\" My friend politely replied that we had, in fact, spent money there. He responded rudely again with, \"if you're going to take up this much space, you need to spend more.\" OHHHH, I suppose I must have missed the sign that designated exactly how many inches one is permitted to take up per dollar spent, as well as the exchange rate for dollars per minute spent at this place. What an asshole. In fact, we were only using half of the table for our work. I'll never come back to this place.

Parking can be tricky sometimes, but I've always enjoyed my time when at this bar. The owners are super nice and makes you feel like you're part of the family. Dont let me forget about the dirty chai tea that's amazing. And during the winter time they serve amazing spiked apple cider and buttered rum. Both are delicious. Definitely one of my favorite bars.",

She Walked right up to the line of being insulting with NON-genuine customer service and a clear dislike of assisting guests. I give her much credit for her creativity in how to give out disdain & sarcasm and remain .3 inches on the correct side of the line (or so she thinks). She even gave me crap about ordering a signature cocktail from the menu instead of a call drink (aka: any alcohol and 1 mixer).  Yes, she did spin the shaker and show some flair but the sarcasm made it an utterly disgusting show to receive since she clearly did not want to make the expensive cocktail. I am a Bartending Professional and I know the struggle is real so I still tipped her but what she said and how she said it made me regret it immediately. We have gone there on quite a few occasions but no more (changed plans yesterday to avoid this place). Sorry her amazing coworkers have to deal with her bringing low class and negativity to a really nice place. I was so happy to be out for date night with the wife and friends! I had a smile on my face that turned to ashes in my mouth and flavored all the beverages we ordered.",

I looked at the board for the price and handed him enough money to cover the drink plus a two dollar tip. He asked if I wanted any change, which is normal. But he had this sort of guilty look on his face. I realized it was happy hour and asked how much the drink actually was, and of course it was a lot less than I had given him.

Things went south when I was waiting for the bartender who apparently I was assigned to as I was standing directly in front of another bartender who was talking to her friends about how pleasant the day was and what was going on in the park. I didn't mind, I figured I'd wait, but considering I'm a customer and she took my empty beer can and I'm still standing there waiting for service while she continues to talk to her friends seems a bit ridiculous.  When she finally sees me still waiting she takes my order and as I get my beer and start to walk away she asks me if I have a tab and as I get ready to respond, my assigned bartender tells her I do and I walk away.  After a while I go back to get another drink and the backup bartender tells me she closed my account because I walked away from her without telling her my name when she asked me what it was.  I reminded her that as I was going to respond the other bartender told her I had a tab going, she did not want to hear it, and the other bartender sadly took her side.  This was truly a disappointing experience. I travel to Oakland on business quite often, and I have never been treated with such disrespect.  I'm not some 20 year old individual, I am a 52 year old well traveled individual who knows how a person who  is spending money in a business should be treated. Granted, the place was full and I'm sure the regulars will keep it open, but I'm sure the owners would like new business and positive recommend it to his coworkers who work in the area.",

I got the Mexican hot chocolate which is pretty good, but you definitely pay the Bay Area price for it.Overall, it's a chill and relatively quiet spot to meet up with someone or to get some work done.

I guess it's a coffee shop in the morning and a bar the rest of the day. Cool bar, great seating options and such, such, such a great crowd of wonderful people.

Unlike some bars in Oakland where you have a definite dress code (mostly from the patrons and not the management), the REAL 389 regulars don't judge people on the superficial.Like I said, its one of the very few places you can go an weeknight or weekend evening and see the place full of people on laptops, drinking, watching sports, and just chewing the fat.The staff has always been friendly to people no matter their color or creed.And the best part is they let you bring in outside food if your hungry.",

I stumbled upon this place on a Monday night hoping for a warm drink to fight off the cold weather chills. Unfortunately the coffee bar was closed, but the bar was open for business! I thought to myself wouldn't it be fun to lose your inhibitions before a dance class? Like any bar, you had to be 21+ to enter so they check ID at the door. People under 21 are excluded, but dogs aren't! This bar is dog-friendly. I saw one inside!I asked about any happy hour deals because I had gotten there around 6:30pm. Luckily, it was $1 off drinks excluding ciders and canned beers. I decided on the Chardonnay which was amaaaazing! I had a tasting beforehand (free of charge). With tip, I only spent $6! The bartender was also pretty helpful in getting me to decide which wine to choose. The place is divey but the bar was nice. I would say there wasn't much of a crowd but let's face it, there never is on a Monday. There were sports TVs so I was able to watch a little bit of basketball too! My favorite team was playing! Overall, I enjoyed my experience at this bar/coffee shop joint (such an interesting combination). Now, I just need to come back & try their coffee!",

I'm not trying to run into any mess! But once the scene is clear, I step my foot in that door and \"IT'S A PARTY, IT'S A PARTY, IT'S A PARTAAAAY!\" I genuinely enjoy Room 389! This is your typical neighborhood divey lounge with dim lights and bumpin' music! It's located off of Grand Ave and is super close to Lake Merritt. I've only come here during the night time, but during the day they function as a caf\u00e9 serving brunch and coffee. I've never actually eaten here during the day, but I've heard that the food is pretty good. I will definitely need to check that out sometime in the near future. They serve up some very yummy cocktails and the atmosphere is very mellow and chill. The bartenders are generally friendly and they have a pretty good happy hour. The drinks here are decently priced compared to other bars in the area, and you can grab a nice cocktail for about $7-$8. The bar is long and beautiful! There are a few tables in the back to accommodate larger groups and this place is super dog friendly! I love coming here and seeing all of the cute pups roaming around! The crowd is very diverse and the people here are really friendly as well. It gets packed in here on Friday and Saturdays nights, and since it's small, it can get really warm. The bartenders here are pretty quick when preparing drinks though, so you won't have to wait a lifetime to start drankin'. This is a great place to come out and chill with friends and your doggies. Come to Room 389 if you are looking for a mellow bar in the Lake Merritt and Grand Ave area!",

It's local, and taste great. 389 also carries some baked goods from local bakeries in the morning.Because they are a bar, they also offer spiked coffee drinks (house whip cream) and mimosas in the morning. I believe they make a mean bloody Mary. Great for an early morning Americano. A bit of a different place in the evening.",

But tonight, the night where I rushed to find a suitable bar to watch the redemption game of the season, the biggest game for so many of us who bleed for Oakland, you half failed me and the crowd of patrons who decided on your bar, who paid for your drinks, who inhabited your space mainly to view and listen to our Warriors playing their ultimate rivals, the Cavs. If more than one person has the guts to ask you to turn on the sound, just tonight, why can't you oblige? Are your \"non sports-bar\" rules so set in stone that you'd rather play your Pandora tunes than accommodate the sea of disappointed faces?!For future reference, we all know you're not a sports bar. But for your location and your sister bar, Mad Oak, please, please try to recognize the importance to the neighbors who frequent your establishments. Many of us don't have cable at home and rely on not having to bounce from bar to bar on big nights like this to get a decent show.",

Early on Sunday my partner asked me if I wanted to grab a drink while we waited on a few friends to venture over from the city.  Well, I am not one to turn down a drink, especially with my S/O, so I quickly agreed.  He said he wanted the best Bloody Mary in our area and could I find the place.  I love a challenge.  I was like, \"Yeah, I got you, get ready and let's go to my secret spot.\"  We strolled over to the bar and they were not too crowded, but it was pretty early on a Sunday morning.  There were several people on stools at the bar top and we were greeted immediately upon entry.  Room 389 has a little coffee shop in the front of the bar, and then a long, super clean bar top, a few TV's, great bartenders, a huge selection of alcohol, a stellar drink menu with throwback prices, these crazy good pretzels--it is an all around awesome spot.  The bar is really beautifully lit during the daytime with mostly natural light, and then at night it gets dark and the music is exactly what I want to hear while I am drinking with my friends.We grabbed a couple of stools and I asked my wonderful bartender, Dana, for the best Bloody Mary in Oakland.  She obliged, and I mean it really is the BEST Bloody Mary.  Hands down.  My companion went for the Brown Derby, which is a delicious cocktail with bourbon, honey, and grapefruit.  The drink was strong and delicious and only $6!  Wow--I feel like I am paying prices from the early 90's when I drink here.  Thank you Room 389 for not buying into the whole \"gentrification\" mode that all the other spots (that used to be cool and affordable and unpretentious--but, not anymore) have bought into in the Grand/Lake area.  What a breath of fresh air Room 389 is.We grabbed two more cocktails--yes, another perfect Bloody Mary and another amazing Brown Derby.  This time Justin, another hella cool bartender helped us out.  We even grabbed one of their famous hot, soft pretzels with mustard and salt.  It was the perfect snack for us while we waited on our friends to cross the bridge.  The service is outstanding, the atmosphere is exactly what I want in a bar and the drinks, well the drinks are straight up \"wow\" type drinks.  I think I fell back in love with Room 389, it has really been so long--too long--since I have hung out here.  I think we found our \"new\" hang out--AGAIN ;)  We loved it so much that we brought several friends in later Sunday night after dinner.  Yes, twice in one day, that is how great this place is.

The greyhound was pretty good. It wasn't sour from the grapefruit, but it could have used more alcohol. Room 389 has a chill ambience. Not too loud but you don't need to watch yourself with how loud you're talking. It is also dog friendly so feel free to bring your dog while you hang out with friends over some drinks. They accept all sorts of payment too which is nice :] No need to worry about bringing cash.",

Waited longer than expected to order drinks. Not sure if it was two bartenders or one bartender and a bar back, but it took some staring down to convey to them we wanted to order some drinks. The drinks were strong and made with freshly squeezed grapefruit juice- which is of course a plus. Overall good vibe, I'd like to come back for early coffee and their fresh pressed juices.",

I have to work outside of my apartment so I can focus. I might be one person, but I've had enough jobs in the service industry that I will always leave a more than generous tip. ALWAYS. Because I know the cost of living is ridiculous and understand all of the things that go along with working in the industry Unless you are bad at your job, then the standard tip will occur. So I have been here too many times and tonight was the final straw. I walked inside with my backpack as I planned on getting some coffee and the ridiculous Chex mix to sit outside so I'm not taking away from patrons that will likely spend more money than me. I waited over 8 minutes at the bar. Not ONE person came to take an order from me. Nope. And I know that it was 8 minutes because the NO vs OKC basketball game was on. I watched at least 6 other people receive service while I was there, waiting, as patiently as humanly possible. But I had things to do. Grabbed my stuff and left to spend my money elsewhere.",

By day they serve cafe style; baked goods and bicycle coffee, early evening and night time you'll see a crowd outside on the patio with drinks in hand. 389 is just outside Lake Merritt. With a huge patio and a lounge like interior, this spot appeals to everyone. Like I stated early they have a full espresso machine, drip coffee and are now serving breakfast burritos! I stopped in for their Spiked Coffee Beverages. I've been eyeballing these guys every visit. Mid afternoon it was so a took a seat outside on the patio, where there is a convenient window opening to the bar through which the bartender can serve your drinks. After asking the Barista which drink she recommended I decided on the Kraken Chai and might I say it was \"CRACCKKKKIIINNNNG\" I loved it. Weary of mixed coffee drinks because they are usually made with milk , I was pleasantly surprised by the strength of the alcohol and the lack of milk. HORRAY!!!389 is a perfect spot to meet up with friends. It's a nice alternative to the coffee shop scene of you wanna do some work on their Wifi network. They serve food and good vibes. I'll be back for another Chai soon.",

The bartender was nice and there was comfortable seating.Unfortunately, they really fell short with the drinks. One of my friends ordered a bottled cider -- that was no problem. Another ordered PBR and tequila, but the can of PBR was warm. The last two of us ordered house cocktails that contained grapefruit juice. The resulting drinks tasted alright, but were in serious need of a strainer. Both were filled with tons of seeds and pulp that blocked the straws and made them difficult and unpleasant to drink. It almost seemed like it was made with a wedge of muddled grapefruit and then garnished with seeds.I've heard good things about this bar, and it has good reviews on Yelp. I'd like to think that this was just an off-day, or that their strainer has a big hole in it and they just haven't realized it yet.",

The crowd is mixed but usually pretty typical of the Lakeshore/Grand area: mid- to upper-30s, blazers with jeans, that kind of thing. It's small and there's a patio kind of thing out front designated for you to smoke and irritate those walking down Grand with obnoxious sounds or whatever you and your crew get into when you're drunk. I'm not here to judge. The bathroom is pretty clean and on the weeknights that my friends and I have stopped in, we've been able to find seating downstairs on the couches but rarely at the barstools or any of the tables adjacent to the bar near the entrance. Upstairs seems all cool and shrouded in mystery like your parents' upbringing but that's probably because every time I've ventured up there I've been told to skedaddle because that area is supposedly ALWAYS reserved, even on the deadest Wednesday known to man. I mean duh. This is Room 389 we're talking about! But I don't mind, as long as you guys keep a big, comfy couch for me to sashay to and fro' and a cold drink for me to set down once I'm seated.

But one of the girls working the cafe is the worst offender. No matter how great I feel when I leave my apt seeing her ruins my mood. Ive tried to go in with a new attitude thinking maybe I am doing something to turn her off, although the onus is usually on the establishment to make the customer feel comfortable and not the other way around.

See, I don't ask for much! Both times I wasn't a fan of the doorman's behavior towards me, but I know he can't be Mr. Rogers around drunk people. So not too big of a fault there. But I decided to spend my birthday here last night. Both times the drinks were ok, but I'd much rather just get the Deschutes Porter. My Old Fashioned was a bit too sweet, but I can accept that. Here is where I went sour: After having my one drink I was cut off because Mr. Ponytail thought I was driving drunk. Plot twist: I WASN'T DRIVING! I just wanted a simple birthday drink. He got mad and began ranting to the whole bar. I'm an understanding guy, so I can only guess maybe drunk driving had a personal effect on him and I was a bystander. Sorry 389, I really wanted this to be my spot. Back to 3411!",

Above all, the people that come here are chill. Even on a busy night, the crowd keeps things cool and its relatively easy to get a drink without bumping elbows. I also like that the crowd age is mixed well between older millennials and middle age people. You certainly will not find an excess of young debauchery like some spots in uptown.  This is also one of my go-to spots for watching sports games. Order your favorite delivery and have it sent to the bar. Outside food is not frowned upon which I think is pretty great.",

From the light fixtures to the book page wall decor. The carved woodwork in the back is stunning. Feels like home. It's pretty much my second home. My bf DJs here every 3rd Saturday of the month. Wax Works! Ambiance is bitchin' with people dancing. The staff are all friendly and awesome especially the dancing barback/busser! Even though I usually stick with my whiskey neat. I occasionally will try their craft cocktails and I've yet to be disappointed. The pours are heavy and drinks are always tasty. Fresh squeezed juices to mix and fresh garnishes. They also make a killer bloody mary!!! Oh and the bar doubles as a cafe. It's a trip how different it is in there in the morning with people on their laptops just like any other coffee shop. So calm and quiet before the storm of afternoon lushes. But what makes their little cafe kick ass is because they offer spiked chai tea lattes and coffees! Yep! That's what I call a proper morning pick-me-upper!",

Upon entering, we saw the small empanada menu at the front and a variety of drink offerings up on the chalkboard. The entire menu looked awesome but we decided on one empanada and one tamale (I have a serious addiction) in addition to an iced coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice. The coffee was so delicious that I only added a little cream (and that says a lot) and the juice was sweet and tart. The empanada....I managed to get one bite from the boyfriend before he completely inhaled it. The pork was perfectly seasoned with the outside crispy and flaky. The tamale was equally tasty and had more filling than masa, which is a good sign. I wish I could have gone back and tried more but the next time that I am in Oakland, this is my first stop!",

One of my favorite brews and I rarely see it at a bar at all so the fact that it's on tap makes it even better! Second, the drinks are consistently strong and high quality. My two faves are the Grand Hound (better than The Layover's greyhound) with not just vodka and fresh grapefruit but splashes of a couple other liqueurs that go great with citrus, and the Eric Estrada,refreshing because of the cucumber but a little dash of spicy-ness adds a great element. Third, the bartenders are always nice a take care of the regulars first!Last, the DJs play actual records! And the beats are always hot on weekend nights. If you're not at 389 right now, go!",

I love the dark atmosphere, unlike most cafe's that are lit up and noisy.  Not here.  Also, It's great to have a place nearby that has good coffee, good  staff, and is not taken over by the bacon/pbr set, yet.  And they allow dogs!!!!

They've got a little bit of everything with the mini garden-like patio in front, long bar, and loungey area in back. So, if you feel like going out but don't want to make a big deal of it, 389 is kind of perfect. Cocktails are fab, and (little known fact) during the day the space operates as a cafe with the usual coffeeshop goods AND made-to-order green juice. So you can detox by day, retox by night. Get the apple pur\u00e9e & egg white cocktail! It's a guzzler.They have a trivia night on Wednesdays, which seems to be pretty popular (but doesn't take itself nearly as seriously as other trivia nights...watch out for cell phone cheaters). I've never had a bad time here, thanks to the strong drinks and chill crowd. Check it!",

Come take a walk into a bar that gives you the feel of being in a New Orleans, meets Jamaica and a bar in BARbados. Its a friendly neighborhood bar that can feel like a short vacation from the urban, busy and fast paced life, where adults of different ages come here for a shot and a beer or a tropical/craft cocktail.Service: Bartenders are no frills and thrills type of people, they love both pouring beers and shaking up cocktails. It is not pretentious like bars in SF, where cocktails are $14, here they are fairly priced from $9-$11. Even during a busy happy hour and with a game on TV, there bartenders are always ready to shake or pour your booze. Highlights: Old Fashioned: I hold my standards high for Old Fashioned, and here they make it simple and right. Not too sweet, not to bitter and has the perfect kick with Buffalo Trace Bourbon. Irish Coffee: One of the best that I have tried! They use bicycle coffee and a generous amount of Whiskey that can either stimulate or depress your nerves. Also, even better they serve it topped with caramel whipped cream made in house.",

They have drink specials, which is right up my alley as well as a DJ on some nights. The vibe is chill with what seems to be mainly locals. Dancing happens! The clientele is mixed, diverse, from super drunks to the proper types - black to white old to new. I dig that... However, I did get crap from some weirdo lady for rocking my Dodger cap in there once. She was a bit drunk and kind of played herself because there were tons of local macho dudes around to back her up but they played it cool and ignored the whole incident.

The happy hour was great. $4 for well drinks. The bartenders were definitely at different skill levels. I ordered a whiskey sour and the first one I got was a whiskey and water. I didn't drink it and got it remade. The second time around it was good... and the third was AMAZING. There is one bartender who has the perfect hand with a drink. If I knew the names, I would totally say it here... cause his drinks were spot on.After hanging out for a bit, the guy with the Cameroonian food came in. He had a veggie combo, chicken combo, and fish combo. I tried the veggie combo ($10) and my friend tried the chicken combo ($12). Both were AMAZING! Whatever he put on the plate was magic. Spicy and flavorful and pure deliciousness.Definitely coming back on another Tuesday night... this might become a thing for me!Go... and bring cash for that food... totally worth it!",

The set up is not very conducive to meeting others in my opinion. I dunno perhaps the lack of standing room and how divided each table is. Not sure how to explain. Then the service is kinda sucky. Just never get a good vibe from the bar tenders except one time this guy was overly happy almost pushing the weird line. There's also no bar food. They let you order from places near by but those places are not the best. The drinks are just OK.  I'm sure I'll try again but I think I'm more for 355.",

The viet coffee here was delicious, not too sweet or creamy with the perfect flavor of condensed milk. I dinked off one stat because I'm a HUGE stickler for politeness and smiley attitudes from employees and unfortunately the person who helped me seemed irritated, didn't say thank you or you're welcome and almost seemed mad that I didn't have the money immediately (had to dig for another dollar)",

Room 389 is pretty much the only reason I manage to study on a Sunday.Staff is friendly, the crowd is diverse but open. In true Oakland style, you get a real cross-section of people intermingling here. I love the vibe of the place when it's quieter, but never mind it as it starts to pick up.

The food is prepared by Chef Malong Pendar and he's amazing! The food is AMAZING - so flavorful. When you walk into Room 389 just go toward the back and his station is just before the DJ booth. Side note: the water is located near the front door and you'll need water if you order his hot sauce.The options are chicken, fish, or vegetarian. I went with chicken, so juicy! There was also spinach, rice, and yams. There was something else that was amazing but I couldn't hear what he said. The plate is only $12 you pay in cash & it's heaping! Could easily feed 2 people. Quite a few people would eat then ask for foil to cover the plate & bring it home. A few warnings: 1) When Pendar says his hot sauce is \"for professionals only\" he means it - HOT HOT HOT but delicious 2) bring cash 3) prepare for a crowd and to eat standing up 4) get water or eat near the water 5) He will serve food till he runs out, sometimes around 9pm so come earlySide note: Room 389 is a bar, it's set up as a bar not a restaurant so again be prepared to stand and deal with a crowded bar crowd when it gets later into the evening. The cool thing about Room 389 is that it's full of locals, a full range of ages for a bar from 20's - 40's, drinks are decent & people are friendly.",

The pieces and pages of books comprise the majority of the wall, and are intriguing.Only reason it's 4 stars is that they only have one barista work in the morning so if there's a few people ahead of you, you may be waiting a bit.

If you want your mind to beat itself into a bloody pulp, you can try the iced coffee but believe the barristas when they say it has tons of caffeine, I almost had a panic attack.

It's a pretty good bar with terrible staff.  Staff is often rude.  One day we waited for 10 minutes while the bartender (who, yes, had made eye contact with us) served everyone else around us.  Another day a bartender rudely corrected my pronunciation of a beer name (who cares how I said it...I'm paying for it, right?), took my order, but then made a bunch of cocktails before giving me my beer.  The bouncer once got upset with me because I had to fish through my purse to get my ID. I could go on, but I think that's enough.I'll keep going because I like the prices and the vibe...but someone should know how I feel about the staff, right?",

Highly recommend to meet some l-oak-ls!We went for trivia night and the busy bartenders didn't even flinch when they got super slammed. They just kept cranking out the great drinks with a smile and a little wink the whole time. Great service and the patrons are super friendly-guaranteed to meet some friends. They have a nice front patio if you want to breathe in some fresh (or not so fresh if smokers are around) air and you can take your drinks out there as well. In the back of the bar is a nice lounge area so you can intimately talk and chill if that is what the night desires. Either way you are sure to be pleased!Also they allow you to bring in food from other restaurants- but, be wary of the restaurant right next door. Food is not so good.",

The ambiance is really nice, and the best part (for me) is that they allow dogs. Holy crap. And they have empanadas. You can't get any better than that.",

It was 4 or 5 deep when I got there but I didn't have to wait for a drink because my friend was belly up!  Decent beer selection on tap, although it ws no Toronado, but they have a full bar as well as some good southern food in buffet pans served to you by a nice man behind the counter.  They had fried chicken, mac n cheese, sausage in a bun, jerk chicken and I think some other items.  People were definitely going to work on the food.  Once the game was over I could hear the DJ playing reggae music and some Motown too.  Good crown, good mix of men and women, cool interior and lighting, a lot of seating and seating areas.Going to put this in my rotation for sure!",

Turns out that the small cafes and bars I keep finding around Oakland pull the same phrase from me: \"Great neighborhood spot!\" The same is true for 389. It somehow manages to feel like both a cozy cafe and a spacious bar. I'm a big fan of the outdoor patio, indoor couches, filament-bulb lighting, exposed wood, and house plants.The crowd is refreshing and always interesting, as it doesn't cater to a specific \"type\" - this is not JUST a hipster bar or place for nerds or destination for jocks. It genuinely seems to be the place where everyone gathers because it has something that appeals to everyone. It's an impressive quality in a bar/cafe. Perhaps it's because they started serving sliders on Wednesday nights during trivia...? But I don't think that would quite explain it. The coffee is solid, so are the cocktails, and so is the company. The one drawback (for me) is that people smoke on the patio, and since the doors/windows are always open, the bar gets smoky. Which means that my clothes and hair get smoky. Which means I have to go home and take my second shower of the day. Grrrrrr.",

The questions were diverse and varied. The drinks are priced within reason.

I was entirely too sober, made out with a hot chick, and then made sure my drunk friends made it home safely.  Not too bad for a first try, eh?  You're not reading anything past the 31st word, are you?  Perv.I had tried returning a couple times with more friends in the years that ensued, but things always came up, like other bars I liked a little bit more.  But the tides changed last week when JZ broke his UYE cherry and brought a shitton of people out on a school night to play trivia.  So much fun!I've been to a couple different trivia nights in my time, but this one was by far the most fun and engaging.  I'm usually the dumb twit sitting in the corner nursing my drink, but I helped rock the music edition of the quiz.  I even gave my own loud rendition of Whitesnake at one point (friends, forgive me).  The trivia master has an amazing soundtrack, reaching across a gazillion genres.As for the drinks, I'm a simple girl - no fancy schmancy cocktails for this one - but I've heard that they're really good.  The bartenders are great, though remember to be nice cus they're working really hard behind that wooden barrier trying to hydrate the masses pouring in and out of the door on a Wednesday night.  If you're into trivia night, come early to grab a seat in the back before they're all gone.  Trust me, they go fast.  I'll see ya there!",

Its airy and light during the day with high ceilings and a little outdoor seating area in front. I'm a fan of the high tables against the left wall waking in. They're comfortable and somehow make me feel socially at ease. So the lack of the fifth star comes from my disappointment to find that they don't offer a vegan bloody mary... There is a bacon garnish option (unusual yet offered) but no vegan option (unusual and not offered) for those of us who embrace a cruelty free lifestyle. I wouldn't even bother complaining about it except that I drank a million of them before learning they weren't vegan (my own stupid fault because I guess the typical bloody mary has worcester sauce which has fish oil or some fish product) because they're delicious! I want very much to go here all the time and drink bloody mary's with my friends but, until there's a vegan one, I can't...To their credit, however, they do offer soymilk in the cafe!I also had Cameroonian food there which I guess they have on the regular. This was before I was vegan so I'm not sure of the vegan status on that... But it was also delicious!So, to recap, really nice vibe/ambiance/atmosphere, really good drinks, nice cafe with vegan options and local Bicycle Coffee, but very much hoping they'll expand on their vegan options, particularly in the bloody mary category :-)One more thing! This bar has a really diverse clientele! I love that!",

They have ripped books on one side of the wall and some saloon type of decor going on near the bar. They have comfy looking couches by the back side of the bar and there seemed to be plenty of seating when I went both times. They were also serving mac n cheese one night (not sure if this is a regular thing) and it was delicious!

Their coffee and espresso drinks are super tastey and their iced versions are downright addicting.  There is a full bar is you feel so inclined, the staff is friendly and they have fresh juice if you are looking for a different kind of pick me up.  There are tables where you can easily work or lounge areas in the back to relax.

We happened past this bar on our way to a different bar, popped our heads in and winded up staying. The giants game was on and people were in a great mood, hot trays of fresh BBQ was getting set up for a dinner service and, unbelievably, people shoved up around a table in the back lounge to make space for our group of five.Maybe it was because the Giants were up 5 in the second inning, but the people in this bar were incredibly kind. I wanted a bitter beer, since I am always cautious about ordering cocktails in new bars. I chatted with a guy at the bar about beer while the bartender finished up with another customer. Then the bartender offered me a couple of tastes of beers on tap. I finally chose a Thelonious and wandered back past the crowd around the bar and into the back lounge area. A large group of women were celebrating a birthday in the lounge with us. They were all drinking cocktails and eating cake.Some of my group opted for the BBQ and two of us walked next door to pick up some Indian food from the House of Curries next door. The bar didn't bat an eye at us bringing in outside food. Between the food, the good beer, the friendly women sharing their table with us and the fact that the Giants were looking good to win the game, I got up the courage to order a couple of cocktails. My Rye Manhattan was pretty perfectly blended, dangerously well-blended, such that you forget how strong it is and drink it too quickly. My friend's Dirty Martini wasn't too wet and was good enough that she ordered a second.This is a really fantastic clean neighborhood bar. I can't wait to go back. Next time I will try one of their Greyhounds.",

I like how there is always a place to sit and chill out with your friends when you are here.  The specialty drinks are well made and the crowd is a good mix.

Get that, and some cold processed coffee from Bicycle Coffee. It's an amazing combo. And try the quiche - it's great, even cold. In fact, it's almost better.

When I reminded indifferent server I was staying he did grudgingly give me a coffee cup saucer to put my own quiche on it. And a fork was a total afterthought.

Halloween was pretty crackn last year too. The lounge area was more like a dance floor and everyone was positive having a good time which is a common theme at Oakland's best parties.

It comes garnished with a crispy piece of bacon and delicious pickles. Perfect afternoon drink. They have a good beer selection. Really nice atmosphere during the day with sky lights. Now on a Tuesday night! African food = amazing. Atmosphere = loud, fun and filled with a hip crowd. We tried the fish plate and the chicken plate. Made the mistake of asking for two servings of the hot sauce (don't do that). They know what they're doing when they're only serving you one spoonful of it.

Good music (more on the smooth, hip-hop tip), friendly people (a birthday party gave me + pals cake the last time we were there...it was my birthday, too!), cute bartenders (can take a bit on busy nights), and a nice patio out front for conversation-seekers.  Lovely couch area in the back for larger parties and looooong happy hours (4-8 PM!).  Check it out and make sure to keep your Debbie Downer friends away from here--it's what makes it precious to me :)",

Drinks are good and not too horribly priced here, definitely not the cheapest in the area but they have nicer quality ingredients. The one thing I always get a little blah about with this place is that I do seem to stand at the bar and wait for a drink a little longer than usual. Maybe I'm used to gay bars where drinks are poured and handed off to you like wildfire but it does seem to take a little longer than average to get your drink. Other than that the vibe is great and it's only a feet steps from my house so I will keep coming back.",

        "ReviewContent": "Besides being a huge fan of its \"night life\", I LOVE 389's Cafe - I'm happy now to find myself there morning, noon and night!The Coffee:My favorite Saturday morning Oakland tradition has been walking to the Grand Lake Farmer's Market and enjoying a beautiful cup of coffee from the Bicycle Coffee Company.  If you haven't yet tried Bicycle Coffee, it is a masterful, delicious, boutique coffee that is TRULY one of the Bay Area's BEST coffees!  I am thrilled to have the opportunity to experience such a great coffee EVERYDAY at Room 389 Cafe.  The \"Pour Over\" option is among the strongest, most flavorful coffee pours you can find.  389 is using Bicycle Coffee for the coffee drinks, and (I believe?) espresso beans from Roast of Emeryville - both are EXCELLENT additions to an already great ambiance of 389's bar decor.The Afternoon: Enjoy the drinks on the small patio outside or inside, if you have your  Joe in house, consider the Cafe's \"Adult\" menu with such deliciousness as the \"389 Special\" - the complements of Jameson, Kahlua, etc. are always nice additions to see at a cafe by morning, bar by night...The Pastries:Delicious fresh spreads from Oakland's local Starter Bakery!Lunch:Yes!!!  They have a (very limited) menu from a flat grill, but try their grilled cheese!  It is excellent!The Service:Emily is awesome!!!!  She serves a great cup and conversation with a smile and an inviting presence to enjoy coffee at 389 everyday!The only drawback I see with 389's cafe is of relatively dark space, even during the day, making it challenging if you're interested in reading or doing other work in a well-lit cafe.Otherwise, I'll have a Bicycle Coffee Pour Over in the morning, and a Green Bulleit at night.",

They have free wireless and most of the time I go, I have my laptop with me and a nice Grandhound (ask bartender to add some cherries) by my side. Also the DJ's are great, variety of great music, nice mellow atmosphere. On Tuesdays they have some triva night--so if you don't like that kind of crowd, its not a good night to go. I think its Wed. where there is a guy who comes in and sells plates of hot and tasty African food...YUM. Diverse crowd..nice seating. The only thing negative that I have to say is that twice there have been people with their dogs in there...not cool..in my opinion. I don't hate dogs, in fact I like them. However, when there are people consuming drinks and food, I'm not a fan.  Also, you usually have a tough time looking for parking...But I'm still giving it a 4!",

My only problem with this place was that being towards the entrance, all the smoke from the smokers outside, was coming in. It kind of ruined it for me and only stayed for a drink.

The premise to look as closely to Rihanna (aka hoochie), without being overtly obvious about your hoochieness.  I was kinda happy that I didn't dress inappropriate considering that we ended coming to a bar afterward.  Not exactly the kind of attention I want.  I love hanging with my work folks--such a great group of people, always full of energy and spunk, happy about life, we love talking about teaching, and just catching up.  I had a couple of beers-- honestly, I don't remember that last time I got drunk.  Sure, I'll have a glass of wine here and there, but full on shots/hard alcohol, gosh, it's been months.  Trying to cleanse my aura and be really healthy.  Honestly, it's because when I drink a lot...I tend to have \"beer goggles,\" and everyone appears so much more attractive than in real life.  And engaging in conversations while drinking, well, everyone comes off like George Clooney.  Charming as all heck, but when those lights come on, and I'm sober, I quickly notice the real deal.  I don't know, I think I'm just over the bar thing...like yeah, you meet people, if you want a quick hookup it's hella easy and there-- all you have to do is spot out the cutest guy and give a \"come hither look,\" and boom, easy as pie.  But it's totally meaningless and you know exactly what you're doing.  I guess I've always been one of those girls that doesn't need a bunch of guys to pay attention to me. The way I see it, if you like me, cool, if you don't, cool.  Whatever floats your boat. Room 389 is chill, kinda divey with laid back couches, music was throw-back hip hop, the peeps were diverse.  I remember getting up to dance for a bit, then I looked at my watch, and realized that it was time for bed.  I do remember a guy asking me if I could teach him how to dougie.  So, I did.  I'm sure it made his night-- happy to do it.",

Great cocktails, decent prices, and lots of seating.  Word has definitely spread over the last year though, because this place can get crowded!  No matter how crowded though, it's still an awesome spot. Great DJing, cool decor too, plus a taco truck in front :)",

        "ReviewContent": "The former establishment, \"Dapper\", received the \"Serenader\" treatment a little over a year ago. And although i couldn't dig up the exact reason for the closing, I'm sure the neighbors are thrilled about it, still, you can't knock a business for the type of people they attract, since we all march to the beat of a different drum. The staff here is always pleasant, especially the bartenders during the day who will take time to describe beer, and answer questions about any drink you may be considering. Room 389 is a cool place to grab a mid-day beer along with some of the locals, some of whom used to frequent the previous establishment. At night, however, it turns into a melting pot of semi-awkward people, the occasional bikers, and some dude-bros sprinkled in for good measure.If that's your thing, then you will love this place after 10:00pm, otherwise, approach with an open-mind and a patient disposition. Oakland is extremely diverse in 2012, and so are the local hangouts.",

We found a spot a block away next to the lake and the drinks were good. The white sangria was my favorite. If I go back, that is the drink that will get me going all night. There is plenty of seating. We occupied the left side of the coach area with about 20 or so of us and there were people on the other side and so many tables next to the bar. Also, the people are so nice. We had some stranger sing my friend happy birthday and I had such a great time. GET THE WHITE SANGRIA!",

Last  night was triivia night and I attended. Trivia isn't for everyone but it is definitely for me. The crowd is grown, intellectual, classy and fun.  There was not a surplus of hipsters at a bar that I like (for once) and they serve  The Brother Thelonious on tap. Score.Plenty of seating for groups, a comfortable smoking section and a clean bathroom. The whole bar reminds me of a book I'd like to read. The bartender was great. I ordered 2 complicated rounds for 5 people and he made no mistakes. I mean, it's his job and everything but I just appreciate that he remembered our drinks on the 2nd round , no problemo. Everyone at the bar was notably chatty and unafraid to say hello. I feel like that says alot about a place.  Note: standard drink prices and two flat screens playing college basketball.Who knew a group of middle school teachers would find a bar that fits their lifestyle verbatum and I'd end up as a contender in the games?

I strolled up to see if they served absinthe and indeed they did!  A friendly bartender named Emmy even gave me the lowdown on the different types they serve there.

That being said, Room 389 definitely lives up to a nice atmosphere with friends and the likes for a round of drinks.Their selection is fairly wide in spectrum, but I've had some hesitation ordering mixed drinks from them as one day it'll be way too much on the liquor, and another day where it can be fairly weak.Their lounge area in the back is very attractive, as it's part layout of their back \"dance area\" so to speak. The overall size of the bar is relatively small (long and deep, but narrow), but their patio area up front (ash trays provided, yay!) makes up for the room lacking.Their live music is hit or miss, as can be expected from differing DJ's on hand.Been here on a regular weekend, but also for holiday celebrations like New Years. There's no real \"barrier\" here, that is to say - you won't be filled with disdain from hipsters dressing up like their from the 1940's or anything. Or will you find yourself weirded out from any other clique. It's overall a very open atmosphere, very relaxed and friendly all about.I once read that this was a \"dry hump\" bar? ... I could definitely see that, but it won't be without reason i.e. dry humping to John Mayer or some stupid bullshit like that. It retains a level of class that anyone can tolerate.It won't be a waste of time to check it out if you're looking for a new bar to try out.",

We got to the bar and were able to order drinks pretty quickly and was able to find a seat.I love their greyhound, which is fresh squeeze grapefruit juice and vodka.  It's $9 but  have to pay an extra dollar for them to use kettle one- which is how I prefer it anyway.  The crowd is very diverse and the music is more of a hipster soulful feel to it.  It definitely feels very East Bay (if that means anything to anyone) compared to a bar in SF.   The vibe of the place is very nice in that you have a diverse diverse group of people who are pretty lively without being obnoxious and the ambiance is casual and chill but not dingey.  They also had a taco truck right outside of it at 12am, that's a nice bonus for those are get the munchies afterwards. The only reason why I docked it a point is that by 11:15, they ran out of grapefruits and had to use juice concentrate for their greyhounds.  One of my friend was unlucky to get that and everyone thought it was really gross.  It was way too sweet and just tasted really bad.  I understand if stuff runs out  but 11pm is pretty early to run out of stuff for one of your signature drinks.",

The specialty cocktails can be a little inconsistent...but overall pretty good.However, this place is NOT FRIENDLY TO SPORTS FANS - even though they show sports on the TV. My husband and I were chastised by the bartender because we were cheering \"too loud\" watching a college football game at 5:30 pm on a Saturday. We alerted the bartender of our intention to watch the game as soon as we arrived and were assured it was no problem. Everyone in the bar (less than 15 people) was friendly and open about us watching the game. Then 2 women showed up and sat at the bar and must have said something to the bartender about our level of enthusiasm. Next thing we know, the bartender - who we'd been getting along with really well up until then - got on our case about cheering. We cashed out our tab and left at half time. Not cool.We'll still go for cocktails, but don't put sports on the TVs if you don't want people to cheer! Super lame.",

(supposedly the bartender was gonna charge me for his drink but i was annoyed and left). in fact, if i was the one that told someone about their car being ticketed, i'd actually leave it at that and chalk it up as a nice deed for the day. really though, it put me in a really weird position as a customer, as someone who was spending money at this place to RELAX. but that wasn't the end of it.so one of the staff (at least he seemed like staff cause he was kickin it behind the bar from time to time) proceeds to give me a hard time about it. i'm like \"yes, that was nice what the gentleman did, now get out my face please.\" but he continues to HARASS me to the point where my friend is like \"yes, it was really nice, but we're done talking about it!\" needless to say, my chill relaxing evening at the bar was ruined. point is, read the parking signs, expect to get played with by the security, and harassed by the staff. i'm sure this place is generally fine but i'm taking my business elsewhere.",

They showed Cal games, had Cal gear and memorabilia on the walls and on Sundays it was all about the Silver and Black...Now it has turned into something more eclectic. Room 389 is a cool lounge focusing on music and artful cocktails. This is more of a fit for this Grand Avenue location down near the lake. Less about sports and more about the tunes. They turned the back area into a lounge where you can kick back and listen to the dj play some funky music. The bar area's swanky and fairly spacious. Their patio is out the front by the sidewalk.  Just be aware of those passerbys who need money to get back to Hayward or somethin.....",

The owner is not some douche bag just collect money, he is actually super cool and puts in his fair share (if not more) of hard work behind the bar. Sometimes there is  food being served (for a small fee). The vibe is one of a neighborhood hang out and most people do know your name lol. The bartenders are well educated about their selection of spirits and they recommend superb choices. The place is safe and people respect one another there.

I stick to Manhattan's (which are poured with a nice heavy hand) but the other cocktails look decent as well. There is also a weird guy who grills on the patio sometimes. His food is pretty good but another guy who does kabobs and other things is better. Also, during busy nights there is a taco truck outside. Boom.",

Meh. Counterproductive much? They have burrito trucks, or some kind of food stand happening every time I've gone. Which is nice, if you're just getting off work and want a bite to eat. Also, you can bring in food. Ah-ha. Nice.The decor here is nice and funky.  There's nice comfy couches in the back. Although I try not to sit on the couch, from fear of falling asleep while being drunk. It's happened too many times... I love that this bar brings in the best of oakland, the crowd is usually laid back, and funny. And you meet all types of different people that are Oakland natives, what more could you ask for? Shout out to Ben for naming that one drink after my word. \"S---E\". Well it's not on the menu, and even if you knew what the word was no one would know what you were talking about, cept for Ben. Pst, quick tip TRY IT. Really really, good. Chill and attentive staff! Major, shout out to Hisani as well! Love this place. They'll still serve me even when I smell like sweat or wet dog.Oakland's hidden gem.",

No one asked me if I wanted a thug in my life; no one called me \"sweetie.\"  Where was the Golden Bear and all of the associated ridiculousness?Replaced by Room 389!Room 389 is a really nice, regular bar.  Decor is interesting but not swank; drink menu us modest but reasonable; music is fine but not over-the-top hip; people that work there are totally friendly and casual.  But it is revolutionary by virtue of its location.  By replacing a ridiculous establishment with a regular, friendly neighborhood bar, and adding some nice touches (the fresh citrus drinks), the owners effectively tapped into the mountain of demand emanating from Adams Point residents like myself who sometimes just want to go out for a beer but who don't need stadium seats or cat-callers.

The music is a little off to me...but very unique ~ from jazz to hip hop to oldies rock.

One duo was full-on dry humping in the presence of everyone. Meanwhile, the front of the bar was totally normal. My friend and I were highly confused -- is it a \"business in the front, party in the back\" sort of situation? One part sports bar, two parts Power Exchange?

Stop already. Get creative and stop being lazy.Anyways. Room 389 is a huge improvement over the Golden Bear that used to be at this spot on Grand, with a spacious bar, comfy tables, couches in the back, a DJ booth, and black urinals in the men's room. The drinks were decent but I thought the $6 beers were a little pricey. Music was generic R&B and pretty boring, but the bartender was super nice and I loved the space. Please don't turn super douchey. Pleasepleaseplease!",

After we finally grabbed a seat at the bar we started with the special cocktail menu (I ordered the bourbon drink I forget the name of but it was FAB) then continued on with some beers and even got to try some drinks tailored to our tastes by our patient and helpful bartender. Did I mention that you can also order some of the best shrimp wontons from next door and eat them at this bar? They'll even deliver them to you! Room 389 has a great neighborhood atmosphere without being dingy or divey in the bad way. It's decor is stylish, crowd is sophisticated but unpretentious, the cocktails are delish and bar is well stocked. Def add to your places to try if you're in the area.",

There's kind of a [i]Walnut Creek on a Saturday night[/i] feel to it, but that's more due to the number of striped shirts than the decor.  The back area is comfy if you can get  a seat.The bar has one really good bartender, one who has been awful each time I've encountered her, and one who macks on the ladies and points down the bar at the bad one.  Maybe he's not a bartender but rather a lounge lizard who got stuck on the wrong side of the oak planks.  Maybe he's also pointing at her as a warning.The drinks are good.  Their greyhound has really good fresh-squeezed juice and they make good sazeracs.  The prices are good for what they provide.  So yes, it's a good little place, but they could use a an extra bartender or two and the bad one needs to be shown the door.",

I'll keep it simple, here's why:- First time there, a low key Sunday evening so it wasn't very busy. Great atmosphere and decor. Awesome smooth music on the radio. Great vibe. We wanted to stay longer, but work was calling in the morning...- Second time there, for a World Series Giants game. The bar was packed but the bartenders were on top of it. Great customer service. Friendly and fast.- The bartenders here know how to make cocktails. Too many places are just a shot and a beer. They know the real thing here. I wasn't sure what I wanted and asked for some sort of light, champagne cocktail. The bartender got it just right.- A guy out front was making sandwiches, if you got hungry, but know that he is a separate biz and takes cash only. Plus there's a pizza place across the street or an asian place next door. Someone said that they don't mind if you bring in outside food. Bonus.- Beyond that, we met some really nice people at this bar. Staff and patrons alike. It goes a long way when you instantly feel comfortable somewhere.- I saw that they have a record-spinning (as in real vinyl) DJ on Thursdays. That will be my next stop in! Can't wait.",

He gave my friend a taste of the seasonal brew immediately, and made a geeky Chronicles of Narnia joke about it (yesssss!). Super friendly service.Beers were on the cheap end ($4) and I didn't try any of the cocktails, but they looked fancy-schmancy. Looks like they have a DJ fairly often...nice touch.

Its a very comfortable place, just wish the music was a bit less R&B urban and more alternative rockish, maybe it depends on the night and mood of the staff. Well you can't have everything. The woman bartenders are pretty friendly too, as was the owner when I chatted with him about the place. Good location and usually easy to find safe parking on the street. Also they allow you to bring in food from the local restaurants as well as the occasional grill that is set up in the front. If I were going to open a bar in Oakland, this would the model.  The one downside, the front patio is a haven for smokers, and their smoke can get blown into the bar when the front door is open. All in all, glad I found this place.",

Loved the quirky, retro, literate decor, the comfortable seating, the friendly bartender, and the great cocktails.  Did not love the totally incongruous reggae music.   Just what I want with my basil-infused top shelf Manhattan... reggae music.This prompted a debate about whether these quirky, retro, interesting bars with artisan drinks and ill-fitting music that pop up are actually the brain-child of the owners, or just some decorating concept that some terrible consultant pastes on but no one really cares about,  or if the concept is really important to the Powers That Be but they just forgot about the music (we're looking at you, Era), or what.  Fortunately somebody changed the music to a great blues sampler so we could concentrate on our excellent cocktails, and the endless debate about how much bike evangelism is too much versus just enough to prompt useful shifts in transit habits.

It's super easy going yet quietly sophisticated, taking the Golden Bear Lounge and politely bidding it's memory adieu with a wonderful incarnation of the space.    The nice, long metal bar with wood trim (important and not un-noticed detail, owners) has double hooks under the entire bartop for the ladies as well. There is some nice art in the back half of the bar, which is wider and more open and looks like it could sustain some serious dancing if need be.    I saw them making tons of ruby red grapefruit greyhounds using this huge  fruit press in the middle of the bar, so I finally broke down and wondered what all the fuss was about. What I got was pretty damn good, and so simple: I ordered a hangar one greyhound and the barkeep cut a grapefruit in half, pressed it and added 2 ounces of vodka, and shook it. That thing tasted like it was still fruit it was so delicious. I was not mad. Not mad at all. I think the hangar was $8 but with 2 ounces thats a steal.   So thats what I got- cool place, great vibe, you can smoke outside in the front patio WITH your drink and they mentioned that they're throwing down BBQ every Sunday in the day during football season. I highly recommend Room 389, especially to all my neighbors who now have a neighborhood bar again!",

        "ReviewContent": "Wow.  The old Golden Bear/Dapper Lounge has reopened with a very new vibe.  I walked in one afternoon, seeing a few people inside, and got a warm greeting from the bartender, who told me they'd just opened the night before. It's a big, spacious place with a long bar, a few tables, TVs, and big open windows facing the street.  In the back, you'll find couches and a few tables to increase the \"lounge\" cred. The beer list was long and mostly priced at $5, with a few specialities like Chimay at $8. The afternoon crowd matched the neighborhood... including a dog and a kid. Nice. Coming back a few days later, at night, the dark wood, mood lighting, and mellow music transformed the place into a softer, more rustic version of Easy. It's definitely aiming toward a more upscale crowd.Seven years in Adams Point and I've never had a real local (The Alley is across the freeway, really).  Let's see.",
