Friendly staff, nice accommodations as well. The open mic was just what I was looking for in terms of a performance venue. As a vocalist, the Fireside *theater* is an excellent space to work in. Justin, the soundman, does a great job in getting things all ready to go for the event. He is also very thoughtful as well. I would have given 5 stars, but honestly, I can't afford $8 for a beer. I would recommend a $3 can beer, such as Pabst, or Miller, 12 oz can.Good spot, great location, friendly and welcoming otherwise.",

Dance floor's always lit, plus open mic and art stuff keep it interesting. Not just a bar but a real gem in Alameda. Solid 4 stars from me!",

        "ReviewContent": "Attended this small-scale halloween costume party in Alameda this past Saturday, and had a wonderful time. Such chill vibes in the venue, even when crowded in the cozy space, embellished with halloween decor and a somewhat limited amount of seating. We enjoyed the live musical performances during the evening... Ledbetter & his Best Bet (folk rock), Islavation\u00a0(island reggae), bonus 3rd set of halloween songs with mashup of both bands. The first band did covers like\u00a0Bee Gees' Stayin' Alive, and the second band, awesome reggae hits! They were all great, and kept us in a good mood all night. The costume contest was cool, since it was halloween weekend (1st prize winning a $50 bar tab). The boxed wine costume was my fave, winning 2nd place, only beat by grim reaper barbie, lol. With food served till 11pm, we were able to enjoy some bar bites from their menu later at night. The meatball dish came with garlic bread slices and a zesty marinara sauce that was quite spicy, but just too delicious to stop eating. And the flatbread was basically a thin and crispy rectangular pizza, it was tasty as well. Our cocktails were on the weaker side, very little alcohol, but flavors were good enough. In short, fun and cute venue, awesome live music for special events (and cool and creepy halloween decor), friendly but slow service, food is fantastic but drinks are weak.",

        "ReviewContent": "Came here to enjoy drag bingo and support FAAS. The good parts: pretzel bites, the DJ, and supporting our island's no-kill animal shelter. The bad parts are all related to the drag performances. I've never seen such low energy, humho queens. The weirdest part was one of the performers is an actual woman, who used creepy dolls in her act and instead of lip syncing, or even trying to sing, screamed at the top of her lungs. She gave the vibe of being kicked out of theater camp and never having parents tell her that she should probably get a job that didn't involve going up on a stage. Definitely come here for the dive bar and drinks, but don't come here for the drag. You'd think living in the Bay Area the queens would be extra and on point. Not at all.",

        "ReviewContent": "I came here several times 13-16 years ago and had fun with the crowd I was hanging out with at the time. Fast forward over a decade to last year when I got home on the ferry one evening and decided to treat myself to a drink. There was a guy behind the bar and he said he was in training. I said I wanted a Manhattan, up. Should have been an easy order and he excitedly said that was a drink he knew how to make. I didn't want to crush him so when it arrived in a martini glass full of ice cubes, I bit my tongue, drank up, paid, and left. Today I decided I wanted a drink post-ferry so I walked in through wide open door, figuring the Manhattan Mix-Up had been a fluke. The place wasn't too crowded and there were several seats open at the corner of the bar. There were two guys there, drinking alone, and I confirmed the seat I wanted wasn't taken. So imagine my surprise when a bartender walked over to me and asked if I was part of the private party. She then asked me to leave. I double checked and there was no sign on the door indicating that it was closed for a private party, and as I wrote above, the door was wide open. It was really embarrassing to have everyone watch as I got kicked out, and what makes it worse is that I highly doubt there was a private party actually going on based on the fact that there were other people sitting at the bar clearly drinking alone. I guess I didn't look enough like an aging hipster because I was still dressed for work?",

We told her it was our first time there and she explained all The activities  offered at the bar. Trivia night, open Mic. Etc. Donna who closedOut my tab was the same really friendly and appreciative that we came in.  Perla the woman who made my drink was farFrom that.  Not friendly did not really care it was our first time in.  She delivered our flat bread and basically threw it on the table along with a few napkins and off she went.  Not saying anything.

We were already stuffed with tacos, but we ate the pizza ... even the vegan guy.  The staff was also incredibly friendly. We sat by the fireplace which was warm and cozy; surrounded by other very friendly patrons.  There are lots of regulars here for the trivia which I think is very indicative of the awesomeness!

So sometimes if I want a quiet drink that is not the place to go even though I really like the atmosphere. There is always local artist artwork on the walls that is constantly changing. I like how they use fresh squeezed juice for their greyhounds and I also like how their large front window opens so that you can watch the people walk by on Webster Street and enjoy the sea breeze as you enjoy your cocktail. There's also a good taqueria next door if you want to grab something to eat while you're sitting at Fireside so that's really cool. A great group of bartenders too.",

Both experiences were fantastic!I love the ambience inside. It's got the perfect amount of dive bar and \"cool\" mixed in. Like, if you're in your 20's-30's you'll feel like you've found \"the place\" that other millennials haven't found yet. If you're in your 40's+ you'll fit right in with a lot of other 40+ers. They also have pinball machines and live music and board games in the back, so super bonus. The drinks are a great price, and they keep a large selection of craft beer. Bartenders are also super chill and funny and seem happy enough to be there. I like that vibe when I'm going to a bar just to hang out. I haven't tried one of their house cocktails, but will check out the list next time. I've heard good things from other people. This place is definitely a great place to hang out with the locals. If I didn't live on the other side of Alameda, I'd probably come more often. Will definitely come in for the music, though!",

Nice clean place, hot as hell during warm weather.  Would rate higher, but the beer and liquor selection is subpar.  Hangar One is a fine vodka, but not having Ketel One is just silly.  No Bushmills either.  Most disturbing is the beer.  I am all for supporting local breweries, even if I find some of their offerings to be awful.  Small batch does not always equal better.  Occasionally I'm not in the mood for all that culture, and can I just have a Miller Lite or a Stella?  It's obvious Management isn't insisting on superior quality, since they serve cans of urine (PBR) and also have Tecate.  Any bar where I can't get a Heineken or a Guinness speaks to the vanity of the management and not the desires of the customer....",

I read on their menu a drink that had fresh squeezed grapefruit juice and I couldn't remember any more than that. It turned out to be the most amazing and creative drink I have had in a long time. The drink was called Endless Summer, sounds kinda cheesy right? but it was delicious. It was made with Mandarin Blossom Vodka, fresh grapefruit, fresh orange, Elemkaule Tiki Bitters and Ginger Ale. I couldn't stop drinking them, I three and to make myself stop. Out of our table of 7, 4 of us had 3 each. Friggin delicious!!The place is really tiny but cozy, they have a lot of tables in the back.

I have given this place multiple shots and have come in here thinking that at least she can fix her tone and demeanor. Mind you I don't have to be nice to her with that shitty attitude but yet I have always remained polite and professional. It appears most times there's something stuck up her... I believe her name is Sarah and she's been working here forever. Attitude up the A Hole. I skip this place often due to her and must say that there are other bars in the neighborhood within this strip that are just as nice if not nicer. I have had parties of 7-10 close knit friends and we gather up at 1400 Bar & Grill down the strip. Great food, and live TV as well. When the owner there (Yanni) himself comes out and gives you a hug EVERYTIME you visit, that says a lot. Just cus she's been here for a dinosaur # of years, doesn't mean she owns the place. She needs to work on her rapport building skills and relationship mannerisms. This is coming from a guy that works in a corporate setting himself. I don't hold grudges but service and conduct is critical to my experiences. ESP when you come to a place to wind down. Not to experience a constant shitty attitude or to bite your tongue. That's a stresser itself and I dont have anytime for that really. If I feel I am \"bothering\" you while placing an order, or ordering something you may not serve (Grey Goose for example), just be cordial my friend. Rest of the crew here are super cool. A few of my friends have also pointed her demeanor out in the past so I know this isn't just me. When she quits (whenever that is), Fireside will earn my $$ then. And I can put down a decent amount on drinks. I hope management can be humble enough to address this and her. Thx!",

Recently I went by and saw that they now have a sign up endorsing a political candidate.  It's my belief that it is unwise for any business to endorse a political candidate, as it isolates would be customers.  And really, is this what your business is about?  No.  I really don't think placing a candidate's campaign sign on your property is appropriate.  There are plenty of other lounges in Alameda to enjoy a drink and socialize without having to suffer a political buzzkill.",

The Fireside is THE best bar in Alameda to go with your buds!!!  Hands down!  Thank you Fireside !  Thanks you for the chill, laid back friendly atmosphere and your amazing service!

The vibe was very chill and laid back and the interior was nice and cozy. Great beer and whiskey selection. The focus is certainly on local breweries and distilleries. We will return here when we are looking for a relaxed night out. They also have a pool table which is great, and Tuesday night trivia.",

Plus, I've been wanting to check out more of Alameda so I figured it would be fun to check out. There weren't many people there, which wasn't so bad for a Saturday afternoon. The bartender was super sweet. Apparently she was covering for someone, but she made a nice first impression.The bar is very spacious with a pool table and a small stage. They had happy hour while I was there and it looks like they have happy hour all day Sundays. Later in the evening, the bartender lit all the candles at the tables and put on the fireplace. Very cozy!After seeing that there will be a Siouxsie and the Banshees tribute band playing next month, you bet your sweet ass I'll be back.",

The fireside is a nice place to enjoy a cocktail (the \"mo betta\" is best) with a special someone.

They have local craft beers on tap from Linden Street Brewery, Ale Industries, Drake's, Black Diamond and Cherry Voodoo. Our favorite is the \"Golden State of Mind\" from Ale Industries, that I still call \"Orange Kush\". They often have a happy hour or game night special drink, beer or shooter offered. I love trying new drinks and beer.The drinks on the cocktail menu are delicious and they have quite a few Gin cocktails that I really like. They will deliver tacos from the Taqueria next door, which makes for even a happier happy hour. You can bring in food from neighboring restaurants to enjoy, which I like. The bartenders, staff and owners are really friendly. The trivia folks are great and it makes for a fun night out in Alameda.",

For the second round, I had to wait for her look away from her cell phone for about 5 mins as she finally poured beers while still on her phone. Its one thing to wait when theres a crowd, but when there's not? Also, there are candles on every table and at the bar which the bartender said she didn't have a lighter for. I found one (at the bar from another worker) and lit them myself. And to top it off, we went there for the foosball table which doesn't exist. Crowd, environment, ambiance, not good either.

The first time was on St. Patrick's day and it was surprisingly slow, the next time was on a Saturday and it was packed and awesome.  There is some amazing talent that comes through here.  To have a venue in Alameda that consistently brings in live music is truly awesome.  The bar itself has a front room with a pool table and in the back room there is the stage and seating.  The bar is a good size and there is seating there as well.  Drinks are pretty solid and reasonably priced.  The only thing that is missing from here is some bar snacks.  They do at least have a fire place, but it's never on, at least when I have been there.  All in all I am a fan of the Fireside and this is probably the best bar on Webster so check it out!",

The beer list includes local faves like Linden, the cocktails feature Hangar One and St. George products, and the wine list is all local. I like tha.t But I can't recommend this bar because the bartender was so hopeless phlegmatic that it made the entire experience excruciatingly unpleasant. On Tuesday night it was trivia night so the bar was busy but not crowded-- nothing a competent bartender couldn't handle with ease. I ordered a Sage Slam from their cocktail menu. And I proceeded to stand there and watch the bartender try to make this drink. And stand there. And stand there. He didn't seem to know how to make the drink, where to find the ingredients or that haste was of any particular import. Mr. Slo Mo could have made a beef wellington in less time than it took to concoct a drink with five ingredients. Meanwhile people are waiting. And waiting. And waiting. Later, I went back to get a beer. And waited. And waited. And waited. I went back three times. Same thing. Then I gave up and left. If you like standing around looking at a bar without a drink in your hand, this will be your kind of place.",

I couldn't believe it when I turned up and there was a sandwich board saying \"Kelly's Birthday Party\".  They had a drink menu specially printed with Happy Birthday Kelly and beautiful balloons. This was all done on their own accord. I didn't arrange anything in advance other than the band and DJ. Bitsy went out her way to make certain everything was set up to my liking. They had the sound system all set ready for the DJ as well as the stage for the band. I knew I had a big dance crowd coming, so Bitsy and Chris removed most of the table and chairs or pushed them to the sides to make plenty of dance space. I was concerned the fireplace in the back would get too hot once people got dancing. Bitsy's response was \"no problem it's gas, we'll just turn it down when it starts to warm up.\"  They supplied a big container of iced water for my dancing friends which was most appreciated. The wonderful bar staff Chris, Julia and Sarah excelled in making the most delicious mixed drinks and serving a diverse selection of micro brews with huge smiles on their faces. I can't say enough great things about this place. It has such a welcoming atmosphere like the \"Cheers\" bar in the television sitcom where everybody knows your name.  They worked really hard to make my birthday the most memorable experience. Love it! Love it! Love it!",

They trick you by saying they have Salsa nights then when you go it's either dead (no dance partners...due to poor marketing for this venue) or they are not playing Salsa at all!!!! For those who love to Salsa we don't want something similar or jazzy or whatever we WANT SALSA and if we are disappointed once we almost never go back. Don't offer Salsa unless you have access to the Salsa scene goers and have a good DJ or live music.  Hip hop Latin music draws a totally different crowd...no the kind of crowd a Salsa person appreciates. The Down Low...closed...why not go after those folks...that place was packed every Wed night...now where do they go???I am a Salsa dancer living in Alameda and I would rather drive to Berkeley or SF to Salsa. What a shame cuz the Fireside has so much potential but they need better marketing and folks who know what Salsa is all about.",

Yes.I was super excited for trivia and taco night, mostly the taco part since I suck at trivia. My friends and I arrived a little early (like the flyer suggested) and no one was there. We had the whole bar/lounge to ourselves. And then, we find out that the place where they get their tacos from (the neighboring business apparently) is closed! So, there goes taco night. We ended up ordering food from the Nations across the street. When people started trickling in, they started trivia night. It was hard as expected; also, it was Christmas themed (extra hard). Fireside needs to update their website's trivia page to let people know about weird themes and taco closures.On the plus side, I found a sweet beer that I actually like - an orange kush. Yes, kush.

So I initially rated low.But then I ended up at Fireside again last Saturday due to a long line to get in at the Forbidden Island. (Unbelievable! A line to get into a bar in Alameda??) I was pleasantly surprised at how alive the place was. There was a live band playing in the back, a small crowd in the front room and some people playing around the pool table. The type of crowd was great too - a very diverse mix of age, race, gender/sexuality. :) I love that about Alameda. The bar service was great. There was only a slight delay in getting our drinks.

I went inside expecting a real salsa dance floor, but all i saw was a pool table and a small space in the back, near the exit, which I can only assume is their dance floor. Hm, this is not the place for salsa though. Its a regular bar more than a lounge. It may be a cool place to hang out if you want to kick back and drink, but not salsa dancing. my friend and I were in there about 5 mins max, then we had to find a real salsa place, so we ended up going to SF. its too bad that there are no real salsa dancing in eastbay on a Thursday night. the advertisement for their salsa nights is deceiving.",

You can tell this is a favorite neighborhood bar for many.  If only I lived closer, I would visit often.  The bartender was adorable.  She was as friendly as can be.  We tried a mix of drinks from the cocktail list, all of them were original and fun.  There was a fireplace in the back, with a few tables, boardgames available for use, and a pool table.  All of these things made me feel like I had just come off the slopes and stepped into the best lodge around.  However, the Hawaiian themed birthday party taking place fit the place perfectly too.  I really enjoyed my time here.  Great crowd, fun atmosphere, and great staff.  I will be back.",

It's almost like a completely different place now... IN A GOOD WAY! I like the old divey feel that Fireside once had, but now that it's the Fireside LOUNGE, the name definitely suits the vibe. There's not a lot of rowdiness, the lighting is perfect, the bartender (maybe the owner?) is very knowledgeable about what she serves. They serve local drinks, like Whiskey from Ukiah and Linden St. brew from Oakland on tap, as well as the \"normal\" stuff. The bartender offered my boyfriend and I a taste of a bunch of different local stuff and even took a shot with us herself. She was attentive, friendly, and beautiful. We will most definitely be returning!!",

Full bar, quality booze and mixers (and the knowhow to mix 'em right).  Besides the drinks, the decorum is great - fresh paint, new floors, good furniture, art on the walls.  The owners are fabulous people, and the patrons are quite enjoyable as well.  A very diverse crowd, without most of the riff raff whose drunken dealings drive most of us out of the bar at an early hour.  A great place to stop in for a drink or spend an evening, especially when there's a band (BarChords!).Cheers!",

Based on the previous two times I'd been there, about a year previous, I thought I'd have good luck.  However, it appears this place was taken over by new owners.  I sat in the most isolated, out of nowhere corner, I had sound-isolating earphones in, a hat way low over my face, and I was very clearly buried, actively, in intense studying.  However, in one hour alone, 6 separate people came way out of their way, over to my isolated corner to repeatedly bang on the table until they got my attention, and ask me asinine questions.   All hope of getting studying done was lost. Clearly not my kind of bar.  However, not going to knock the bar down to one star, because everyone there was working was very nice, attentive, and the staff seemed to be putting a lot of effort into including all the customers in social activities, a real social kinda bar.  It was also clean, and had a solid atmosphere.  I think if I were looking for that kind of bar, I'd come back here.  However, it seems now I have to find another bar to study in.Also, 5 bucks for 1 beer is ridiculous.  And they charged me $7 for a shot of jager.  Times are too hard for these kinds of prices.  However, some clientele can clearly afford that so, again, am not going to knock them down to 1 star for that.",

Went to the Grand Opening Friday night and the Fourth of July party yesterday morning.Great (local) beer selection and delicious cocktails (they actually squeeze the fruit juice right there in front of you).  Their tap water is infused with lemons and cucumbers!  Amazing.It's well-lit and has lots of tables to sit with groups, plus a long bar with plenty of seating.Best of all: free pool.It's right on the 51A bus line, so I had an easy commute from my Oakland home.  I'll definitely be back.",

They put in a great selection of small-batch, mostly local spirits, beers, and wines and they mix up a great cocktail. The bartenders were a hoot, the crowd was fun, and there's food nearby. CD jukebox with a wacky mix of 80s, metal, and randomness. Awesome evening out--can't wait to hang there when it's warm and the front windows are open. I remember the Fireside when the interior had been renovated, but the owner had not. It's a whole different energy now.",

Over my time in Alameda the Fireside has gone from the grossest bar on Webster, to a good looking place with a terrible owner, to one of my favorite bars ever. The owners are amazing, the whiskey selection is outstanding, the whole vibe of the place is just preface, and what's that you say, there is free pool as well! I do not review often, but this place deserves it. There are a lot of mediocre reviews on here that have nothing to do with what is in this space now.  Good people, good drink, good times!",

I have never had a sour experience there; in fact, it was one of the first places in Alameda where I felt welcomed. I live close to Webster St and have seen how dead the nightlife can be on a week nights, so I really can't blame the owners for having limited hours.  Recently, The Fireside has gotten even better: Dollar Taco Thursdays, Five dollar glasses of wine on Wednesday, and great music on the weekends.

So if you can see from my ratings, I rarely give 1 stars to ANYTHING but I've got to say this place deserved it.  3 of my friends and I walk into the bar on a Friday night around 12am.  We were NOT intoxicated at the time, in fact we had just met up to START drinking at the Fireside Lounge.  Here's is an reenactment of what happened.We walk in and there are about half a dozen people @ the bars.  We ask the bartender what kind of beers they have to which he responded \"they're all over there\" (gesturing to a fridge with a bunch of beers).  Yes there was a sign that said no self-service BUT we assumed that if you point us in the direction of the beer it would be okay to grab our selection and pay for it.  No at this point, the asshole (aka bartender) decides to pull a power trip and accuses us of being intoxicated and used his \"right to refuse service\".  We all thought he was kidding until he escorted us out of the bar and locked the door behind us...all because we picked out the beers we wanted?!?!So after all that, I've come to the conclusion that the owner (bartender) is a complete douchebag and I don't understand why anyone would patronize that bar!  Perhap he just has a hatred of asians? I don't know.  Maybe it could have been the fact that half our group was asian?  I have no idea but don't come here- they deserve to close down.",

There are signs that say \"No Self Service\" but the guy just pointed me over there so I figured I should bring my choice to the bar to pay for it.bartender: Did you see the sign?me: Well, yes, but didn't you just send me over there to pick one?bartender: No. Have you been drinking tonight?me:  I had some wine earlier... (It's 11:30, not very early)bartender: I am going to refuse service to you, i'm closing up now.My friends and I look at him, like \"Are you serious?\"bartender: Yes. you are intoxicated, I am closing up. He went to the front door and startind to lock it up. There were still 6 people sitting at the bar, but we were being kicked out.I still can't believe this actually happened. Being kicked out for picking out a beer of a fridge after being directed to do so. What a jerkface!

Nice sized place (so I thought).Well, at about 11:00pm, turns out the party went over capacity for the place... which I guess is 50 people according to the guy in charge. The music was stopped and people who did not have drinks in hand were told to leave. I guess if we were all packed in there like sardines, this would of made sense except for the fact that it wasn't even crowded. I've been in bars and clubs where you have a hard time just moving around and this place was far from that point. After some people left (it seems they stopped serving alcohol at that point), the party limped along for another hour before house lights were up and music was cut.In the end, night was over just as it was getting going.

        "ReviewContent": "1st time here was for a Birthday party. The night started out pretty cool, maybe 15-20 people showed up between 9-9:30 and were just chilling. Bartender was very friendly and nice, but seemed to get a little overwhelmed as the place started to get busier. The guy who I didn't realize was the owner was bar backing and didn't really lift a finger to help with drink orders. (Two bartenders hustling could have handled the group, but one bartender was never going to get keep everyone served) It seriously was taking 15min+ to get drinks (some people weren't even getting acknowledged) Then about 10:45, the owner stopped everything and asked people to leave because he was \"Over Capacity\" (There were maybe 60-70 people in this place) and sounded like he was complaining that he had run through a case of vodka in an hour and a half. (Last time I checked, that was the point of a bar to sell alcohol) He more or less ordered anyone that didn't have a drink in hand to leave to help reduce the risk of them getting a fine that he was not going to pay (within his right as the owner to reserve the right to refuse service to anyone, but I just didn't get the whole rationale of things) People complied and then 15 minutes later the bar stopped serving all together and they started putting up the chairs. Needless to say, the evening was cut short, it was fun while it lasted and I've never heard of a bar not being allowed to have more than 80 people in at one time. It was bizarre... I felt bad for the two regulars that stopped in but couldn't pull up to the bar because our group had it locked down, but heck, it was one night and they could have stayed...This place maybe cool on regular nights, but this experience turned me off to it... it was just bizarre to me. Atmosphere was cool, but it didn't seem like they wanted the business. Even if the group was around 50 people like the owner said he \"was told would be in attendance\" he still wasn't even trying to keep that many people in drinks.",

Cheap date that I am, I wasn't really trying to go somewhere that charged more than a few bucks per game (some places were $10+/game!). This is how we ended up at Fireside early one afternoon. I hadn't bothered to check their hours and if it had been a different day we would've arrived to find ourselves staring at a locked door, as they usually open at 4pm. However, the fates (and NFL or NBA or whichever happens during Fall) were working with us that day and Fireside was open early to show the game.The bartender, who I'm pretty sure was the owner, is very friendly and let us sample various beers from their great selection. I don't remember the name of the one I had but it was a caffeine-laced stout and was very tasty. Between the alcohol and the caffeine, my body quickly reminded me that I hadn't eaten anything all day (don't worry, we hit up the El Novillo truck after leaving Fireside).Because there were only a few guys sitting at the bar, D and I had the pool table all to ourselves. Not having to wait for others to finish and not having an audience to watch me fail miserably were bonuses to the pool being FREE!It was a little chilly in the bar and they had a space heater set up, which was so kindly pointed in the direction of the pool table. My skinny ass really appreciated that. I would love it if the fireplace were in use and if there were more places to \"lounge\" - it is called the Fireside Lounge, after all :)",

I wouldn't mind if they were dumb as a box of rocks if they were at least decent to look at - they are repulsive!  And their attitudes don't help them or the establishment.  The owner needs to wake up and take some notes from the successful bar owners in the area, such as Lucky 13 or McGraths.  Every other bar in town will be packed on a late Sunday afternoon except for this one,",

        "ReviewContent": "We fell into the Fireside late one night after dining elsewhere in Alameda. My friend is an enthusiastic fan and patron of the place. It was my first time there. After being served some pretty dismal alcoholic concoctions all over Alameda, it was a pleasure to be served by a truly talented bartender who takes his work seriously. I ordered a lemon drop - with gin, not vodka. Friggin' fantastic! I had completely given up on ordering this relatively simple drink at any bar since everyone screws it up so badly. Why is it that all of a sudden every fool thinks he/she is a \"mixologist?\" NOT!!! But there's a true cocktail artist at work at the Fireside. Add great prices, cool vibe and comfy atmosphere with all kinds of wonderful people, and what's not to love? They deserve to be busier. Hope the word gets out 'cause this place is a jewel.",

        "ReviewContent": "1996-1999:This was like a second home to me.  It was a dive.  It had a beautiful Budweiser Billiards Lamp fille with dust and a old Telephone booth. THe bartenders were far from friendly, but that added to the ole' character of the place.  We sang karaoke on certain nights and played pool on others..all while being completely plastered from their heavy-handed pouring.  Our saving Graces were the Doggie Diner and Nations Giant... It got tiresome when the bartenders would get more drunk than the patrons....I phased this place out cuz the abyssmal downturn wouldn't let up.Today:  Suddenly I'm hearing a lot about this place from people all over the Bay Area...I kept thinking \"they can't be talking about THAT Fireside!\"  I finally entertained my curiosity and looked it up.  Even the Pictures of the place weren't recognizeable to me, until I saw the ole' Firplace and The Sign.  Mind you, I've had NO reason to drive through Webster in the past I-don't-know-how-Many Years. Yep, it's THAT Fireside.  I might have to check it out now.  I'm guessing by the pics that the bartenders wouldn't even recognize me, because they were most likely not 21 yet when I hung out there!  Please be nice to me guys!  I'm a good tipper! =)  Oh, do you guys need a Karoke night there? hahaha",

Who are you people writing about roaches and bad service and giving 1 star reviews??  You sound like bitter, angry, and pathetic people with too much time on your hands.  (Are you confusing this bar with the scetchy Shamrock or Wallys or the weird Pacific Island Club?)I have patronized the Fireside many times and have ALWAYS had a great experience. There is a huge bottled beer selection, a few really good tap beers, a friendly staff, and free pool. In addtion it is very clean! I have been to my share of pubs and bars and this is one of my favorites. Great ambiance, great people, with a nice local feel to it.  So ignore the angry reivewers and check this place out.",

And for $4, I felt that was about right.I would think this might be a good place to catch the Sharks and have some decent beersFor some reason, I had avoided this place (maybe because they showed up in the police blotter or something), but it was actually very, very tame on a Friday night (at 9 pm).    I don't know if they have changed ownership in the last 6 years, but I was expecting a crazy crowd.And, yes, they have a fire place.  Don't know if it is a working one.",

I mean, I love a good dive bar; but the metal band in the tiny interior was enough to make my ears bleed (my eyes were already bleeding from how it looked), so I wrote Fireside off my list o' Alameda haunts.Skip ahead to today, and you have a tastefully decorated, homey, inviting place with WINDOWS (which sure as heck weren't in the original Fireside), free pool, and bartenders with personality (and yes, I too, like so many of the others here, like Alan with a passion). Tons of very interesting beers, and at least 10 or so bottles of wine at any given time. Plus, I caught the tail-end of the Raiders/Chargers game yesterday (ouch) and the place was actually pretty rockin'!I will reiterate others' sentiments about how quiet the bar is, though.

The modern decor, the sleek intimate tables, the chill hang out area in the back with the pool table make it perfect for a date, or for a group, or a must pit stop if you're doing an Alameda pub crawl. The vibe is relaxed and yet hip without even trying. The blues jazz playing in the background complements the super diverse crowd. The scene is set for some good times. Once inside, if you don't find any of the beers on tap that entice you, which I doubt, make your way to the back of the room where they have the coolers. The coolers are where they stock their beer collection that even puts Bevmo to shame. You just need to point out which one you want to the bartender.All sorts of Trappist ales, organic brews, local brews. I opted for the Rochefort ale. The bartender said it must be served in the traditional goblet, I obliged and walked around with my goblet and felt like a million bucks. Jean Claude Van Damme aka The Muscles from Brussels would approve of the Belgian brew selection here.",

The free pool is just a bonus.220+ beers in bottles, and another 10 taps with constantly rotating kegs. I don't know if I should be proud or ashamed that I have a few suggestions for their cooler... Hmmmm...The only thing really missing from this place is a good crowd.  Oh, and perhaps an actual fire.  Friendly barstaff who remember my name, and have figured out already that I never really order the same thing twice, as well as pleasant ownership who are actually here, playing pool and hanging out in their establishment, enjoying a warm spring evening.  It is definitely a neighborhood spot. I hate to shuck off a star due to the lack of a crowd, but perhaps this review might help that.  Much like Alameda itself, the Fireside is an unknown little gem in the Bay Area.  One part of me hopes it will stay that way, and another hopes that I can swing by on a weekend night and see more than a dozen faces drinking and being merry.  Just because I'm a beer drinker doesn't mean that I overlooked the full bar... they have firewater for you boozehounds too!  Oh, and free Wi-Fi... I'm actually here now writing this over a nice pint of Drakes IPA, but if you want one, you better head down because next week there will probably be something new in it's place... I just wish they would have kept the Denogginator, as it's one of my faves.If it's beer you crave, and like variety, a warm atmosphere and friendly bar staff... pop through the tube or over the bridge and make your way down.*protip: If everyone who stuck their head in the door and decided it was slow chose to stay for a pint, it would have this place rockin', so don't just poke your head in, stop in for a pint.",

They were matched in size to the votive candleholders on the table! Also, the drinks sucked. I got a drink from each bartender and each was awful. Either too strong or too much sour mix (got a Midori Sour and a vodka cranberry). If you're a beer drinker, then this is your place.

It's now a fairly serious bottled-beer bar, with a loft-like open design that makes the place seem a little barren when not crowded, but helps absorb the noise once a crowd picks up. The bottle selection is conventional yet extensive, but what matters is that the folks running the place are serious about beer. Want to talk homebrewing and the ins-and-outs of how second-tier brands are distributed? Want to figure out the best glass for an Alt? Come in during off hours and talk about the product.There's a lot of potential here. Add some wild cards to that beer menu! Go for the Euro stuff that's harder to find in California, especially the British bottles and more of those great German imports. Take the customer on a world tour. Yeah, our local stuff is great, but we need the New England-Britain Axis and the German-Czech Conspiracy to really represent in the East Bay, and this place is in a position to make it happen.",

The atmosphere is on point: perfect lighting, comfortable room temperature, just the right volume for the music, and a great bar & staff.They have an amazing selection over 200 beers, along with wines and spirits, and all the BEST kinds. I love that they have a great selection of microbrews and local craft brews, not supporting the conglomerate giants that are Bud-Miller-Coors, though I did see one Bud in the cooler, I'm not sure if the rest of them were. The best part, is the prices aren't bad for GREAT beer.Make sure to check out the Fireside if you're ever in the area, or want to visit a really rad bar. I will definitely be back, soon!",

This was back when folks could bring their tykes to the bar, set them up with a few quarters and a tabletop Ms. Pacman and go to town on their Manhattans, Martinis, and Tia Marias. Drinks were served in tiny old fashions and skinny highballs. The bartender could get your folks a good deal on a side of beef, wholesale. And of course, everybody knew your name. Which could end up being a problem sometimes, I suppose. We had my dad's retirement party here, after his 45 years of servitude as a newspaperman in a dying trade. I ate my first lobster tail here in celebration of my 2nd place win in an essay contest. This place was witness to the first time I got drunk with my mom not long after my dad passed away. And it was witness to the two of us stumbling home together to compete for first rights to worship the Porcelain God. Sadly, that Fireside has been replaced with a Starbucks and a One Hour Martinizing. Yes, it's true, you can't go home again...So I suppose I stumbled into this Fireside with a few nostalgic notions in my mind. Happily, I was not disappointed. We were immediately greeted by a friendly bartender who let us taste a few beers on tap before we made a decision. No offer for a wholesale side of beef, but that was okay by me. My Martini was dry, icy, and well-shaken. We played a friendly game of pool, during which I am happy to say I did not embarrass myself. The music was cool - Johnny Cash, Curtis Mayfield, and some other stuff that made me happy but did not intrude on our stimulating conversation. The bartender politely closed our tab, asked us our names, and shook our hands on our way out. Then we stumbled across the street to Lucky JuJu and spent the rest of the night drunkenly multi-balling away. A nostalgic night to remember.",

If your thinking about having a B-day party for some close friends, this is the place.  Cristi and Patrick were accommodating and very giving.   OK I can go on forever, this place is great!!",

More under raps and quiet.... The menu looked interesting, but I wasn't there for food... I was there for drinks and was craving the coolness that was the Fireside. Oh well.",

        "ReviewContent": "One star for free pool, one star for EXTENSIVE bottled beer selection. That's about all this bar has going for it. When you first walk in Fireside Lounge looks really upscale, think lounge room in a mansion(that's right they have crown moulding in a bar...) until you look a little closer and see that the place has big unpainted sections in the middle of walls and missing sections of crown moulding. No big deal though right? I mean maybe they're just in the middle of remodeling and want to remain open throughout... Then you see the three large cold cases in the back stocked with just about any beer you can find at BevMo and then some. BEER HEAVEN! All is forgiven! However, when you order shots for your friend for her birthday you will find that the bartender is a huge tool, and doesn't know how to make most shots you order. A red headed slut is that hard to figure out?! Well yes, but not when we're talking alcohol. ZING! Bottom Line: If you're lucky(or early) enough to get the single pool table locked down, you could have a good time here... Just as long as you don't have the beertender do anything more complicated than shake your appletini or pop your beer top. For me? I'd rather make a run to BevMo and buy the whole sixer for the price Fireside charges for one bottle...",

        "ReviewContent": "So the Fireside used to be one of the most disgusting bars on the island, considering it smelled like vomit and the people there looked like they were on the verge of homeless-- if they weren't already. But after a closing period, it re-opened with a thick coat of fresh paint (that didn't get rid of the vomit smell), some new fixtures, and a single man that was so rude I'm surprised his ego fit through the door. Let me tell you, it was nice that the bar had a pool table and all, though it wasn't plumb-- it leaned to one side and was a wreck. The beer was cold, yet overpriced. Don't even think about the liquor there, if you were being served by the Owner/bartender extraordinaire there was hardly any in the glass and I think he charged some people less than others! On one occasion I asked for a fruity drink selection and he quipped back with a snide remark about the \"extensive imported wine and beer collection\" if I couldn't find something there, go elsewhere. So I did. (Another bar with a similar name on the island recently opened, I find it enjoyable!) Needless to say, I went back once and still hated it. This weekend when I was driving past the place it looked as if the Fireside had a little run in with some, um, FIRE! Oopsie. Looks like the place had a little bad karma!!! Maybe it was in some hot water and won't open up again!!",

The old Fireside had a lot to be desired but new owner Patrick has cleaned (that's a first for this place), painted, remodeled and made it a great place to stop after work or any night of the week.My first encounter with the Fireside was 1980, long ago when sailors still roamed Webster Street and Ladies of the evening were hailing distance from the Fireside. I was 15 and it was a place that would serve me a beer. I was so nervous that the only thing that I could order was a Bud. Patrick now serves probably 30 types of beer now and that choice no longer has to be an option.See my complete review: http://cocktailcocktailscocktails.blogspot.com/2007/12/fireside.html",

She almost poisoned my friend with the amount of Chambord she added to her sparkling wine and my whiskey & ginger was watery as all get out. Some of the crowd here was annoying, especially the drunk guy who would lift up his shirt and flick at his nipple to distract his friend while playing pool, then go make out and dance awkwardly with her and her friend. The crappy phoned in R & B was too loud and all the pictures of sailboats from the 80's was just, weird.Good try Fireside.",

Some older folks sipping wine.  Swanky decor, comfy leather couches and not too loud not too soft music, one standard pooltable with free play and some pro looking cuesticks.  A stately fireplace at the far end keeps the bar true to its name.  Artifacts of note include the historical map of Alameda above the fireplace.

Literally had to park the car and find it by looking at the individual street numbers on the neighboring shops.  Once we found the place, we stepped up to the door and thought we were about to step into a total dive bar.  Upon swinging open the heavy door, we were shocked by how totally hip and modern it was.  I guess it was once a dive, but underwent a major rehaul not too long ago.Spot now has high ceilings, tasteful dark stools & furniture, a nice toasty fireplace, warm lighting, good tunes and a well-maintained pool table in the back.  Most importantly, the specialty drink menu is off the hook. We sampled the Blueberry Mojito, Strawberry Banana Caprahina, and Honey Lavender Martini (my personal fave).  All the drinks were extremely tasty & were served up with a smile.So if you happen to find yourself in Alameda, Fireside Lounge is definitely a nice spot to grab a drink and just chill out with some good company.",

What a sham. This place was nice. Nice and full of 30somethings with button down shirts and expense accounts, oh, and that one guy at the end of the bar who probably doesn't even own a button down shirt, umm, and the older guy who probably was a regular back when it was a dive, this hot edgy guy I picked up at happy hour a few weeks prior and myself, who transcends any sort of 30something categorizing since I often act like an adolescent. In short, the Fireside is clearly geared towards a crowd that likely decorates their place to resemble a model home (in fact, the decor of the bar sort of looks like the the living room of a model home, except that there is a bar taking up one wall). It seems that you do not need to fit that mold to drink here and still feel like you are welcome. The selection of libations is good and my companion found a new favorite beer that we promptly ran out and stocked up on for home use.Still, I would have preferred that this place was on the inside what it appeared to be on the outside.",

Thanks to Fireside Lounge, I'm now hooked on absinthe drinks.  I asked for a recommendation and she made one with whiskey and bitters that was quite tasty (one of their two signature absinthe drinks).  Being among the first to serve absinthe again in the area, others around me at the bar were interested in my drink.  It was a kind of glowing bluish green color.  After Christy told them what it was they wanted to smell it...kinda bizarre, I know!  But I indulged them.   Despite their interest, I don't recall them ordering one.  I guess they were scared off by rumors that absinthe can make people hallucinate or go mad.  Pfffttttt!  Down the hatch!A friendly couple next to me (with whom I chatted away for most of the night) kept asking me to tell them when I started hallucinating or if I was about to levitate.  I told them unless they were both figments of my imagination, I think I was fine.  They also later pointed out that one of those sniffing my drink was the mayor of Alameda.  Nice!  I must say, the crowd at this place is quite diverse, both culturally and age-wise.  You never know who you'll run into. And the interior really is Pottery Barn-ish.  A little dark, a little flickering flame, and then BAM!  a pool table!  But it all comes together quite well.  I gotta hand it to the owners for turning this place around and giving it a comfortable yet upscale feel that you usually have to cross the bridge to find.  Will have to make another visit soon and see if I can't raise my review to 5 stars.",

This is a *great* bar. For a variety of different reasons:AmbianceThe room has nice furnishings and a sophisticated feel, but lends itself to many activities-- lounging with drinks, playing pool, watching sports on the TVs above the bar (I can't tell you how happy I am to have found a bar that isn't a dive but still allows me to catch some ACC action), or dancing on weekend evenings. The crowd seems to be very friendly, with a good mix of regulars and visitors.StaffWhen I was there the owner's girlfriend Cristi was bartending. She was friendly as all get out, managed her crowd well (always making eye contact with people trying to order, even when she was busy, telling people she would be right with them), and EXTREMELY knowledgeable about their offerings, from beer to wines to spirits. I spent a lot of time quizzing her about different drinks and spirits and was very impressed with the amount of analysis and thought she had put in to the bar's selection of alcohols. Since her boyfriend is mostly interested in beer, Cristi is in charge of the cocktail menu (which changes seasonally), and has come up with some excellent drinks. I was also very pleased to hear that she makes their own mixers herself, since she can't stand most of the crap mixers on the market. This is a woman dedicated to making a quality drink, which makes her my type of bartender.DrinksFirst, they have an excellent and very wide selection of beers. I'm not a beer person but was impressed by the variety. The wine selection was good, and included some good local (and by local I mean the Bay, not Napa, people) choices. Hard liquor included lots of quality labels and numerous local products (although not Hangar One-- and with good reason, as it turned out. But I'll let you ask about that your ownselves). As importantly, the \"signature\" cocktail menu had some creative and as it turned out quite good offerings that Cristi had put a lot of thought in to. And, as I mentioned, the drinks are made with quality mixers that Cristi makes herself (who doesn't like a woman who declares her hate for commercial sour mix?)Really, I can't overstate how stupid I feel for not getting to the Fireside sooner, or how happy I am that I finally stopped in (thank you Cristian!). What a great bar. I can't wait to go back.",

        "ReviewContent": "As my delicious companion and I noted last night, if Restoration Hardware and Williams Sonoma Home fucked and had a bar as a love-child, this would be it. I dig the decor, but it's not at all what I expected from the outside, much less the area. It way out-classes it's neighbors.The Fireside Lounge is spacious, comfortable, and friendly. And they serve what just might be my new favorite beer: Kona Brewing Company's \"Pipeline Porter\"-- a coffee brew. So, so good. And the prices, judging just on the two drinks we had, seem reasonable: $6 for a pair of 10oz beers. A larger, 20oz size is also available. There's a pool table that looks like brand new, or at least very well treated. The clientle appear to primarily be of the 40-or-older professional white male set, but nobody seemed to mind when this 32-year-old mohawk'ed whippersnapper entered.I should give this place a solid four-star rating, but in the time that it took me to finish my beer, they played the Black Eyed Pea's \"Get It Retarded\" twice. I dig the track, daddy-o, but keep the rotation fresh! Sorry, I'm a music snob.I will be coming back, not just for the Pipeline Porter, but because this seems like an excellent place to relax with some of my button-down-shirt-and-pressed-slacks coworkers.  OK, maybe just for the Pipeline Porter.",

And he found a gem in Cristi, who makes the insane cocktail combinations behind the bar.  Cinammon chai martinis, absinthe drinks that are strong, but not overpowering, plenty of beer, and WINE!  Having joined (or been forced by my girlfriend) into the wine snob category, I'm starting to appreciate wine more and more these days, and when Patrick found out we loved wine, he started bringing stuff out from the back and having us test it out.  Very heavy pours, great service, nice floor plan, everything is perfect.  Do it!",

        "ReviewContent": "UPDATE 3/17/08: Still 5 stars. Celebrated my birthday here on Saturday night and had a blast! Thanks to the bartender, Jeff, for keeping the drinks and smiles flowing. (Sorry I kept calling you Kevin at first, but it was pretty noisy.) The joint was pretty packed at one point and he held down the fort all by himself. Also, they play music off an iPod and Jeff swapped in my iPod which I brought with me. So my friends (and all the other customers) were listening to my personal playlist all night. A birthday to remember. Note to self: tried absinthe for the 1st time and don't need to have it EVER again. Nasty sh*t that tastes like black licorice and will eat your brain.Original review starts here: YES! Alameda needs a joint like this (I think that about a lot of new places). A fresh, not-divey bar for 30-40-somethings. Yes, at 36 (37 in a few months!) I'm showing my age. Call me O.G. The Fireside Lounge has no windows so it's easy to miss. I overheard about the remodel and new ownership while dining at Asena one day. One of their waiters is also a bartender at Fireside, and he was raving about the makeover; been dying to check it out ever since. He said the former old-timer regulars would poke their heads in, see the new digs and leave. That's a good thing in my book.So the decor is Pottery Barn-ish (in a good way): tasteful dark wood furniture with a dash of retro cool. There are a nice mix of regular tables, bar tables, leather sofas, plus the bar seats. It's airy and cozy all at once. The walls are lined with vintage magazine ads for old cars and Tab cola. There is a pool table in the back, right by the fireplace (yes, Fireside has a real fireplace with real fire). The music was on the loud side, but not horrible (no louder than you'd hear at Old Navy in the mid-afternoon). I'm probably more sensitive to the sound level now that I have 2 kids and don't get out much. On a busier night, I probably wouldn't have noticed at all.Lastly, the drink menu was creative and reasonably priced (not cheap). My wife chose the Caramel Martini which she liked, and it came with a little caramel candy on the side. I had a Fireside Hot Coffee with coffee, Bushmills or Jameson (can't recall) and some kind of Baileys-like liqueur. At 10pm on a chilly Saturday night, it hit the spot. Bottom line: I like that Fireside is roughly the same target demo as Forbidden Island, with slightly cheaper drinks and more spacious. Also a good step above Z's for liveliness but that ain't saying much.",

        "ReviewContent": "What a find!  While I can't speak to its former incarnation, the new Fireside Lounge is inviting -- from the tasteful decor to the creative cocktails, unexpected wine offerings, and most of all the enthusiastic and personable staff (owner Patrick and cocktail queen Cristi). They made the b/f and I feel most at home and talked to us at length. Patrick was stoked to find fellow wine buffs to share notes with and hearing about Cristi's amazing journalism career was another surprising twist to the night.Stiff cocktails and very generous wine pours in oversized glasses that really let you appreciate the nose on the wines. Would give it five stars, but the music was odd (super random shuffle setting, anyone?) and a few details were overlooked -- a prohibitively dark corner, underused fireplace area, etc. But Patrick's love for his watering hole is apparent, and he has plans to outfit the front with windows and a Dutch door, so I'm confident his place will only continue to improve. While we live on the other side of the island, I do believe we've found our \"neighborhood\" bar. :-)",

Hmmm, not really the term I would use, but  a really nice neighborhood bar & lounge.  I like the fact that there is a split between the lounge area and the pool table area.  The bartender was friendly to chat with and shared some great cocktail recipes.  Alameda's hip factor is still pretty low, but places like this make me want to stay on the island.  The comments about the furniture are pretty funny to me.  As a designer, form is important to me and I am willing to pay for it for ambiance and setting format - but for these prices and this neighborhood, who is thinking Le Corbusier?  I think they did great job with the interior design and selection of furniture.  It matches the target customer.  Hopefully, this and the reasonably priced drinks will make many Alameda residents feel welcome.My only suggestion, is lower the lights - darker is always better.",

He invited us in to take a look around even though they weren't finished with everything.  Immediately, I knew that I would love the place.  Friendly owner AND an updated classy bar - count me in!We went there for the 2nd time on Friday night and I was excited to see an addition of a drink menu.  They had a beer special, where they put their extra beers that they have limited quantities of in a bucket and sell the individual bottles for $2.50 - bargain!   I even got one for free because a guy at the bar said he would buy me the beer if I tried the one without the label.  I lucked out, it was an amber ale!  We also tried the Pumpkin Martini, very delicious, a nice fall drink.Definitely give it a try - you won't be disappointed!",

I hope I didn't drive them crazy with my constant meetings with the DJ, florist and photographer, tasting wines, creating my signature drink (Red Hot Hottie...Thx Larry!)...but despite my OCD, everything was handled so smoothly and professionally.  It was a totally stress-free evening for me because I knew everything behind the scenes was being taken care of, and it was indeed.  In fact, looking back, I probably should have gotten slobberingly drunk knowing how perfectly everything was being managed.  Oh well.  (I'll make it up to you guys!)Regardless, every single one of my guests told me how much they just Loved the \"new\" Fireside and how much fun they had.  Can't beat that!FYI, since my last post and reading the older reviews, I just want Yelpers to know that any minor \"issues\" previously mentioned have been worked out, so you can just ignore them.  It is a new venture after all.  For example, that ladies room door (Tracy A)?  It's very secure.  In fact, it closes all by its magical self and on my way out, it almost hit me in the ass!**Orig. Post**Luv it!!  The Fireside has it all and then some.  It's a beautiful open space inside.  Cool people, great drinks and a really comfortable vibe that's inviting and relaxing.   You can play pool, listen to cool tunes, meet some new people and you can even hold a real conversation with your friends.  The ladies room is so cute and clean.

The decor is very tasteful, and I love the new raised ceilings.  Another plus is the vast beer selection - a great many bottle to choose from, also some great tequilas.Now the bad stuff - the bartenders pretty much suck.  They are not bartenders (and have told me as much), but are learning.  Hence, they have no idea what they're doing, ehich makes getting a drink take a lot longer than it should.  Also, the music is HORRIBLE!  Music is essential to any bar, and the Ipod regae/soft rock thing is not working.  Get some upbeat DJs, etc.I see room for improvement in the Fireside, but for my money if I want to go to a loungey-type bar in Alameda it'll be The Hobnob ... much better all around.I'll keep my fingers crossed for the Fireside, though, and maybe update my posting soon!",

There were a few unfinished things like the women's room door frame from the inside was not finished and to secure the door was this flimsy little hook and bar closure.  I also heard the bartender tell one person that the wine list was coming.We were happy to see 2 great IPAs on tap: Drakes and Bison.  They had a large selection of bottled beers too including some 20 ouncers, which I love.  The tap beers came in 2 sizes: small and large.  The small was really small like a 10 oz. glass.

Later, the dance floor opened up and the DJ was willing to listen to requests for different types of music, including Latin.
