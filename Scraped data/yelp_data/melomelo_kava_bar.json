She was wonderful and informative! She explained everything, invited us to ask questions, and made some recommendations. We felt so welcome!In addition to the incredible welcoming staff, the space is gorgeous. One wall is covered in live, growing plants that are all healthy & well tended. It gives a great vibe to the indoor seating space. One of us loves indoor plants & admired their plant wall so much that the tenders let us take home 2 small clippings (plant babies), to grow at home.The lighting & music are thoughtful & pleasant as well.We enjoyed our visit, would recommend highly to newcomers to kava like ourselves!",

This place has very relaxed vibes and we came on a Sunday evening so it wasn't packed. Right when we walked in we were welcomed by the super friendly staff and we took a look at the menu. This was my first time having Kava so I wasn't sure what to get but I went with the Melo Chai which is chai spices, raw agave, almond milk and kava. It was delicious, the second the kava hits your tongue it's a cool numbing sensation. I would definitely come again and try other flavors. They also have what's called a riptide you can add which is an instant kava boost and they didn't have it today so I'd want to come back and try that.",

I tend to go for the Kava which I always enjoy. I don't drink alcohol so for me it's a great alternative if I'm looking for an overall calming, yet enjoyable effect without any negative consequences.  All of the staff is great, but there is a star in there who truly shines and gives all of herself to make sure the customers are happy.  Sarah is truly top notch in every way - so much so, that she is the reason I felt compelled to write this review.  I couldn't help but sit back in awe and watch how she worked her magic managing to make every customer she engaged with smile and have an enjoyable time.  She's on top of it - between engaging with the customers ( & that night, open mic artists), refilling glasses without having to wait ( & this was on a packed night), explaining the history of Kava in a quick, yet super informative way & most importantly, delivering nonstop genuine AMAZING energy.  Crossing paths with people like Sarah is a blessing - she will leave a lasting, super positive effect on you.  You'll just have to go to see what I mean.  And for those of you who own businesses, this is the type of person you'd want at the very top - no understatement.  She's exceptional.  Melo Melo is a great vibe & definitely worth checking out!",

        "ReviewContent": "A friend and I were exploring the area when we stumbled upon Melo Melo. I had been to the one in Berkeley but did not know one had opened in Oakland during the pandemic. What a nice surprise!I am quite familiar with kava, but my friend had never tried it and was interested, so we headed in. The space is long and narrow with a very chill lounge vibe. There's a long bar on one side and some colorful couches along the other side, and lots of lush plants for a relaxing atmosphere.As it was my friend's first time with kava, we had the staff explain a little bit about the kava ritual. The staff was very friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. We were feeling pretty good after our first kava. They have a pretty decent selection of kava mocktails and other drinks, and they all sounded good, so it was difficult to choose, but we followed up that first kava with a kava chai drink with just a little bit of agave (we were able to customize the sweetness level since the drink was being made in front of us). The drink was delicious! I could have easily had another, but we didn't want to fall asleep at the kava bar! We'll be back to try their other mocktails, sipping chocolates, and teas, and more!Did I mention they also have an open mic night, a DJ, and a daily happy hour from noon to 6 p.m. when drinks are buy 2 get 1 free? All of the good things in one place.",

They have an open mic night on Monday - it's amazing ... all kinds of talent - singers, poets, authors, etc. It's a hub of artistic talent and I feel honored to be there.Their drinks are awesome. You can do traditional kava or get something flavored; if you're familiar with the taste of Kava then traditional would be fine! If you're new to Kava or don't like the taste - try one of the infused drinks. They're delicious and you cannot taste the Kava.Please give this place a chance; come contribute to the great vibes!",

I've come here twice now. It's designed very similarly to the Berkeley location, love the (real) plant wall and mood lights at night. And like the Berkeley location, the service is great! Definitely sit at the bar for more interaction and to learn more about kava (how to drink, \"bula\", samples!), otherwise you can sit on the couches for more private conversations. There is outdoor seating at this location, which is great especially if you're not comfortable being indoors. Outside food is allowed. I've heard that fatty foods can intensify the effects, so do with that info as you will. I think there's truth to it! Some folks have reverse tolerance when they have kava, so to feel the effects you may need a lot. They had a Halloween kava drink, I think called Midnight? Or Midnight something, something Midnight? But it tasted like sunshine lol (lemon-lime). So far I've tried the purist, pina colada, ginger, chocolate, and kava dreams (orange creamsicle), the global warrior sipping chocolate and the chameleon kombucha. The colada and kava dreams are my favorite! If you don't like the kava taste you might like these. But for me, the kava isn't all that bad. It does get more earthy/bitter as you get to the bottom of the shell though. You may get a slight tingle/numbness on your tongue. Maybe I'm too used to milk chocolate and sweetened chocolate, but the chocolate drinks I've had didn't taste like much to my taste buds.

        "ReviewContent": "Melo Melo, having been a Berkeley institution since 2015 has finally expanded to Oakland. Their #1 asset--their employees. Among the friendliest, most interesting people you'll meet. A truly positive community of people who want to be your new friends. The kava is always strong and a quality, gotten directly from their sources in various Pacific Islands like Fiji, Samoa, and Vanuatu. For those that don't like the peppery taste of pure kava, they have some delicious kava cocktails to sip on. The kombucha is among the best I've ever had, and the creator behind the magic is often hanging out at the bar here or Berkeley (or the Grand Lake farmers market). Quality CBD drinks, sipping chocolate, and tea provide many options for people who want a local hang without the alcohol and barflies. If it's your first time, they'll hand you a free shell and tell you all about kava. Talk to the manager, Dave, a friendly joker who's always down to have a shell and chat you up. If you're nervous about kava, don't be--they can answer all your questions and are extremely friendly and patient. My favorite spot on Grand to unwind and read, roll some dice with friends, or just enjoy the vibe.",

        "ReviewContent": "I've been OBSESSED with their Berkeley location, and I'm super juiced (pun intended) to see them open near Lake Merit. This place is the chillest place for groups and 1:1 conversation, like a bar but without the hangover. I can't get blackout drunk anymore, it's just not fun. At MeloMelo, I can have a drink or two or five and be chill and remember what  my friends say. This place is exactly what I want in a chill spot: quiet enough to talk, plenty of couch space, and bartenders who remember my name. They're actually the best part of this place: Even if I don't come with my friends, the bartenders make me feel like I'm in someone's living room. They're engaging and know their product, and they'll sit and chat for a hot minute. I can tell they're genuinely happy to be there, which dramatically increases the chillness factor. Logistics: Dogs are allowed, and there's a bunch of them every time I come. Outside food is allowed - they don't serve food here. 18+",
