        "ReviewContent": "Taking the N-Judah out to Ocean Beach, I find myself walking south on the paved walkway along the Great Highway trying to avoid zealous joggers and bicyclists. Not easy given how rude some people like to get. By the time I get to Taraval, I'm ready to make a left and head back into the city.However, before I set off on my journey back, I sometimes make the very first stop available right here. But only after 3PM because that's when they open. It's a surprisingly large space for a tavern, but the wood paneling, brick fireplace sometimes with a roaring fire, and overall old timey vibe make it feel cozier.I'm usually on the early side, so it was just me and the lone bartender. I've ordered the $12 Mama P's Shaken Pina Colada which always surprises me to see a tiki drink way out on the edge of the Sunset (photo: https://yelp.to/b7CA2mNjqu). It's a mix of Malibu coconut rum, cream, and pineapple juice shaken and served over ice. Simple but quite tasty even on a brisk day.Recently I took advantage of their holiday menu and ordered the reassuring $12 Nutty Hot Chocolate with Baileys and Frangelico (photo: https://yelp.to/TuOAbfOK3M). My one takeaway here is that it's definitely a locals' hangout, so when they trickled in, I felt very much the outsider. If I came later for an event, I would think that might offset that isolated feeling.DRINKS - 4 stars...not the best tiki cocktail I've had but I like that they make itAMBIANCE - 4 stars...cozy, vintage feel offset by the exclusivity vibe from the regularsSERVICE - 4.5 stars...the bartender is always cordialTOTAL - 4 stars...a nice find way out westRELATED - Exploring the Sunset?

The bingo host is hella fun and they provide jello shots when calling 69 on bingo. It is dog friendly and you can bring pizza in from next door. The prize box is magical too if you win, but I cannot let the secret out. You have to go and find out for yourself.",

We considered staying to play, but had a date with dumplings in our tracks :pThere were a few doggos in the bar, including one who had their own seat at the bar and was maybe the cutest thing I've seen all week (:The seats at the bar had one hook per seat to hang a jacket or bag (big plus/thoughtful consideration in my mind).Seems like plenty of events throughout the month (posted some photos of flyers hanging on walls as of 11/11/23). Bartender was friendly & efficient, with a good memory. Fun lil neighborhood watering hole! We'll def be back for bingo the next Saturday we catch a sunset at Ocean Beach.",

However, they are doing cocktails to go and have outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is built as a parklet, which I'm always a little skeptical about because cars are still zooming by. However, on Taravel where The Riptide is, the street is closed so no worries about a car zooming by. But I still wasn't too comfortable with their outdoor seating arrangement. They have walls on 3 sides of their parklet and a roof meaning less airflow. I imagine it being because they're in the Outer Sunset and well it's cold there! But the tables overall were spaced out well and it looks like they have a smokers area too. So we decided to pay with Apple Pay and grabbed our cocktails to go and walked 2 blocks down to the beach and enjoyed the evening. The cocktails were either strong or I haven't had a cocktail in a while (likely the second). But well-priced. Service was at a window and she was super kind and didn't rush us at all. Would come back.",

Their outdoor setup is safe yet cozy with its views of Ocean Beach's dunes. Prices are fair and staff are friendly. Tunes are playing over a sound system. It almost felt normal!

This was the second Monday, last Monday having played the Botanical Garden Piano event, a group of people I just met went there after. It was a blast. Charles, who leads the event, is the most helpful. I had an issue with the connector to my instrument, the iPhone. Honestly, I have no idea how I sound to others. I am usually nervous. It started at 8:30. A line forms in the middle of the room silently. You write your name in the book and you have 2 songs or ten minutes. Molly serves the booze. Every type of music gets sung/played. All skill sets. Everyone is friendly. If as one person said, she waited and waited, think of it as a blessing. You didn't have to pay. You got to take in the atmosphere free of charge. There is a therapy in waiting. Sometimes a bar is a form of therapy. Enjoy your life. Don't take yourself so seriously.I got to play my music, which I think is an addiction, and people were paying for drinks, and listening. Two people were nice enough to say nice things. What more can a person ask? I only have good things to say about The Riptide. \"Can I pull out now?\"",

She kind of looked off and mumbled something to the bar-back. The bar-back saw me. Said nothing to the bartender. There was no one else waiting for a drink and only a few folks seated at the bar. She leapt up to serve a couple who approached the bar a few minutes after me. I thought, there's no way and no reason she shouldn't serve me. She must have... not seen me? Tried to give her the benefit of the doubt. But an older gentleman seated across the bar saw me. We made eye contact. I shrugged and smiled. He waved the bartender over, whispered something and pointed toward me. She said something back to him. Slowly turns with a hard eye roll that I couldn't miss, and drags her feet over to me. She approached me in a way that assured me she knew I was there the whole time. I ordered for the group of volunteers I invited to the bar who were seated at the table. I won't go into the details of how she took my drink order. I'm really puzzled. Was it the way I was dressed? Too formal? Ms. Bartender, I was respectful to you. I didn't wave you down. I paid and tipped. I live in the sunset and I will never invite friends to join me at Riptide as long as you're serving there. Usually don't write these things, but as a local and someone who's never been so poorly served and welcomed into an establishment, had to write this for others.",

The bathrooms are about as clean as you could hope, and everyone is surly in that wonderfully dive bar way.

The owners, Les and David, have done an outstanding job bringing back the homey, nostalgic feel of the original Riptide while adding some updates. The fireplace survived and is still a great place to cozy up when Karl the Fog is out and about. The drinks are cheap and generous. There is usually a special going on, and themed events like Bingo (the BEST) and karaoke (the WORST...in a good way). If you make it out the Western Edge of the World (aka the Sunset), make sure to add a stop at The Riptide!",

Thank goodness that the owners were able to raise the funds to rebuild - it's so good to have it back.The best part about the riptide is that it is totally un assuming.  You can be anyone, be going for any reason, and feel at home here. Yes, there are hipsters, yes there are surfers, yes there are punk people, yes there are old men, yes there are your classic day drinkers, yes there are students, yes there are nerds - really - you do fit in here.Other things about the riptide that are great:- They serve free food during their happy hour (5-7 weekdays). No it's not fancy. But really, who doesn't love chips with nacho cheese sauce out of a crock pot?- The beer is not $8 or $10 a pint. I think it's like $6 for a Lagunitas.- They have both light beer and craft beer. Again - you DO fit in here.- They have a fireplace. Yes, you heard me right - a fireplace. And no, not a fake one - the real kind that you put wood on. And yes, you can sit next to it.- They have a TV and you will find your local sports fan friends there at the appropriate moments.Cons:- uh there really aren't many- It's too clean since the remodel?- Verizon doesn't get good service inside? (this might actually be a pro - who wants to get a phone call while enjoying happy hour anyways?)- It's kinda small? Love the Riptide.",

The bar staff is pretty and accommodating if you're new to the joint like we were and aren't quite sure where to situate yourself when there are no tables left.

(PS I waited 5 minutes standing at the uncrowded bar while she was texting someone)  She glared at me and literally barked \"As long as you clean up after yourselves\" and kept glaring at me.  She was so hostile that the people sitting at the bar looked up in shock.  I was in shock myself and to keep from saying \"Well, you know it is hard for me to clean up after myself or even eat in public especially since I'm only 35 years old...\" I just paused and laughed uncomfortably.  WTF.  Meanwhile there was a nasty little table with cold cuts and bread that people could eat that they had to dip their hands in.

When my sister said we were leaving, the bartender called bullshit and said 'you've been sitting here all night, you're not leaving.' And so we drew really bad Jasper Johns and Andrew Wyeth knock offs to comply with the 'American modern artists after 1920' sketch contest rule that night. This bar is really fun.

It's near the ocean side of San Francisco, so I got super lucky, and it was insanely easy to find parking... unlike in the Sunset... or some other crazy part of town. If you look over yonder, you can see Ocean Beach! Wooooooooo.I was excepting... well... divey... but this. This place is homey; yes it's small (there are two parts to the bar which is divided by... well the bar), but even when it was a little crowded, it didn't feel that bad. The only thing I felt bad for were the dogs people were bringing into the bar... like people please... dogs? In a bar? Where they're at ground level and drunk people can't see and step on them? :/ Poor doggies... plus it's loud and kind of rowdy... so I imagine them getting kicked around a little bit.Drinks are cheap, but I didn't come here for drinks that night. I came here... for BINGO. Bingo, you say? The old people's game? No. This bingo is awesome bingo. Riptide does Bingo on Saturday nights at 6 pm. We were late, so we only got to play the last round out of three total rounds (come early because sometimes the rounds finish quickly), but it was still awesomely fun. It was a blackout round, so you had to blackout all the squares. The emcee was hilarious (pretty sure he made the game); drinking with the patrons, telling funny jokes, and he was super nice and let us play the last round.Here's the thing about this bingo. Everytime they get the O69 ball... EVERYONE and I mean EVERYONE who is playing the game, gets a free jello shot! How's that for advertising. Makes the game pretty fun and everyone's obviously in a great mood.Love the decor, there's carpet in some places... which seems like it would get really gross, but it wasn't, there's a random fireplace too in the back! Seemed to have enough space for the people in the bar... and I didn't feel too claustrophobic inside.Definitely on my list to make it back to. So much fun! Oh also, don't forget. This place is cash only! So bring moola!",

In fact the crowd was soo nice there I had people buying me drinks.  The bartenders are great , no matter how loud it gets it seems like they can hear what you requested without you even having to yell and no matter how busy it gets they give you excellent service. It was packed and I didn't have a hard time ordering my drinks at all.  The karaoke gets pretty happening here on tuesdays. Theres a nice variety of people in here. No clicky types , everyone seems to make me feel welcome. There seems to be a big college crowd here. I also find it to be a great place to watch the game. gotta check out the drink specials from 4-7, but they also have specials for the certain days of the week that last all night too.

We live in Fort Bragg CA and only get to San Francisco a couple times a year.  But the bartenders ALWAYS remember our preferred drinks and our names.  Week nights they often have \"Happy Hour\" food.  But you can always bring a snack of your own.  Well stocked bar and they know how to make a martini.  I would recommend the \"Bacon Bloody Mary\"served in a pint jar with bacon bits on the rim... Miss Jean makes a mean one on Sundays, and since I prefer Gin over vodka, she is happy to make the change and never questions me.  If we have our dog \"Miss Dixie Dalmatian\" with us, she always gets a strip of bacon herself.  Some nights they have events that are always fun.  But any day is a good day at the Riptide.",

Drinks are strong, staff is friendly, and they usually have *FREE* nachos or hot dogs (eat at your own risk, but I've never had a bad experience) to soak up some of the strong drinks you'll most likely be sappin' on during the queue for Karaoke. Oftentimes there's live music and the spot has a homey kind of feeling to it: a bunch of people who know each other, or you're with someone who knows other people, or you're a stranger and go to bars alone, either way, you will likely be able to find someone who will converse with you.",

They were welcoming, not judgmental, as I was- for sure -the ONLY Asian in this place, and just down right a fun bunch of people.What other place gives you free Jell-O shots during Bingo when the coveted O-69 gets called?

A winner from each round wins a prize. The last round's reward is a $50 bar tab, which I think it very worth it if you win it. The entire bar gets excited as the rounds progress. Everyone also gets a free Jell-O shot if O69 is called. Unfortunately, none of us won anything that night, but I still had fun playing and chatting with my friends!

The general ambience reminds me of the random, divey country bars I've been to in the Central Valley and the infamous Elkhorn in San Miguel, but that's probably what I love most about this place.  It embraces the divey-ness without being one of those sticky-floored, dingy, crusty dive bars, and that's what makes this place truly great.

The PBR flows in golden showers amidst rivulets of cheap whiskey, the bartenders have a few miles under their eyes, and the karaoke options include vaguely racist David Bowie songs.*  I can't wait to go back.*I don't condone racism, and the staff is in no way racist, but hearing someone drunkenly belt out \"China Doll\" is a sight to see.",

As you enter and leave you can smell the salt water in the air. Bliss.The Riptide's bartender are unbelievably on top of things.The whole time I was here  - their main lovely bartender made sure that my water was constantly refilled (despite there being a self pour station). Each time he - added fresh wedges of lemon as well. So refreshing! It was open mic night and from the moment I entered - everyone at Riptide was kind. The older Irish gentleman sitting next to me at the bar had such a warm demeanor. He talked lovingly about his grown children. All of Riptide was bubbling with kind-eyed regulars - many of whom were there for the open-mic. Everyone was supportive of all of the musicians and just happy to be out and surrounded by friendly faces. My long walk to the beach was so well rewarded by an epic evening here - full of the nicest and most personable bar regulars and staff around. I can't wait to spend more epic evenings here.Trust.",

Some were amazingly good, others less so... but all were entertaining. I really meant to find out the name of the mother/daughter duet duo. They were incredible!The bartenders were on it and the place was soon filled.

A jazz quartet was setting up, and we found 1 stool for the old broad (me) and ordered drinks from the calm, efficient bartender, who was holding down the fort all by himself.  Drinks were very strong, well made, properly garnished, delivered with alacrity and a polite nod.  This bartender was so good, all he needed was eye contact to start another round.  There was a big table of boisterous ladies with their dog, folks were dancing to the great band, and much merry was made.  The one sad texter sitting next to me made a number of trips to the bathroom, drank a beer, and left, texting, fairly soon, delivering up another stool.  We spent a happy Sunday night at what I think is the best neighborhood bar I have ever had the pleasure of drinking in; and I've been drinking legally for 42 years.",

        "ReviewContent": "I came here the Friday of Halloween weekend with three friends. Let me just say that the last time I was here, it was a Wednesday afternoon and I was one of 6 people in the place. Not so exciting. Fast forward to my last visit: We walk in at midnight--my friend just turned legal--costumes and all. The place was PACKED! So much life and noise! Deeefinitely a different picture than scenario #1. The bartender pulls out a full-page menu of special Halloween drinks, and we get on with business. (Which by the way packed a strong backward punch in me at the end of the night. Strong drinks indeed.)A little while later, we're posted up right at the bar, and everyone's throwing me compliments on my costume and wanting a picture. I'm not trying to gloat/brag/whatever you will, my point is that the crowd here is very friendly, sociable, approachable, amicable, I can keep going...It was a very comfortable alternative to our next night at a gay bar in the Castro where the same costume returned absolutely no compliments or photo requests, only questionable and/or judging looks that l understood only as \"What the eff are YOU?\" (Feel free to sue me for wearing the same thing two nights in a row. It was indeed a superb costume, and I was on a budget.)To sum up, The Riptide is the place to go if you want a fun crowd to surround your entourage, if you need an upbeat place to party solo after a bad breakup/shitty week, and the music is great. Not to mention the drinks are relatively inexpensive. The ATM was giving me some trouble, though, so bring cash before you go on your way.And for those that are wondering, I was Slash.",

        "ReviewContent": "As someone else wrote, it has good nights and it has bad nights. The dichotomy causes a tension that has motivated me to write this. Bad nights are when the bar is overcrowded with people barely legal, or when its so full of hipsters acting unwarrantedly elusive that you eat one of the Tides free hotdogs so you dont throw up from laughing. Curt waitresses most of the time. The boys/men are a little better at customer service. The glasses are filthy often: someone else's debri encrusted lip marks on that nice fresh Riptide Red you've been jonesing for all day and now, its sudsess-interuptus. Insanely unwarranted unfriendly pretention is sadly the 'Tides social benchmark, and yet the fireplace, surfer movies, wednesday's 7-11 quality nachos, and the days when there's a free table to write keeps the Riptide in the debate of \"to be or not to be\" in Sunset bars. Hipsters take note: The ironic thing about Irony is that it is self originating, it cannot be artificed. For a friendlier, more down to earth bar, with its own dirty glasses but a beef stew to die for go up the street to 4 Deuces. Just avoid the Irish activity nights if you dont have an accent...their picky about that stuff, and I dont blame them. No pretense except cocky young male stuff.",

I digress.... Myself and 4 of my friends were at Riptide on 3/26/11 for late night drinks we made it just before last call  5beers nice tip though thru the whole process of ordering this petite brunette bartender acted as if we were the biggest inconvenience. We proceed to sit at a table and chat amongst ourselves which would have been much easier if Suzy Happy Pants wasn't hurling bottle after bottle into the recycling bin with such force it was ear piercing.  Last call is given, not even 7 minutes after she is at the table saying drink up let's go and literally grabbed the drink out of one of my friends hand.  Idiot!!! 5 Industry folks that will never go back and live in the hood!! Nobody killed your Damn Puppy!! Oh wait it gets better last night April 2 Gave it another shot heard there was a great band, and yes they were Fantastic!! People are hootin hollering and WHISTLING!! Yes little miss Brunette Bartender if you are reading this you know all about the whistling.  My friend was asked to leave the bar for whistling....??, yes I know my friend occasionally can be a pain in the ass. Tonight was not one of those nights, crowd was happy everyone getting along older crowd etc. etc.  Okay so he leaves does not put up a fight. He took the fall for myself and another woman who were showing a few individuals how we learned to whistle when we were kids.  Okay probably sounds pretty lame but that is the story.  The bouncer was going to pop a vein still talking about this with Suzy Happy Pants.  She makes eye contact with me so I tried to explain that my friend was not to blame and try to tell her the lame story....  Her ever so shitty rude response was well you better give me your drink and get out of the bar as well.  Again, I digress....Dearest Owner,That little bartender should be let go in this case, the biggest gripes from your yelp reviews are service.  Whether you are dive bar in the Sunset or the Ritz our money pays your lease, labor, inventory, insurance etc.  Having a bitchy mean girl such as that in your employ is outlandish.

I really  liked Bingo Saturdays, with a good friendly crowd that was there to chill and play with a beer.  Then I started noticing more and more people coming to Saturday Bingo, and I thought, ok, that's cool, you know, bigger bingo pot, more energy.  Then I noticed that many of the new people were rude, annoying, with drunk ex frat boys and hipsters or hipster wannabes to boot. Honestly, after this last Saturday, I think I'm going to take a break from Riptide. This Saturday reminded me of those annoying bars in the Mission and in the Haight that are super pretentious and where irony is a fashion requirement.  I know that this Saturday crowd swell may be good for the Riptide in the short run  in terms of income, but they could end up loosing some loyal customers who go there to chill, have a beer, and play the occasional game of bingo.",

I had three small nicks on me from the glass, two of them on my face with a little dot of blood and no means of proper first aid.  Being that I am a calm person I didn't make a big deal out of it but I thought the situation was handled poorly.  Of course I am grateful that all I had was a few tiny nicks, but it could have been a lot worse.  They should hire a bouncer and they should have shut down the bar for the evening.

        "ReviewContent": "Oh, the Riptide. I love this place just as much as I hate it. I've spent many nights here enthralled by the drunken debauchery of the Sunset. It's one of the only bars in the neighborhood with cheap beer and decent music. I used to live down the street so it was easy to access if we decided last minute to head out for drinks. It helps that the L drops you off right in front and a cab ride back home used to be about $5 (if a cab is willing to even pick you up down there). It's a block from the beach so drunken walks to the sand are inevitable. However, I will advise that if you have never been before and you are not in the area don't make the trek over.They have beer specials and my favorite is Thursday night, Ladies Night. That's when all the crazies come out and the place is just packed. Needless to say there are very few ladies on Ladies Night so beware! They also have trivia nights, DJ's and bands playing from time to time. The crowd ranges from young college students, to locals and then really creepy men. I've had a few unfavorable encounters, actually I think everyone I know that has been there has had a few unfavorable encounters.I've come to the conclusion that you already need to be a few drinks in before heading to the Riptide otherwise you are just going to be disappointed. They also have happy hour but the Riptide during the day loses its charm mostly due to the fact that the crowd is tame and you can see the floors. It's a fun local spot and I'm grateful that the Tide has always been there for me on cold, foggy, lonely nights.To sum it up, the Riptide is a local dive bar located deep in the heart of the Sunset; You never know what your gonna get.",

Basically, bros who have decided to pretend to be hipsters (without giving up their baseball caps or bench-presses) going to hit on girls who walked into Forever 21 looking for anything they could get their hands on with black and white horizontal stripes. Which is fine, but my friend and I felt really out of place. It's okay. Earlier in the evening (like, before 11:15, before it got really crowded) it was actually pretty good. Oh, also, watch out for the creepy older men. Really, it's high school with a creepy faculty.",

It's an OK place, with OK drinks, and pretty terrible service. They have live music here, not to my taste but to each their own. I do not generally like to give a bad review, but because the service here has sucked on more than one occasion, I had to voice my opinion. There was a particular time that my friends and I waited for 25 minutes to get the bar tenders attention, actually I should say for her to take our order not because it was crowded or  busy, but because she was talking to a friend. She acknowledged our presence and continued to chat away. When we finally did order the drinks they were not made right. There is no shame in saying \"I am not sure how to make that\", but there is something wrong about serving drinks that don't taste right. If you are coming here for a beer I guess it's an alright neighborhood spot, but for anything else I do not recommend it. We have not been here for a while and have no intention of coming back any time soon.",

The 'Tide is a good divey bar with alot of cool crap on the walls and the coldest beer in town. They have a different event every night of the week. The most popular is \"Ladies Night\" on Thursdays. Ask any girl that's been there about the free shot at midnight. Looks spectacular! They also have bingo, surf movie night, and open mic night. Live music acts and DJ's occasionally play as well.I've had many good, drunken times at this bar. Too good of a drunken time more often than not.  Not much more you can ask for. The owner is often there, and works hard to keep it a good place. He is also a great guy, so go up to him and say hello.

        "ReviewContent": "Another cool bar ruined by DJs.OK bar owners, music is great. Music adds to the atmosphere, and I *want* music in my bar. I also go to bars to talk to people. When the music is SO LOUD that I have to YELL to talk to the person I'm with, it ruins the atmosphere. It also makes me take my money elsewhere.Last night (10/1/09) was a *perfect* example.  A guy was playing some really cool music. However, he just kept turning it up louder and louder. About halfway through my first (and only) beer, I decided to move to the side room - but there was a speaker in there too. There wasn't a single place in the bar to escape. This place could be the ultimate neighborhood bar. Now it's just another hipster hangout with overpowering ironic music. Puke.And DJs. Your giant stack of old vinyl records looks all sorts of cool next to the fixie you can't ride, but worn out records *sound like shit*. Mmmmkay? Some of the stuff you were playing last night was so worn out it was unlistenable. If it had been something that was only available on ancient, thrashed records, it *might* have been excusable. What you were playing was good, but it wasn't rare enough to *require* you to play old, shitty, worn out copies of that record. Take some damn pride in your music collection (and by \"pride\" I mean quality of the actual recording). And point the fucking speakers at your head so you have *some* clue as to how loud it is.",

Whatever.Don't come to the riptide if you want some sort of scene. Come here to drink and be nice. And you can bring your dog. Monday night open mic has the best guy on piano doing Queen songs, you've gotta check him out. I think I tried to flirt with him in front of my boyfriend. Anyway. Love the jukebox, sometimes they'll even load some free tunes for you if you ask. Most of the bartenders are great, you know, relaxed, nice. There's a bitchy girl or two, but I assume they'll leave eventually and get a job at Delfina or something.Although there's been an influx of lame lately (customer-wise), Riptide will always be special to me! Once again, if you're looking for more than a place with beer where you can hang out with your friends, you should probably look elsewhere. If you want a dive bar, you've found it.",

The other women there definitely don't. There's a fireplace, too, which is cool, even if they do light the fire during Save the Air fire prohibitions.I also like the Riptide because it is the only San Francisco bar I can go to that when I tell people I live in Pacifica, they don't look at me like Pacifica is somewhere just south of Guam.

Tonight, I came home to a dark block and dark house.  Remembering that the closest bar is the Riptide (and I have never been there), I eagerly went to go have a drink and wait out PG&E.  Plus I've been meaning to try this place out for a year or so, since moving into the much less bar-dense Sunset.  Maybe nice to get drunk less than a $30 cab ride from home once in a while, right? Once inside, I noticed that it is very similar, but smaller, in layout  as the Uptown on 17th and Capp.  Wraparound bar, but smaller main room and no pool table.  There was a dub DJ playing in one corner.  I stood at the bar, trying to decide what I wanted.  The bartender didn't look at me.  Not, she didn't look at me until she was ready for my order; She never looked at me once the 5 minutes I stood at the bar.  Literally in front of her.  I tried to make eye contact.  Nothing.  She wasn't that busy.  I myself am a bartender and am very understanding when it comes to waiting one's turn.  I also hate it when I am obviously busy and some A-hole comes in and thinks that they are the only one waiting.  However there was nothing.  Three of four minutes after I'd been standing at the bar, literally in front of her (no \"hi\" or \"give me a sec\" or \"I'll be right with you\".  Just nothing.  Then a  dude came up to the bar next to me.  \"What are you havin honey,\" she asked, and served him a beer.  Thats cool.  Then another dude comes up to the other side of me and she serves him.  I look at her, she doesn't look at me.  Maybe I smelled bad, I don't know. Suddenly I realized I don't want to be at the Riptide,  and I say F-it and go home.  Screw you riptide, PG&E was done, my lights are on, and I'm not coming back.  So now I am going to have to go on the hunt for a nice, friendly, sunset bar.  Sweet!",

A juke box with a pretty swell variety of cuts. There was a Thursday night about a year ago that included cut up hot dogs in water in a crock pot. Apparently they do free bar food. By 1am it doesn't look too bad with some relish.The bartender didn't know how to make a Mexican Martini (proper noun, not racial slur!), but put together a pretty decent margarita with top shelf tequila on the house when I carried the boot around for the DJ, to encourage tipping.

In the last two visits,  I had one bartender  shortchange me and another was swiping  / palming any and all money off the bar as a \"tip\" I suppose, including the money I was going to use to buy my next drink. . My money was near the edge of the customer side of the side of the bar next to my drink. The bartender comes by, takes my next drink order, takes away the old glass, swipes my Five and then asks for the money when she delivers the drink.  Twice in a row here...a little bit shady.",

I feel like people love this place because its one of the few bars out that far.  Its filled with surfers, people who like surfers, people who like the beach and people who don't want to live close to town.  (I feel weird saying \"town\" but there you have it.)  I don't surf, I didn't grow up in a surfing culture and the beach to me is hanging at the Jersey boardwalk so yeah, its not my scene.  HOWEVER, the vibe is friendly and I do enjoy their Beach Chalet beers on tap but its small, reminds me of a bar I would find located next to Mo'Bags in Mt. Olive, New Jersey.  I should note Mo'Bags is in a strip mall.  Its definitely a neighborhood bar which is why it probably gets 3 stars, because its not in my neighborhood and I'm not willing to drive or take public transit down.  I pass too many other places I would rather hang out at.If one does live in the neighborhood I can see the appeal; movies projected up on the wall and free food sometimes.   If you live out there and haven't checked it out, definitely stop by OR if you surf in the area its a must stop.  Otherwise, eh.",

The bands tend toward Americana, including bluegrass, country, etc, and did I mention the music is always free? My favorite country band, Red Meat plays occassionally to a packed house. One side of the bar is perfect for watching the band and the other for hanging with your friends at authentic driftwood tables. The decor is funky nautical, of course. Ocean Beach is only a block away and they have a killer 4th of July bar-b-que!  The majority of the bar staff are adorably cute girls who seem to be having a great time.

If you live in the outer sunset and you and you can't handle the trek to the mission or lower haight then I say the Riptide is the place to be.I love the moose head and the wood cut tables too.

Jeff the bartender was super sweet and gave me a free beer for my bday!  his other drinks were strong and the red-headed-slut was fantastic. he was even a gentleman when our drunk as a skunk friend hit the table and knocked over 5 glasses which he had to clean up, despite our attempts to do so. then he was even more gentleman-ly when i accidentally knocked a glass out of my friends hand (i still think it was partly his fault..) thanks jeff!! wet wednesdays were cool, old surf movies and a fireplace, plus a piano, dj, and plenty of boardgames. and clean bathrooms!! high five. ill def be back :)",

It is just not the sort of instrument that should be played out of its traditional form, which does not include wires or plugs. I certainly did not think I would find myself in the midst of one at a bar that I fondly remember as the Sand Bar, a drug den and downtrodden stomping ground settled on the edge of civilization in the Sunset. However, this is no longer the Sand Bar. It is now the Riptide and instead of witnessing a deal going down or a brawl ready to erupt by the fireplace tucked in the back you have to stand back a bit and listen to someone bastardize music in a venue much too small for even a good musician to play. The decor has cleaned up since the days of the Sand Bar as has the clientele. The drinks are a fair price and the service is efficient. The majority of the drinkers here look to be a nice mix of semi-wholesome boozers who come here because there really isn't anything else around. I wonder what happened to the shady characters who used to come here.....I would pay them double the price of whatever they were slinging to take care of the guy with the uke.",

Fortunately for me my dog is strong enough to carry me and smart enough to know how to get home.  So no matter what happens after my 17th cocktail I know I will arrive safe and sound.

We eventually sidled up to the bar and got our drink orders in and when I handed her my credit card she quickly replied with \"You're from LA, huh?\" Apparently they don't take credit cards and the LA kids who come up for a visit always slap down the plastic when it comes to gettin plastered. Luckily I had cash on me because I was vacationing and we were shocked when our cocktail and beer added up to a grand total of 12 bucks. That's unheard of in LA!We continued our drinking by ordering up a couple carbombs which were the best value of the trip at $10 for both. Sweet.

The crowd was pretty freakin' cool too- hipsters mixed in with other regulars and everyone was getting along (could be the strong drinks). yah- apparently there are hipsters in the outer sunset- who knew. Probably a result of some porkbarrel diversity program spending that requires hipsters to be bussed out from Zeitgeist and Casanovas to other, less skinny-jeans wearing neighborhoods (read: outer sunset)I think I may have found a dive bar/future home of Tim V winner..... time to start getting old, who's gonna help me with being crotchety?

Throw in the wooden ship wheel decor, the neat double-sided bar, the trashy drink specials posted on the wall, the Beach Chalet's very own Riptide Red on tap, and a live band with harmonica that gets the place surprisingly packed with a lively but laid-back crowd from who-knows-where, and we might just have a winner in my search for a local bar (never mind that this is technically farther from my house than most places in the Mission--it's (extremely) west side and that's what counts).",

I must have missed the sarcasm in the singer's voice. I think I must give this Riptide another visit.******************************************************************This bar is WAY the heck out there... but it's still in the San Francisco city limits, right? Cuz from the look and sound of this place, I think I'm back in Oklahoma:1) There is a live country band. 2) The country band dedicated a song to all the \"born-again Christians\" in the crowd.3) The chorus from that song goes: \"Me and my best friend, Jesus.\"4) There is a dead mammal hanging on the wall.However, I must say that the beer selection is much better than most Oklahoma bars. The Riptide also had plenty of tequila. I mean, with that country music playing,... what am I supposed to do? WHAT WOULD MY BEST FRIEND JESUS DO?",

When the (sweet Alicia) bartender whisked me up during the DJ's offering of  \"Rio\" - I felt as if I could fall backwards into the lively crowd of 80's fans and be body bounced about ever so gently. Somehow I stayed on the bar, \"dancing on the sand\" with Durran Durran. A girlfriend had previously turned me onto the \"skinny bitch\" - Vodka and Diet Coke. This was my drink of choice in which I found pleasure in ordering and hearing myself do so. So, I ordered a few rounds for friends who then became hooked on the strangely good concoction.I was at the Riptide back in November of '04 - the day it \"snowed\" in San Francisco.  As a Michigan native, I found it funny to hear the \"hail\" called snow, but made no effort to correct people who so clearly were beyond thrilled. Anyhow - a photo of this day hangs on the wall at this bar, reminding me how long I have been boozing it up at this fun little quirky outer sunset neighborhood spot.

When it was reborn as The Riptide, I approached the front door fearing the worst...that of a tragic remodel involving sheet-rock walls, cheesy neon lamps, and a tolling of the bell for yet another neighborhood watering hole.\r Thankfully, The Riptide's new owners didn't ruin the place.  To the contrary, they've performed the delicate balancing act of cleaning up a decomposing neighborhood bar while leaving it's rustic charm largely intact.  The result is a place that's changed for the better.  Years of filth have been scoured away, and decrepit timbers have been replaced. But still, the hearty soul of a meeting place with history  remains.\r A central bar sits in the middle of the room, with most of the seating on the West side.  TV's for sports are small, but decently placed.  Limited wood on the walls along with a brick fireplace help create a humble ambiance with a rough-cut charm.  It's an overall feel that no cut-and-gut remodel with new materials and contemporary styling could ever duplicate.  \r The mid-day/after-work crowd is an odd mix: An easy-going group of young surfers  and a smaller segment of old-guard codgers.  Later at night the clientele gets younger as the beach crowd trickles in and the music gets turned up.\r All in all, I like it.  It's a friendly mix of young and old where the two actually interact.  And while the night crowd gets a little young and noisy for my tastes, I could really see liking it when I was in my twenties. It's out of the way, it's near the beach, and there's a pizza place two doors down.  I've came, I've seen, I'll be back....",

        "ReviewContent": "So disappointed b/c I had such high hopes.  Our first time there, we loved it-- the fireplace, the feeling of being in a Northwoods bar.  But, the second trip there ruined it for me.  We had the whole family from Madison in town to visit.  On our drive along the oceanside, we stopped off at Riptide for a beer during the afternoon, and they kicked us out because we had a kid with us.  We weren't buying her beer-- we bought her a coke and planned to play cards in the middle of the afternoon. Instead, the bartender demanded she show ID, even though she was with both her parents, and then made her wait outside while the beers that he had already tapped were drunk.  Some chronic at the bar chimed in with, \"you should've charged them double for smuggling in a child.\"  Turns out the Northwoods look of the place is just that.",

        "ReviewContent": "When I sauntered into this extreme Outer Sunset bar I was welcomed by a warm presence of locals and a roaring fire.  I then realized I think I have found my favorite San Francisco bar, and one close to my house.  Located right off the MUNI L and at the cusp of the Pacific Ocean, the Riptide offers cheap drinks, Guinness on tap and a plethora of music options ranging from alt-country to bluegrass.  They have happy hour specials throughout the week, but the special thing about this place is the remodeling job that brought the true character out including knotty pine walls and the lodgey northwoods feel.  For a truly honest drink poured by friendly bartenders and surrounded by locals, stop into the Riptide.",

Rustic seafarer's pub meets knarly surfer dood saloon.  Cool fireplace, cheap drinks, good pizza next door, board games, friendly staff and customers, good eye candy, ample parking in front, live music and free food. Not a pretentious post-greek Marina a-hole for miles.  Good all around.",

No, we didn't stop at a liquor store on the way to a bonfire on Ocean Beach- we were hanging out indoors at this bar.  They actually have sticks for roasting things by the fireplace, and on Wednesdays they're providing sausages and shish kabobs!  And it's right next to an L stop.  Need I say more?",

I arrived on open mic night to find a fifty year old man playing cover tunes on his electric keyboard. This was followed by two guys playing punk covers of Neil Diamond songs. Wow. They have their own brand of Riptide Red Ale. The owners and bartenders are super friendly. The Riptide rocks. Live Music 2 nights a week.",
