The Starry Plough,"Jan 17, 2024","Food , service , ambience , history , rebellious sacred duty , this place carries all that within it's walls . Go there . Experience it ."
The Starry Plough,"Mar 8, 2024","I would not be writing this if I hadn't JUST received a denial of a refund for an event I had to cancel my ticket on back in OCTOBER!  I bought the ticket on October 21, 2023, and I requested the refund on the day of the event due to illness, which was October 27, 2023.  Today is MARCH 8, 2024!!!  I finally got an email saying, ""Sorry but we paid the band before this request was made.""  So you paid the band on the morning of the event?  I would hope you'd have paid them by the end of the night, at the very least, but to email me at this point and give me this load of BS is inexcusable.  I figured out back in November that I wasn't getting a refund, thanks for that.  Why bother at this point?  My health is still in decline months later, so I sure didn't need the reminder that I missed yet another event thanks to long COVID!  I think I've said all I can say without the review being taken down for use of profanity, so in closing, even if I could travel to Berkeley, I'd skip The Starry Plough.  It's far too cramped and the restrooms are horrendous, anyway.Here's the email I received, copied and pasted:Your refund request has been declined.Message from Starry Plough:""Sorry but we paid the band before this request was made.""Event: Tempest's 35th Anniversary and ReunionOrder #: 8105424159Refund Request #: 15873999Contact the organizer if you have any questions or view this order"
The Starry Plough,"Nov 27, 2023",My second time here for a live performance and it sure was lively. The stage is amazing and sound quality is too. Little light on the bartenders but service was good.
The Starry Plough,"Mar 28, 2023","I have been to The Starry Plough Pub during several Saint Patrick's Day Celebrations. This is an Irish bar with reasonable prices (for this day and age). I was able to find a dry cider--yum!What a celebration this 2023 Saint Paytrick Day was!!! It was standing room only. They had Irish bands, Irish dancers, and it was an open mike for singing Irish songs.They offer foods like Corned Beef and Cabbage, Fish and Chips, and Bacon Cheseburger, but we had dinner before going there. They looked good, though.The Starry Plough is a hangout for Irish and Irish wanna bes. They have live music, Irish music, and even Irish dancing."
The Starry Plough,"Nov 12, 2022","Came on a poetry slam night with a date! Cute ambiance and tasty ciders for fair prices. The fries were a really good snack to munch on. Fairly big place, and really good service:) Would come again!"
The Starry Plough,"Aug 22, 2022",Got the fish and garlic chips. Tried the fries years ago and thought they were incredible and they still hold up.
The Starry Plough,"Apr 10, 2023",Love this place up down and sideways. Such an institution. Great food and drinks. Old school ownership. Great people!
The Starry Plough,"Jan 23, 2023","Starry Plough is a great local Irish Pub. It's got beer, cider, burgers, stew and desserts and they are all good. There's Irish music Sunday, Irish dance with lessons for begginers on Monday, Poetry Slam and other stuff other days. Well worth going to just sit and socialize as well."
The Starry Plough,"Oct 23, 2019","The Starry Plough is a good neighborhood bar with great fries, but the set up for events and other food can be a bit meh.I came in on a Wednesday night for a veggie burger from my nearby hotel and had no idea where to order or how things worked since it was more of a bar than a place to eat. Thankfully a very friendly bartender saw my bewilderment and helped me out by directing me to the far counter with the register where I could order. There was a hockey game on TV and I think background music. The Irish was all over the walls and other than bar seating, there were a few tables and chairs.My food came out pretty quick, but I was the first to order before a ton of people showed up for the poetry slam later on and they looked like they had a wait. The veggie burger was black bean and I think quinoa based, but had so much jalapeno in it I found it mostly inedible (was pretty hungry so I had just a small amount of patty and lots of bread, leaving 3/4 of the patty on the plate). The fries were on-point! Loved the crisp, skin on fries, but didn't appreciate the dregs of the bag being included (little strips of fried potato skin). While the poetry slam was advertised for 8pm, which I waited for and then passed, it still hadn't started by 8:35 and I gave up. The lady in front collecting funds noted they should have started already, as 8:30 is more typical but I had to get going with my night and the organizer was not looking like it was going to get started for a bit despite expectation setting with announcements. They had placed a bunch of chairs in front of their stage, which were mostly filled by the time I left, so popular event for sure. Unfortunately the sound people didn't really know appropriate levels for 10-15 minutes and the bass made me sick to my stomach.Good fries, beers and popular events await you at the Starry Plough, but come prepared for waits and maybe stay away from the veggie burger if you can't handle the inferno."
The Starry Plough,"Oct 28, 2022",Best bar ever! Good food good beer good music good vibe. Great place for anyone to be whomever they want to  be.
The Starry Plough,"Jan 14, 2023",Great customer service! Great food! Fantastic ambiance! I went for poetry night. Will definitely be going again !
The Starry Plough,"Nov 12, 2022","Came on a poetry slam night with a date! Cute ambiance and tasty ciders for fair prices. The fries were a really good snack to munch on. Fairly big place, and really good service:) Would come again!"
The Starry Plough,"Nov 10, 2022","Still a great local Irish tradition.  Still partially closed to limit crowds on the weekend.  Hoping Thursday funk night will be back soon!  The video is from Sunday night, a real Irish folk music performance. Musicians welcome"
The Starry Plough,"Oct 28, 2022",Best bar ever! Good food good beer good music good vibe. Great place for anyone to be whomever they want to  be.
The Starry Plough,"Aug 30, 2022","The best place to get a hamburger and beer. I love Sundays; they play live Irish music, stop by and say hi to my BFF Rose. This place is very close to my heart; I practically grew up in this place."
The Starry Plough,"Aug 22, 2022",Got the fish and garlic chips. Tried the fries years ago and thought they were incredible and they still hold up.
The Starry Plough,"Aug 16, 2022",I love open mic. This was definitely one of the coolest I've ever seen. The sound guy did a great job. Not easy. I would definitely recommend if this is your thing. Play here. Come watch these talented people.
The Starry Plough,"Aug 16, 2022","Great mf food hella flavor fresh cooked, coolest bartenders in the world and they give ppl a mic on tuesday nights to spit your issue. Open mic tuesday night is turnt up hella local artists"
The Starry Plough,"Aug 16, 2022","I had a great time even as a one-time visitor! Very cozy, wholesome, not loud. It happened to be Monday dance night, so I really enjoyed the merry tunes of Irish folk music while soaking in the happy vibes from the dancing class."
The Starry Plough,"Jul 19, 2022","This Pub always seemed random to me. I actually grew up not to far away from it. Before 2020 I generally avoided this place. The Food and Drink here are top notch. Most of the time I went to other places in the area. It sucks that The Starry Plough isn't open part of the week, because I would love to go here on Friday and Saturday night."
The Starry Plough,"Jul 5, 2022",super cozy place and open mics every tuesday night! very excited to continue hanging out here and enjoying the general vibe
The Starry Plough,"Jun 30, 2022","Yet another update....  Still happy they're back, but the schedule really sucks.  Closed Friday and Saturday nights?  Who's bright idea was that?   Losing a lot of revenue there. Many times we haven't gone because they're not open Friday or Saturday and those are the best days for us, and many other people who work.  So, we'll still go when we can, unfortunately it just won't be weekly like it once was.  Closed to monthly now"
The Starry Plough,"Jun 21, 2022","A long standing family owned business, they have friendly staff and quality food. I come here every week for Irish céilí dancing on Monday nights, and once they opened back up following the Covid-19 shelter-in-place, I realized how much of myself I was missing without it. An excellent place to grab a bite or a drink with friends, with live Irish music on Sundays and Mondays, and plenty more interesting attractions throughout the week!"
The Starry Plough,"May 2, 2022","Great good! Great food! Great people! I especially love Sunday night Irish music jam and Monday night Irish dancing. They serve Irish fare, shepherds pie and corned beef and cabbage, year round. So lovely that it's in our neighborhood!"
The Starry Plough,"Apr 26, 2022",Awesome pub with a great open mic night and friendly staff. Check it out and have a drink and listen to some good original music on Tuesdays!
The Starry Plough,"Feb 17, 2022",Loved this place. Anyone know when it might reopen?  Miss it. Had great times there. I reviewed it in full 4 years ago.
The Starry Plough,"Jan 12, 2022",Drove to come eat and it was close. Please keep an updated schedule. Good looked great but it'd a bummer.
The Starry Plough,"Jul 17, 2021",Temporarily closed? Looks maybe like it. Phone is down. See ya on the other side. Hello to all
The Starry Plough,"Mar 17, 2020",Best irish pub in all the land. Delicious food and always live entertainment. 10/10 would recommend.
The Starry Plough,"Nov 17, 2019","This is a fantastic bar. Saw truly authentic musical performances on Saturday night, well worth the $12 cover. Baby Santa is also a well-known performer here with his steel guitar, duck-dynasty like hair, and some slap-knee lyrics you've surely never heard. This place even serves Kombucha, in fact the strongest grapefruit Kombucha I've ever tried!"
The Starry Plough,"Nov 9, 2019","I'm at the Starry Plough on a Saturday night to hear some bands perform, and we got here early to grab a table. Food was good, house music was way too loud, tables were never bussed even though wasn't busy (and after I asked). Meh, I'll try again another day but tonight has just been irritating"
The Starry Plough,"Nov 8, 2019","This place is awesome! It's been around forever, which makes me happy. Great burgers and fries. Also, the owner is super genuine and caring towards the customers, you can tell he actually cares about community, not just profit. The staff are also super nice and welcoming."

The Starry Plough,"Sep 12, 2019","This bar is good, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. They seem to attract clueless millennials  who aren't who aren't ready to be parents. I'm trying to watch the debates in a bar. Don't to this bar.  The local children run amok, screaming and running all l we threw place. It just shows how fucking stupid and clueless these people are. I can't wait to see how your chidden turn out with your direction. If it was my Pub, it give you a warning  and then cut you off. It's OK to have a locAl pub, but to be successful you need to create a welcoming en environment . If you let a couple millennial parent , who are oblivious of child-rearing run a-mock, you completely destroy your brand."
The Starry Plough,"Aug 27, 2019","Love this place, funk night is the best! Keep coming here for the best Thursday nights!"
The Starry Plough,"Aug 27, 2019","Great place with great people. Owner is a great guy and the food is way better than you would expect. Starry Plough could do well as an independent restaurant. Seriously, try one of their burgers. Absolutely life changing. Love this place."
The Starry Plough,"Jul 16, 2019","I love this place. Great food, focused menu, good beer selection and excellent atmosphere!Seriously a great Irish pub with lots if events and shows. If thats not enough they have 2 dart boards.Don't forget to tip your bartender :)"
The Starry Plough,"Jul 5, 2019","Love this place--the food, the beer, the music events, the good vibes! This is a Berkeley staple."
The Starry Plough,"Jun 15, 2019","This place is amazing! The staff is so sweet and make you feel at home. Plus, the live bands on Sat night were too cool. So much talent in such a small place! Good food? Check. Good service? Check! Great entertainment and energy? Double check!"
The Starry Plough,"May 21, 2019","Awesome!!  The food, the beer, the atmosphere, the staff.    AND free live entertainment.  Tuesday night open mic is off the wall.  Music, comedy, poetry, everything goes.  This place is a gem.  Try the Irish Poutine then sing a song or try your hand at comedy.  Or just go and enjoy the show.  Supportive crowd.  Easy parking if you need it in neighboring streets."
The Starry Plough,"May 8, 2019",I absolutely love this place! The staff are friendly and helpful. The food is pretty impressive given the small size of the kitchen. I really love their black bean and quinoa burger although it can be quite messy! They have something interesting going on every single night of the week.
The Starry Plough,"May 8, 2019","Love this place. I lived on the same block as the bar for 11 years, met a good friend there on open mic night 15 years ago, we're still good friends. I love the crusty old customers, the regulars, I've seen them on the corner or in their stools for over 16 years, couple of them have died, some day I'll die, but in the meantime, I'm really glad this place exists for the space it holds for the community, there's something for everyone every night."
The Starry Plough,"May 6, 2019",Good place for live music My husband and I went there for live salsa music. Free salsa lesson prior to performance. Full bar and some food like burger.
The Starry Plough,"Apr 23, 2019",Went here and bought one round of drinks for $15.  I seen later that another separate charge was made afterwards for $25.  I don't know if somebody used my tab without my agreement or not but either way I'm not happy about it.
The Starry Plough,"Apr 18, 2019","Great beer selection !  Chicken strips, 5 stars. Staff is awesome. Something happening every night. Live music, poetry, Irish dancing.  Love to watch playoff games here.  Super fun chill spot"
The Starry Plough,"Apr 3, 2019","I almost don't want to give this place a good review because I don't want too many people to discover this neighborhood gem...but alas I cannot. Whether its a random beer on a Tuesday, dinner with my kids on a Thursday, or a Sunday when the neighborhood musicians play - this place is always amazing. And the food is really, really good for a pub. Not what you would expect."
The Starry Plough,"Apr 1, 2019","I'm neither Irish nor white, so the idea of checking out the Irish pub near an area I frequent didn't seem too appealing to me. But one day I wanted both food and a beer, and Starry Plough popped up in my good ol' Yelp app, so I figured why not. Turns out what I had envisioned this place to be was a little far off. Yes, there are Irish themes (and actual Irish clientele), but also a variety of other folks (I'm assuming from the neighborhood) who frequent this cozy little spot. Since then I've came in a few times for happy hour, and have tried a couple food items. Earlier today, I had a regular ol' cheeseburger, and I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. The patty was seasoned and charred just right and the homemade mayo was a perfect accent. I'm not a pickle person, but even those were really nice! I'd come back for that alone."
The Starry Plough,"Mar 15, 2019","Four stars because it's a local staple, been coming here for as long as I can remember.  Audio - kinda loud for the size but the acts they book - including regulars - is eclectic and the vibe is good.  Food - it really depends on what you order; keep it simple and it's ok (e.g., grilled cheese sandwich, fries)...anything requiring quality or technique (e.g, hot pastrami), you might be disappointed.  Overall, a fun, simple, inexpensive neighborhood joint."
The Starry Plough,"Mar 10, 2019","It's a nice spot for live music! Small and intimate but you get a nice feel of the music, chill vibes, and dope people all around. Everyone is so nice and welcoming, just enjoying the music and the good company around!I support local bands and the love for music in general. Coming back for more live music performances, so will see what's next!They have a $1 off drinks Yelp check-in."
The Starry Plough,"Mar 6, 2019",Me love here. Me drank here college. Food great and company just as good. 5 peppers on the pepper scale
The Starry Plough,"Feb 8, 2019",Exceptional service from Sabrina makes this spot a destination to visit again...This spot has character and a East Bay meets the world vibe...
The Starry Plough,"Feb 7, 2019","I love coming here for a poetry night, and I have also been here for a music open night. I love the space and the ambience. They make a really delicious burger, and a pretty solid pizza as well. They also have a bar with decent prices."
The Starry Plough,"Jan 8, 2019",A hidden gem!! Went on Tuesday for karaoke night & it was great to hear a diverse group of people perform. The place was packed but luckily found a spot to sit at & people were chill. Service was great & even though I didn't eat the food smelled GREAT. Monday - Irish dance & ceiliTuesday - open mic Wednesday - poetry slamThursday - FREE funk nightFriday & Sat - live bands & touring actsSunday - traditional Irish music
The Starry Plough,"Jan 6, 2019",We came here for New Years 2019. This was my first time here. My boyfriend recommended it because he enjoyed coming to this bar.The New Years event included live music from a couple bands. The overall vibe was nice. It got really full towards the end and we left early. We also ordered food from the kitchen. I got a bacon cheeseburger with feta instead of cheddar. It also came with a side of fries. The burger was really good and cooked deliciously.
The Starry Plough,"Oct 23, 2018",Great Garlic Fries:) The Reubin was great as well and the environment is super cool and rebellious. Great Guinness on tap.
The Starry Plough,"Oct 9, 2018","The Starry Plough is an iconic institution of the east bay.The first time I visited the west coast a decade ago, a local friend took me to the Starry Plough's Monday night Irish folk dancing night for their beginner's class. Sweaty and kind of drunk, I told my friend, ""When I move to SF I'm coming here every week.""It turned out that was more like ""three or four times a year"" since it's a bit of a commute, but each time I do I enjoy myself, even if it's just to sit and have a pint by myself and let my thoughts of the day settle.The place has character, and atmosphere, and ambiance. By which I mean, ""They don't blast background music so you have to scream at your friend next to you just to be heard."" Pubs like The Starry Plough are hard to find; it doesn't have bland, Instagram-worthy trendiness, it just has class and comfort. I find myself enjoying small-talk and conversations with the stranger next to me. It's been a shining jewel for the last fifty years, and I hope it continues so for the next five hundred."
The Starry Plough,"Sep 5, 2018","5 years I've lived in the area and 5 years I've loved this place. You can't get a more ""Berkeley"" vibe. Removed enough from campus that it's not all students. Beer and wine only, so no drink aholes. Seems to be family owned. Staff are really nice, patrons are generally really nice. Darts! Live music! Rotating taps of deliciousness. Fries have gotta among the best of the Bay. My only wish is to see more vegetarian and vegan options on the menu so I can eat dinner there instead of before I head there. After all, they claim to be revolutionary..."
The Starry Plough,"Sep 3, 2018","Great Irish pub! Has good food and drink, including Irish cider and Artesian beers, as well as non-alcoholic juices and teas.Saw the sign for Starry Plough while driving by, went in and I haven't left yet. Awesome!"
The Starry Plough,"Jul 31, 2018","Love this place. Great service. Nice people. The food is awesome. I would suggest getting the pulled pork french fries. They are AMAZING; especially when alura makes them, she is a great cook. Will definitely be back !"
The Starry Plough,"Jul 30, 2018","Wow....actually ate there at the most recent show (Flamenco night-FAB!).Did someone call this ""typical pub food""?Really?!WOW-the food here is EXCELLENT.Tied with Spatz for the best burger in the Bay, (get the ultimate-it is about 6"" high and comes pinned together with a steak knife). $15 and feeds two.Such a cool vibe here.This place is doing it RIGHT. :)"
The Starry Plough,"Jul 28, 2018","Good beer, service, and music.  It's just a cool place. Since my post is too short, I'll say again this is a cool place to get a beer, relax, listen to music, and eat."
The Starry Plough,"Jul 26, 2018","Not really my cup of tea (a bit too hippie-ish), but this place has a friendly ambiance, outstanding food, and a small but varied beer selection. I had the pesto pasta and it was absolutely delicious! The chef takes the orders and makes everything fresh as the orders are placed. Lots of good-looking food on the menu and the portions are very generous for the price.This place is certainly worth checking out if you're in the area!!!"
The Starry Plough,"Jul 16, 2018","Great vibe, lovely people, good food. My burger was taking a while to cook so a cook gave me some fries to much on; it was really cool of him."
The Starry Plough,"Jul 15, 2018",I stopped here for a drink after being stressed out about something and the place was pretty chill. The bartender was nice knowing it was my first time there and let me sample some beers until I found one I liked. I ordered some food with the beer which was good as well. However I did leave because I wasn't in the mood to be around too many people. It wasn't bad for a first visit though. Next time when I visit I will stay for the music.
The Starry Plough,"Jul 10, 2018","Came expecting an Irish Pub.  This place is a nice local bar,  but no Irish pubness here."
The Starry Plough,"Jul 4, 2018",Awesome Live Music Venue. Great food. Love the burgers there. Staff are the best. Very friendly. Place is run very well and fun always specially Thursday nights that is the night I usually go. A regular hang out.
The Starry Plough,"Jul 2, 2018","The Starry Plough is my local bar and what a great local it is. I haven't been before because I just had a kid, and times away are few and far between. However, I was recently here twice in a matter of just a few days. Once for a low key dinner on a funk Thursday and one for Fleetwood Macrame, a Fleetwood Mac cover band.They have live music every night here. Thursday is the only night where the is no cover. The DJ was spinning some tunes early on and we left before the band, but dinner was good! The fish and chips were solid, not too flavorful, but thick cuts of battered fish perfectly fried with freshly cut and fried potatoes. The roasted vegetables with homemade pesto were delicious! Great beer selection (only beer and wine here).The cover band was a $15 cover, and that was way too pricey. Although fun, the band was dece and I'm not quite sure was worth the $15 and spending a ton on drinks. I discussed with friends and we all agreed - $8, $10 tops is the most one should pay for an average cover band at a bar/venue.I think I may be more of a preshow drinks and eats local here unless that band is really enticing me to pony up the dough. But for that early evening beer and burger, The Starry Plough is a no brainer!"
The Starry Plough,"Jul 1, 2018","yelpuspleasei said i would and i keep my promises!  this is my new local watering hole. came on sunday after moving things all day and had delicious late-night bites, great drinks, and awesome live irish music. i will be back, often."
The Starry Plough,"Jun 28, 2018","The people are friendly, the beer is cold and the food is good. What else do you need? Well, bourbon would be nice. But other than that, this place is great."
The Starry Plough,"Jun 20, 2018","This is my local pub and I have been going for over 30 years. I've played there countless times. There is always something going on, last night's open mike was a scream. The owners are darlings, and i am not sure when I noticed the food, so I'm not sure this is a change, but the food is outstanding. Best BLT in town, they always have Fieldwork IPAs of one kind or another.Love it."
The Starry Plough,"Jun 19, 2018","Live music is enjoyable here while grabbing tap beer and maybe bar bites if one wants the munchies! It's a bit rundown and the music performers were senior. I thought it would be more of a hip kind of bar place. Darts shooting available.  I looked up the ceiling randomly and there was a poster of a girl.  That made me smile. Ah, the random things in life, makes it fun."
The Starry Plough,"Jun 8, 2018","A really nice neighborhood Irish Pub - Great Beers on draft and I can not comment on the food but I have heard great things from others.Came in here for a quick drink to buy time, it was about 30 minutes to playoff Warriors game and it was about 50% filled. There was still live music some sort of strings band which was very nice. There is tv's playing the game. The bartender was super relaxed and found out I got a $1 off my first drink for checking in on Yelp!Anyways I ordered a Guinness - I used to hate Guinness, now love it especially if its poured the right way out the tap. The cans of Guinness are complete GARBAGE - You have to order draft.Anyways over good experience and would like to come back and grab some grub along a pint next time. Thanks!"
The Starry Plough,"May 12, 2018",Outstanding food and interesting ambience. You almost feel guilty paying menu prices as the quality of food is so flavorful. No rice.
The Starry Plough,"May 4, 2018","I'm obsessed with their food! Drool alert!!! So I typically go for their spicy fish sandwich with coleslaw and fries or garlic fries. Recently I ordered chicken strips sooo yummy! They bread or batter everything when it's ordered, so it's nice and fresh. Always pipping hot when I get my food. They have a great menu full of yummy choices and great prices. The staff is always friendly and helpful. Food is made pretty fast as well. I have gone on a few nights were they've had poetry reading and bands playing. Great atmosphere to just chill, be weird and vibe out. :)"
The Starry Plough,"Apr 15, 2018",My friends and I had so much fun here. The bartenders are friendly. There is a good selection of beer on draft. We went on a night when there was live music which was really cool. The place has cool posters and signs of protests all around the world. I didn't try the food when I went so I'll have to return soon. Definitely coming back here!
The Starry Plough,"Mar 30, 2018","I really wanted this place to be good. I went with my husband who is Irish. We were really disappointed in the food and my drink (his IPA was good). He ordered the Irish poutin which looked nothing like the other photo on yelp. The fries were a bit soggy, there was about an inch of oil at the bottom, and I'm not sure where the gravy was (bits of bacon were good). He ate about half and left the rest (very unlike him). I had the quinoa burger and fries extra crispy (after asking the cashier if she recommended it (which she enthusiastically did) and making sure she wasn't a vegan (I'm sorry, but I feel they often have lower standards for veggie food b/c of their restrictions)). The extra crispy fries had a great color, but were not crispy. The burger was below average. The bun was nice, but they put mayo on both sides (I'm not a fan and didn't expect it to be put on for me). The quinoa burger was mushy, not great tasting and fell apart. My snakebite tasted watery and was not carbonated. I really wish this place had tastier food as we would have loved to make this our place. The table next to us had 5 people sharing a pizza and they left more than half... that should have been a sign. The staff was very nice though."
The Starry Plough,"Mar 23, 2018",I want so bad for this place to be good! The food is way too SALTY and the beers on draft could be better and changed out more.There's something going on every night so if you want to just get a beer and a bite do it before 7:30 otherwise your luck of getting a table will be zero.Someone who works there always wearing a Bernie hat seriously needs to tie their hair up when in the kitchen and wear proper shoes not birkenstocks. I really don't want to be served food from someone whose toes I can see. It's quite unsanitary.
The Starry Plough,"Mar 18, 2018","Hands down the best Burger in the East Bay. That combined with a hot bartender. You can't ask for more. And I'm a meat eater. In n out, born n' raised, biotches."
The Starry Plough,"Mar 11, 2018","I haven't been here in years, but we stopped by today because our dog's circus school teacher was playing in the fiddle jam--how's that for an East Bay intro to a Yelp review? XDThe fiddle band was really fun. The bartendress was nice and poured me some beer samples, but actually, their house Cabernet was solid for $7. We ordered the Irish poutine which was a little bit odd. Fries were fine, and there was a decent melty cheese, but no curds. The gravy was beige, and there was a ton of onions and green onions. I suspect there are better food options at the bar.The Starry Plough is a cozy place to hang out on a Sunday afternoon. There's some natural light, good beers on tap, and friendly staff. Would definitely return."
The Starry Plough,"Mar 10, 2018","This may be my first and only 5 star rating ever which is why I'm so inspired to write this review. I've always passed by this place en route to and from work for three years now and I finally experienced why this establishment shines so bright in the beautiful city of Berkeley. Now it has the attention and won my chubby Asian heart today. #shook I value quality, price, service, atmosphere, and restrooms (if u have a filthy bathroom, then what does your kitchen look like?) #eek. All were exceptional and Samantha was the bartender and created a great experience. This place also has live music on a consistent basis, which is a huge bonus. I got their hamburger and it has an option to come with a side of fries (which are freshly cut and fried), salad, or coleslaw. The burger was perfectly cooked (very juicy and thick) and the bun was perfectly toasted and very soft. The element of arugula in it was a fabulous touch. The slaw was perfectly sweet, fresh, and crunchy. I'll definitely be back!"
The Starry Plough,"Feb 10, 2018","So disappointed with my experience here last night. My friends and I are regular customers, and were so excited for Balkan night. We knew that the atm in the bar charges a fee, so we called ahead to see if we could add the cover charge to our tab. The man that answered the phone said it would be no problem! But once we got to the pub, we were told that that was ""in no way possible"" and that ""someone must have been trained wrong or something."" Honestly, getting cash last minute wouldn't have been such a big deal if the bartenders and woman letting people in weren't so rude to us. In an aggressive and abrasive tone, we were told to either pay or leave and they were in no way apologetic for spreading misinformation. It definitely seemed that they thought we had made up the whole thing, which we had no reason to do. Asking for clarification on something we took the initiative to inquire about earlier in the night, should not merit disrespect. We turned around and are never coming back."
The Starry Plough,"Feb 8, 2018","I love that there is always something cool happening there. And the kitchen rocks. My favourites are corned beef and cabbage, the plough burger ( should be shared) and the fish and chips (not to be shared) and the bar Tinder's know their stuff so ask questions."
The Starry Plough,"Jan 15, 2018","Awesome pub, I love this place! They have great beer, food and music!! The staff are all friendly and the whole place has a really great vibe. Definitely recommend!!!"
The Starry Plough,"Jan 15, 2018","I was in Berkeley and thank God I decided to stop by this place. The food here was amazing and they had a great selection of beer. But I was more impressed with the quality of service. This pub is doing all the right things, which doesn't surprise me that they've been open for a long time. The atmosphere here was really lively.  Definitely will come back here anytime I find myself in Berkeley."
The Starry Plough,"Dec 30, 2017","Fun, Fun, Fun! The people are wonderful, the food is great, the beer is spot on and the overall atmosphere was wonderful. We had been looking for a place like this. Can't wait to go back!"
The Starry Plough,"Dec 19, 2017",My husband and I ate here for the first time with some friends yesterday and I have to admit to food was delicious! I had the ultimate burger and it definitely lived up to its name!! It was cooked perfectly and it was huge! I can honestly say it was the best burger I've ever had. Full of flavor and juicy! Garlic fries are to die for as well. The staff was super friendly and had a lot of patience. I asked a lot of questions while I was debating on what to order. The dining room had a lot of space and the bathroom was clean. Overall great experience and I'll definitely come back when I am in town again.
The Starry Plough,"Nov 24, 2017","The folks behind the counter were cheerful and pleasant.  The fish & chips were good.  I think they use rosemary in the chips.So why the bad review?  The dining area reeked of wintergreen.  Extremely strong, overpowering smell.  If I had not already ordered and paid for my food (and my friend's food) I would have left.  The odor ruined any chance of enjoying the food.  I think it was from a cleaning product.  I don't know how else to explain it.Also, there is no door on the men's room, just a doorway and everything is right there."
The Starry Plough,"Nov 21, 2017",This is the go to spot for a good time. They have amazing food! The burgers are out of this world.This bar is excellent at making everyone feel welcome. They have different events each night. The bar tenders are always extremely friendly and attentive. The community vibe this pub provides is just awesome!
The Starry Plough,"Sep 19, 2017","I was craving fish and chips and this is one of the first listed on a Yelp search. We got the fish and chips, mushroom burger with added jalapeños and garlic fries, and a couple of pints. Service is curt, food is bomb. Didn't have enough time to stay for the live music. We'll be back when we're craving good pub eats!"
The Starry Plough,"Aug 18, 2017",This place is awesome! I love the entire staff and the pear cider and the family oriented vibe on Sundays
The Starry Plough,"Aug 8, 2017","Good Draft Beer, Great Burgers, Great crowd and decent entertainment on most nights. It's definitely a challenge to keep live music going every evening so hats of to Starry Plough for keeping it going and keeping it real!"
The Starry Plough,"Jul 31, 2017","This is a cool place with a fun vibe. When I was there, the owners' son was working the grill, and he took the time to chat with us (newcomers to the bay area) even though he was busy. He's a nice guy, and I'll go back just to support a local businessman.I knocked off a star because I didn't care for the live music. This place has theme nights every day of week, do check the calendar to make sure you like the theme before heading over.If you like garlic, try the burgers!"
The Starry Plough,"Jul 16, 2017",Apparently we went here after eating too many cannabis gummies. I only vaguely remember going. I told my husband it was the best burger I'd ever had. He agreed it was really good. I'd like to go back sober. I remember it being dark and unpretentious. Perfect.
The Starry Plough,"Jul 9, 2017","This place is as good as it gets.  Open kitchen with very well prepared food.  Quite a varied menu for pub food.  Large beer menu with reasonable pint pricing. Often has free music during the dinner hour.  Last time we were there a mandolin player was quite entertaining. He did not play so loud that it inhibited conversation but provided wonderful background sounds.,Highly recommend this spot for both dinner and entertainment."
The Starry Plough,"Jun 13, 2017",Solid solid neighborhood bar. Came for the NBA finals and the kept moving chairs out for people to sit in.  Insisted on Irish step dancing which was a little awkward but true to the character of the place.
The Starry Plough,"Apr 6, 2017","Great neighborhood spot with a nice selection of beers, good food, and frequently good entertainment.  The crowd is a mix that reflects the area, and the staff are all helpful and friendly.  It is definitely worth a stop if you are in this part of town.  I think their pizzas and burgers are pretty good, and they have enough space to dance if you want to get your groove thang on."
The Starry Plough,"Mar 29, 2017",Really cool pub. I ordered a Reuben sandwich. The corned beef was really fatty and inedible. When the wait staff asked how everything was I mentioned how fatty the corned beef was no reply and walked away. Disappointing to say the least. On a better note open mike night was fun and the french  fries were good.
The Starry Plough,"Mar 29, 2017","Awesome live music, a fantastic Wednesday Poetry Slam, good beer selection, and delicious food! Love this place, and love knowing that they host really fun events every night of the week."
The Starry Plough,"Mar 24, 2017",Irish bar. I got a pint while I was waiting for my to go order. I got the pesto sandwich and the fish sandwich. The guy was nice enough to tell me to have it added onto my food since I had a card and there's a $10 minimum. We went splitsies so I got to try both and they were both good. Wouldn't travel there specially for those sandwiches but the beer and the fries were worth writing home about.
The Starry Plough,"Mar 19, 2017","Arrived at 2:15 on a Sunday afternoon, just after opening. I was the first person in and sat at the bar. Bartender helpful & friendly. I ordered the cheeseburger with fries & a Pranqster. Burger came out hot and delicious! Grilled onions with fresh lettuce and tomatoes - great quality. Fries are amazing! Fresh, hot, house made. Highly recommend!"
The Starry Plough,"Mar 16, 2017",Open mic MC/host ruins the night.I went for an open mic on a Wednesday night and never plan to come again. The mc/host of the event was offended by a rather innocuous poem because it wasn't 100% PC. After I read she lectured me on my insensitivity and immaturity (while also making unsolicited attacks on my writing quality). If you're not part of the in crowd you're not welcome. Don't bother unless you know people or want to be told what to say and how to think.I must note that the bartender was friendly and attentive and if I were rating the bar service alone I'd give 5 stars.
The Starry Plough,"Feb 19, 2017","Had dinner here on a Sunday evening. Ordered both Sunday specials: corned beef and cabbage and shepherd's pie. Both were delicious and exactly what you want on a cold wet Sunday evening when you are craving something hearty and homemade tasting. The portions are very generous and we left happy and satisfies. The prices are very reasonable. Musics a little on the loud side, but hey, it's a pub."
The Starry Plough,"Jan 24, 2017","I don't venture outside San Francisco enough, so when it came time to plan a hangout with my friends who live in the East Bay, we decided on somewhere in Oakland. The Starry Plough seemed close enough to the Ashby BART station, so we met up there. Upon walking in, it was cool to see a group of musicians jamming out on their instruments! Seemed like they were friends that do this often.We were originally planning to eat dinner here, but it turns out the kitchen was closed. Probably remodeling. That's too bad. We did enjoy a beer before heading to our next destination. They have a decent selection of beers, though I wasn't too thrilled about the cleanliness of the seating areas. It was a mediocre place to hang out. I wouldn't be thrilled about coming back here again, but I'm sure some customers have made The Starry Plough their regular, comfortable watering hole!"
The Starry Plough,"Jan 15, 2017","Absolutely love this place! I stumbled upon the Starry Plough because I was craving a burger. Holy shit did they deliver. They have the best burgers in Berkeley bare none. If you want live music, a great brew, and a damn good burger this is your place. Cheers!"
The Starry Plough,"Dec 28, 2016","In search of pizza in the Ashby area, we Yelped ourselves to the Starry Plough. And, expecting pizza, we were surprised to be welcomed by a local folk band. We curiously entered the 'dive-bar-meets-Irish-pub', ordered beers and grabbed some pizza. The beer selection wasn't too great, with brews ranging between 'meh' to decent. The pizza, however, was not bad at all: tasty, cooked all the way through and nicely balanced out. Overall, Starry Plough seems like a fun place to hang out with a friend and eat some pizza and catch up... if you don't mind the beer."
The Starry Plough,"Dec 27, 2016",Loved this place but it has changed a lot as it has gotten more attention. Funk night used to be real funk! And much more intimate and no rock band performing? But still great vibes nonetheless. Miss the old funk nights though.
The Starry Plough,"Dec 24, 2016","Some come for the good selection of beer, some come for the fun nightly events, personally I come in for the freaking amazing food. Seriously, the chefs here know how to make a mean burger (I strongly recommend the jalapeño burger--and they do too) and the fries are so delicious they're a euphoric experience in and of themselves. One time I ordered an apple bread pudding dessert and the entire bar was in awe with the amazing, glorious piece of culinary perfection they whipped up. As for the setting, the plough has the perfect ""casual, local bar"" vibe mixed with the exciting event atmosphere. It's rare to find a chill bar that simultaneously caters to the hardworking after-work drinking crowd as well as artists AND families. it's a nice feeling. Reminds me of home."
The Starry Plough,"Dec 12, 2016","I had a couple of bad experiences with their Sunday family events and came close to writing it off. We were blown away, though, when we showed up on a random Saturday night to find a large group of Irish folk musicians. They seemed to be having a jam session and the vibe was absolutely lovely. Folks were friendly and my husband felt like he'd been transported back to the Scottish isles. So glad we went back!"
The Starry Plough,"Nov 17, 2016","I like this bar quite a bit. It is a very short walk from the Ashby Bart and they rotate their taps every once in a while and always have a good and full selection. Their happy hour deals are not bad either as you can get a pint for $4 at that time. In terms of their bar food it is not more special than any other bar food with the usual things being offered like burgers, sandwiches, and mac and cheese. There is also only one TV that isn't accessible everywhere in the place but they're always playing the most relevant sports that day.What is really cool about this bar is that fairly frequently they have live bands perform and different shows. Usually the cover charge is $10 but that does also get you a beer. So if you are looking for something fun to do and like bars and small local bands I would definitely check this place out."
The Starry Plough,"Nov 2, 2016","Starry Plow has great vibes. It's very much a friendly neighborhood bar with a community feel. They have live music and lots of cool social justice/activism oriented decorations. Because of that though, it's definitely a bar you go to when you're looking for social interaction and music, not when you're looking for somewhere to watch sports (there's only one TV). Food is average-above average bar food depending on what you order. I've had fish and chips there that were kind of bland and I've had mac and cheese with rosemary and a few kinds of cheese that was quite good. Happy hour is long which is a plus, but the deals aren't great which is a minus. You get a dollar off a drink but the drink has to be under $6 to begin with, which doesn't leave a great selection. Overall, not a bad place to go get a drink with friends but not my favorite."
The Starry Plough,"Oct 30, 2016",My local bar and I am grateful. And Shahin is a dope manager!
The Starry Plough,"Oct 24, 2016",This is.an Iris Pub. Authentic with Great fricken bar food! My first time.here so I had to try everything!.. Lol.  Im big but not.big enough...Eveything i tried was exceptional and the way I like it. Shepherds  Pie. wow. Mushroom burger had a ton of mushrooms. melted cheese..toasted bun. sides : Coleslaw was  crisp fresh and just right amount of dressing.  Best for last..Fries.... had special seasoning not sure what it was but I couldn't stop eating them. Oh.and Beer on tap. Like 30 of them. Owner was nice as was the bartender.  What a great spot!
The Starry Plough,"Oct 21, 2016","Went to the poetry night on Wednesday night. It was a decent crowd and good poetry BUT, it was nosey when the poetry was going on because of the Bar and in addition to the 7-10 dollar cover, they also wanted you to donate more to the poets and food lol. I would go back but, just be aware of what to expect. Cheers,D"
The Starry Plough,"Oct 16, 2016",I used to live just down the street and always walked by and would tell myself I should check this place out.  Well now I don't live down the street and one Sunday night I came in enticed by the sounds of live music.  I didn't even know they served food.  I ordered the poutine....I am in love
The Starry Plough,"Oct 10, 2016",They have almost 300 reviews. This place is a land mark. Service was just a bit slow and it wasn't that busy the last time we were there but they were apologetic and really made up for it  the service staff was great and live music is a huge plus. We come here of ten and will continue.
The Starry Plough,"Oct 4, 2016",Great place to catch quality local music. Good friendly staff. A nice place to meet with friends over a beverage and some music.
The Starry Plough,"Sep 16, 2016","TLDR:People are really nice, It was a funk night, the music was awesome,food wise, I had a burger and french fries, one of the best I ever had, and the beer selection is amazing."
The Starry Plough,"Aug 31, 2016","If you are looking for a place to take a very odd profile picture, this is the place for you!"
The Starry Plough,"Aug 29, 2016",Stopped by in the middle of a Sunday afternoon to find a great band called These Wiley Coyotes playing. Good beer selection. Great diverse crowd. Nice sound system. Thoroughly enjoyable. I'd heard a lot about the place over the years and it didn't disappoint.
The Starry Plough,"Aug 8, 2016","Quite frank, place brought some disappointment impression from the minute we've stepped in, HOWEVER, polite and responsive service, deliciously cooked food, good tap and friendly party Irish atmosphere made me enjoy my time and want to come back. Thank you, guys, for being there since ..... 1972!Cheers.""Many will call me an adventurer - and that I am, only one of a different sort: one of those who risks his skin to prove his platitudes"" - Che GuevaraSorry, but unfortunately change my mind to single star after visiting the place yesterday, Sunday, August 7 at 2:00 pm for delicious lunch, placing an order and waiting for one hour without that order even reaching to the kitchen. Left at 3 PM hungry and angry. No more! Done with this place. Let the revolution begin!"
The Starry Plough,"Jul 24, 2016","Friendly neighborhood bar with surprisingly good food. They offer pitchers of beer and a comfortable place to bring babies, kids, dads, soccer coaches (hey Art). They cut their own French fries and cook them to a crunchy dark brown. The burgers are actually cooked to order. Salads are more than iceberg or romaine with shredded carrots. Highly recommended."
The Starry Plough,"Jul 23, 2016","This is either my second or third visit as I have been here previously for other Brazilian music events.  So when a friend asked me to join her, I jumped at the chance to go back to this cozy, intimate place for music, food and dancing.We got a great table with a great view of the stage (as I like to take photos/videos of the bands) and the prices for the drinks of beer and wine are reasonable.  Ordered a pear cider and Lagunitas IPA for $12.  Then I forgot to check in on YELP before ordering the drinks and discovered there is a discount upon check-in which I will save for my next visit.  I noticed they have food here ranging from appetizers to burgers to sandwiches to pizza at reasonable prices but all I wanted tonight was a bag of chips.  Luckily they had one plain bag left for $2 at the bar.  I will have to try the food next time too!"
The Starry Plough,"Jul 23, 2016","Liars and thieves!! After taking money out of their ATM (which only gives 20's) I paid to get in ($10) and the door person said I gave them a ten, I said it was a 20, I just took it out of your ATM, they refused and so I spoke with the manager about the discrepancy and he told me they would only check the cameras if I filed a police report.  Unbelievable!! what terrible customer service... and so wasting public time and funds I have been bullied into filing a police report in order to verify that I was short changed when they could have easily checked themselves, what a waste of time.  Avoid this place like the plague, find an honest dive bar or just drink at home"
The Starry Plough,"Jul 23, 2016","The Starry Plough is a great pub to hit any night of the week for a beer and some comfort food (their Ultimate burger is killer). Plus they have my favorite dessert: Guinness floats!Wheelchair accessibility notes: The entrance is a flat, low-grade ramp. Tables are at normal height but there's also a bar. Bathroom is a single-person bathroom that's large enough for any wheelchair. The absolute best parking spot is the handicap one right outside the door."
The Starry Plough,"Jul 14, 2016",Great food. Great people.  Always awesome service.  I wish they carried more organic and local beers like Rasputin's Stout and Ninkasi Brewery!  I love this place. Especially tuesday open mic night and the darts (still learning).And Sunday night's Celtic music is the best in the area!  Ask Michael Tsarion about how the Irish gave the world Civilization! He knows!
The Starry Plough,"Jul 5, 2016",Unfriendly and un-attentive staff.  I went here looking for what I thought would be good irish food.  That is only on Sun and Mon.  Only have beer and wine.....If you are not a regular which means local as there is no parking except for on the street.  the décor looks 50 to 60 years old which was an early age for the clientele that was there.  Im not your but sure felt it in amongst this crowd.  Definitely no a place I can recommend or will go back to.
The Starry Plough,"Jul 2, 2016","If I lived here, I would be a regular. The staff was so helpful and kind and the food was amazing! My husband and I split a blue cheese and jalapeño burger and a corned beef sandwich. Both were exceptional! The food was so fresh and the pickles on the burger were like homemade. The selection of beer on tap was great. You can taste the beer for no charge! If you have a chance, be sure to visit this pub, it's brilliant!"
The Starry Plough,"Jun 16, 2016","This is THE hang.  Great atmosphere, wide selection of music.  Staff is kind, welcoming and friendly.  The manager especially is really a great guy.  If you're in Berkeley, this is THE place to be.On great music nights, place can be packed and rocking and you'll meet all kinds of great people.  Great food too, and the beer and wine is priced fairly.  Can't say enough good things about The Starry Plough.  It's a Berkeley institution, and absolutely deservedly so."
The Starry Plough,"Jun 13, 2016","The Starry Plough seems like it has been around since as far back as I can remember. It took me leaving the Bay Area to finally come and try it though. After spending a great weekend with my best friend we ended the trip with a beer at the Starry Plough. The beer selection here was really solid. Not the best I've come across, but a solid B at least. There is enough of a variety to please everyone. The food was where they started to loose me. I ordered a nice salad, and it was meh. I know salads aren't generally seen as very sexy or fun, but we are in CA which is known for produce. The salad was also supposed to be seasonal, so I had high hopes for some fresh flavors. Everything just felt sort of flat and drab. Again, I know it is a salad and a poor choice to make, but it just did not live up to the potential I saw on the menu. The service was friendly enough and the atmosphere was very kid friendly. There were kids running around and dancing on the stage. Not super relaxing for the adults, but great for them. Overall it was an ok stop. 42/100"
The Starry Plough,"May 9, 2016","Ego ruins a fun night. A friend and I went here recently for an Irish dance event that they hold on Mondays. We hadn't been in something like 8 years. Apparently the guy that organizes the event (John) didn't like how we were dancing or something and had us kicked out. Apparently, if you're not part of the in crowd, you're not welcome. Don't bother unless you already know people or want to be told exactly what to do. Beer selection was all right, food was ok, but the organizer ruined our night. What a jerk."
The Starry Plough,"May 5, 2016","Yo, The Starry Plough is the best bar near ashby Bart! The people are kind. The people are welcoming. It's a Irish bar that welcomes every race that you may be. Give it a chance and you won't be disappointed. There's great food and good beer and wine at fair prices. They have the most important sport's games on so don't worry about that. Enjoy yo self and relax. Bless !!James Pow"
The Starry Plough,"Apr 20, 2016","This is a funky neighborhood bar with a friendly (and occasionally very odd) group of regulars and alright bar food. As a venue the sound is pretty bad, but the open mic was kind of a bay area legend. I met amazing folks there over the years, lived three doors down, absolutely dreaded going there at times, and was always glad that it survived being a slightly divey bar in a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood (houses there don't really sell for less than seven figures now). Family run, which is nice. The staff in general is pretty rad."
The Starry Plough,"Apr 11, 2016","The food looks really good, but only one star because the kitchen closes three hours before the establishment does. Too bad....."
The Starry Plough,"Apr 3, 2016","This was our first time and absolutely not our last the burgers were incredibly fresh, flavorful, completely delicious! Perfect portion sizes and the beer selection on tap was the perfect addition to our meal, service was great very personable although we came in too soon to enjoy the live music we definitely enjoyed the atmosphere and good vibes, cant wait to come back we will definitely be recommending this to our friends."
The Starry Plough,"Mar 29, 2016",I'll start off by saying the bartender was kind and they do have a great selection of beers. However the food service was not so nice.  It took an offensive amount of time and they were rude to us for asking any questions including for ketchup :\ My recommendation is if you're going for beer and/or show go for it and have fun.  Don't go there expecting a nice meal.
The Starry Plough,"Mar 25, 2016","I would not have loved beer if it weren't for this pub. Through music, dance, and a warm pub atmosphere here in early 2016, I would not have thought I could enjoy beer so much. I mainly go for the stouts but for some reason when one of my friends shared with me the pale ale here, it felt... Good. A word I usually don't associate with beer because my Chinese palate has averted my taste for a long time until this pub made me truly taste happiness.I rate this pub 5 for the social warmth and the fondness of tasting beer here.The food is okay... Sometimes it gets flat and there's too much of it, so I would t come here just for the eats."
The Starry Plough,"Mar 24, 2016","All you would expect from a pub. Good pub food and nice selection of beer. The entrance feels a little tight, but it opens up as you enter."
The Starry Plough,"Feb 29, 2016","The food was good, people friendly - did not go for the music. But having gone in when they opened at 2pm, we only ordered  a couple of sandwiches and they took over 30 minutes. Either put up a sign that the kitchen isn't ready until 2:30 or be ready when you open the place. Then the band began to tune up at 3pm and the squeaking/ volume testing was really hurtful on the ears. Liked the food but there's a lot of good competition out there."
The Starry Plough,"Feb 25, 2016",Great relaxed pub. Friendly staff. Good food and on occasion some really chilled but awesome music and entertainment. Definately stop by.
The Starry Plough,"Feb 17, 2016",I was on Arnold Palmer all the time on Tuesday Open Mic night..Some amazing set of talents right there in Berkeley.. Loved the Original composition.. some folks ran out of chairs to sit.....Will go there again..
The Starry Plough,"Feb 15, 2016","I thought the food was excellent. We had chicken wings, fish and chips, and slaw. The fires were delicious. The apple cider was really excellent. The bar tender was great. The bathroom was old but very clean- we were there on Valentine's Day, early evening. I didn't much like the live music that night which I guess is the reason for 4 not 5 stars. But that's maybe not fair of me. I would return and hope I liked the music more."
The Starry Plough,"Jan 8, 2016","Great bar wherever you are in the bay. Awesome food, and the best pizza I've ever had. Always a good time, especially when there's live music, which is often!"
The Starry Plough,"Dec 29, 2015","I have lived next door to this charming bar and restaurant for the last 5 months. There is always packed with people and the place has a nice atmosphere. Every night there is some kind of event whether it is stand up comedy, Irish folk dance or Thursday funk nights. I have most frequently been there on Thursdays where there is an excellent live band and a good crowd. Come on Thursdays if you like to dance. The beer selection is also good and prices are low. Haven't had the food but it looks deliciously greasy :)"
The Starry Plough,"Dec 28, 2015","Really love this place. The atmosphere is great, staff is super nice and they have a good selection of draft beer. Haven't tried the food, but it looks delicious! Definitely recommend this."
The Starry Plough,"Dec 6, 2015","I'd heard about this place for years. It has a long history. It sounds like it used to be an interesting place. Unfortunately, I can't say much good about it now."
The Starry Plough,"Nov 28, 2015","Incredible food. Excellent service. Great music. Drinks. What more could you want from a bar??  Great place to eat, drink, and be merry. Had the mushroom Swiss burger and Bacon cheddar burger. If you are a burger fan you must check this place out! Also - great fries and dessert (brownie). The rotating tap always keeps things different and interesting!"
The Starry Plough,"Nov 11, 2015","Went here for a show and decided to get dinner here as well. The gentleman who took our order was extremely sweaty, kinda twitchy, and kept scratching his butt. We kept an eye on him to make sure he wasn't preparing our food. Turns out he was and we didn't see him wash his hands... ever. He cooked our pizza and then cut it into tiny quadrilaterals and triangles. Eating this pizza was one of the most awkward dining experiences I've ever had. To make matters worse, the pizza wasn't even good. The dough was undercooked and tasted like it was from a can.Prior to getting our food, we had to go to the bar to order drinks because drinks can't be ordered with food. We also had to wash the plates which were provided because they were dirty. The bands did an excessively long sound check 2 hours prior to the show - like they each played a few songs in their entirety. It was super loud and we were not able to talk during dinner."
The Starry Plough,"Nov 1, 2015",Fun little place to get beer and great pizza. They also have big salads that are good. I enjoyed watching people Irish dance.
The Starry Plough,"Oct 29, 2015","*Bad management, bad system for the open mic, unaware of their own actions, uncaring and unapologetic.*After emailing the manager, I see why my evening was such a bust: he did not know what was going on or care. (Good) He bothered to reply, however, (BAD) he did not apologize or make any attempt at reconciliation. His ""advice"" was to try what we already had done, which he would have known had he read the complaint. He was unaware of the MC's methods even though they were described for him. (See previous review).Asking him to take another look at the original complaint he was more than a little rude in his second reply. No apology, no ""I'll look into that""; only swearing and ""advice"" that was not applicable.Also, after talking with the other two in my group, their food was bad unlike mine, so that's a gamble too."
The Starry Plough,"Oct 19, 2015","Good old fashioned pub food choices like corn beef and cabbage and new ""pub"" food choices. Good wings, fish and chips and burgers, pasta and much more. Live music with ever changing groups.  Nice people and a happy clientele.  Enjoyed everything we ate and drank.  I'd improve the buffalo wings and tartar sauce. A bit yucky."
The Starry Plough,"Oct 9, 2015","They have a very solid beer selection, nice bar atmosphere which seems to be conducive to the live bands they regularly host, and the best burger I've had in the East Bay."
The Starry Plough,"Oct 4, 2015","I had a benefit show at this venue with three separate acts a bit stressful. The staff at The Starry Plough were so helpful and nice, they made sure everything went so smoothly. And it was very much a success. Also the whole vibe at this venue just makes you want to come back. I also had a chance to have some food, it was very good. I would definitely recommend going. Good music, good food, good vibes, nice people."
The Starry Plough,"Oct 1, 2015","Seeing that The Starry Plough is rated well in Berkeley, I expected more. I should probably go back when they are having an Irish Music Night. My three roommates came out with me and I got excited because they have many of my favorite beers there, but the service was poor. I'd go back but I wouldn't drive far to do so."
The Starry Plough,"Sep 22, 2015","Let's begin with their food. Their bacon cheeseburger was just a little messy, but it was the kind of messy that means ""this burger is good"" and it really was. They have a nice beer selection but the bad news is that they don't have any booze that I could see. The atmosphere was ok. They had a stage that was slightly bigger than other Irish pubs that I've been to. But if you like food and beer, you'll like it here."
The Starry Plough,"Sep 15, 2015","Everything about this place makes it my favorite hometown pub. Fantastic Open Mic on Tuesday nights, the employees are always warm and welcoming, food is always spot-on, and has two dart boards that are not usually too crowded. Love it!"
The Starry Plough,"Aug 17, 2015",Sunday night Irish music is the best!The bar also has good food and draught beer
The Starry Plough,"Aug 10, 2015","I'm not sure how many other places you can get great beer, great food, listen to live Irish music, amateur rap, AND get a great dance workout but...this is my favorite one."
The Starry Plough,"Jul 16, 2015",Cozy classic bar great burgersgreat musicyou haven't been to berkeley till you go to the starry plough
The Starry Plough,"Jul 13, 2015","Sunday and Saturday nights here is amazing, live Irish music and dance , lots of warm people and one of the best burgers you can taste, juicy and delicious with that roasted onions and black pepper. ..uuuhShawn is awesome,  he's a great chef and a sweet guy, gives you one of the best burgers in the world.Everybody here is doing their best to bring a smile on your face :)have fun and enjoy lol"
The Starry Plough,"Jul 13, 2015",Master chef Shahin whips up a bomb diggity burger.  Great beer and the best dart boards in town.  Be sure to stop by on open mic night for sick freestyles and awkward comedians!  Shout out to my man Alan Hewitt!!
The Starry Plough,"Jul 6, 2015",Love this place. They have free celtic dancing and the environment is really pleasant overall. You do need to be aggressive to get a drink though. But a lovely neighborhood spot. They do lots of fun alternative entertainments so it never gets boring.
The Starry Plough,"Jun 30, 2015","Great local Irish pub with music and different events on different nights of the week. Definitely a nice change of pace from the 'regular' bar scene. You can come here and have a bite and hang out, or just drink a few beers and chat with the bartenders. Has a nice, homey feel, but can definitely get crowded and louder on Thursday-Sat nights."
The Starry Plough,"Jun 20, 2015","This place is amazing and everything I could ask for in a local pub. The vibe, the people, the food, and the music are all fantastic. Their burgers are to die for, and I've always received great service at the bar and kitchen. I usually stop by on Thursday nights for funk night. The band that plays there continues to deliver quality jams. Glory!"
The Starry Plough,"Jun 16, 2015",I LOVE the Starry Plough!  The burgers are amazing. The beer selection great. Friendly and welcoming place. I always feel at home! So happy to have this place in the East Bay!
The Starry Plough,"Jun 15, 2015","I drove past this corner irish pub as I was slipping my way out of Berkeley after enjoying a wonderful weekend packed full of things that CAL has to offer. Remembering how ppl often ask how I find such cool places, I must be honest and say that often times it is the energy that will pull you in. I visited on a Monday aka Dead-day (in the night life industry). Surprised to see a full house at 8pm. They were hosting Irish dancing lessons- How clever!- and fun. I enjoyed their Rotating Taps which included a number of local brews. (+4pts). They also have the standard Irish-bar beers on taps for those whom have married their brands.In efforts to see if this place was legit I ordered the ""Shepherd's Pie."" The place operates an ""open-kitchen operation,"" which allows patrons to see the chef prepare, and cook the meals (+2 pts)""Samoe"" was my bartender and I felt she was informative and provided others at the bar with quick and friendly service. (+2pts) Off back home to OC. Till next time Bay Area. Go Golden State Warriors!"
The Starry Plough,"May 30, 2015",We stopped by this place on a Sunday afternoon a few months ago because we were in the area and starving. The staff was not very eager to help us and it took a few minutes to get a couple of beers and find a different person to take our food order. We ordered a couple of burgers and sat down to wait. We regretted placing that order less than a minute after sitting down. There was a young man on stage setting up to play. As soon as he began sound checking it was clear that this was his first live gig and the 10-12 people there to see him were obviously his family. When he actually began playing everything got much worse. The food seemed to take forever but that could have been because the torturous sound coming from the stage. Or food finally came and we ate the mediocre fare quickly so we could end our pain by leaving this establishment. Would not go back after this experience.
The Starry Plough,"May 18, 2015","DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I went to this place for dinner and drinks and it was great the first time. Went there a second and it was not nearly the experience. My girlfriend and I went there at about 6 pm not knowing it was slam night but we got there went in, grabbed a table and ordered food. Then when our food was served the door man came up to us and asked for 7 to 10 dollars for a cover charge. We politely told him we were just there for dinner. So he walked away. Then 5 minutes later he came up and asked us again for the 7 to 10 dollar overcharge and we politely told him that we were eating dinner then we were planning on leaving. Every 5 minutes after he would proceed to ask us for the cover charge. So we finished our food and left. When we got to the car I realized I had left my card on tab so I went back. The doorman was joking with his friend and noticed I was walking in when he asked me again for the cover charge. I just politely told him I was there to close my tab and be on my way. So I did and started walking back to my car. Then I noticed the guy that was hanging out with the doorman was following behind me. I got to my car and quickly turned around and went down the street but not before I saw the door mans friend reaching for something in his belt. I assume he was trying to intimidate me but 2 days later I was charged 22$ to my card from The Starry Plough. I called and the manager argued with me, yelled at me and refused to refund my money and to boot told me to f**k off. This place is shady. DO NOT GO HERE."
The Starry Plough,"May 15, 2015","Tastiest bar food in the east bay, great vibes, and beer!  Amazing Wings!"
The Starry Plough,"Apr 27, 2015","I have come here multiple times for shows and it is always a great crowd. The owners are truly invested in supporting local artists. I recently shot a music video in their space, and Shahin went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. Good people, great vibes."
The Starry Plough,"Apr 19, 2015","Very cute little place, although it is not the place to go if you plan to have a lot of conversation. The music is very loud, but a very enjoyable experience! The Guiness tasted a little off, but the food was delicious and the portions were generous!! Love the authentic pub vibe the place gives off. Definitely recommend grabbing a friend or two and checking this place out!!"
The Starry Plough,"Apr 10, 2015","Visiting from out of town and had a great time here!  Everyone was really friendly, and as a Chico(CA) resident, it's refreshing visiting a bar with no tension or bad vibes!  Owner is very nice and went out of his way to make sure I was having a good time after meeting me.  I always try to support local businesses when I visit places so this was a great place to get the Bay Area experience! Food was good, and entertainment was fun!  Place for all kinds of kinds, everyone got along and was nice, and I normally frequent country bars!  Thanks for having me, I'll be back!"
The Starry Plough,"Apr 8, 2015","This place is pretty sweet. Irish music every month, shepherd's pie, beer. Yeah, not much I don't like here. The floor can be a little sticky and seating on the music nights can be a wee bit sticky, but that adds to the whole experience."
The Starry Plough,"Apr 8, 2015","I love this place.  I hadn't gone for a long time for the Sunday evening Irish music jam, and I don't know why it took so long to go back.  Everyone is very friendly, the music is great, and they have the usual fare of tasty pub food."
The Starry Plough,"Mar 29, 2015","We had the fish and chips and I really enjoyed the chips. The fish was too rich for me at the time, but moist.The buffalo wings were good but the ranch sauce seemed to be missing something and my husband agreed. We used the tartar sauce that came with the fish fry instead. I also would have liked more meat on the wings. Overall they were satisfying.Oh the Guinness though! Winner! Looking forward to coming back to try other items!"
The Starry Plough,"Mar 28, 2015","We waited an hour to be served. Multiple parties ordered and were served while we waited. Staff was not apologetic, excuses excuses."
The Starry Plough,"Mar 9, 2015","Fish & Chips battered in Anchor Steam beer, Swine Burgers dripping in Pork goodness and the Quinoa Black Bean burger is off the chain!!!Come for the beer, slam poetry, folk dancing and friends. Stay for the radical commitment to leftist ways of life!!!"
The Starry Plough,"Feb 26, 2015","I've been coming here for a couple of years now, and with good reason! Consistent genuine service, awesome live music, and the owners of this establishment sincerely care about the atmosphere and overall customer satisfaction. If you're in the area, the Starry Plough is a must!"
The Starry Plough,"Feb 14, 2015","Fantastic lamb sandwich as one of the daily specials. Friendly service, home cut fries, and great beer selection on tap. My one big complaint is that the music is always way too loud! I feel like I can't wait to get out of there just to hear myself think again. I'll be back though, great pub food is needed in this area!"
The Starry Plough,"Feb 8, 2015","I love how lively this place is.I recently went on a Wednesday for the Berkeley Slam Finals and had a great time laughing with everyone. I just loved the chill laid-back feel of the place. It was really interactive and the MC was hilarious.I was also hungry though so I ordered the Jalapeño stuffed bleu cheese burger. OMG it was SO juicy and SO delicious. It was definitely messy trying to eat it with my hands but OH SO GOOD. The fries were a bit salty but they were still really tasty. All the food that I saw around me looked really yummy too.This really is a great place to hang out. They have two dart boards, a HUGE collection of board games, and a stage for live music/poetry. What more could you ask for?I definitely want to come back on a Tuesday for the open mic though!"
The Starry Plough,"Jan 31, 2015",Food was outstanding. The spicy fish sandwich and fries were yummy.  The music was some of our favorites.
The Starry Plough,"Jan 30, 2015","Love this place! Great scene, super quirky, and really good food!!"
The Starry Plough,"Jan 30, 2015",Awesome fish & chips at a very reasonable price. Sunday night music featured a Scottish tune amid the all the Irish! And the Guinness Float - a delight!
The Starry Plough,"Jan 28, 2015",I am made to feel comfortable here. The staff are pleasant and outgoing as well as professional. I feel right at home. Good eats are very inexpensive. I love the house salad.
The Starry Plough,"Jan 21, 2015","Great local joint, LOVE the poetry slams! Nice sense of community, not pretentious. Nice beer selection, but the food left much to be desired... it's at least well priced, but I'd prefer to pay a couple $$ more for something outstanding!"
The Starry Plough,"Jan 12, 2015","Smack N Cheese- amazing smoky sweet bacon and garlic on big cheesy shell pasta. SO GOOD.Also great tunes. What a delight, going to listen to good musicians jamming together, and lovely singing as well, in English and Gaelic!"
The Starry Plough,"Dec 16, 2014","Live music/performance just about every night and there's just enough beers on tap to make the night enjoyable. I actually came on a night when there was a decent country band, though the crowd wasn't  very lively. Personally, I'd only come by if there was a band I wanted see because the this is what they do best; live music, beer and greasy food."
The Starry Plough,"Dec 6, 2014","Awesome buffalo wings, it is lemon ish i believe and after being over you are just craving for more. Great selection of bands and beers. The crowd is energetic and accepting of new company. Love all the revolutionary signs on the walls!"
The Starry Plough,"Nov 28, 2014","Starry Plough was needed. Enjoying my Lagunitas, stuffed from the delicious Fish n Chips, and melting into the sound of the bands playing tonight is therapy (Otto + Moaners, Robbie Dunbar, TV Mike + Scarecrows). Hard to find a place and crowd like this in Berkeley."
The Starry Plough,"Nov 20, 2014","I LOVE this place! Great burgers, cold beer and fantastic music. The vibe is really chill. Staff is always really nice. Musicians set up around tables and jam for hours. People come in and out to play. It's great! Hometown feel in the big city!"
The Starry Plough,"Oct 11, 2014","Holy crap this place is the best. Mushroom swiss burger with the garlic fries. If I could eat that for the rest of my life I would die happy. They make my favorite burger in the bay area! And its my favorite happy-hour drinking hole, so they get 5 stars.They have great open mics, too! So many talented people and a lot of familiar faces that come back every week. I have never been disappointed with any show I've seen here, though sometimes I do wish the sound guy was more on-top of things or people would shut up and actually listen to the music. The Possum Family was always a blast, though, such great energy."
The Starry Plough,"Oct 5, 2014","Found this gem thanks to yelp! Was instantly amazed once I walked in! Super friendly//helpful staff, awesome menu with healthy and local food//very peaceful//upbeat atmosphere//tables in front of the stage and my favorite of all.... Christmas lights hanging, a very simple addition but beautiful touch :) I also loved that my friend and I were told we could choose between $8-$15 dollars tonget in anf that part of it would go to the musicians. Score. The music we heard here tonight was ne of a kind and the hard apple cider was scrumptious.  Can't wait to come back!"
The Starry Plough,"Oct 2, 2014",Bacon cheeseburger w/side salad = heaven on a bun. 510 Burger ain't got shit on Landis & Donnie.This is definitely Berkeley's pub equivalent of Cheers. Everyone is super friendly and the regulars know your face even if they don't know your name. ;)
The Starry Plough,"Sep 21, 2014",Love this place. Cool vibes. Went with my friend Kelsie for the food on a Sunday and the servers were awesome. What we didn't know is that it was youth singing day. The kids did a kick ass job. I wish I would have paid attention fully but it was hard because the Seahawks were playing the Broncos and Peyton Manning scored a touchdown and a two point conversion with 58 seconds left. I love the kids but they gotta understand that peyton manning is a balla.
The Starry Plough,"Sep 17, 2014","Sorry Plough. You are no longer starry.My wife and I came back after a few years of absents. This place really has gone down hill.  It is NOT the food, service or music lineup. It is your patrons. The Plough was a place to go have a pint and listen to some good music. That was then. Now, you cannot even hear the music anymore with the crowd shouting over the musicians. After most every band we would talk to the band members. We will tell them we came to hear them play but could not hear a note. They were sadden too that they were voiced over by all of the rude people. Like many other places in the Bay Area it get taken over by Hipsters and Techies.  They do not come to places like the Starry Plough for what makes them cool and unique. They come and invade a place because it is a ""cool"" and hip place without caring on why.  Sorry Starry Plough...  You no longer shine"
The Starry Plough,"Aug 3, 2014","Ok. I tried the veggie chili. $4 for a generous ""bowl""--a great deal! I took it to go and it was a lot of food, especially since I had it with a big piece of toast and a whole avocado. I could have saved half of it for another meal but I pigged out. So, if you're on the fence, jump off and get yourself some of their veggie food!"
The Starry Plough,"Jul 6, 2014","Plus: delicious garlic fries and burgers.Big minus: the $8 buffalo wings gets you 4 wings. That's right. After tax and tip, you're looking at THREE DOLLARS PER CHICKEN WING. I thought this was a bar for the working class ;p"
The Starry Plough,"Jul 5, 2014","The most character filled, lively heartwarming pub ever! Great food! Great service! Open mic night is the place to be on Tuesday"
The Starry Plough,"Jun 17, 2014","I'm leaving a review for the sole reason (as usual) that multiple people have give a terrific place poor reviews.  First off, the food is amazing.  It's not necessarily healthy, or incredibly varied (and there pizza can be hit or miss), but the many burgers and fries are truly exceptional and a massive improvement on the previous options (5+ yrs ago).  The people who work here are not surly or mean and the bartender and head cook are both incredibly nice guys (the bar tender must have been having a bad day or something when those below came to visit).  The music and Irish-themed dancing and jam nights are one-of-a-kind in the east bay and deserve praise by themselves, but on top of that they give bands that are just getting into the bay area music scene a place to showcase their talents and provide a venue for poetry (really, you didn't like the poets, so you bashed the bar!).  Open mic usually draws a large and young crowd, so avoid Tuesday nights if you're into a more intimate setting and thur-sat band nights often has a cover.I will agree with a couple reviewers that its difficult to get a table on a busy night, but I recommend playing some darts (rarely being used) until one opens up.  The decor is awesome (if you're into Ireland) and the prices are very reasonable.  The only other thing I will concede is that a whiskeyless Irish bar is a bit laughable, but this is one of my favorite bars in berkeley and not to be missed."
The Starry Plough,"Jun 8, 2014","Seen all the pics from prior patrons. Everything looked delicious, but we were sadly disappointed. We were in town and wanted to experience the pubs atmosphere and food. As we entered the establishment we were greeted by a very kind drunk gentleman. When we mentiomed to him we were there to eat and listen to the musicians, we realized that all the seating was taken by people not eating or drinking.There were empty tables with no chairs. Too bad, you lost 8 customers who are supporters of local businesses."
The Starry Plough,"Apr 26, 2014",I came up and visited my friend who lives down the street from this awesome pub. When I walked in there were musicians playing live music which is always a treat! The food was amazing!! I had the Reuben Sandwich with garlic fries and I was not disappointed! I'm a big time snob when it comes to Reuben's. I also had an excellent Kona Brewing Co. Porter to wash it all down! Excellent and quick service in all. This Irish American girl is super happy that I had my dinner here!
The Starry Plough,"Apr 24, 2014",Great selection of beers and live music. Plough burger was amazing. Nice crew behind the bar too!
The Starry Plough,"Apr 18, 2014","Lovely neighborhood bar. Found myself chatting with the owner/founder randomly during the World Series last year. Stories of revolutionary roots and clandestine trips to Nicaragua in the 80's. Great place to watch a big sporting event, and some of the live acts are amazing, although it can be hit-or-miss depending on the night. Food is decent for bar food, but don't expect gourmet quality. Just glad this place is here and continues to be an anchor in the community."
The Starry Plough,"Mar 10, 2014","The Ploughman Burger has redefined what a burger can and should be. Most of the time meat is diminished by grinding, but this is a patty that remembers that it used to be steak . . . juicy, tender, delicious steak.The Plough is also a great venue for live music, and I've seen some of my favorite local bands perform, while enjoying their extensive beer selection."
The Starry Plough,"Mar 4, 2014",An Irish pub that doesn't serve whiskey makes me want to weep.That is all.
The Starry Plough,"Feb 18, 2014","Amazing hidden gem! Great food, live music and darts! I got the best salad and mac and cheese i have ever had in my whole life! Not to mention the beer is awesome. Loved the feel of this pub! would definitely make this a weekly meal spot!"
The Starry Plough,"Feb 8, 2014","So. I ended up on a late Friday night. Hungry and not ready to end my Friday at home alone. I chose starry plough instead, hoping for burgers, beer, and live music. What did I get instead? Beer, burgers, and new local spot. Burger is delicious. Homemade pickles, pickled for only 24 hrs, the sesame seed bun adds a great flavor and grease to the bun. Fries are good, I am guesisng also house-made.  Also they have root beer on tap. Where did my burger go? Oh. My stomach! Service is great. Kitchen closes at around 10:30."
The Starry Plough,"Jan 19, 2014","Amazing bands. Awesome service. Cool place to enjoy a pint with a friend and listen to funk, jazz and whatever else happens to be on its way through. Shaheed and the other bartenders are some of the nicest people I have met. Great all around place"
The Starry Plough,"Jan 18, 2014","Who'd a thought anyone could have this much fun in Berkeley.  This is a great venue to listen to music and they offer great pub food too.  The preformances are eclectic, so check out their schedule of events, there's something for everyone, just choose a night."
The Starry Plough,"Jan 16, 2014","Awesome place to enjoy a night of slam poetry! I've been here on several occasions for their Wednesday night poetry slams, needless to say this is the place to be for such gathering. The performers are all regular peeps who come to share their voices/words with others. It's great, I love it. There are sometimes live bands/djs too. Pretty great place to enjoy live entertainment.Not to mention the food here is pretty darn good. Everything is prepared fresh daily, or from what I observed they seem to be. The fries were cut on the spot. You know this isn't your typical kind of bar food cause they actually take time preparing the food. The burgers here are fat and filling. I was very pleased. Their cheesy pulled pork fries were pretty tasty too! Oh, and the bar is pretty awesome too. The beers are about $5 a pop. Pretty decently priced for a bar.If you're ever in this area, and love poetry etc etc check Starry Plough out!"
The Starry Plough,"Jan 8, 2014","The best thing about the Starry Plough is that it's constantly booked with eccentric performers. In turn, it draws very eclectic audiences. Open mics, 80s cover bands, celtic music, americana singer/songwriters, poetry slams, funk, local band album release parties. Chances are, if you wander in here, you'll end up being entertained by something. It's walking distance from Ashby BART, but also pretty easy to find street parking out front. The venue is relatively dive-y, the walls are covered with posters, both musical and political, and they typically charge a cash only cover on a sliding scale. The stage takes up a nice portion of the room, but there aren't an abundance of seats facing it  since a lot of space is claimed by tables. If you're not in it for the long haul, there's plenty of standing room and stools along the bar. Sound is usually decent. I wouldn't say that cleanliness is their strong suit, but they undoubtedly have a vibe. In the way of alcohol, your main options consist of draft beer, more draft beer, and some bottled beer - everything from Guinness to PBR. If you were wondering, they've got deals on pitchers and pints during happy hour/until 7 pm. If you don't like beer, you're left to choose from their house wines. Weirdest part? It's an Irish pub that doesn't serve whiskey. Yes, you read that correctly.I've never eaten any of the pub fare, but I've seen them serve up huge cheeseburgers and fries, piles of saucy wings, giant sandwiches, fish and chips, even calamari. The last time I was here, one of my buddies ordered some burger monstrosity with jalapeños and blue cheese. I think it's safe to say that if you're looking for greasy eats to accompany your brew, you won't have to look far. I'd come back to see a friend play a gig here, but otherwise, I'll leave the whiskey free zone to the troubadours and world music buffs."
The Starry Plough,"Dec 23, 2013","The Starry Plough is truly a great venue for intimate live music events with a wide variety of talent, room to dance without being judged, and great acoustics.  This past Sunday, I caught two musicians that will keep me coming back to Starry Plough again and again:Into the Pacific: http://tinyurl.com/intothepacific (My favorites are ""Hold Fast,"" ""From the Start"" and ""Sunrise, Sunset.""  Esteban's voice is amazing and he plays the bass and foot drum while singing the songs he wrote.)andI.R.: https://www.youtube.com/user/IRfiq1 (My favorites are ""Driftin"" http://tinyurl.com/l2vjvzq and this other song I sadly can't identify but really enjoyed.)I've been to Starry Plough a few times before this and have always enjoyed the vibe, but I was always a little unhappy with how long it took to get the food.  Now I just try to plan better and order food way before I even think I am hungry.  Another minor complaint is that the Starry Plough only offers beer and wine, but that is really just a minor complaint because the beer selection is solid.To summarize, if you catch a great live music act, you will absolutely have a 5-star experience at the Starry Plough. Otherwise, it might be more of a 3-star experience, which is A-OK to me."
The Starry Plough,"Dec 18, 2013",I came here on a Tuesday evening for the weekly poetry slam. Beautiful neighborhood. Awesome event. Good beer. Easy parking not too far away
The Starry Plough,"Dec 17, 2013","From the awesome food menu to the extensive tap selection, from the great free shows to the awesome staff (What up Shaheen(s)!), this place has it going on. If you ever find yourself in South Berkeley and looking for good people and a warm, friendly environment with a rich history, be sure to stop into the Starry Plough!The blue cheese stuffed jalapeño burger is bangin'!"
The Starry Plough,"Dec 12, 2013","Best burgers ever!  With house made pickles yummmm.  Very good soup made from scratch, too."
The Starry Plough,"Dec 9, 2013",The starry plough is my favorite place to go for pub food and great beer on tap... All the burgers pizzas appetizers are amazing and the new rotating taps are awesome... With live entertainment every night and usually reasonably priced cover charges I try to stop by whenever I'm in Berkeley these days... Definitely recommend stopping in for a beer or a burger anytime in the neighborhood
The Starry Plough,"Dec 7, 2013","After driving past this place multiple times, we finally ventured in. Upon walking in, I made the joke that it must be senior night, as there were mostly patrons upwards of 60 years inside. We still went for it, and I'm so glad we did!! Root beer on tap?! Dear god, yes! I had the mushroom-Swiss burger, my boyfriend had the bleu-jalapeño burger. He tasted both (I don't like jalapeño) and said mine was better. I know that mine was STELLAR. We also made a special request (which I didn't realize was special at the time, because I read a bunch of menus earlier that night) for chili cheese fries. The fries were AWESOME!! There was a group of older what I can only lovingly call hippies playing live music too, and we just sat, grubbed, and enjoyed. We will be back!"
The Starry Plough,"Nov 17, 2013","I went here for Open Mike night with friends and it was a very fun and comfortable environment with people of all ages there but mostly 25 to 30 yr olds...luckily my friends were all in the 30 range so my old self was just fine...the bartender was super friendly and made a big deal about my friends BDay which made her feel super special. There were some very talented performers and we were even treated to a song from the lead singer of a popular local band. I plan to go back and try the food one of these days and maybe a song or two? Yeah, right."
The Starry Plough,"Nov 3, 2013",5 orales. Come in and try it. A cold beer and a phat burger. And anyone you order is great!  All kinds of beer to choice from. Super friendly people that serve you...
The Starry Plough,"Sep 24, 2013",It's no fun when the MC thinks he's powerful and invisible just because he has a microphone... It doesn't  help either that the mc is more drunk than most of the patrons on a Tuesday... Truly lost faith in you star plough :( #bringbackjulie
The Starry Plough,"Sep 24, 2013","Great spot for a brew (no liquor!), especially some harder to come-by Irish beers (like Kilkenny).  The crowd is usually really friendly and laid back, and everything is priced just right.  It gets pretty packed and noisy as a concert venue, but on its own this place is pretty fun."
The Starry Plough,"Sep 22, 2013",Open mic night is weird but fun. Decent beer selection at very reasonable prices. I like the space over all and I'm definitely going to eat here at some point soon.
The Starry Plough,"Sep 19, 2013","Love this place! Great atmosphere, tasty food & beer, and awesome live music! No complaints here!"
The Starry Plough,"Sep 7, 2013","This place really shocked me - the food is really good! Came here last night for a concert (only $5 cover and a GREAT show!) and I wasn't expecting good food. For whatever reason I have found the best concert venues often have substandard food. So after grabbing drinks and wanting to fill my stomach I cautiously ordered a Big Kahuna Burger (bonus points on the name!) and some Calamari for my wife. We got given a number and only a few minutes later our food arrived! Impressive considering the huge crowds of people there for the show that night.Oh my gosh was that Big Kahuna Burger ever AMAZING! It was juicy, perfectly cooked (not too dry) and bursting with flavor. My wife had a similar reaction with the Calamari; it was crispy batter and juicy on the inside. I think she said it was the best she has had in months. The atmosphere is hip; posters on the walls from past and present, and just a cool place to hang out. There were lots of beers on tap and the prices were more than reasonable. Also the people there had personality! For instance when the runner dropped off our food he said we were number 3, and now he was making us number 2, and should we get lucky we might even get to be #1. It was quirky and fun. I love it!Will be back!Oh also worth noting:- Lots of free street parking nearby- Kitchen closes at 10pm most nights (so come earlier for food)- Cover is cash only- Arrive early to get seats; this place gets busy!"
The Starry Plough,"Sep 7, 2013",This place is amazing with some great people and hella good food!!! This pub has a lot of room and really good deals! Come here if you want a good time! The wings are amazing btw
The Starry Plough,"Aug 19, 2013","Rated the best open mic in the East Bay 2013! (Every tuesday no cover 7:30ish) they also have one of the best poetry nights as well. (Every Wednesday night $8 cover)(UPDATE) THURSDAY ""FONK"" NIGHT IS FULL OF LIVE GLORIOUS MUSIC. IT'S A GREAT NEW ADDITION AND A MUST SEE FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE FUNK. DANCING IS PERMITTED. Always an eclectic crowd. Always a good time, even better when the school's back in session. Really good pub food. I would try any of the burgers or fries. Everything they serve has the ""oh shit"" factor since they are always generous with the toppings. The staff is always really nice and on their game. (Cheers)If they served liquor at this place it would most likely break into an all out riot, even on weeknights. The Starry Plough has my heart. I absolutely adore this place."
The Starry Plough,"Aug 5, 2013",This was delicious!  I especially loved the garlic fries!  The gentleman cooking and serving the food was wonderful and accommodating as well :)
The Starry Plough,"Aug 1, 2013","The Starry Plough is like a second home to me. I have been coming to the Berkeley Poetry Slam since I was 16--the pub is one of the friendliest, warmest environments you are likely to ever come across. The food is delicious, perfect munchie food--the beer selection is huge and the events they host, such as the slam, are all fascinating/powerful stuff. Highly recommend."
The Starry Plough,"Jul 30, 2013","Great beer selection and delicious pub food at a good price.  Burger and fries are solid, as well as the fish and chips.  Considering the dearth of good restaurants in the neighborhood, this place is an oasis.Left-wing propaganda, classic beer ads, and Irish decor cover the walls.  Live music quite regularly that ranges from catchy to jesus-christ-I-just-want-to-have-a-pint-with-my-friends-without-this-noise.  Very Berkeley."
The Starry Plough,"Jul 14, 2013","Great bar food, best fish-and-chips I've had in the East Bay, French fries would be worth a trip to the Starry Plough, burger and cole slaw surprisingly yummy, two different hard ciders on tap plus many ales, all priced inexpensively.  It's a funky place with a genuine feel.  We went to open mike Tuesday night, and as one would expect, the acts were variable, but some of the talent was exceptionally fine, perhaps a bit much hip-hop early in the going when the younger performers take the stage.  I give it five stars for the quality of the food and drink at low prices."
The Starry Plough,"Jul 4, 2013","The spicy fish sandwich is awesome! Plus, the bartender was nice, happy, friendly, and attentive. My experience here made me feel like I was actually in stereotypical Berkeley...and it was a good thing!"
The Starry Plough,"Jul 2, 2013","Really great music, really great vibes, really great burgers.Come on down to the Starry Plough.One of my favorite places around.  The Wednesday Night poetry slam is kind of lame when they start shushing people - but, overall, it's a fun time to be had by all.Try and negotiate a price if they're asking a cover for some of the better bands."
The Starry Plough,"May 29, 2013","Love the owners. Great vibe and music. kinda random, but in a great way."
The Starry Plough,"May 29, 2013","The response from Starry Plough is hilarious. The guy writing this seem to be the cook who jumped out of the kitchen and called the woman a 'Bitch' in ear of all surrounding tables including ours.  He cooked our food too and was wearing a white apron. When told to go away after pouncing in and swearing and yelling at the lady, he puffed up his chest and practically stomped his foot saying 'I'm the OWNER! I'm the OWNER!' He wasn't there, didn't know anything that was going on first hand yet was frothing at the mouth to support the weenie in the Jeff Campbell band's version of things and to play at power tripping. Any woman is entitled to push someone away who is inappropriately getting in her space as that asshole from the Jeff Campbell band was. She was sitting in HER seat minding her business when he harassed her while she was trying to listen to the guy on stage. He didn't like her asking him to shut up and she wasn't even the first one that had that night. The Jeff Campbell jerk had a totally different lady ask him to shut up earlier as he talked through the entirety of  Freedy's set and all the Jeff Campbell guy did is get up from his table and go chat more at the bar where the other lady eventually asked him to be quiet. The Jeff Campbell musician was an asshole to another musician as well as the people trying to listen and 100% provoked the situation with the second lady by hassling her at her table, and then was a big drama baby about it. Nobody was hurt and the jerk deserved to be pushed.  I gotta think he's embarrassed how this went down as both he and the bar look really bad. I gather even the cops laughed about being called. When I and other customers suggested this was not a big deal to this cook guy when he was threatening the lady sitting in her chair with cops he would not listen to us or any other patrons. The offended little Napoleon cook 'owner' was hell bent at that point on pulling his power trip to evict her. Many customers were appalled and one even got up and gave a speech to the crowd about how wrong it was before HE was threatened with being thrown out.  None of these people knew each other before but I've got to say, I feel like I made some friends. Its the old adage when good people stand up to a wrong and all that.  A long time customer of the bar  who was a local neighbor was also trying to intervene,  and told us that the real owner, this dude's father, was home in Walnut Creek that night and if he'd been at his bar none of this would have happened as the real owner was in the habit of habitually yelling out  'Quiet at the Bar' when necessary.  The local guy also mentioned that there had been some 'trouble' with the son being too big for his britches before. This bar is a nightmare of cacophony and only very loud bands should ever consider gigging there.  All these people were trying to help solve the problem that was becoming more and more apparent to everyone was the bad call of the bar in supporting the bad behavior of the Jeff Campbell guy. In any case, lets hope there is someone in charge over there soon who knows how to run a bar as this cook not only doesn't even know how to cook well but along with the guy from the Jeff Campbell band was the only one that night who was vulgar, rude and disrespectful and certainly didn't know how to defuse a ridiculous situation in an appropriate and professional manner - his ego appears to have  seriously gotten in the way. Maybe he has a future in Daddy promoting him to door man where he can have folks thrown out to his hearts content. There is a blow by blow account of this silly melee  being circulated to music fans by the guy who made the impromptu speech to the crowd that is the funniest thing I've read in awhile - neither The Starry Plough or the Jeff Campbell Band come off well and neither are making friends or fans from this night. Yelp could have been an opportunity for the Bar to save some face and apologize but instead they've stupidly doubled down."
The Starry Plough,"May 29, 2013","Starry Plough is definitely a one of a kind spot!  Great atmosphere, tasty food and wonderful staff! I don't go as often as I would like to but when I do my friends and I enjoy ourselves.  They always have great bands performing and definitely worth the small cover they charge. If you want to have a chill and awesome time in Berkeley this is the spot!!!!"
The Starry Plough,"May 29, 2013","Love this place.  I've been coming here for a few years now.  If you're in the area, stop by for a drink and some great food.  Good beers on tap, good prices, and there's usually entertainment, ranging from open mic to irish dancing to poetry slams.  Friendly staff and patrons, too!"
The Starry Plough,"May 29, 2013","I've been coming to the Starry Plough religiously for nearly 4 years. I come for the ceili dance on Monday nights. It's a fantastic group of people! I love feeling like a regular. Shahin and the kitchen staff are constantly tweaking and upgrading the menu. The Teriyaki Burger is fantastic! I haven't been to many of the other events the pub holds, I come up from Castro Valley. But Monday Night Ceili and the Trad session on Sundays are awesome. There's something going on here nearly every night, and chances are the game of your choice will be on the screen above the bar! Being in this room for the Giants World Series win in 2010 was goose bump inducing!"
The Starry Plough,"May 27, 2013","I was  not impressed with most of the food. The root beer was very tasty and the burger was nicely prepared with hand cut fries. Pizza was just ok.We ordered calamari and it was so rubbery that I took it up to the counter and told the cook it wasn't eddible. When I told him about it his reply was ""we must of cooked it to long"". He took the basket back but didn't offer to take it off my bill or replace it with something else. Later he hands me a half a basket of more calamari and said he had some  left over from a order to try this one it might be better. We ordered dessert and the Bread pudding was awful..I ate the vanilla ice cream. The cream brulee was 3 tiny cups. About a tablespoon each. One was ok. amount tiny.  Go for the music and ale what a bar is known for."
The Starry Plough,"May 27, 2013","What an awesome, albeit, unassuming little gem! You would think dive bar from the outside, but once you enter? Its a quaint little bar lined with posters from upcoming artists and politics from yester year alike. Yummy Irish beers filled our glasses (on tap) all night long. Oh yeah, did I mention the amazing smells coming from the kitchen? Or the fact that they had live Irish music filling our drunken ears?! Im so paying a visit my next time in the  Berk!"
The Starry Plough,"May 10, 2013","Who woulda thunk it.  BEST WINGS EVER??  Craziness.We got 4 orders of em (for 2 people) Yeah, they were that good.  FYI: I got the sauce on the side, and no extra flour ""dustings"".  (see pic)  Note: After 8 pm, they have a weird sliding scale cover.  It's strange.  I didn't understand it.  But didn't really have to deal with it.  If I have to pay to get in, in order to eat wings, I probably wouldn't go back.BEER & WINE (limited) ONLY Bands were entertaining.  Sound setup was good.  As a band, it's a cool place to play."
The Starry Plough,"May 2, 2013","Stumbled upon this place one Friday night. Very pleased with the live music selection. Cover fee was a bit much, but definitely a cool spot."
The Starry Plough,"Apr 15, 2013","*** BOMB ASS BURGER ALERT ***Yeah, there's a bar and a stage and all that jazz but what really matters is that this place has the best burger in the universe! It's a herbaceous, meaty, slab of greed and food beckoned sluttyness. The 1st bite delivers you and the last sends you plummeting into the realization that the experience is over. This burger begets fatness. If all burgers tasted like this burger we would all look like the people in Wall-E and make little burger shrines that worship the mighty Angus and Kobe. The economy would fall into despair and cow meat would become a tool for barter.  Why does this burger taste so fucking good?!!!?I am 79% - 95% certain that this burger is a secret mechanism for world domination. Beware of the sweet, savory rivulets of grease that sumptuously slide down your cheek like dirty tears of joy as you obliviously nosh your way to oblivion. The impending calamity of  fatty grief and food snob ruin will be your only fate."
The Starry Plough,"Apr 13, 2013","We checked out the Starry Plough Pub since I had 2 tickets to see some band Th 4/11/13.  It's walking distance from Ashby Bart so you don't need to drive.They have a bar & sell food.  B. got fried calamari $6 - he ate a bunch & gives it 2 stars, it was crispy, but didn't taste like calamari, I didn't try it.  He also got 2 glasses of red wine - he seemed to like it.Band - was forgettable.  Bring earplugs!! otherwise you'll go Deaf!!  They charge you to hear the band - Not free.  Sliding scale, I think she said $6-12 when we went.After that band we left, but there was suppose to be a bunch more until Midnight!If I lived closer maybe I'd go back, not in any hurry."
The Starry Plough,"Apr 11, 2013","This is the best open mic in Berkeley. When i was living in Oakland we came here twice a week. Awesome ambiance, great crowd every Tuesday. the food is amazing. they recently changed the menu and hired a new chef who is killin it in the kitchen. Home made aioli on their fish sandwich, the meat was superb quality and the portion was gigantic. They have tons of beers on draft as well as a few bottles of good wine. Fortunately they don't serve hard liquor. and the music"
The Starry Plough,"Apr 6, 2013","This review is based on the buzzkill that 'ploughed' into my evening last night. ""Captain F--king Sandy.""Place looked busy, solid 4 stars on Yelp, driven past the 'Plough' (am I cool enough to call it that yet?) at least 50 times, why not be all urban 'n shit and check this block out.I stepped into this joint and some woman on a barstool was all... ""something something some-band, and the suggested something is $10 - $15 sliding scale."" SLIDING SCALE?We had NO idea what she was on about, but apparently venues don't pay artists for the bands these days - only unsuspecting patrons, trying out bars for the first time (or fans of the bands, who apparently knew they were playing that night) do.Note to the future semi-sober party people trying to escape the reality of this place after paying $10 on the sliding scale unwillingly. This place serves up ONLY the finest BEER and WINE - ONLY. None of that get rich quick liquor.  The real estate (seating) was all booked up, so myself, my husband and his similarly named coworker all stood about trying to finish our beers ASAP to get further into the 'starry' bit of it.Done, done and done. Never returning. Unless... nope never returning. Well, unless - I'm driving down Shattuck and accidentally run over one of their patrons or something and need someone to call 911, because they seemingly alway cross the crosswalk at night in the dark out front of this place without looking for cars.Also, question of the century, why would the sliding scale have a limit of how much you can donate? This is not a scalable solution for the bands playing at this venue.I'll see myself out."
The Starry Plough,"Apr 4, 2013","Couldn't ask for a better local pub! Lovely, warm, happy atmosphere and always some kind of live music or event going on. Open Mic nights on Tuesday are really fun but also super crowded! The food is amazing: they make a delicious, honest burger and the man who does the homemade sauces is some kind of wizard. Staff are friendly and in general just really gracious people, which is kind of a rare thing these days. Go grab dinner or relax with a beer or catch a show - or better yet all three! - and you'll have a grand time!"
The Starry Plough,"Mar 30, 2013","Cozy little tavern with 23 beers on draft, various cheep pub grub and most Irish staples.  Most evenings they have a live band, open mic or poetry slam.  Pick up an events calendar at the bar.  Plus, they have dart boards!"
The Starry Plough,"Mar 19, 2013","Anything with pesto here is amazing, and the service and scene works well whether you are out for the night or just grabbing a beer. The BBQ sauce is the bees knees and if you make it on Open Mic night, the stage is yours! Shahin's the best bartender in town as well, so if you want a pint poured right talk to him. Tip!"
The Starry Plough,"Mar 13, 2013","I would like to complain about the booking person.  I have been trying to book my band at the Starry Plough Pub for months.  I think the band is a good fit for this venue; however, the booking person ""Michele Kappel-Stone"" doesn't even reply to my emails.   This is so disappointing!"
The Starry Plough,"Mar 7, 2013","I adore this tavern not only for its revolution like theme, but mainly for the poetry slams it has been housing for god only knows how long. I have been frequenting the poetry slam for at least 15 years now and you must give credit not only to the friendly bar tender but also the poets that have made this a home to artist, writers, and great thinkers... As well as great drinkers of course. This place has a good hold on my heart. The location in Berkeley is also suiting, because what's a Berkeley adventure without meeting unique people and off the beaten road dive like places. Seriously though, don't mistake this as a dive bar. It is much more than that and not that at all. It's absolutely incredible, and do not pass up the garlic fries as they alone are also worth the visit."
The Starry Plough,"Mar 6, 2013","OMG! I can't stop thinking about the Bacon Cheese Burger I had on Sunday.  Man the bacon was meaty (not crispy) The burger was well seasoned and the roll/bun was buttery and toasty! The Aoli was delicious! The fries were hot straight out the grease! Man I can't wait to go back and get another one.  The only thing was my meat was done before my bread, which at the end didn't matter so much because the roll/bun is so delicous it was a great way to top it off.  OH and the tomatoes on the burger where delicious.  And the Pub owner is easy on the eyes! Plus he helped me find my favorite boots I left there after a show last month I thought they were gone forever!  I'll be back!"
The Starry Plough,"Feb 25, 2013","The location of this place is great, especially if you live in Oakland and loathe going into the depths of Berkeley to be entertained.I went on Friday to see my friend's band, Emily Bonn and the Vivants, headline that night. We got there before the first band even went on, and the place was packed! The beers on tap were pretty good and relatively inexpensive ($5?), though bar service wasn't always that fast for how busy the place was. The sound was fairly well done, though I'm not sure it was optimized for the kind of music that was being played that night (folk & bluegrass).It was a good time all around, and I'd go back in a heartbeat for more shows."
The Starry Plough,"Feb 18, 2013","This is a stupendous gathering place for friends! The atmosphere is very relaxed and there is a full bar with a great bartender.  The best part of the pub for me is the food.  The traditional pub food is done amazingly well!  You can't go wrong with any of the hamburgers. The bread is freshly made, the meat is cooked perfectly and the pickles are made there!  All of the staff are also very nice and helpful! I would most assuredly recommend stopping by for a burger and some relax time!"
The Starry Plough,"Feb 11, 2013","Ya know, it rare that I find such a comfy bar/ restaurant that makes me sick, literally, but this pub's food did. I had a medium rare hamburger with soggy fries  and didn't get any sleep that night due to my volatile vomiting that happened as a direct result. I tried calling the next day and there 's no room left on their answering machine, it's like, get a cell phone, it's 2013, c'mon!"
The Starry Plough,"Jan 26, 2013","Reasons I gave this place 5 stars is it hit basically everything I look for in a pub:-Great atmosphere with down to earth people from every walk of life, your bound to meet some interesting people and have some great conversation here-Solid beer selection, all my favorite beers on tap-Good very reasonably priced food, id say its a step up from your typical bar food, the proportions are generous and the service is top notch-Friendly staff, never had to wait very long for food/drink and they always are in a friendly mood-Events going on all the time, I dont know of another place with as much live music and poetry Def recommend checking this place out!"
The Starry Plough,"Jan 23, 2013","They got a new menu and the food is great, the beers on draft are amazing... Everything is amazing!  Live entertainment.  You can't help but love this place.  I love this bar!"
The Starry Plough,"Jan 8, 2013","One of my favorite local pubs. It's truly the essence of Berkeley, with its mix of protest propaganda and world folk music. Good burgers and great sounds. The owners and staff are incredibly friendly! Get jiggy here and dance a ceilidh or bounce around to the brass of the Balkans. Love it."
The Starry Plough,"Dec 18, 2012","The Starry Plough is a place that has a bit of everything.  very solid beers, good food (dig the tuffle oil), excellent entertainment.  This is the sort of place you can come and sit with friends for hours and enjoy.  You could also totally come here by yourself and make friends at the bar.  This is a real public house, just what it should be. Wish they had more drinks, cheaper prices, and slightly dimmer lighting for a more intimate atmosphere."
The Starry Plough,"Dec 12, 2012","Came here for the infamous Poetry Slam. $7 cover is kinda steep. The crowd was cool and performances were, too, but I wish they had cooler beers on tap. I get the Guiness, but there are a ton of local stuff to choose from and all they got is Laguinitas?"
The Starry Plough,"Dec 5, 2012","My 5-star review is based mostly on their redone menu. Most of the old stuff is still there (Save the daily hot-plate special), but completely redone. The burgers are soooo much better than they were before.  And they have GREAT healthy coleslaw as a side choice in addition to fries, spicy or regular, with not too much mayo.   I had the bread pudding for dessert for $5, and it was enormous, with a generous scoop of ice cream too.   The ambiance is the same as always - typical pub. nothing too special, nothing to complain about either."
The Starry Plough,"Dec 3, 2012","Always tasty beer for the soul, live music more nights than not. Free wi-fi, and dark corners to write your next novel or manifesto."
The Starry Plough,"Nov 29, 2012","Great pub, great music, lovely food and great service. Will come again."
The Starry Plough,"Nov 11, 2012","Fun open mic nights! Heard some really good music here. Diverse crowd. Enjoyed the vibe, and had a good time."
The Starry Plough,"Nov 2, 2012","My neighborhood pub. Friendly staff, good food, reasonable prices. Zero snobbery. Great for both loud weekend-night events and quieter early-evening hanging-out. Come here twice, and they will remember you when you walk in the third time.The best part: the inclusive crowd. I love that the Plough attracts people of every age and stripe and persuasion. Really. Whoever you are, your people are here.Finally, a sign of the Plough's good heart: Yes they'll be watching the A's and Giants games...but they'll MUTE THE COMMERCIALS."
The Starry Plough,"Oct 26, 2012",Smell of bar food hits your face as soon as you enter.  Berkeley Slam Poetry night on Thursday was amazing and inspiring.
The Starry Plough,"Oct 15, 2012","Awesome food.  The fish and chips (actually fresh potato wedges and really fresh fish) are awesome.  Excellent friendly staff, family owned caring ambiance...very reasonable prices and large food portions...thank you SP!"
The Starry Plough,"Oct 13, 2012",A great family owned and operated Irish pub with great burgers and pizzas. Great customer service too!
The Starry Plough,"Sep 29, 2012","Came here for a quick bite to eat and a few beers on a Saturday afternoon. It was quiet, the bartender and chef were both really friendly. The burger I had was the best burger I've eaten since I moved to the area 6 months ago from Austin. I had been searching for a decent burger in town and this one really surprised me. There was even acoustic live music playing by the time I had to leave, though I wanted to stay all night and watch the other performers. I'll be back!"
The Starry Plough,"Aug 31, 2012","Has quickly become my favorite destination for beer, excellent food, and amazing slam poetry or music.Great staff, wonderful atmosphere, great selection of beer, and the food rules.Plus, its a five minute bike ride from my house! Winner winner."
The Starry Plough,"Aug 21, 2012","I love pubs. And this pub is no exception.  A somewhat hidden bar, I went here with a few of my friends to catch up and grab some drinks.  Had a great time with the wide beer selection (it's a pub, what do you expect?), food (I would say typical bar food, but quite tasty), dart range, and a stage where local musicians performed! Scared to bring your family here? No Fear! When I was here there were several families with their children, all just having a great time grabbing food and mingling with the local musicians.  Overall I found this pub to have a great chill vibe and would definitely come here again."
The Starry Plough,"Aug 8, 2012","I'm not sure if there are many irish pubs like these.. but you will meet all types of people here..seriously ALL TYPES.. from hippies to conservative folks... poets, bohemians, wannabe rock stars, rappers, wristcutters, loners... the list goes on and on and every performance that i've seen here whether good or just okay has been really fun to watch and quite interesting if ya know what i mean..my advice to anyone who wants to come to the open mic on tuesdays..  bring an open mind and come early enough to snag a seat"
The Starry Plough,"Aug 8, 2012","Only one review gets to be your first Yelp review, so I'm happy mine is for a friendly neighborhood Irish pub. For starters, the Guinness was poured well, which should really be the lowest standard for a bar, but apparently that's assuming too much for a lot of other places. The pub had quite a few folks for a Monday afternoon, mostly local, and as evening approached, the weekly Irish dance lessons got underway, which was fun to watch.The best part was the food -- perhaps because it was so unexpected. I had the chicken burger, which was a grilled chicken breast on a soft and crispy bun, with fresh lettuce, pickles, and tomatoes. I mean, who'd expect a chicken sandwich at a bar to be very good? But it was delicious. The chicken was seasoned and cooked well, bigger than the bun, and covered with Swiss cheese. (FYI, cheese is extra.) To top it off, I got a side of garlic fries, which rounded out what may have been the best dive bar food I've ever had."
The Starry Plough,"Jul 25, 2012","Nique.. simple and true.. Starry Plough is a Dive Bar... lol  But keep in mind dive bar's are NOT bad.  The beer is cold, the food is hot, the chairs won't break under you.  There is bands.. and some are actually ok.   Even better is the soul this place gives can never be erased.  its so engraved that even if you tore this building down to the ground, it will be in the memories of so many for at least 100 years, maybe even more.  IPA, Darks, Reds.. drink up.. before last call."
The Starry Plough,"Jul 24, 2012",Open mic night Tuesday was fun. Tough to find seats if you go later but great prices and I dig the atmosphere. I will definitely go back.
The Starry Plough,"Jun 27, 2012",A great place to go to hear wonderful local and regional live music. Has quite a good pub food menu and the staff does not make you feel weird for not drinking. The only real drawback for me is that the sound is not that great. This could be from poor sound engineers or just plain bad equipment. Nevertheless an overall good experience.
The Starry Plough,"Jun 27, 2012","Starry Plough, i haven't been here in decades, not since my college days. Starry has changed, evolved into an artsy venue for performance arts, poetry readings, musical performances, etc.new is the stage, the food. dispensary in the left corner, the cluster of tables in the middle for dining. the bar on the left is the same.h-h , 4-7? m-sat, didn't ask what's involved. . probably beerspour: summerfest (4) daily specialeats: creme brulee (2.5)-got 3 small one. closeout? or is this the way they come?heavy sugar glazecustard flavor not too noticeable. creamy..on draught:-4 stars for the remaining bar and draught choices-not rating the venue since i wasn't really listening.to the band.-has the same irsh poster on the walls from way back when."
The Starry Plough,"Jun 20, 2012","i've been going here periodically for open mic night, and i've never had a bad time. the staff is all super friendly and the service is fast.  in the spirit of full disclosure i have to admit that i don't drink so i can't vouch for the alcohol, but i can vouch for their garlic fries which are SLAMMIN'. there's consistently a great turnout for open mic and i've seen a lot of wonderful musicians there, i'll definitely be going back!"
The Starry Plough,"Jun 17, 2012","They have completely revamped their menu  and even though they have raised prices it is so worth it to get a burger here.  I dont really come here for the music because the sound guy is terrible, but the burgers are where its at."
The Starry Plough,"Jun 15, 2012","I have been a patron of the Plough for several years and usually go on Sunday or Monday.  People should know the kitchen is closed Sunday but when it is open, I always have gotten the pizza and loved it.  Love the music and vibe on Sunday but was sad when they took Bass off the tap."
The Starry Plough,"Jun 7, 2012","What a great place to go chill and listen to a live band. I came here to order food because, everything around was either closed or was about to close. My boyfriend always asked me if I wanted to get food from here but I always chose to go elsewhere. The food here is good and their burgers are huge. I originally ordered a pepperoni pizza BUT the menu on their website isn't up to date. They only had BBQ chicken, Thai chicken and a veggie pesto pizza. I was debated on getting the BBQ chicken or the Thai chicken pizza. I ended up not getting any. When I went to pick up my order the owner or manager made one for me anyways on the house. How awesome is that. FREE PIZZA!! He said since he had a new cook he wanted us to try it out and spread the word. The pizza was really good. I would recommend it. The food here is cheap and affordable. The workers are also friendly."
The Starry Plough,"Apr 19, 2012",Best Pub food in the Bay. Great place to catch a show. Irish music session is definitely worth checking out. They have shows with a cover most nights so it's tricky if you just want to stop by for a couple of beers. really staff
The Starry Plough,"Apr 16, 2012","A great place to catch a live band and hang out. I immediately felt at ease as I walked in ~ a friendly, Irish pub, locals vibe filled with a pleasant mix of people, ranging from college age to seniors.The set up consists of an open-room format ~ a long bar and a few tables + chairs on one side, a counter for ordering pub food in the back (fish & chips, burgers, sandwiches, pizzas and daily entree specials), and a low stage with a medium-size dance floor on the other side. Folks were rockin' out, having a blast the night I went."
The Starry Plough,"Apr 6, 2012","I live nearby, and haven't been there in a while, but it's not my kind of place. It's predominantly an entertainment venue, with a small bar and kitchen tucked to the side and corner. From what I remember, the food's decent, and the staff were nice. But the drafts never came out cold enough.I just don't like the bar area, that's what bothers me the most.Guess when it comes to bars, I'll either be somewhere in downtown Berkeley, or Rockridge."
The Starry Plough,"Mar 21, 2012","Several Up-and-Coming band play here! The walls are decked with Che Guevara, Revolution flags, and Irish Union Scrip. Every sunday local musicians, from fiddles to mandolins, get together and jam celtic songs.I went here on my 21st birthday and the entire band and bar sang me happy birthday. There is magic here beyond any SF club could handle. It's a place for friends, bonding and BEER!"
The Starry Plough,"Mar 19, 2012","Came here on st patty's day and wow ot was packed. There was a $10 cover, so I'm not sure if this is all the time. There was a live band playing some irish folk songs and some chicks doing molasses irish jigs and it was fun to watch. This review is based on an event night rather than a regular night. Service was quick and prices were moderate, even on this amateur's drinking day"
The Starry Plough,"Mar 8, 2012","I go to the plough almost every Tuesday for the open mic and it is a wonderful place to meet local musicians. Everyone there is friendly and supportive. If you're new to the area this a great place to make friends! The bartender, Shaheem, is amazing! Truly one of the best bars around!"
The Starry Plough,"Feb 19, 2012","I went here to see the Berkeley Balkan Bacchanal last thursday (this is an every 3rd Thursday show) and had a really fun time dancing around and also just sitting and listening to great music by local bands. I had so much fun dancing by myself (with a crowd of others) that I completely lost track of time and missed the last bus home. Luckily, I was able to find someone kind enough to give me a ride. I highly recommend this show, different bands perform each month and so far, all that I have seen have been great.They had a sliding scale $6-$10 cover, which was great for me as I am currently unemployed and cash flow is a major issue. For this same reason I didn't order any drinks, but from what I saw, they do have an excellent selection of beer on tap, domestic, microbrew and imported in the $3-4 a pint price range-- when I have some extra cash I will certainly grab a beer. They did have a pitcher of water out for anyone to hydrate, which was great as you dont have to stand there and try to get the bartender's attention just for a glass of water like most places. Inside, there is the stage and dancing area on one side, and the tables and bar on the other. It was very crowded, but a warm atmosphere, I can safely say that most if not all of the people there seemed to be having a really good time as well. The location is very convenient to get to by public transportation, right off the 18 bus line, and not far from the Ashby bart and next to another venue I have yet to check out La Pena Cultural Center.On the walls are protest posters and Irish pride splashes here and there, and with the high ceilings, I didn't get the stereotypical  dark cave-like Irish Pub feel, which wasnt a bad thing, it simply had a feeling all of its own.I will for sure come back here to check out their Irish Music, Open Mic, Poetry Slam, Art Bazzar and other such repeating (every # day of the week) shows."
The Starry Plough,"Feb 6, 2012","There was a debate going on between friends about whether Starry Plough was a dive or not. The opinions were strong on both sides, but after a few recent visits involving impressive cover bands, monstrous hamburgers from their kitchen, and a bevvy of microbrews from the bar, the jury had been swayed...Starry Plough is not guilty of dive status. But don't let that scare you away! The anti-government/ Irish pride paraphernalia gives it a charm all it's own. I feel pretty darn lucky to have this happenin' little hideaway within stumbling distance from home. They've got an interesting line-up of live music virtually every day of the week. I haven't been to their infamous Open Mic night yet, but the Friday night shows have been fun, drawing a lively all-walks-of-life crowd.  You'll see old folks dancing tenderly, tripped out hippies with their eyes closed and their arms flailing, and tame observers tapping their toes. At least, this was the case for ""Petty Theft"", a seriously spot-on Tom Petty cover band.Speaking of covers, the bigger shows are usually $10 so you'd better plan to stay awhile, call some friends, and make a night of it. It's a down-home kinda place where just about any fun-loving boozer will feel welcomed."
The Starry Plough,"Jan 12, 2012","Came here for Slam Poetry Wednesday - decent beers on tap, ample seating, awesome poetry. Couldn't ask for more!"
The Starry Plough,"Dec 22, 2011","Tuesday night open mic is a good day to check out. Things starts going around 9:30, good people, service, and beer!"
The Starry Plough,"Dec 12, 2011","Ceili on Mondays with live music.  Slam Poetry on Wednesdays.  Concerts all of the time (well, not actually all of the time, but rather often).  Great bands that I wouldn't have ever seen otherwise.  Plus Guinness, cider, and fried food that satisfy my needs after dancing."
The Starry Plough,"Oct 20, 2011","This place is great for some beers and good bar food, great deals on pitchers. A lot of evenings have live music or dancing that is Irish themed."
The Starry Plough,"Aug 31, 2011","Stumbled in here on a Saturday night since they had live music and it was close to our dinner spot. I liked the flexible cover $7-10 for 3 bands. Sweet. The bartender was a cute older lady who promptly took our drink orders once we procured 3 bar stools.The food looked greasy, I wouldn't eat here. The crowd is...interesting. Mostly older folks. In an out of the way location, at least for me."
The Starry Plough,"Jul 31, 2011",This place has an interesting vibe. It's kind've dive-y but somehow not (probably because of their poetry slams and other such activities). I would recommend checking it out =).
The Starry Plough,"Jul 6, 2011","I love this place! The food and atmosphere is excellent, but that surprising is not what brings me here time and time again.  The amazing staff creates a welcoming atmosphere and really is what makes this place what it is.  The bartender Shahin really knows what he's doing and you can tell he loves his job.  I have been here 4 times, and I keep getting more and more impressed every time!  Thanks Shahin and staff for making  me a new regular :)"
The Starry Plough,"Jun 28, 2011","Want to talk about great service?  Let's talk about an open mic host who goes the distance of not only providing bean bag chairs for the audience, but also giving complimentary back-alley massages.  Humor aside, the Tuesday Night Open Mic is a total hit in my book.  They take a while to sort out the lineups for the evening with bands and their groupies crowding the venue by 8pm.  The little'ns have to be out the door by 9, so all the under 21s perform first.I'm not sure what else to say besides there being stellar service, from the bar and beyond, cheap drinks, and cool live music."
The Starry Plough,"Apr 16, 2011","I love the starry plough. So convenient to go after work with a few friends to enjoy a cold hefeweizen. I don't care who's playing or what's going on.. Its all good. Crowd ranges from anywhere between 21 and 80-no kidding. Everyone is always nice. Bartenders are attentive. St. Patricks Day was fantastic. As the sign says behind the bar, ""today im irish, tomorrow im hungover"". Hehe"
The Starry Plough,"Mar 17, 2011","This. Is. The. Best. St Patrick's Day.  Ever.Seriously, how do I explain how great this place was.  We arrived and I was pretty dejected to be paying $10 just to get inside.  (Sorry, still slightly under the effect of all the beer, all my GRE words are coming out!)  But then... the music started playing.  The people started dancing.  The old Irish man told us how the bartender was his daughter so he could get us our drink quicker.This place is magic, and I couldn't imagine a better place to celebrate St. Patrick's Day.Some observations: You'll notice that this place is just *so* Berkeley.  Adorning the walls are a fleece blanket with multiple portraits and profiles of Obama, vintage posters in both Spanish and English protesting neo-colonialism and supporting socialist uprisings in Nicaragua, Zimbabwe, and Chile, quotations from famous Irishmen, and the Starry Plough itself.I came to the pub in about as low of spirits and energy as one could be, and I left raving about how much fun it was to hear the Irish folk music, the grandma who hopped up on stage to sing an old tune, and the dance instructor who taught everyone to dance.  (By the way, at least now they've got dancing at 7:15 on Monday evenings.  I'll be checking it out soon!)A++.  Thank you Starry Plough for the most Irish, fun, neighborhood St Patrick's Day experience ever."
The Starry Plough,"Mar 16, 2011","Best place by far in the East Bay for Irish Music, Craic agus Ceol. Not to mention the Guinness which  is the best in the area as it is poured from their taps quite frequently and not left to stagnate in the pipes like in other wannabe drinking establishments. Dont' come here if you are looking for fancy pants drinks. Irish pubs generally do not serve dirty martinis or daquiris or any of that nonsense. Man up and have a Guinness....it's good for you and full of Iron!  FACT!  As I'm Irish I will be at home in Ireland this year but I spent last year's Festival with the gang in the Starry Plough and had a great time.Get there early so you can grab the best spot.  Enjoy"
The Starry Plough,"Dec 19, 2010","Not sure what to say about this place.Wanted to like it..really did.However, was overwhlemed by the very unpleasant smell of strong body odor. Will not be going back."
The Starry Plough,"Dec 19, 2010","Been back a few times. Would be great if this were in my neighborhood. Too few live music venues in Oakland. Tuesday open mic night is fun, although the MC's attempts at humor mostly leave me cringing in pain."
The Starry Plough,"Dec 1, 2010","I love the Plough. I mainly go on Tuesday nights which is their open mic night. The talent is actually fairly decent with folksy stuff prevailing, and there is no cover like there is for the Poetry Slam on Wednesdays. The bar is a bit small, so do be aware that it can get pretty crowded on Tues and Wed. The crowd is varied, the people I go with are all early to late 20's, but there are also quite a few older regulars as well. It can be a bit crunchy, but not in a bad way and the bar just smells slightly musty not hippie stinky. The main bartender (Shaheen?) is a riot, he always has fun stories to tell and is fun to talk and laugh with once things wind down after midnight. The drinks are good and average priced, and he knows how to pour -best tasting Guinness in Berkeley is here! The rest of the staff is great too, and everyone is super friendly. I always end up chatting to random people and having a great time. Also, the food is cheap but good! One warning though is that this is a beer and wine only place. Even though it is called an Irish Pub, there is no whiskey or irish cream here."
The Starry Plough,"Nov 16, 2010",Decent beer selection.  Good sound/stage set up.
The Starry Plough,"Oct 21, 2010","Much room for improvement.I was jonesing for a fix of live music, and the band that was playing that night sounded pretty good online so I decided to head on down to the Starry Plough.   They were charging $10 at the door which is pretty steep, but I wasn't about to leave because the trek involved two wrong buses and way too much walking.  The venue was practically empty, but it was still rather early (around 10pm).  After the opening band was finished, they left and so did their parents, leaving about 5 people to watch the headliner.  That's cool; I came to dance, so I still boogied down and had a great time, but I noticed large groups of people turned away at the door because they didn't want to pay $10 for a band they've never heard of.  Reduce your cover charge Starry Plough! Don't you want people to drink your beer??..at least there's no line at the bar or the bathroom, I guess.My second visit was quite disappointing.  Came here straight from work one day to meet up with some friends, ordered a pizza and waited about an hour for it to come!  I understand that it's made fresh and takes time to cook, but after I ordered I watched the cook chat with one of his friends for 20 minutes before getting started on my order.  The price is reasonable, but the pizza is forgettable, and the service was just painful.Apparently they were hosting a poetry slam that night.  We weren't planning on staying much later, but certainly would've had another pint if not for the rude lady collecting money for the slam.  She came around several times to take our money, even after we told her that we were just finishing up dinner and would be leaving shortly.  She made us feel very uncomfortable, so we just left.3 well-deserved stars for good beer selection, and great service at the bar."
The Starry Plough,"Aug 20, 2010","I have only came here so far for poetry slam nights (Wednesdays) which can get the place pretty tightly packed.I always enjoy my time here.  The place is a beer and wine only establishment.  They do carry a pretty decent variety including Smithwicks.  I havent tried the food myself but each time, someone in my party has ordered something and EVERYTHING looked good!!!The service was fast and friendly and the bathrooms are clean (at least the ladies ones are)Check, check, check it out!"
The Starry Plough,"Aug 13, 2010","Starry Plough was my first pub.  Yep, they popped my pub cherry!  Needless to say, I was surprised when I couldn't order a grey goose dirty martini--duh!  All of my visits have been on Wednesdays for the poetry slam/open mic-- an experience every poetry and/or art lover should have at least once or twice.I find the staff to be friendly, the wine intoxicating, the pizza over-sized and delish (I went with vegetarian), and the bathroom's always clean.  What more could you want from a pub?  Whatever that is..."
The Starry Plough,"Jun 30, 2010","I've been the the Starry Plough on a few different nights and usually have a great time, whether it's for poetry or Irish music or open mike night, but the 5 stars I'm giving are all for the music nights.  They regularly feature local bands, and I've never been disappointed.  Granted, I've went there in the first place to see a band I already was a fan of (7 Orange ABC - great!) but in general I feel they do a great job of putting together a show."
The Starry Plough,"Jun 3, 2010","Here's the thing - this place can be reviewed as a bar or as a venue.  However, during their weekly poetry slams, they go hand in hand.  The bar itself is great, with friendly bartenders and a great selection.  However, during their shows, the place is open for all ages, and you know what that means - teenagers.  Imagine yourself, a fine adult enjoying a Smithwicks, and these kids going through puberty are gathered together drinking their Diet Cokes.  It's odd to say the least...But as a venue, this place is top-notch.  Those unfamiliar with poetry slams are in for a real treat every Wednesday night, as both amateur and professional poets take the stage to express themselves.  In some cases, I would go so far as to say it was more of a comedy show!Thankfully, the youngins usually leave around 10ish, so knock this review up a star when that happens."
The Starry Plough,"May 25, 2010","Love this place, been coming here since I got my first fake ID! Great place to have a pint of Guiness, hear a local band, and plan an IRA car bombing. Feels like you get transported as soon as you walk in the door. I know I have eaten food here, well, I think I have? If I have it's probably after being completely toasted, so I can't review the food. But the beer, the feel, the everything, built for just having a pint, getting a little too loud and forgeting all your troubles..."
The Starry Plough,"May 25, 2010","I walked into the Starry Plough Pub for Poetry Slam night last Wednesday, and was immediately relaxed. The lighting was low and attention was on the stage in the corner. I enjoyed myself. The bathroom was very clean and the poetry was great! Can't wait to go back!"
The Starry Plough,"May 8, 2010","Trading in on the Celtic vibe the Starry Plough is about as far as you can get from true Irish spirit and hospitality. If I had a choice between the Plough and Guiness from a can.......pop that top, buddy.Beware of under-age drinking, it seems the Plough has taken on that role to make up for their dismal management."
The Starry Plough,"Apr 15, 2010","Went to the Starry Plough for poetry slam last night. Good vibe, nice crowd & the poetry was certainly interesting. I will say it's a bit off the beaten path and it's not a place you would readily find just walking by. The bartenders were super friendly and Three Blind Mice (band) was better than expected. I will def go again."
The Starry Plough,"Mar 25, 2010","This was just ok. There was nothing spectacular, but there was a great selection of beer. Perhaps because of the night I went, poetry slam night, there was an overabundance of underage high school kids. While I have nothing against high school kids I'm in my late 20s and have no interest in hanging out with them socially. I guess that just comes with the territory though.I was happy that the Starry Plough had my favorite beer on tap, Smithwicks, because not too many places I've been in this area have Smithwicks. Because it was poetry night there was an emcee but it was impossible to hear her over the music in the background and the talking of the other patrons. Mostly the music and not the patrons.I'd go back here but it probably wouldn't be my first choice of bars to hit in Berkeley."
The Starry Plough,"Mar 12, 2010","Great bands, friendly bartender, old hippies with beards and tie dyed shirts, very relaxed vibe, I'm hooked!"
The Starry Plough,"Mar 1, 2010","This place gets good points for two reasons:1- Always have good, local bands playing2- Big selection of beers on tap including my newest favorite, Smithwicks (pronounced smiddicks for whatever reason)Not quite five stars because I had probably the worst garlic fries there. Yes, they were cheap, but it was still a wasted $4 because we didn't even eat them, not even with ketchup..."
The Starry Plough,"Feb 16, 2010","What a fun night at the Starry Plough! Not a fancy environment but it had the casual feel of the pubs in Ireland. The corned beef and cabbage was very good. The service was good  and the clientele of very good quality. The restrooms were spotless. They don't serve hard liquor  but do have a nice choice of brews and wine. We went on a Monday night and had fun with the Irish dance lessons and really enjoyed the live traditional Irish music. Its not located in a very good neighborhood but we didn't have any problems. It had a Berkeley atmosphere to it, but why not, its in Berkeley. I can't wait to go back."
The Starry Plough,"Jan 20, 2010","If you can make it to this place before the bands start (usually around 9), it's a solid 3 or 4 star bar with an all right beer list and some nice greasy bar fare.  After 9, you will have to contend with some terrible performance that often goes late into the night (and, to add insult to injury, pay a steep cover charge for the privilege).  This place is located in an area with practically no other bars, and so it's perfectly positioned to be a neighborhood center.  It's too bad that it's a crappy venue instead."
The Starry Plough,"Jan 10, 2010","Went in for a burger and beer on a Monday night, need to check-out the weekend scene."
The Starry Plough,"Dec 5, 2009","I love this place. Good beer selection, good food, good music, good people.......pizza and beer and people playing guitars.....I'm sold!"
The Starry Plough,"Nov 30, 2009","I want to love this place.  It's my local pub, the people who work there are generally friendly and sometimes they have amazing bands...HOWEVER, the sound system is so crappy and/or unreliable, I pity any band that dares to play there.  I heard a rumor a couple of years ago that they FINALLY, FREAKING, FINALLY bought a real sound system.  This rumor seemed substantiated by the one or two incredible shows that followed.  And then...they pawned off the new sound system for the old shitty one? I'm not sure.  All I know is every single band I have seen there since has been tortured with horrible feedback, etc.  Are the engineers to blame? It's hard to say.  PLEASE STOP SUCKING, STARRY PLOUGH! YOU COULD BE FANTASTIC!!!"
The Starry Plough,"Nov 23, 2009","Such a great place! I have been coming here for many, many years. At least eighteen, I'm pretty sure. A great variety of music and creative bookings for sure! St. Patty's Day and the Murder Ballads show are two events I ALWAYS look forward to here. The have a great open mic/poetry slam night, too. Not my thing but if you're into that sort of thing, you'll dig it the most. Also Irish music jam nights and ceilis (I know I spelled that wrong...community dances in other words). I actually really like the fact that you can only get beer and wine here. I'm sick of going to bars and dealing with classless people who can't hold their liquor and try to ruin everyone else's good time over it. Especially when I'm just there to dance and have a good time without some sloppy-ass drunk spilling their drink all over me while they stumble stupidly all over the dance floor. Decent food, good grubbage for a night of drinking. Their fish and chips are pretty damn good and their burgers hearty. Yum. I have so many great memories from this place. I've met boyfriends here, made friends here, discovered amazing bands here, watched my son win a Mingo 2000 dance contest here during a day time all ages show, etc. etc. I love the Starry Plough! They're my neighborhood night spot and and I'm so glad they're here. One thing I'm unhappy about? When they remodeled their bathrooms, they painted over over twenty yeas worth of latrinalia (bathroom graffiti) and my favorite bathroom graffiti EVER is now gone. I have saved it to memory, though. Someone wrote: Some jaded miscreant sat here and thought about life for awhile... And directly under it someone responded: Thanks for hogging up the bathroom! Haha! Fer reals! I don't know why I find that so hilarious, but I do. Jacques the doorman was awesome. Where the hell is he these days, anyway?"
The Starry Plough,"Oct 25, 2009","I love Starry Plough.  It is loud and friendly like a British pub with a distinct Berkeley flair.  The food is good the cheese pizza is my favorite.  I always order more than I can eat, so that I can enjoy it for breakfast.  You know pizza is good when it tastes good cold.  Another plus is that they have Wider's Cider - my favorite.  When my day has been worse than average, I head over here for pizza, cider and enjoy the entertainment of the night.  It is nice to have such a solid neighborhood pub."
The Starry Plough,"Aug 24, 2009","I've been here a couple of times on open mic night to support a friend.  The crowd is mellow and it doesn't get too packed that you can't find a seat.I have to admit - some of the acts are good and some are a bit off.I haven't eaten here, but they have a decent selection of beers at reasonable prices."
The Starry Plough,"Aug 20, 2009","Went for the first time on a night that happened to be open mic night.  Some of the talent was really great, and some, well not so great.  But the crowd was really into it, so there was a really great vibe in the place. They have a good, but small beer list with wine and non alcoholic drinks.  The prices are pretty reasonable, and the bartender was awesome."
The Starry Plough,"Aug 4, 2009","Yeah, its loud.  But that is okay when the music is Irish and the musicians are jammin'.  The bartender should be able to track the customers in a place this small; not knowing a black and tan when you only serve beer and wine is ridiculous.  My non-drinking friend was thrilled with the tea selection.As other yelpers have noted, quite a few Snapple drinkers.  What kind of Gaelic sould would find solace in  that?  Lets lift another pint.  I will be back for the music."
The Starry Plough,"Jul 13, 2009","They must have a new sound system because it all sounded great (I saw Mushroom there last week). Really great beer selection at decent prices ($15--$16 pitchers). The pizza I had was pretty tasty (and priced at $7--two meals there). The folks there were cool, the bartender and cook were genuinely friendly...a good time was had!"
The Starry Plough,"Jun 12, 2009",Great music and laid back crowd. I was tipsy and the food was still terrible.
The Starry Plough,"Jun 10, 2009","Go for the music! If you are a Grateful Dead fan you will love this place. Unpretentious music... original songs... great voices ... local talent like Jayde Blade who belts out her original song ""Bless... our helpless disguise"" like she was a latter day Joan Baez. What a great experience to know there is talent like this in the Bay area and this IS the place where it is showcased. The ambiance is great... relaxed... informal enough for audience participation and interaction. However, the food sucks. Garlic Fries... bring your own garlic!"
The Starry Plough,"May 31, 2009","The Plough is a Berkeley institution. I've been here a few times to hear friends' bands play, and this is the only reason i'll come here.Although they have a large selection of draft beer, it's a beer/wine only bar. The food selection is limited as well -- burgers, fries, sandwiches, and pizza. I like their fries -- it tastes homemade. The kitchen closes at 10pm. Other nights may be different, but every time I'm here I notice more than 50% of the crowd drinking juice, Snapple Iced Tea or water, which is not a bad thing. You wouldn't want belligerent drunk during a show. It's also nice to be at a bar where you can feel comfortable ordering a cup of tea, which I did last night.Beer sells for $4.75 - $5, and the quality can be inconsistent. I had a very pleasant glass of Liberty Ale -- good pour and chilled glass. Yum. And then I had yucky Murphy's Stout -- taste was off, a little bit watered down, and too much foam.The sound guy should be fired!!! This guy never showed up last night. No phone call. Nothing! The whole show was delayed by over an hour. My friends called around friends and friends of friends and got a guy to come out and rescue three bands that were lined up to play. The crowd is very diverse -- young East Bay/SF hipsters, baby boomer hippies, arm-pit haired and no arm-pit haired ladies. Some people def have BOs."
The Starry Plough,"Apr 18, 2009","My friends and I intended to meet at the Starry Plough tonight to eat, drink, and listen to the California Honeydrops (local blues/folk band).  We showed up a bit early around 8 (show started at 9:30) and found seating easily in the main area in front of the stage.  None of had eaten dinner so we ordered a couple of pitchers of beer, a mushroom/olive pizza, and some garlic fries.  The beer was good (great selection), but the food was just okay.  The fries were definitely made from fresh potatoes, but they were a bit undercooked to me.  The pizza, too, was standard.  But who goes to a pub to order food anyway?We ended up having to leave before the show started, but the room was definitely getting packed as we walked out.  The crowd looked fun and pretty diverse, which is a definite plus.  If I lived closer, I'd definitely give it another shot...maybe next St. Patrick's Day..."
The Starry Plough,"Mar 18, 2009","I went here for a slam and fell in love. Like the venue was awesome and so diverse! Yeah I love seeing a rainbow of brown, pink, yellow, and orange skin tones lolol I am definitely coming back here!"
The Starry Plough,"Mar 18, 2009","Ohhh, I'm a crazy Irish Dancing Scallywag!St Paddy's Night - Guinness, Irish Fiddle-Music, More Guinness, Dancing, Even More Guinness!  and some Fun times!Love this place. From open mic, poetry slams, to Celtic Music and Dance on Sundays. Nothing beats the Plough for a wonderful evening with friends!"
The Starry Plough,"Mar 17, 2009","After an hour here I had:- found a dancer for our St. Paddy's Day event- gotten my cards read, ""child of the worlds"" (hey!)- gone to town on a few Smithwick's- met a balloon man who created a shamrock with a penis out of biodegradable latex- learned a waltzRelaxed, welcoming and delightfully local, the Irish spirit is especially alive during ceili dancing on Sundays and Mondays. Slainte!"
The Starry Plough,"Mar 16, 2009","I love the Plough for the wednesday slam.Great beer on tap, served by the Persian of Perversion.And some damn fine verse."
The Starry Plough,"Mar 8, 2009","what happened to this place? i used to frequent this pub years ago and thought it was a real gem, not so much now. went to see a show on saturday, paid $15 and the music was so bad i left after 5 songs, though that's prob my fault as i should have researched the band more before to see what i was in for, but $15? yikes I appreciate that they have pretty cheap food, the burgers looked good, but I ordered a fish and chip ($7.50) and the fish were two flat frozen filets, much like the fish sticks of ones childhood. are you kidding me? if you're going to serve fish and chips for the love of god please make if battered, fresh fish or don't make it at all."
The Starry Plough,"Feb 2, 2009","This is a great neighborhood bar, with a definitely Irish twist, that features live music, poetry, open mic nights, and on Sundays, a Celtic music play-along/sing-along that I can't stay away from.  I guess I have some deep, deep Irish roots or something, but this music just lifts me.  Or maybe because I play the violin (badly), but wish I could fiddle like some of these guys.  I dunno.  I think the only thing I'd like more is if they allowed smoking inside...this place seems to call out for it!If you're starving, the food isn't bad.  Definitely what is called Pub Grub, and as such, well prepared, especially the fries.  (Guinness and Fries for dinner.  Sign me up!)  My recommendation if you are going to hear a band you like is to get there really early, like at 7 or so, and grab a table in the main room.  Otherwise you're going to be perching and hating those bastards who are sitting where you wish you were sitting!  If you drive, please don't block the neighbors' driveways.  This is a neighborhood with real people.  Try taking BART. The Ashby station is just a few blocks away."
The Starry Plough,"Jan 14, 2009","Flannel shirts, skinny jeans, Irish beers, and guitars.  Berkeley's attempt at an Irish Pub! I went here last night for the Open Mic night to see the amazing Nojos play! And I was pleasantly surprised by the talent that graced the stage.  Some guy even played a shovel he made into a guitar! They have slam poetry nights too - a very community oriented Pub! The best kind....but the beers can be a bit pricey! $5 for a Guinness?! Yikers."
The Starry Plough,"Jan 14, 2009","The low score is because for me, food is the most important thing when you go to a restaurant, not dancing, so it's a personal preference.  But I appreciate the fun atmosphere that they have.  The food is mediocre, but maybe its because Irish food on the whole is bland, so I won't fault them for their food being boring. The parking is just impossible whenever I come out.  Then when I go in, it's a little dingy and depressing, so maybe it's authentic Irish that way.  They do have dancing classes on certain nights so you can learn how to do the riverdance, then its followed up by live music so you can practice your newly learned moves. The kind of people who come here are regulars who just love to dance, so at least they are having fun and I'll admit that it's infectious."
The Starry Plough,"Dec 14, 2008","So this is what happens when you open an Irish pub in Berkeley. You get a hippie-communist Irish pub. It's hard to picture, but I swear it's true. Huge banners of Che, other leftist propaganda, a stage for slam poetry and local music meets an Irish pub serving Guinness, Smithwicks, Harp, and fried food. Really hard to imagine until you walk in. Then it all makes sense. This place should get 3 stars for being what you think it is. But the constant local music, the community presence and neighborhood feel and the fact they have Sierra Nevada Porter on tap bumps it a up a notch for me. A place definitely worth checking out at least once."
The Starry Plough,"Nov 10, 2008","Don't come here unless this particular brand of ambiance does it for youIf you want to compare it to your favorite restaurant or your personal beliefs about what a pub should be, you shouldn't be rating the place in the first place. I like how I feel when I get here. Every show I've been to here, people talked to each other, and who needs whiskey with all the great beer flowing for a steal. And its pub food, and the best of pub in my opinion.I sometimes like to go to Edinburgh Castle in San Francisco, and they serve Fish and Chips that feel like they've been in a warmer  for awhile. And NO one is saying its bad. Matter of fact I love having it because it is what it is.I love the cabaret/bizzare/jazz fused, rock fused music in the local scene. Always fun and the music is never boring. I wish I didn't have to cross a bridge to come hang out and have fun at the poetry slam. Sounds like the people who run the place know makes for bringing people together to interact and enjoy themselves.And.. the people who work here and the customers are relaxed with a cozy feeling. I don't experience that in other venues."
The Starry Plough,"Oct 13, 2008",I'd heard so much about this place from my friends.  I decided to have my birthday party there last night.  It was a Sunday so Shay Black and other musicians were there.  Folks would pop up all around the room and sing a song.  My friends and I were some of the first people there.  The place got packed!  One of my friends told a musician it was my birthday and the whole pub sang to me.  It was awesome.  The bartenders are very friendly and attentive.  They have two good ciders on tap and my friends seemed happy with the beer selection.  My hubby was happy with the root beer they have on tap too.I'll definitely be going back.  Maybe on a Monday to learn some Irish dancing.
The Starry Plough,"Sep 24, 2008","Starry PloughIf this establishment were a woman, a woman with low standards and a little drunk, a woman who hasn't been laid in awhile and is willing to give me a chance, I would make nectar sweet love to this woman.  I would impregnate this woman and have little revolutionary babies with this woman.  We would feed our lil' Huey P.'s, Guinness Stout and corn nuts.  We would read to them the court transcripts from the Chicago Seven trials and bedeck their baby asses in only the finest of hemp made Che' attire.  This is how much I love this place.  I would want it to have my babies, even though I hate babies SO MUCH.  And puppies.  However, I'm willing to sacrifice my convictions, throw aside my hatred for cute things, and overcome my fear of tiny hands and wobbly heads, just to have one night of bliss with the Starry Plough.5 Stars!"
The Starry Plough,"Sep 23, 2008","I have heard Alma Desnuda  play here a few times (my friend's fiance is in the band) and it was a great venue. The place was packed with people and the vibe was fun and lively-a lot of people drinking beer, dancing and having a good time! My friends and I ordered a pizza and it was off the chain! I don't know if it was the beer talking but it was some damn good pizza! I always have a great time when I visit the Starry Plough."
The Starry Plough,"Sep 7, 2008","I probably give this place a 3.75, but I rounded up because I like neighborhood bars that feature live music.  It's sort of rag-tag, only serves beer and wine, but it does have an older crowd that enjoys themselves.  My boyfriend's band played music here a few times and the sound quality is pretty bad, but  people enjoyed all the shows.  I hope the starry plough never dies~~"
The Starry Plough,"Aug 20, 2008","After having friends rave about the place, it seems to fall short.  Honestly, I think the idea is better than the implimentation.  Cramped and loud to the point that you must shout (even at the farthest point from the ""OK"" live music).  The food and drink was so-so, but I'll definately pass the next time my friends head this way."
The Starry Plough,"Jul 31, 2008",Alrightie. I would say 4.5 because I am never satisfied. But really I cant imagine much better. Unless the food was better.Pretty limited menu and with a wide variety of acts and so great you want to stay a while I would hope the food would be better. I had the steak dinner and a shirly temple and was so excited I took a picture. And yes for now I am too lazy to post that picture.I went for poetry slam but was really excited to see they have an event pretty much every night. It is like a teen rec center for misfits and hipsters. Yea there are a lot of hipsters which can be a little eh. But I love it. The poetry slam was better than expected. I also like the location. Sketch enough where a pot partaker could partake but not so scummy I was constantly worried my bike or parts of my bike would be stolen for crack. A wide variety of clientèle and no cross cultural hating going on like you can find elsewhere in Berkeley/Oakland. Oh yea I had a cider for you yelpers to survey price and for $5 I thought that was fair and $2 for my temple. I think $7 for my steak/potatoes veggie dinner. Fair price even for a cheapskaker.
The Starry Plough,"Jul 25, 2008",I encourage you to read my whole review... but glad to see they fixed up the outside.  Photos added.
The Starry Plough,"Jun 25, 2008","I've been going to ""the Plough"" for over a year now on an almost weekly basis and I think of it a ""my pub"". I've tried just about every night and I have to say I like Sunday and Monday the best -- and not just because there is no cover on those nights!On Sunday night you can go in and sit down have a pint -- in my case pair cider -- or a glass of wine, and listen to some fine music or even sing a song if you wish. People chat, play darts (only one board), and even dance. There is dancing on Monday nights (lessons starting at 7pm for only $5). All in all -- I love it.But as is the way with love: some things have to be forgiven.1st: No rum...or whiskey...or gin -- or anything else outside of wine, beer, and cider.2nd: Sunday there is no regular menu and while the owner cooks a little something -- I would recommend eating somewhere else, or bringing something in (Francis says its OK!)"
The Starry Plough,"Apr 27, 2008","fun little place.  beer only (slightly strange, but a full liquor license is a bastard to have).  I've only been on Sunday Nights, which is ""Irish Sing-A-Long"" night.  And by ""Sing-A-Long"", I mean ""mandatory"".  you will get shushed if you aren't participating, or at least shutting the hell up."
The Starry Plough,"Apr 27, 2008",Like this place for the events it holds. Totally recommend coming for poetry slam at least once. Recently tried monday night irish dancing too! FUN! Get there at 7pm sharp for the lesson.
The Starry Plough,"Mar 22, 2008","Oh, the Plough. How I love thee.I have seen my favourite local bands here, from Toshi Reagon, to Love Dog, the Kasey Knutsen Band and Disappearing Completely. The ambiance is great - a wall with a poem painted on it, flags from all countries, of Che, of protest of US invasion of Nicaragua in the 80's, and seemingly home-made flags of Plughs that are starry. Cute.The Guinness and pub food are delish, and most importantly (for me), the management, bartenders, and door staff are ALL super mellow, kind, and friendly. A perfect neighborhood spot, with great sound and always a mixed crowd.Just anther reason to stay in the east bay and avoid the rowdy ego-pumped bullshit of city music venues. Word."
The Starry Plough,"Feb 18, 2008","This is a mediocre Pub.  Firstly they don't serve whiskey, which is an outrage.  The music is often decent, but the wait staff doesn't work the floor, which means you can get trapped away from the bar at a table and unable to get a drink, especially when it's crowded.  They could significantly increase revenue if they had cocktail waitresses to bring you drinks, instead they compensate by sticking you with a COVER CHARGE OF UP TO FIFTEEN (15) DOLLARS.  I don't pay that much on my let's-go-all-out-in-sf nights, let alone for some back roads Berkeley ""pub.""  The bouncers can be pretty snooty about the cover charge -- don't think that by arriving early for dinner you're escaped, instead once the band arrives they'll go around and take a collection.  Pay up or get out!While the kitchen can be good (and I'm generally a huge fan of alcohol establishments that cater to the late night munchies), the quality varies widely.  One time I was informed that they were only servering the daily special, which was lasagna.  That certainly sounded good enough to me, until I saw the woman go to the back, scoop lasagna out out of a Costco foil tray, and then stick it in the microwave.They also boast to be a ""former home of the Berkeley IRA.""  Here's a question:  if you're a member of the IRA, and your organization's purpose is to fight for the independence of Ireland, should you be in Ireland fighting for independence?"
The Starry Plough,"Jan 27, 2008","I am walking distance from this one and so have been here a bunch of times over the past several years. To me this is an unpretentious local watering hole with some great characters. When I have stopped in on my own for a beer while heading from here to there I have had some really amazing conversations with some kind people hanging out. And who can complain about the Imperial Pint? And frankly I love their cheeseburger and fries. These are frighteningly authentic fries here people. I am talking about a huge portion potato wedges bigger than your fingers brought to your table with all the condiments. For some reason I always slather mine in the malt vinegar that the fella from the kitchen brings to your table along with ketchup, mustard, and mayo. The burger may not be made from a politically correct grass fed cow who willingly gave its life for the good of humanity (not sure where they get their beef), but it is damn good. Thick. Juicy. And with a big old pile of crisp lettuce, a nice thick slice of tomato, onions, and pickles. And all of that is served on the plate next to your burger so you decide what to put on wnen they bring it to you. (I always eat the pickles on their own first). As far as being a music venue is concerned it can get absolutely packed but even when it does the people all seem very cool. Not pushing their way through the crowd. The one thing I wish they had was Sunday lunch hours. After writing my review I am now craving one of those burgers and I   they don't open till 4! Oh, did I mention the Imperial Pint?"
The Starry Plough,"Jan 27, 2008","More of a 3 1/2 star place, but the music was great so I'll round up!  Like someone mentioned, the lighting in this place is brighter than a bar should be.  That being said, I must have come on a good night for music! I heard 3 bands and all were awesome and sounded great because of the revamped system. The stage was nice, but the place is small and the sitting/standing situation is a bit awkward.  I wasn't much in the drinking mood, but the bartenders were nice and there is a $10 limit if you want to use a card to pay. Oh and the bathrooms were seriously the cleanest bar bathrooms I have EVER been in! I will definitely be back if there is a show I want to see."
The Starry Plough,"Jan 27, 2008",Now I am ONLY rating this bar as a music venue because I came to the bar already drunk and never bought any drinks but I had a great time dancing here to Izabella last night. The dance floor was big enough for a large crowd and the stage is elevated enough to actually be able to see the band which isn't always the case in the bay area. The stage area was nicely decorated and the music sounded great to me (I'm not an expert at sound by any means).
The Starry Plough,"Jan 25, 2008","Really good place to catch local bands live. Have been lucky enough to come in on a couple of nights when the lineup was rather awesome. As a venue it's a bit small, and hard to seat everyone who comes in to catch the act on a good night, but then again standing while listening is neither strange nor hard to do, so. Drinks are okay, prices are okay, but don't make the bartender mad or he'll slam a glass down onto the bar next to your head (if you are my friend so-and-so...)."
The Starry Plough,"Dec 26, 2007","I came here with a lady, grabbing a drink on a sunday night, just lookingh to hang out.  I had read about the Irish themed music/band that plays every Sunday night but I wasn't sure what to expect.  We got in, grabbed a drink and then pulled up a couple chairs next to this group of ten or more people, each playing a different instrument, just jamming to Irish tunes.  It was amazing to listen to the great music and to experience the classic Irish neighborhood feel that the musicians excuded.Great place to come with a date, or with just friends.  And they have darts!  Wahoo!"
The Starry Plough,"Nov 20, 2007","I've gone here for the live music, you have your good bands, and your not so good bands.  Whatever, that's all right with me.  Not enough seating for the live music portion though.  The pizza I had there last time however, was sooooo freakin' yummy!!  Mushrooms, sausage, cheesy cheese, really, it was sooooo good!!  And I tasted a bit of wine on it too.  Fantasmic pizza, good venue for live music, not sure about the alcohol...."
The Starry Plough,"Nov 18, 2007","If you like to be around upper class wanna be hippies (or yippies) and their babies on a Saturday night, then come here.  At least that is how it was last night when I went to see my friends band Blue Rabbit play.  What I found out when I arrived  was that it was a CD release party for some folky chick.  Every single song sounded exactly the same AND she played for an hour in a half BEFORE my friends band.  DEAR GOD! It was The most boring night, I could barely stay awake!They had food, my friend got an uncooked chicken sandwich, and we got garlic fries (that we didn't order) instead of garlic bread, and they only had beer and wine oh and yeah...Nantucket Nectars!!!! Woo hoo!  I thought it was a pub. Liquor would have saved the night from being a total loss.It may not be like this all of the time, but something tells me those yippies and their babies are there on a regular basis.  That shit freaks me out.  I'm staying in SF."
The Starry Plough,"Oct 29, 2007","So I went to this place this past Saturday night as part of an adventure with Rox M.  - and I have to say, I'm glad that she dragged me along to go there with her .....really nice first impression, nice atmosphere and a diverse group of people being there. ordered a 10"" pizza with sausage when stomach was growling and  it sure did feed the two of us just fine with a price that is more then reasonable to me. Nice selection of beers, too and so will definitely check out this place again in the near future. Also a plus - really close to Ashby Bart, a quick short stroll around the corner"
The Starry Plough,"Oct 25, 2007","As an Irish chick, I give this bar a solid 3. Yep, no whiskey. What's gonna go in my IV before I kick the bucket? Whiskey. Why? Because potatoes won't fit in the tube.I can't believe it took me this long to get there, but it was a bar. Just a bar. Like my man said, a very well-lit bar...too well lit. And the bathrooms a bit too clean--not that I'm complaining. But it didn't reek of rotting wood, cheap perfume and regurgitated alcohol--which is what I'm used to in an Irish Pub. If it's anything different, I am suspicious and there must be bodies buried under the stairs.The bartender was great, sweet and attentive, so ploughy stars for that. She keeps a smile on even though it looks like she's working in a hostel.It did smell a bit like old man in there. It could've been the gaggle of Bukowski's sitting around drinking, playing cards and going apeshit over the Sox game. They had fingers like Cheeto's and reeked of stale smoke when you walked by. I chose to sit by an open door.They serve pizza. And burgers. And sell T-shirts. I don't know if I'm down with that. I DO like the fact they have open mic nights, Celtic music (not that you'd catch me doing any Lord of the Dance bullshit) but it's admirable that they are a host to so many diverse events. If I'm in the neighborhood I may stop by again. If there is a good band playing, I'd definitely stop by. And bring my own flask. Shhh."
The Starry Plough,"Oct 24, 2007","When I used to live in the neighborhood, and went there all the time, this would have been a 4 or 5 star review.  These days, I'm just over the Plough.  Just went there for the first time in a few years, and it just wasn't doing anything for me.      There are a few things:1.  They don't have whiskey?  Wow.2.  People were watching the World Series on a tiny tiny TV.  In an Irish bar.  A well-lit Irish bar.3.  Did I mention it was fantastically well-lit at 6pm on a Wednesday?  That's just wrong.4.  According to the lady, it smelled like sweaty old men.  Can't tell you but I'll take her word for it.     Back when I lived around Ashby BART with 3 other roomies and communal meals, the Plough was fantastic.  Saw Jonathan Richman there.  Just missed Frank Black.  They did poetry slams.  I wasn't into the Irish dancing, but it came with the territory.  Now, the Plough doesn't have that much to offer, but I'd still go to a show there if they got Frank Black back . . ."
The Starry Plough,"Sep 12, 2007","Irish pub? Pubs have whiskey. Restaurants have beer. There used to be a ""bar"" in Philly across from Bob and Barbaras called the Tri-tone. I saw Mark Helias there. The Tri-tone had 3 bottles of cheap well booze on a slab of plywood propped up with milk crates. Great cutting edge music; genuinely silly home depot style bar. The Starry Plough is to irish pubs what the Tri-tone is to a bar. Maybe I'll be back.p.s. if you want a good irish pub see my review for O'Donovan's in Minneapolis"
The Starry Plough,"Jul 26, 2007","This is a great place.  I've seen some truly inspiring, vibrant slam poetry, straight from the soul and even performed here once myself.  It saddens me to see very degrading comments by some reviewers here about the SP, venting their perceived stereotypes so harshly, they becomes caricatures themselves--the thought of such self-absorbed individuals representing what San Francisco (a city I love) is to an outsider makes me grimace.  To come back to business, the Starry Plough is a heartfelt real community center that I reckon, is going to be around for a long time.  Doesn't get better than that."
The Starry Plough,"Jul 18, 2007","My first intro to The Starry Plough was on (what else?) Saint Patrick's Day. This being yet another ""passed it a million times for the last 10 years but never went in"" establishments, I am actually glad I never went or else I may not have kept my waifish figure for so long. *note said waifish figure no longer exists on me.*I wanted to be immersed in sweet music, rich heady beer, and savory brined meaty deliciousness (from the oven, you dirty birds). I was on the hunt for corned beef and cabbage. All hands pointed to here or Becketts. It was closer to home and not the insanity madhouse (well, almost, but not quite) of Becketts so two of my bestest friends fell prey to my promise of beer and briny meat to partake in St. Paddy's Day, Starry Plough style.The corned beef, cabbage and potatoes were great, as a return trip w/ JR reminded me. The Irish have a good thing going with all that salt and spices cooking up a pinky slab of beef. Being piggish as we always are, we tried to go for seconds but they ran out. Not surprising since it was around 9:30, so we tried their fish and chips. Too bad I don't remember how good it was, because my focus the entire day was seeking out the corned beef and cabbage so it looks like I'll have to go back and have a rematch. JR and I also had their chicken pot pie on another occasion, which was less desireable than the corned beef but on Sundays they apparently don't serve the full menu, they just make one veggie and one non-veggie dish. The crust was more biscuit-like than pie-crusty and most notably a good number of the potatoes in the pie weren't cooked throughly (there's a reason why chefs try to make everything uniform). We were starving however and ate around the uncooked potatoes, too busy listening to the reels, jigs and ceilis to care too much.  Many, many beers later, some spilt due to brimming pint glasses and inebriated jovial folks, an ear full of Irish tunes and two happily fed friends, we left the stuffy, humid building with good memories of good  food, good beer, good music and great friends. Thanks Starry Plough for the first but surely not the last St, Patrick's Day under your roof!"
The Starry Plough,"Jul 11, 2007","My friend Tom was in a band called Farma and they performed here.  I saw a few nice performances here other than them also.  Somethimes they had a dance DJ who was good.Great Irish beers on tap.  Good place to get drunk.  Makes me feel proud to be part Irish when I go there.  Why, I don't know, it's farfrom perfect.  I guess I like the Irish vibe there.  Sometimes they have Irish music and Irish customers."
The Starry Plough,"Jun 28, 2007","I don't care what anyone says, I love the Starry Plough. My best friend and I come here for poetry slam night when we can. We made our first embarassing attempt at slamming a few years back at this place. We have unforgettable memories with the Starry Plough."
The Starry Plough,"May 17, 2007",I lead a rather sheltered life in my 7x7 square of San Francisco... However last week I got out to the Starry Plough to see the Berkeley finals for Slam Poetry and had a BLAST!!! Truly a great pub that I will leave my bubble to visit again...
The Starry Plough,"Apr 28, 2007","Kind of biased, since I go here for the poetry slams, and those are inherently fun.  So stars for hosting them, Starry Plough.  And the beer wasn't bad, either. ;)"
The Starry Plough,"Apr 21, 2007","Well...there's the Starry Plough in Berkeley. There is the Plough and the Stars in Inner Richmond. One is an authentic Irish pub with music 5 nights per week, the other probably hosts music on a similar schedule but really shouldn't. I was slightly interested in going to Berkeley last night & seeing Wayward Sway perform at a bar similarly named to one of my favorite Clement St bars. They usually rock whatever venue they enter, but this was definitely an exception & not even their fault. From the start of their set, the sound was horrible. I'm not over exagerating, either. It sounded like the audio engineer was deaf--the instruments were about the same level as the vocals. A friend in the band mentioned that he didn't have stage monitor the entire time.For a ""live music"" venue & pub, this place horribly fails. Maybe it was a bad night for the audio guy, or maybe the apathetic & stuffy Berkeleytypes forced him into a downward spiral of not caring either.BEST PART:Thomas Kemper Root Beer on DraftIF YOU ARE ASKED OR HEAR THAT A FRIEND'S BAND IS PLAYING THIS VENUE, TRY TO TALK THEM OUT OF PLAYING HERE AT ALL COSTS!"
The Starry Plough,"Apr 21, 2007","Hmm... What can I say after my first foray into Berkeley nightlife?I'll stay in San Francisco, thank you very much.Went to the Plough last night to see a friend's band play. A folky, bluegrassy, hand-clappin', foot-stompin' crew. We were prepared for a good time; we'd heard good things about this place. That it was a great little pub-venue for local acts. We were expecting, well, um, FUN.But alas, this place was a real dud. First off, the kitchen was closed when we got there, at 10:00. Um... okay. What now? We'll get something to eat in the neighborhood! Only there's NOTHING in the neighborhood.But hey, it's not the Plough's fault the neighborhood is a snore. Also not their fault is the lame crowd that gathers there. The place was full. Full, alright. Of people drinking coffee and water (and one guy SLEEPING) and engrossed in conversations that I'm sure were way too sophisticated for us SF hoodlums to join in on. Because the joint had the most unfriendly vibe of any bar I've walked into in the Bay Area.They listened politely enough when the music started -- TOO politely. But they also never smiled. I kid you not. There was no smiling in this bar. I felt mildly retarded, grinning and swiveling to Martin's music.And they golf clapped. Once again, I kid you not. Golf clapping. To bluegrass.But again, that's a product of the people and not the bar. What IS the Plough's fault is that their sound guy SUCKS. Maybe it's because it was 4/20. Maybe he had a little too much wacky tobbacky, if you know what I mean... But he clearly was not hearing the same music we were hearing. Dude, vocals up. Stage monitors, perhaps? Seriously. It's not that hard. Four people shouldn't have to come up and tell you. Or maybe it's true: the Berkeley-ans are more intellectual than us San Franciscans. But our ears are definitely more refined."
The Starry Plough,"Apr 15, 2007","Easy going local pub.  I only drank, never tried the food.  I saw a couple bands there, who were both quite good.  A very comfortable venue.  The only negative I had that night was that the guy who was supposed to be collecting money for the bands came and asked for money halfway through the show, as we got in well before the bands begun.  I think that this was a pretty classless move on his part."
The Starry Plough,"Apr 14, 2007","Went here last night. It was everything I dreamed Berkeley would be and then some. :) Bar was a typical neighborhood bar, patrons were typical Berkeley. The band that played was really good (wish I could remember their name)."
The Starry Plough,"Mar 18, 2007","Went here for St-Paddy's Day last night and had a blast!  The band was fun and the crowd was into it.  It was really cool seeing people do Irish step-dancing...and fun to just dance around in Irish jigs!  The Guinness was pretty good, and I was actually surprised at the selection of beers (for an Irish pub).  Though it would have been nice if they had a liquor license so the wife could have had some Irish coffee or Baileys (she ain't a beer drinker).  Since it was late, the kitchen was closed so we could not actually try any of the food.This was my first time here and hopefully will not be the last.  The place had the feel of what a real Irish pub is supposed to be...neighborhood bar where people can hang out."
The Starry Plough,"Feb 7, 2007","An authentically grungy Irish pub-cum-cultural center situated in south Berkeley (""Broke-ley"") near Ashby BART, the Plough is a home away from home for grayhairs and willowy maidens alike. The food is greasy (but fairly decent) and dirt cheap ($2 burgers! Even dirt isn't this cheap!), the bar keeps BOTH Guinness AND Murphy's on tap, and is often tending by a charming 30-something dark-haired Irish lass who taught me a few words in Gaelic (ga ha mahagith to you too, darlin'). Their website calendar isn't updated frequently, but know this: weeknights you can expect a local cadre of regulars to bust out their fiddles, mandolins, and guitars to work up a feverish jig while patrons  nurse their stouts. Weekends usually feature a line-up of newly minted bands straight from their garages--not a good time for a quiet conversation. And here's the biggie--a dealbreaker for some--Wednesday nights are Slam Nights, when the Plough charges a cover to support bad poetry. The only time I was ever impressed by the quality was about five years ago when Mike Cirelli dominated the local poetry slam scene with his odes to waitresses and Point Reyes (dude even published a chapbook called ""My Tarnished Heart Still Blings"" before getting out of the inbred Slam scene for good).Still, for a local hangout with no pretense, no meat-market, and  good vibes (a good thing, in vibe-friendly Berkeley), the Plough is a Brokeley favorite."
The Starry Plough,"Jan 25, 2007","This pub is a Berkeley institution, with a nice beer selection and a fantasticly simple grill serving the best cheese burger in the Bay Area.The vibe is VERY laid back, friendly and neighborhood-y. During the day it's a group of local characters until the music kicks in then the age range drops.The booker at this place is a top notch, she keeps the music and performances very eclectic. Plenty of  live music- both touring acts and locals. I've seen some bigger names at this place. The open mic and poetry slam happen every week as well as Irish dance lessons and an Irish jam session."
The Starry Plough,"Dec 26, 2006","Not your traditional bar, but not bad either.  This place is offbeat enough for me to dig it.  I didn't mind the brighter lights, and I enjoyed watching the Irish dancing on a Monday night, even though I did not partake.It seems to be a very Berkeley crowd, intellectual/radical hippie.  I sat at a table eavesdropping on a guy at the bar telling practically anyone who'd listen his conspiracy theory about the war for oil... oh Berkeley!  It's unmistakable.I enjoyed it for what it was, not the best place ever, but friendly with some pretty decent conversation."
The Starry Plough,"Dec 7, 2006","nothing like finding comfort in an old familiar space, with decent food. the fish & chips tonight were dissapointing, but filling. still can't help but love the charm of this little corner pub."
The Starry Plough,"Oct 9, 2006",A dirty ghetto cool vibrant musical venue. Different bands and diverse crowd.Sorry I don't have much else to say - I was very sleepy and hungover when I went.
The Starry Plough,"Sep 5, 2006","For about 6 months, a couple of years ago, I played open mic here every Tuesday.  Sometimes it would go until 1pm.  I enjoyed myself, even though open mic can be brutal here (as I guess it can be most anywhere), because people are getting wasted and they want something entertaining for the most part.  They don't want you to express yourself artistically so much as make a fool of yourself, which is fine.  Definitely fine. Anyway, I like the Starry Plough.  I appreciate people getting up and doing whatever it is they do. I think the Poetry Slam Wednesdays is a lot bigger than open mic Tuesdays. Their beer selection is poor, but that's an Irish pub for you -- it's all about the Guinness."
The Starry Plough,"Aug 20, 2006","The Starry Plough hosts many different events. Which means that you should probably check what event is going on there before you head out, because maybe you're not the kind of person who wants to spend their Tuesday night watching depressed Berkeley girls with shaved heads twang away on their acoustic guitars while singing about lust. I know I'm not. Thankfully, Starry Plough has a decent enough selection of beer so you can at least get nice and hammered during the Tuesday night open mic session. Bounus points for you if you pass out.This place, I think, has plenty of ambience. It just isn't the hip kind that you can get in San Francisco at nearly every bar you go to. The Starry Plough is laid back as hell, and it's more of a community atmosphere. Friday and Saturday nights are their live music nights. Once again, a very hit or miss thing. Awesomely awesome bands like Charming Hostess, Idiot Flesh (rip) and The Kehoe Nation have played here, but that don't mean crap. They're really lax with their booking policies so you could end up watching some group of 17-year-olds who have no practice outside of their mom's garage.Another heads up: a lot of the regulars at the plough are weird as hell. Middle-aged, former hippies who damaged so many brain cells while dropping acid that they now forget to wear deodorant. Personally, I find it endearing."
The Starry Plough,"Jul 11, 2006","The Starry Plough is unmistakably Berkeley.  If you yanked the place up by it's foundations and plopped it into any other city, it wouldn't work in it's current form.  It can only work in Berkeley...and it works well in Berkeley. The soothing sound of  Rhythm + Blues greeted my ears as I walked into the most well-preserved stronghold of old-guard Berkeley culture I've yet to encounter.  An aging bar with a  feel of history sits up against the South Wall, while a sizable stage sits off to the side of the entrance facing Shattuck Ave.  Adding to the Berkley theme, a sizable collection of aging political flyers announcing protests, rallies, and varying political statements graces the area around the door.  A fair amount of seating sits in front of the stage, gracefully blending into an eating area near the kitchen in the back. Several windows near the entrance enhance a pleasant daytime vibe. The incoming sunlight  creates a natural glow around the end of the bar, then slowly fades to an appropriate cafe-like subtleness in the dining area.  The Starry Plough's layout is truly interesting.  It incorporates the elements of a bar, a performance area, a kitchen, and a restaurant into one space...and does so without any one section stepping on the toes of another. It's very old-school....and very Berkeley. I sipped an ale and looked around the Starry Plough, glancing about at several young couples as I chatted politics with a collection of middle aged men.  At the same time, I could easily image being transported forty years prior to another time, where the events advertised by the antique posters on the wall were taking place.  I could envision the place filled with long hair, tie-die shirts, and peace-sign medallions.  It was easy to look up on the stage and envision idealistic voices from the last generation attempting to rile the masses to support the passion of their choosing.   In this day and age, countless memoirs of local culture have perished at the hands of the hip and trendy, and few remain.  Finding the Starry Plough was a refreshing experience.  While old-school Berkeley may not be a significant piece of history, it's history nonetheless.  And somehow, after quaffing a few pints at the Starry Plough, I feel just a bit more in touch with what it was..."
The Starry Plough,"Apr 27, 2006","You don't come here for their wide selection of drinks or the decor, you come here to watch local musicians show off their stuff.  Jeff Buckley used to play here long, long ago; the talent is no longer what it used to be.  Still fun to watch, though."
The Starry Plough,"Apr 1, 2006","That reminds me... I have been to The Starry Plough many Wednesday nights for their Poetry Slam contests. There's always a ton of energy during these slam contests, and even if you can't understand a word the poets are speaking, their theatrics are entertaining enough. However, I have never come here for the bar itself and decided one Sunday to check it out with a friend. Well apparently Sunday night is Celtic night, or otherwise known as ""church"" to those who scoff at it. I soon discovered why...people gather together to sing old Irish folk songs, play Celtic music, and dance folk dances. This was very interesting to watch, and enjoyable to listen to Irish music while drinking Guinness, that is until I wanted to hold a conversation with my friend and the director stopped the music and made examples of us. Evidently, talking during ""church"" is absolutely unacceptable. I would have completely understood had I been in a real church, but we were in a bar for crying out loud.  I agree with others--The Starry Plough is old and tired. But, I'll still go for poetry slams..."
The Starry Plough,"Mar 31, 2006","They have a decent selection of beers, but the lack of ambiance and the crappy food doesn't really drive me to hang out there and pay $4/pint.  The fish 'n chips I had last night were horrible.  They serve frozen fish, like a big fish stick and it smells bad.  The chips were soggy and made me sick to the stomach.I agree about the quality of their draft system, the first pint of Lagunitas IPA I had was off, the second was better.  I've put down more than a keg of that beer in my time and visited their brewery at least twice...I know what that stuff is supposed to taste like.If you're coming there to see a band you like, then go for it.  But don't go there for the food or drinks."
The Starry Plough,"Mar 12, 2006","I love love love the Starry Plough. Memmories galore. The staff (and most of the patrons, for that matter) are super-friendly. Very warm vibe. You can go either just to hang out participate in one of their theme nights.My favorites:Sunday night: I don't especially like Irish people or culture but Irish Sunday nights are badass! Real Irish people playing real Irish intruments (what is that drum/ harp?) making real Irish music (""The night before we sailed away,"" etc.) Feel free to sing along or just get shloshed.Tuesday nights: Open Mic night--always a guarenteed good time- even if the acts are shitty. This is my favorite. Some of the acts are OK, many horrible but it is a very interactive affair and always very entertaining. Plus the flamboyant MC and her soundgirl(Girl George) are gratious and hillarious hosts who make sure everyone is having fun.Cheap beer, bar food etc.Especially good for entertaining visitors."
The Starry Plough,"Feb 17, 2006","SP Poetry Slam = Poetry Slop. I can't believe they charge a cover when you can ignore white suburban ""artists"" in their REI pants for free any other day of the week.They won't give you earplugs, butt least they'll serve you beer."
The Starry Plough,"Feb 5, 2006","irish pub.  They have open mic on Tuesday, you basically go and sign up at 7:30 and chill have a few drinks til it's your turn or you can always come back.  Some amazing talents they attract and it's a great place to meet and get connected.  Each night has something different."
The Starry Plough,"Dec 2, 2005","This is a great bar with a great community vibe. The after work scene in there is mellow and relaxing, but at the same time they can really pick it up and pack in a crowd for any number of quality musical acts that they book. The sound in there is good, and the stage is only a couple feet off the floor, so its very intimate. On top of that, the bar has the best collection of protest propaganda from the past 30 years, yellowed from hanging on the wall in a formerly smoky bar. They really ought to restore those. And they DO need to clean out some of those lines AND get IPA back on tap for my uncle who spends too much of his time and money in there to be denied the beer he likes god damn it! Ok. I digress. The food here is great. Ricardo is an awesome chef and the bar is lucky to have him because if the food sucked on TOP of there being sour beer in some of those lines then the place would have shut its doors years ago. The best show I have seen there, and also the most crowded, was the Asylum Street Spankers from Austin, TX. Go check these guys out next time they come in to town, but dont forget to use your inside voices. If you do forget, the band will remind you. They frequently tell the crowd to shut up because they play acoustic intruments with minimal amplification. And they are great.There are two references to the Starry Plough on Yelp. I wonder if they'll figure out a way to merge all the repeat entries? But thats a question for the webmaster. This is where reviews go, right? Ok."
The Starry Plough,"Nov 3, 2005","They have Poetry Slam on Wednesdays.  An event you must experience at least once.  There are some crazy talents folks and not equally crazy not-so talented folks.  If the poet lurks deep within your inner soul of souls show up early before 7:30 and sign up your name.  Don't go over the 3 minutes or you're score will drop!! While you wait for your turn or if you just want to sit back and watch the performances there's beer and food.  The place is wooden, dark and cozy...a great place to hear some drunk poetry."
The Starry Plough,"Apr 27, 2005","If you're looking for a good time in the East Bay on Wednesday, check this place out.  I went a couple of weeks ago and thoroughly enjoyed myself.  Wednesday night is Poetry Slam Night, and local/national poets sign up to send you into both a verbal and mental tizzy.  There is usually a featured poet/guest or two.  The night I went, Kid Beyond (the ultimate beatboxer) was a featured guest he was way cool (although some of his numbers were a bit on the long side).  The event is judged by the lottery picked members of the audience who hold up numeric scores after he poet goes, and the best part is that each of the 5 audience judges get a free beer for their services.  The host of the event was witty and entertaining, the talent on stage was impressive, and the crowd was down to earth and respectful of the poets.  The house jazz band, 3 Blind Mice, was surprisingly REALLY good and weaved in and out of the poets quite well. The show starts at 8:30pm, there's 2 rounds of poetry, and it goes till about 12:30pm. I had a great time and would definitely go back.   http://www.starryploughpub.com/poetryslam.html  http://www.daniland.com/slam/"
The Starry Plough,"Apr 22, 2005","It's true that the Starry Plough is mostly a folk-oriented venue and is nominally an Irish pub, but they're pretty loose in their booking policies and will gladly take rock bands that lean toward the cabaret/acoustic/folk/art side of things--hence my memorable times here seeing Ramona the Pest, Mark Growden, Charming Hostess, etc.  Their open mic night is also one of the better ones I've been to and attracts some respectable talent while keeping the mood friendly and congenial.  Of course they've got good beers and even serve a pretty decent pizza along with their other varieties of pub food."
