SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Jan 11, 2023","I've been here before.I don't remember why I came here, but I have definitely walked through those freaking doors and been inside this building.  This last time was special, because I was able to go in the back and watch a bunch of nerds playing a bunch of instruments and singing a bunch of songs.  Like, ""l al alala lalalalal I'm singing! La la la al alalala!""  Ya know, typical song-stuffs.They have beer.  This is good for drinking.  This is also good for making important decisions.People talk about acoustic stuff here and how good they are.  So there's that.  Okay. Cool.Bye!"
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Sep 27, 2022","Been here many times, and it seems that lots has changed since COVID. The comic book shop looks very empty with shelves up against the wall instead of forming aisles, cute seating on the border, and it's very spacious inside, whether this setup is due to special events or due to the pandemic. The music hall in the back where the concerts are held looks more beautiful and inviting than I remember (or maybe it's just the person I was with that made me feel that way). Lots of colorful lighting, great posters on the wall, plenty of seating (with just a few tables), and of course the tiki-themed decor everywhere. The food and drink offerings are limited here, but it's better than nothing.We visited this past weekend, and got to enjoy performances by Tuz & The Sound and Social Justice Collective, talented musicians who were just extraordinary, poets performing beautifully with rhythms of different music on stage. The drummer was particularly outstanding, and the artists on stage were all smiles and seemed to be having such a great time the entire night, which made the perfect atmosphere for the crowd as well. The show ended around 10pm, so it was about 2 hours long. But you don't need to arrive at the start time, which made it convenient for us as we opted to take our time having dinner on a Saturday evening before attending.Art Boutiki does live music the way it should be, with great sound quality and lighting, professional setup and equipment on stage, and no messy wires creating a distraction for audiences. And of course, great bands! I did get a bit warm in there (it was a hot day in SJ), but they had the fans blowing, so it wasn't too bad."
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Dec 8, 2019",Best venue for music in San Jose.How many placed have a comic store in the front. A music venue in the back and a hidden away printing shop for all your t-shirt needs and shenanigans?!Probably the most versatile place ever. I've been a huge fan of this place since they were in downtown San Jose and I continue to love this place til this day. Its been awhile since I have been there (due to life complications) but I always recommend friends to check out music even if they are unfamiliar with the band. You won't be disappointed. Also -- the family who runs this business support local music which is a huge plus. They really do the SJ music scene a huge favor around here by showcasing fresh or seasoned talent without ego :)
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Nov 11, 2019","Great small venue for listening to live music or performances.  We saw the Top Shelf Big Band there and the sound and lighting were wonderful.  Their website warns you that parking is not great, so we had UBER drop us at their door step, easy-peasy!  They had a decent selection of wine and beer.  They even have food, which they call small bites. No fresh fruits or vegetables were available as far as I know. You go up the bar to get your drinks and order food.  They give you a restaurant pager that lights up and jiggles to let you know when to pick up your food.  The food was served in paper plates, but it was a normal wine glass. Periodically, I gave the bar empty beer bottles, dirty napkins, dirty paper plates and dirty wine glasses. The seating includes about 10 dinner tables and various upholstered chairs behind that.  The music started at 7PM on a Sunday evening with a crowd of 50-60 people. Starting at 6PM would be even better for us as so many places start at 8PM or 9PM for music which is too late for us.  We bought the tickets on line for about $16.xx including an on line surcharge.  The food items and drinks were all under $10 each."
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Oct 2, 2019","Great atmosphere here! Dan is awesome, fun and friendly. Super cool place to check out."
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Sep 18, 2019","These guys rule I guess they've been around for a little while Unbeknownst it it to me but I just checked out a comedy show there tonight seriously for almost free their menu their accommodations their staff their drinks are excellent and it was the comics that brought it all home! Seven comedians including the hostess five female, two male we are outstanding! I've been to shows that advertised to be far more legit than this and I am truly blown away for not only was it just me but the rest of the crowd truly laughed, howled, clapped, yelled for all of these comedians were just so professional! At the end of the show they announced they would be doing a comedy lineup like this monthly... Count me in! Please consider checking out this venue if you haven't yet add it to your list October 23 is their next gig... I'm sold!"
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Feb 25, 2019","I got to play on the stage here the other day and I have to say tgis place is a great place to play. The sound is incredible complete with a real sound guy that knows his craft.   The front room is a comic shop that sells all sorts of books and shirts and trinkets and stuff. The back room with the stage has a bar that serves beer and wine. You can also order food from their limited menu.   I would love to give them 5 stars but they sell food and it's really bad. My wife ordered a chicken bowl and I never heard the end of it. The white rice was crunchy like it was cooked and reheated and her chicken was still frozen in the middle. Ugh, I didn't get any food but she was quite disturbed.    I think ultimately this is a killer music venue and all the other stuff is just a bonus. I say go to the taqueria across the street then come see the show. Rock'it!"
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Feb 2, 2019","SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery reminds me of mullet: business in the front, party in the back. The front part of Art Boutiki is a store, and the back part of Art Boutiki is a legit music venue.Art Boutiki's front store has a small selection of comics, statues, toys, pop culture art, clothing, and other miscellaneous items. I must say though that Art Boutiki isn't the kind of comic book store where I would go for my weekly comics pull. You'll mostly find trades. During nights when there are shows, this area becomes a great mingling space for bands and their fans since bands have their merch tables set up in this part of the establishment. So far I've been to Art Boutiki twice. I went to a show a few years ago to see a Seattle band called General Mojo's, and the latest show I saw was with the SJ local band, The Pounders. Art Boutiki's music venue is perfect for small, intimate performances. They do serve alcohol, but I believe only beer and wine. It's got a decent size general standing area, but there are lounge chairs and couches in the back. The sound and acoustics sound great at Art Boutiki. I like how Art Boutiki carries out the tiki theme. You'll find Polynesian art and tiki masks throughout the entire place. Even the bar at the corner of Art Boutiki's music venue is a small tiki bar stand."
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Jan 25, 2019","I've been coming to this venue for 2 years now.My friends play here, but I've come for other events, although primarily for the folk/indie scene.It's a small place, seats maybe 50-60 people comfortably. They have an easy to see stage from all angles and it's decently lit. The ambience lends itself to an island feel - Art Boutiki, emphasis on the Tiki.They serve drinks of all kinds, coffee, tea, beer, and wine.Their beer is more on the IPA side, but still a couple other varieties. The wine is a bit short, just a few selections, but enough to appease.Their sound board is on point - never too loud and they are dialed quite well for the size of the room.You can preorder tickets usually online for a few bucks cheaper, walk ins are around 12 bucks for the night.Usually it's 2-3 groups for a total of 3-4 hours of play. Almost always worth the time.I'll keep going here and I always look forward to their events. An absolute gem of San Jose."
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Dec 26, 2018","Dan is the man for all your DTG printing needs! He is great to work and always makes sure my orders are done exactly how they are supposed to be for me and my clients. He makes sure the garments that are selected will work, that the artwork looks good on the garment and gets everything done in a timely matter. I could not be happier that I found him and Art Boutiki when I was at a loss to find a new DTG printer. He really is a supporter of all things art and music which makes him a rare gem and the kind of man I love giving business to! He has been a blessing to work with and I highly recommend him and Art Boutiki!"
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Jul 6, 2018","This is a great venue.The front is a comic shop the back is a decent sized space for local indie bands to perform.Shows are typically affordable ($10 a person door fees usually). I've seen several locals play this venue and brought my Wife and teenage Son.A couple that's lived in San Jose has owned and operated the place for a long time and is highly respected by the bands and customers that frequent it.I've seen a lot of great local talent here.They serve alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages and an assortment of appetizer type dishes. Pizza, chicken fingers, that sort of thing.The only con is that it's in an area where the zoning goes from commercial to residential so they tend to close around midnight. They are also in a part of town that honestly looked a little sketchy to me but I've never had any problems."
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Jul 2, 2018",The best place in San Jose for local live music.
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Feb 24, 2018","I've been to this place a few dozen times over the years and it's never the same place twice. The comic store front always has something to read, wear, or keep on a shelf. The variety of musical events makes it unique. Jam bands, pop duos, open mics, Jazz, Indy, you name it! Customer service is 100% kind and the beer selection includes local brews and trusted favorites. Never a dull moment. If you're lucky, Bill will be on Lights creating an epic event for all."
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Feb 21, 2018","San Jose Jazz has had a few events here, we recently saw La Misa Negra, awesome Oakland band, Cumbria/Latin very high energy!  There is some seating around the perimeter of the room but it is set up to get people moving. Will keep an eye on their performance calendar.  The food is limited but the Mexican place directly across the street is very good and reasonably priced."
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Dec 16, 2017","Great little hidden gem of a place to see local live music.  Acoustics are excellent, vibe is friendly, bathrooms are super clean, and there's plenty of space to dance or just lounge around on the various recliners, chairs and couches.   It's a big open warehouse-y type space so it can be a little chilly inside in the winter.  Bring a jacket like your mama told you to.I didn't look at the food menu but they have some nice craft beer and ciders.  Prices were reasonable.  Will definitely be back!"
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Oct 27, 2017","Great source for direct to garment printing I have used them many time, and I strongly recommend their -shirt printing services."
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Jun 2, 2017","Family run business, all ages music venue, a couple dozen beers to choose from in bottles, good selection of food, and good entertainment. Solid vibe and an eclectic art and comic selection. Owner is a nice dude and the sound engineering is awesome. Great place to play if you're a band and a good place to watch if you wanna catch a local show."
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"May 17, 2017","Like others have stated THIS SHOULD NOT BE A UPS ACCESS POINT.  They are only open limited hours, parking sucks, and they don't honor the business hours posted."
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Mar 14, 2017",Really great comic shop.   the hidden gem of south bay music venues
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Jan 22, 2017","I went last evening to the open mic that is hosted at Art Boutiki. I was absolutely blown away and will definitely be back. First off, the venue:The place itself has a deliciously cool warehouse feel - without the terrible acoustics. The stage was impressively setup and for once, the soundboard was in the back, where competent sound guys were manning the board. The staff:Extremely friendly staff, utterly lacking the smug hipsterism too often seen at other venues and events. They were genuinely glad to help their customers and treated me - and the rest of the musician rabble - very well. The open mic:This was, hands down and by far, the coolest open mic that I've been to, and I've visited from Dallas to Detroit to LA, to everywhere in between.  Why?It was perfectly eclectic. Although there was a hip-hop overtone, ALL were warmly received. I played an acoustic set. I was followed by numerous comedians, rappers, and a couple of monologues. The environment was one of community and not competition - a sentiment felt and experienced at most other open mics that I've been to. In short, in a single evening, this place earned my respect and my business."
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Nov 7, 2016","Tons of fun here at this all ages venue. Great sound system, friendly folks on staff, and a huge variety of musical acts other performances to be enjoyed. Truly a gem in San Jose."
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Oct 25, 2016","Dan's got a great performance space, neat comic book store AND he has a print shop that does fabulous work.  He's an intriguing guy who understands the meaning of customer service.  Great addition to the neighborhood!"
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Aug 6, 2016","This place should NOT BE A UPS ACCESS POINT...they are NEVER open and I want my damn package.  I just reported them to UPS and apparently I am not the first, second or third to make this complaint.  Looks like this place will no longer be an access point for UPSYou have no business being affiliated with UPS if your not open late or on the weekends."
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Mar 6, 2016","Nice spot, great for music. I'd say the only improvement is to get a beer or two on tap. Cool comic book collection, but that wasn't really my thing."
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Feb 12, 2016","They have a good selection of comics, art and collectors toys. I went in and got a Transformers action figure (They have some) and the customer service was great. I told one of the employees "" I'll take Hot Rod"" and then I was rightly corrected when he said "" You mean Rodimus Prime?"" . Well said, well said. The prices range from inexpensive to very expensive. It depends on what you're looking at. The employees are pretty helpful when you ask though."
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Aug 14, 2015","This place is a treasure among hidden treasures.I remember going to SLG Art Boutiki once or twice about 6 or 7 years ago, when it was on South First street in a little warehouse space.At that time I thought it was very cool, but life circumstances conspired such that I did not end up going there much, and forgot about it.This week, there was a special showing of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" hosted by Lord Blood-Rah, and it was awesome.  The comic shop portion of it is awesome, and the bar-and-grill performance art/theater space has a killer snack bar.  This place rocks."
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Apr 17, 2015",The venue is absolutely amazing! Great size to accommodate more than a hand full of people.The food...not so much. Will never be ordering food from there again.
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Mar 19, 2015","This a great spot for attending a show or event. The event space is unique, memorable, and very comfortable. Also, if you are here for music, the acoustics are wonderful. (Ask any musician who's played there.)Now that they have a beer and wine license, the environment is even more welcoming for a music or comedy event. And there are regular open mic nights (to discover new musicians) as well as an active concert calendar.If you're into comics and graphic novels, you'll really enjoy the shop in the front that features some predictable fare as well as some unique one-of-a kind publications and artwork.Good spot!"
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Mar 14, 2015","I give up, after three attempted visits during hours that are listed as ""open"" on Yelp (today's being at 2pm on a Saturday) I have found Boutiki to never be open for business! There aren't even operating hours listed on the sign in the window. What gives?! I have no choice but to give one star out of frustration and for wasting my time."
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Mar 7, 2015","I can't speak for the comics, but we came here last night to see a friend's band play. There was a $5 cover, and beer and wine were available to purchase. We parked across the street with no problem. Good acoustics and friendly employees. Awesome!"
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Jan 19, 2015","My band Polysonic Soul played here the other night. The place has got a great stage and acoustics. They even have a sound engineer to get us dialed in. The owner was pretty cool and accommodating. They sell some food and drinks and are working on obtaining a license to sell alcohol. Definitely a venue we would come back to play. I didn't hang out in the front of the store which sells comic books and some other items. Parking can be a bit of challenge, but it was all worth it."
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Oct 25, 2014","I come here whenever my friend's band plays. The store has a pretty neat collection of comics, old and new, and collectible figures. I find myself nerding out everytime I browse through their inventory, haha. The venue behind the store has a great P.A. system and th acoustics are decent. Definitely worth checking out."
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Aug 23, 2014",place was super dope. went for a show. really cheap and really low key. met some really cool down to earth people there. keep doing your thing.
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Jul 29, 2014","They've got a great collection of art work hanging in the walls, and they change it up every month."
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Jul 18, 2014","I am not a comic book chick but ended up here for a music event in their back room behind the mysterious curtain. For $10 you have access to their tables, sofas, and a snack shack in the corner. The stage for the performers is pretty small but I liked the intimate vibe in the room. Worth checking out, I wouldn't mind coming here again for future events."
SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery,"Jul 23, 2013","I have never heard of this place before I went to see a show there for Wander. This place is uber cool. It is an art gallery/comic book store with a room in the back for events such as parties or shows.The events room is decked out with tiki idols and lights, lots of couches and chairs. I walked in finding myself extremely attracted to this place and automatically thinking, ""wow this place is really cool."" They have a great collection of different comics and toys and even clothing at very affordable prices. (bought a shirt for only 5 dollars; very high quality material) I cannot wait to be back in San Jose so I can come back here!"
