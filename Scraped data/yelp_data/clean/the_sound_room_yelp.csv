The Sound Room,"Mar 12, 2024",Great spot for live music. the space is intimate and the acoustics are fantastic. The staff are very kind too.
The Sound Room,"Mar 2, 2024","*Awesome hostess - she knows her people well*Great crowd - kids are welcomed*Never a bad seat in the house*Fresh yummy food*When the show is over, everyone goes home*Of course, the music is off the chain!"
The Sound Room,"Jan 18, 2024","The food was amazing!  The ambiance was fabulous. It's a very welcoming community.  The concert was excellent. It's very intimate and small, which is wonderful, because you really get to see the musicians close up making their magic!"
The Sound Room,"Aug 7, 2023","My first time at The Sound Room. I went for my birthday as I LOVE jazz and live bands. I loved the vibe here. Everyone came to listen to good music.  But seemed like most of the people there were regulars and for the most part knew each other.  This is a non-profit organization supporting local bay area artists. However, the audience was not very diverse.  As a Black American, I couldn't help but notice there were fewer than 10 Black people in the room, including the singer (we actually counted about 8).  We arrived just at 7:30 pm when the show started, so we didn't try the food.  But there was a separate area near the entrance where you could order and pick up your food and beverages and bring to your table.  We ordered a bottle of rose that was pretty good, and reasonably priced.  There was no table service, which was fine considering what you got with the cover charge, which was 3 hours of live performance.We had the pleasure of listening to Chloe Jean who was phenomenal. If all the artists are of her caliber, I'll definitely go back again and again.  If you don't mind this place not being very diverse, I highly recommend."
The Sound Room,"May 8, 2023","We heard Kenny Washington on Saturday night at the new Sound Room. It was our first time in the new building. Same great music, same wonderful seating actually even better than before. We paid for a table directly in the middle and didn't have to show up an hour early to get good seats. We felt we had the best in the house and I chose them on-line. Great to arrive a few minutes before the show started because our table was reserved for us. If you're a music lover, it's a great venue!!"
The Sound Room,"Mar 30, 2023","Would not recommend! When I entered the establishment I was greeted with a very aggressive ""Can I help you?! Can I help you??"" As opposed to the folks that walked in right before me and nothing was said to them. Can't speak on the experience of the music or anything else because as a person of color this instantly turned me away. I won't ever go back."
The Sound Room,"Jan 3, 2023","I have only been to the old venue, so I'm looking forward to seeing the new one. They really pay attention to details whether it be to the food & drink being served, or to the artist.Very intimate small venue. I liked the size of this venue, so we'll see how it compares to the new one. If I had my preference I would always choose small."
The Sound Room,"Dec 20, 2022","I loved the band, ambiance, vittles, and hosts!  Wonderful time all around for the grown and sexy. I'll definitely be back."
The Sound Room,"Dec 5, 2022",Great venue and staff.  Got a chance to catch a stellar jazz quintet there and grab a drink.
The Sound Room,"Nov 14, 2022",Intimate vibe with good acoustics and friendly staff. I highly recommend the Sound Room!
The Sound Room,"Sep 27, 2022","What a wonderful venue to see some live music! The Sound Room is an intimate experience to see wonderful, local performers play all types of live music. The owners are passionate about the quality of music they bring in. You can feel the love and hospitality the moment you walk in. The room is fairly small so the sound of the music is clear, bold and loud. They offer wine, beer and even some good food. This is a wonderful place for a date night & to sit back, relax and enjoy the musicians play great music."
The Sound Room,"Sep 3, 2022","Great band, great sound and a wonderful time!!!Lightening was good, we could see and each player's solo performance. We will be back."
The Sound Room,"Aug 26, 2022","Great spot! Perfect for intimate shows where you can really share the room with performers. First time there last night, but definitely not the last."
The Sound Room,"Mar 13, 2022","The venue was very cold ...the ac was in.  After the show, we came out to find our car window smashed ..we were parked on Broadway ...recommend using a parking garage"
The Sound Room,"Feb 27, 2022",Such a nice spot! Came here with some friends for a Brazilian samba performance. I was initially worried that the vibe would be pretentious (as some Jazz spots can be) but there was nothing but friendliness. It sounds like this space is much larger than their previous location. I really liked their brick lined semi-developed interior style. I will probably be going to more of their events.
The Sound Room,"Feb 5, 2022","The Sound Room is the hidden gem of a great Jazz club in Oakland. Richard & Karen, the mom & pop owners of the Sound Room have poured their hearts, souls, money, passion and sincere dedication to provide a home for top performing jazz, blues, soul & Brazilian artist with occasional comedy mixed in.     Richard & Karen make sure the musicians get paid as Richard & Karen are many times unpaid volunteers whom have put the Sound Room together at a hefty expense to them to provide great music for you.     Richard is an architect and the sound system and room acoustics are the best!They have recently rebuild the grand piano for optimal action and tone.    Many wonderful artist and have graced my body, mind & soul from the Sound Room and have left me singing.    Bravo Sound Room! Well Worth It!!"
The Sound Room,"Dec 10, 2021","The Sound Room disappointed my 1st time at the new spot by turning my table for 2 into a table for 4 because the artist invited 2 guests and I guess my table was the only place they could seat these guest of the performer. The owner Karen, an appropriate name for sure, claimed she had no choice. I said their is always a choice. She offered to refund my $$ for the tickets and I said no since I had already purchased food and drinks.The refund wasn't the issue, the issue was selling me a table for two and adding unknown/unwanted people because the performer wanted it.Then before the show started, they moved us to a table for 2 in the back by the bathroom door.  They should have moved the people at my table since I paid for it and they didn't... Won't be returning Karen....P.S the one star is for the food. It was very good."
The Sound Room,"Oct 3, 2021","Sound Room has been the secret place that Oaklanders have kept for a long time.  Karen and Robert the power couple with a passion for Jazz and blues created this non profit organization over 20 years ago at the their home and they have been supportive of this cause for years.  You always feel welcome at this place and know you walk out of it feeling better about the world we live in.  First Fridays of the month, Jason Cole has a great line up of comedians and no single show is like the other.  I recently celebrated my 53rd birthday at this venue and my friends had tons of fun.  At one point In the middle of the show I turned around to my guests and saw more than a hand full of them laughing in tears!  I couldn't imagine a better way to treat my friends.  Highly recommended."
The Sound Room,"Aug 7, 2021","The Sound Room is known as a jazz venue but does comedy the first Friday of the month. Such a great spot with a really chill vibe. Comedians were funny and the drinks and snacks were delicious. I had the Moulin Rouge to drink, which was delicious and the hummus, which was AMAZING. Everyone working there, from the founders to the staff to the show's MC, was super friendly and gracious. Can't wait to go back."
The Sound Room,"Jul 4, 2021","I saw The Family Jules Band show last night and it was amazing. They rocked it!!Finally after more than a year I was able to join friends and music lovers for live music. Thank you to everyone at the Sound Room, especially Karen and Robert, for making it possible. You bring a bright light to all of us. I love it!"
The Sound Room,"May 16, 2020","I love the sound room!!! Intimate venue with perfect sound system and customer focused employees/volunteers.  Thier main focus is to keep jazz alive.  While I have ventured out to occasionally see a jazz show...my personal preference is for the Blues and Big Band shows!!!  Always fantastic treat...homey venue with great staff.  Ok...during this pandemic with ""no live venues"" open...why am I writing this review now? Besides the good food, good music, nice crowd of people that usually make this a go to favorite...it's because the gentleman that works the front door was so generous to find me and my partner seats to a show I really wanted to see. I had driven over the bridge without tix and space was tight...also known as sold out. I will never forget his generosity and kindness...we had a great evening and a great show.  Now fast forward to this time of financial difficulty...and they have again stepped up. Now they are offering live stream shows. I continueto be impressed and appreciative of their dedication to the art of music.  Now they are requesting donations to keep the fire going.  Please consider donating to the great mom & pop style venue...and may the music continue.https://www.gofundme.com/f/Keep-Jazz-Alive-at-the-Sound-Room?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link-tip&utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheetWarm appreciation,Sharine"
The Sound Room,"Oct 6, 2019","I loved this place! Great atmosphere with live jazz music! Mature crowd, a perfect place to take your lady. Customer service was professional and welcoming. Definitely will be coming back with my wife who also enjoyed the experience."
The Sound Room,"Aug 16, 2019","Super great little venue that hosts many local artists. It's small and intimate with folding chairs and stools and small coffee tables laid out, so get there early to snag a good spot with prime viewing of the stage. Food and beverages are also served and at reasonable prices ~$8 for a plate of two vegetarian tacos, $14 for empanadas. All were flavorful and conveniently delivered to your seat.I fully enjoyed having dinner while watching a local jazz group perform. Definitely a great weekend night out with my brother!"
The Sound Room,"May 24, 2019","Been here many times and never disappointed. Great jazz, great food, great wine and great company. Recommend to everyone."
The Sound Room,"May 11, 2019",Always great music options! Love the food and wine choices too. Good acoustics and great accommodations for any physically challenged guests.
The Sound Room,"Nov 20, 2018",Best spot in Oakland for Jazz and Comedy. Reasonably priced and friendly staff.
The Sound Room,"Nov 19, 2018","The Brazilian jazz band gave a excellent performance last sat.  The gentleman doing the seating and the lady   owner were very cordial and very professional.  However The male owner of the venue was outside throwing f bombs at a patron and totally out of control.  He was bartending afterwards.  He was extreemly rude, yelling at customers and being disrespectful and angry towards nice paying customers inside the venue.  He should seriously consider investing in some anger management courses and tips on good customer service .  So beware... u might wanna avoid him. It was really bad and unprofessional behavior."
The Sound Room,"Oct 7, 2018","Wow. Just Wow.This place is over the top perfect.Great venue-not a bad seat in the tiny house. Saw flamenco there last night and it was outstanding. Excellent sound system. Super nice staff. Vibe is low key just enjoy. Food marvelous and prices very reasonable. Easy to park if you walk a few simple blocks, and close to BART.What's not to love!The sort of place that just makes Oakland shine.I'm hooked."
The Sound Room,"Jul 9, 2018","Great place to see a show! The place is intimate and small so every seat is a good seat. The food and drinks are very affordable and they serve throughout the show. Also, the staff works hard to make your visit enjoyable. As nonprofit organization, you can see that everyone is stepping in and supporting the venue. They have created a solid community feel and I hope that The Sound Room is around for eternity supporting music and the arts in the community."
The Sound Room,"Jul 9, 2018","Cozy little venue for live jazz and a monthly stand-up night.  We were able to see a show that was all ages, so a good way to foster in them an appreciation for good music.  Reasonable snacks and drink prices.  Can't wait to see their new location, coming soon."
The Sound Room,"May 26, 2018","The Sound Room is simply as good a place as there is to hear jazz and other musical offerings in the Bay Area. It's intimate, friendly, comfortable and convenient.  They have reasonably priced food, wine and beer on offer but most importantly they book a range talented local, national and international groups and present them in a small room with great sound.  Nothing fancy but reasonably priced and the best reason to go to Oakland if your not already there."
The Sound Room,"May 18, 2018","nothing fancy, but sound was great, tickets cheap, beer good and cheap, cool people running it.  Look forward to their new location down Broadway and seeing some more stuff at the venue."
The Sound Room,"Apr 2, 2018",It is so much fun to enjoy great music at low prices in an intimate room.  Love it!
The Sound Room,"Jan 27, 2018","I am so grateful to have such a warm, intimate venue for high-quality jazz in downtown Oakland, I want to tell everyone about it."
The Sound Room,"Dec 3, 2017","Nice place with a bunch of musicians full of passion! Jazz lovers must come and enjoy. I have been to Yoshi's and a few other places in the Bay Area.  The sound system here is the best, or I was a little drunk... anyways, keep going and will come back when in the area for sure. Thanks for the fun & great music"
The Sound Room,"Dec 2, 2017",Nice place for some live Jazz. Went here cause Yoshi's was sold out. Definitely recommend it!
The Sound Room,"Jul 23, 2017",Love this intimate Oakland venue! Easy to find and BART is a block away. Lots of fine local players and some out of Towners. Always a good time.
The Sound Room,"Jul 6, 2017","On June 30, 2017 I had the delight of hearing new music by the Fred Randolph Quintet at the Sound Room on 2147 Broadway at Grand. They played with the intensity of true professionals at the top of their game. Their sound is as fresh and diverse as Cachao or Miles Davis in the 70's. The band featured Fred Randolph, on bass; Erik Jekabson, trumpet; Sheldon Brown, sax and alto sax and flute; Greg Wyser-Pratte, drums; and Dan Zemelman, piano.   My favorite piece was entitled, ""Song with no Singer"" and was inspired by Salif Keita and aptly had neither lyrics nor a singer. The hosts Karen and her quieter husband, Robert, were wonderful storytellers and I was able to order bruschetta with cheese and figs and tapas of olives and peppers, for nine dollars!  The scene was intimate and my friend and  I shared a table with a nice Dad and daughter duo from Portland, Maine. If the Sound Room is at capacity with 55 souls it feels packed. The lighting and sound were impeccable and the temperature in the room was warm. It was a memorable show, which makes us wonder what this talented composer, Randolph and his quintet will have in their repertoire for next show's set on August 2nd, which is in Walnut Creek."
The Sound Room,"Jun 11, 2017","Here's a customer service take, as opposed to an assessment of the quality of the music or location. I'm thousands of miles away from The Sound Room and have never been there - I just wanted to get a gift for my sister, who lives near it in Oakland. There's a phone number on the website that I tried a bunch of times, but no one ever picked up. I emailed and got a reply running through some gift options that weren't quite what I was looking for, and the note that ""we do check messages frequently and return calls if contact info is left on the recording.""So I said I would call and got an emailed reiteration of the same options from the earlier email. When I called and left a message ... it was never returned.(The email from The Sound Room explained: ""We are a non-profit run on volunteer labor. Our presence at the Sound Room is focused around scheduled shows."" But I left *more than a month* between leaving my message and giving up. I figured even ""volunteer labor"" could make a phone call *guaranteed* to bring in money, given several weeks in which to do it.)So instead of giving several hundred dollars to The Sound Room, I surrendered and gave it directly to my sister. Much less fun and surprising. And she's now planning summer travel, so I don't think much of that money will wind up going to this nonprofit.The Sound Room can do what it wants, how it wants. But if they're going to put a phone number on a website, why not, you know, let people use the phone?"
The Sound Room,"Feb 20, 2017","Going to a jazz lounge, having drinks, and enjoying great music has always been a dream of mine, and I was happy that my first experience happened at The Sound Room. I purchased the V.I.P tickets for only ten dollars more than the regular ticket price. That extra ten dollars got us into the club a half hour early, giving us time to buy drinks and food, as well as get priority seating. They opened their doors promptly at seven, so we didn't have to wait too long in the rain. While waiting in line to get checked in, I couldn't help but notice the food at the counter. It was glowing, and even though I was here for the show, my stomach needed to be appeased first. The food was very affordable, much more than I thought it would be. For two Moulin Rouge drinks (champagne, hibiscus, and ginger), a cheese plate, a crostini with pecan pate and mushrooms, a lavash roll, and a shrimp skewer, I paid $40.00. Everything tasted great. We also indulged in their version of spinach dip, which looked good, but lacked in flavor. Enough about the food. The real show is the actual show, which was everything I wanted it to be. The room is fairly small, only seating 70 people, and every seat is the best seat in house. The small room crams everyone together, but you abandon any sense of claustrophobia once the show starts. The show for the night was performed by Marina Crouse and Garth Webber, along with their band. The music they play is like no other. I have always been a fan of Jazz and Blues, but to hear it live is a whole other experience. The music was very soulful. It made me truly listen to what's being played, what's being sung, and the stories that are being told. The band was full of life, especially the drummer, and the vibe was just incredibly warm and fun. The venue is small, making the sound incredible. The staff are incredible as well, especially the owner, who clearly has a passion for this type of music. Even the other patrons are incredible. While we were waiting in the rain, at least four different people offered to share their umbrellas with us. The Sound Room has it's usual members, and it's clear they are a tight knit family, but no one made us feel unwelcome or left out. Parking can be a bit of a hassle, so I would recommend arriving early, so you have ample time to find a spot. Overall, I can't thank The Sound Room enough for providing me with a very pleasant first experience into this world of live Jazz and Blues."
The Sound Room,"Dec 9, 2016","Came here for a Wine Tasting & Jazz & Magic event. bought tickets ahead of time, and was expecting to show ID at the door, but all I did was give them my name and they checked it off the list and let me in. weird heheVERY cool magic! the dude had lots of charisma, was funny, and his magic was also astounding! (had to use the word) definitely could not figure out how he did most of his tricks. he was a great entertainer!Jazz was nice, and singers were good too. They know their craft for sure. definitely more of an older crowd there though, so I wasnt feeling the atmosphere so much. cool that the ticket sales were going to charity!wine tasting had weird timing, slow at first and then rushed towards the middle and end. Their white wines tasted much better than their reds, which was a bummer because im more a fan of reds.Super yucky & stale & tasteless & overpriced appetizers. I can throw together better stuff in my own kitchen for sure."
The Sound Room,"Nov 13, 2016","Many great musicians/singers perform in this intimate venue. I suppose I should make this five stars, and would do so but I find the sound system itself to be a bit fuzzy. But I was sitting in front of a big speaker and the other speaker was on the other side of the room. Perhaps the problem was my faulty ears!Friendly, reasonable prices, good food. A non-profit, now four years old. As I think about it, I'm giving it five stars."
The Sound Room,"Jun 10, 2016",Great place.  Reasonable prices for tickets and beer/wine.  Nice intimate venue with good acoustics.  Only downsides are parking and the chairs can be uncomfortable for longer shows.  Definitely will return.
The Sound Room,"Jun 4, 2016","This is the PLACE.  Every visit has been delightful  - great music and great food, all at a ""way -it-oughta-be"" price.  Mostly jazz - played at a high level  - with performers old and new, in styles from Dixieland to Avant Garde. This is a friendly and truly intimate setting, with a casual, but always interesting and delicious, collection of tapas and other small plates - almost all vegetarian or vegan.  They also offer a small selection of well-priced, usually local, beers and wine.  Recently, The Sound Room has begun featuring Flamenco performances - dance, guitar, rhythms,  and songs. These shows usually draw from the deep and excellent Bay Area flamenco community, which I'm told is among the best - outside of Spain and Mexico.  Occasionally, Spanish visitors perform.  Great to sit so close to these dramatic dancers.The Sound Room is only two or three years old, now. --  a nonprofit organization dedicated to jazz and its local performers and audience.  I feel lucky that these people came to Oakland to bring us music at this intimate scaler."
The Sound Room,"Apr 29, 2016","Not a big selection of food, basically they had a variety of hor d'oeuvres and simple drinks, but good price and great music!"
The Sound Room,"Dec 10, 2015","My wife and I recently visited the sound room for a show.  The musicianship was exceptional, setting intimate, and the help and management were very friendly.  The appetizers and wine list are excellent.  Highly recommended!"
The Sound Room,"Oct 29, 2015","Great venue with fine musicians--NOW featuring the Monday night Open Mic sessions, too!Come one, come all; bring a chart to sing, and have some fun!"
The Sound Room,"Sep 30, 2015","By far the best jazz and jazz-y music venue in the SF-bay area, and this area is blessed with many places to choose from! This is an absolute gem of the music scene, the place where you can find fresh and exciting things like CD release concerts for up and coming musicians, fado nights, live 16-piece Big Band and much more... Long live Sound Room!"
The Sound Room,"Jul 26, 2015","This is a gem of a place for listening to live music, and Jazz in particular! A small and intimate venue, where no seat is a bad seat, since you're up close to the performers.This happens to be a non-profit that is entirely operational due to the love and dedication of volunteers. All the proceeds from the ticket sales go straight to the artists. Proceeds from food/drink offerings and your donations keep the lights (and sound) ON! The ticket prices are very reasonable, so do consider enjoying a small bite/drink from their kitchen. They have a decent offering of libations (wine/beer/non-alcoholic) and hors d'oeuvres. If nothing else, for love of music!!Tip: Since this is a volunteer run venue, please be patient with them, as they may sometimes be stretched thin! Go a bit early, so as to give yourself some time to grab a drink, and locate a table/seating of your liking. Talk to the volunteers, they're fellow music lovers. Stay back after the show and talk/mingle with the artists. Make a great evening off the event."
The Sound Room,"Jul 13, 2015",Absolutely love this place. They provide a wonderful space for music to be played and listened to. Those two things don't automatically go together...Garth Webber
The Sound Room,"Apr 22, 2015","This is great classy place to listen to jazz in Oakland! It would be great if they had more variety and daily night shows. The atmosphere is pleasant, clean and bright."
The Sound Room,"Mar 30, 2015","A really nice, small venue.  Every seat is close to the stage; small tables with chairs up front, high chairs against the side and back walls.  I sat in the high chairs off to the side  could see great.  Sound quality was good.  The food is homemade, and my daughter said the pizza was good (I didn't have any). Ticket price for Tiffany Austin and Marcus Shelby was a reasonable $20.One minor gripe - for a place that is trying to keep jazz alive, they did not have any kid/student price.  If they want to attract the next generation of listeners, they should make it easier for them to attend."
The Sound Room,"Mar 27, 2015","Went tonight to see Terrence Brewer. Seen him before, just not at the SR. It was a great venue! Small, quaint, and I was 2 feet from the performers. The owners and staff are very nice and supportive of the music scene. RECOMMEND!"
The Sound Room,"Nov 22, 2014","What a wonderful place! Scat-singing, poised and entertaining Kellye Gray and a nice trio, excellent sound, serviceable very limited menu, basic wine and beer list.  As for earlier reviews about owners' personality, this is a 501(c)(3) with volunteer help, cut them some slack.  First time for us, plan to become regulars. Come for music, quiet listening, cozy but IKEA type furnished room, and  camaraderie of Jazz lovers."
The Sound Room,"Aug 17, 2014","I love this place.  It's unpretentious but genuine - a great place to hear great music.  Just saw Allison Tucker Adams there tonight with a smokin' band!  This woman can sing!  Original arrangements, broad repertoire, gorgeous voice and musicality!  And the food and wine were terrific.  I go there at least every other month and kick myself for not going more often."
The Sound Room,"Aug 13, 2014","My husband and I really like this place.  Stumbled upon it reading Yelp reviews for live music in Oakland.  The price is reasonable ($20)' the bands very talented, and seating is intimate.  The relatively early show times work well with an active schedule.  The food is good, too, if you are running late."
The Sound Room,"Jun 10, 2014","I hadn't been to the Sound Room until last week, when a friend was playing there. I'm not going to wait for her return to go back.This is  small room, seating about 50 at the most. That means you have great sight lines and great sound wherever you sit.A nonprofit, The Sound Room gives the entire door (ticket price) to the musicians, and keeps the food and drink income to run the place., Obviously a labor of love, they have made an intimate club that is comfortable and welcoming. the sound system is good and the staff is very friendly and helpful.Very easy to get to, half a block form the Paramount theater, i highly recommend the Sound Room."
The Sound Room,"May 24, 2014","Went to see Ian Carrey amd Nate Clevenger Sextet.Sound man turned a low qiality board up to jist about as loud as it could go. Nothing less than a 105 db in the back row !!! Often 120 db for a Jazz Sextet playing intricate composotions, Great musicians and compositions ruined by over amping and low fidelity eqjipment.Forthe  second set the sound man left the board on while connecting the new band. A loose connection in Sheldon Browns rig caused explosive snapping crackling and popping at a deafening volume for at least 45 seconds before the ear assault ended. This sent everyones hands to their ears and as I kooked around it looked like Edvard Munchs Painting the ""Scream!""!!  In all directions.!!!!  Could be a nice venue with a professjonal sound man with a quality board.To the owners you have a very live room only the piano needs a mic. The Bass brings hi own.Everyone else should be amped for balance not volume. A sextet shouldnt sound lime a marching band. You should hear the instruments sound come from the instruments not the monitors and side speakers . Also the low quality amp does not allow the subtelies of tone through that are generated by the grear musicians wjo play at your venue. You the owner or manager need to take responsibility for the volume musicians and sound men tend to have lost significant hearing and really cant be the best judges in this matter.you no its loud when the flute needs the monitor turned up necause theh cant heare them selves over the band.!!!"
The Sound Room,"Apr 6, 2014",Went to the Sound Room recently in uptown Oakland for a night of flamenco. This is a great place to have an intimate experience with musicians and dancers. This non-profit could use everyone's support. I will definitely be back!
The Sound Room,"Nov 7, 2013",A non-profit venue that brings budding artists and top talent to Uptown Oakland.  It is truly a labor of love.  The door goes to the performers and the staff volunteers their time.  Consider making a tax free donation if you enjoy the show.  The drink/ food profits and donations keep the lights on. The shows I attended were all spectacular.  i highly recommend checking out their Facebook page. There are links to the some of the artists performances on YouTube. Judge for yourself.  They do not have a liquor license yet so you may want to bring a flask.  They serve 4 delicious non-alcoholic cocktails that taste even better with a touch of hooch.
