I went to see Olivia Dean earlier this year and atleast when I went the venue and staff had an organized process going and everyone seemed to have a great time."

    "review": "Pretty nice venue! Went here to see The Breathing Room on Aug. 25, 2023 around 8pm (amazing!) with some friends and the audience that it attracted was great.However, the bouncer was very rude. I, unfortunately, didn't have an online ticket and they only accepted cash for walk-ins. Thankfully, there was ATM inside past the bouncer. When I tried to walk toward the ATM to get my cash, he forcefully yanked me away and told me I need cash to pay for a ticket to do so.How am I gonna get cash to pay for a ticket if you won't let me walk towards the ATM? I had to ask others to go to the ATM for me just like this other girl next to me while we waited.Understandable that they want to ensure no one sneaks in, but invading my personal space with unwarranted physical contact was rude and unnecessary; a simple verbal warning or compromise/agreement would have been much more appreciated.Visuals were great and the venue was pretty packed but it was nice to have different levels to watch the performers! Bouncer overstepping boundaries definitely hurt my experience here."

Flew out to San Fran, spent well over $1000 in travel costs to see my favorite band, showed up with my vaccine card (as required) and was denied entry due to my vaccine not being the preferred dosage/type of vaccine. Ridiculous, staff was unable to provide help besides contacting the ticket service. That can be understandable, but there was no sincerity in the miscommunication and lack of communication.

He was taken out of the line to the side.After my friends and I entered the first floor was packed, and there was no order. People were constantly pushing each other to get to the front. Then, half way through the show, a fight erupted on the floor where a man smashed his glass against a woman's head (I think because she spilled beer on him). Chaos ensued. The fight went on until the performer actually stopped and asked if something could be done. Then finally the security guard came to break up the fight....Police cars parked outside the venue as I left.Disgusting management from start to finish. I will never come back again."

    "review": "A great place for a smaller/ more intimate show! Came here for a concert and was able to get right at the front of the stage. You can either stand in the lower area or stand/ sit in the upper area--the lower area goes very far back so don't arrive too late otherwise you will be far from the stage. The lower area has a bar, where they have beers on tap and they also had a cocktail special named after one of the performer's songs. They also have an upper area which is a decent size--the regulars seem to go straight up there and grab a seat on the couches and chairs. The seats are good if you don't want to be down below where you will be tight standing next to people.I like that a Rickshaw Shop is walking distance from Civic Center bart! Maybe a 10 min walk. As always be careful walking at night and try not to walk alone. If you are looking for a dinner beforehand, Cala is right next door to Rickshaw. I have never been but I've heard good things (you should make a reservation beforehand).Enjoy!"

We came by when doors opened for Emo Nite but we were told that they weren't quite ready and to circle back later.When we did come back, there was a small line but it moved by pretty quickly. Once in we were stamped to indicate that our tickets were checked and we had wristbands placed on us for being 21+. Once you're inside you can pretty much see to the end of the venue with the main stage at the back. To the right as you walk in are the restrooms and there is a bar on this floor as well. There are a set of stairs to the left and there was a sign indicating that there was a bar upstairs that was open and that coat check was also located up there.When we got up there the bar was definitely not functional. There was a rack where you could hang up your jackets and take a ticket but there were no staff monitoring that so someone could in theory take your jacket. The upstairs area has some couches and has a lower level where you can watch from upstairs.I didn't drink that night but they did have a spout with water to the left of the main bar so you could help yourself.All in all it was a pretty intimate venue. The event didn't seem too packed so maybe that's why there was still a decent amount of room to move around. I think some of the hiccups may have had to do with the event organizers rather than the venue."

I hate to sound like a weenie but smoking of all kind should be outside. Some of us are really sensitive to smoke and wish ordinances would be followed. Otherwise, the casual seating was really cool and the bathroom was really nice compared to other divey places.

I've been to 100+ venues around the country, and I've never been so crammed into a tiny club that to watch the show I had to stand in the back of the club, literally 5 feet from the bar's center, directly under bar lights shining down on me.  Talk about a terrible way to see a show.  All lit up, constantly bothered by people trying to maneuver to buy a drink, and with all the bar noise.  There was no way to move forward--the place was that inappropriately packed.  Also, the temperature inside was too warm -- running one large fan in the balcony area doesn't cut it, people -- and the small balcony has some stupid garage door-type thing pulled partially down that blocks much of the view of the stage from the balcony.  Awful, like nobody gives a sh!t who works there.On top of the issues I mention above, the staff lack common sense.  After showing my ID, they stamped a VERY large \"HOT\" stamp on the inside of my right wrist.  It took me 1.5 days to scrub this off of my skin, and it looked far more like a \"HOT\" tattoo than a club stamp.  Thanks, guys--how about using some discretion in your stamp selection.I ended up leaving the show after about six songs despite being a big fan of the band, as I just didn't feel like dealing with the nonsense.  The show two nights earlier at GAMH was night-and-day more fun to attend.  The Rickshaw Stop may be a decent place to see an unpopular, uncrowded show, but I will never return for a show that I feel might be sold out."

There is one good thing, though, the manager gave our friend $12 back for the ticket price she paid (disregarding service fees) while she was crying on the sidewalk outside of the venue waiting for her uber.

Talks- they are funny, they have character, they are animated speakers giving a run down of their respective field with purpose. This night we got the history of SF's Trans culture, 20 math mysteries with graphics and dancing in 20 minutes, and how a physicist is working to understand dark matter. Each was beyond entertaining, captivating, and educational without feeling talked down to or watering down the content to much. And you walking away learning some really cool stuff.This happens the 3rd Wednesday of each month and this was the 92 hosting. Great date night, or solo event, don't bring a crew this thing fills up.

Next to Cava, I could not help but hear the music pouring put into Fell Street. Stopped and talked go the bouncer and he escorted me in with great service to explore the venue. \u00a0\u00a0If your type of music comes to this venue, you will love it. I remember watching Coldplay at the Warfield there first year. You may stumbnle accross the next big artist before they were famous. \u00a05 stars all day."

Came here for Popscene/Frenship  on the hottest night ever (75 degrees at 7pm?!) and I happened to have a water bottle in my purse with like 2 ounces of rose left (from earlier in the day) in it.The bouncer asked to see my purse, I said ok, totally forgetting about the rose. So he saw my water bottle, took it out, and said \"THIS IS PINK\". Right, ok, so...? I said \"can I drink it? I can step out of the line\" And he didn't care at all that I said anything.He then threw the water bottle to this scary looking possibly homeless guy in a wife beater across the sidewalk and the wifebeater guy dumped the rose on the sidewalk, then threw the leftover bottle to a nearby trash can. Bouncer then said to me \"you can purchase alcohol inside\" Yeah, really? two ounces of rose would have cut back your revenue by how much? $2?Normally bouncers would give you a chance to drink it or go to back of the line or like, give you a chance to even respond. Obviously I wasn't trying to sneak it in.. the water bottle is a huge Dasani bottle! thanks for treating me like a criminal. Btw, you didn't even check the rest of my purse after you made a scene out of my water bottle. You didn't even thoroughly do your job."

The saving graces are the exceptionally helpful and friendly staff as well as their amazing grilled cheese sandwiches with a selection of your favorite toppings (e.g., basil, bacon, onions).  Parking can be tough on the street.  However, it's a few blocks from MUNI at Van Ness."

Came here last night to see the early A R I Z O N A after paying a premium on the resale market for the early 7pm sold out show. My friend left his ticket in our Uber on the way over, so we spent the first half of the show outside trying to get that back. By the time we made it inside, we were only able to catch the last two songs. On our way out, I found myself venting to guy by the door about what had happened and how I was disappointed we missed the majority of the show. Turned out, he was the owner, and asked me and my friend to come over. He pulled out wristbands for us to attend the 10 o clock show, and told us to have a good night. We were the first to enter, and caught every song from the very front along the stage. The opening act Glades pointed the microphone at us at one point, asked us our names, and gave us a shout out. To the very generous owner who turned our night around BIG time - thank you SO much for your generous hospitality. Last night will be hard to top, but I will most definitely be coming back to Rickshaw stop again."

The venue has a general admission floor and a balcony upstairs with sofas and stools. I would definitely say that the center front stools on the balcony are the best seats in the house. For someone 5'0\" tall, it's always godsend to be able to see the entire set. With two bars on each floor, you won't have to struggle getting drinks either. What I love about this place the most is the intimacy you'll find here, watching your favorite band or whoever. The place can still hold a good amount of people, but the intimacy factor of it isn't reduced. If you're familiar with other venues in SF, this place is larger than Brick & Mortar, and similar to The Chapel. Also, Aaron Axelsen is here on Fridays and he seriously made the wait before the concert and in between bands poppin'. He's also on 105.3, but I'm not too sure when he's on exactly. Usually later in the evening. Anyways, I feel like he's always bringing out the dopest remixes and he's such a good source for new music. I was really stoked to find out he was the one DJing."

As soon as we got inside, one of the bouncers was staring us down and following us around. My friends who are over 21 ordered drinks, and even though I didn't get a drink, he took the first chance he got to kick us out. He was very rude and aggressive about it and so were the other workers on duty. They didn't even want to hear our side and were acting like power hungry assholes. Beware if you are under 21, you will be watched like a hawk. I don't even know if the show was good, all I can say is the bouncers are terrible."

The door men and managers are the most rude, obtuse, pompous, pretentious, narrow minded, petty, Inconsiderate, unsympathetic, insensitive, ignorant, and underwhelming people I've ever met. I drove 20 hours from Colorado to see Rainbow Kitten Surprise in San Francisco on spring break. I have followed the band since their first album in 2013 and couldn't have been more stoked to see my favorite band on their first tour. I purchased my ticket months in advance for the show. When we showed up at the door my ticket wouldn't scan. The manager came over and told me I bought the ticket for the earlier 5 o clock show they had and that I'd have to buy another ticket to get in. Ticket says 5pm-2 am. Never have I heard of a venue playing 2 shows in the same night. After pleading my case and telling him how far I came to see the show he told there was nothing he could do. (Meaning he's just a lazy manager) And subsequently kicked me out because he just decided he didn't want to argue with me."

Was about 8 mins from Civic/Downtown to Fell and Van Ness so super easy to get there. From the person checking ID's, to the stage crew - every single person was very nice, friendly and up beat. The balcony is cool, the couch in the back is comfy, the wooden boxes to sit or stand on on the sides of the room are a great touch. The sound system is awesome! Not too loud and high quality sound! I had a great time to see an awesome singer. The beer was reasonably priced and the bartenders are way hot! Would not hesitate to see another show there - I had a great time!"

Drinks are pretty cheap and I like that the water is self-service at the end of the bar.\u00a0But the shows start late and go really long. The doors don't open until 8 o'clock, and the first act doesn't usually go on until 8:45. And don't expect the main act until well after 10. At the last show, there was a half hour wait between the two. The place was full, the stage was set, and everyone was antsy and ready to go. Is it a ploy to sell more drinks? It might not bother me if it a was the weekend but on a weeknight when I still need to take public transportation home and get up at 6:30 the next morning to go back to work, I'd like to wrap up at a reasonable hour. Subsequently. every time I've been here, I've had to leave before the main act was over which sucks. Another thing is that sound system isn't very good. I didn't realize how bad until I saw a couple of shows at The Independent for a few dollars more on the ticket price. I could hear every word the singers were singing. At the Rickshaw, the bass is really low and throbbing sometimes to the point of ridiculousness. Even in the intimate moments of songs, when the artist is playing the keyboard and singing, the sound is muddy and distorted. Not OK! They do have a balcony with a few seats but they'll be taken early by people who know they're in it for a long haul."

You get a great view of whoever's performing no matter where you are on the floor. The crowd, thankfully, isn't too unruly. The tickets were also very, very cheap - $36 for two tickets after taxes/fees and everything!I only have a few minor complaints. The sound system could have been better -- when a violinist was playing, I could barely hear that part, which was sad, because the violinist is a big part of the song. Though I'm not sure how much of that is the performer's fault vs. the venue's fault.The ticket also said 8pm, but Mako didn't start playing until much later -- probably around 10. I was a little annoyed at the time, as I didn't know how much time I was allotted to skip the opening act to finish up a task I needed to do. I'd have liked a little more transparency in terms of when the acts started/finished.But those are only minor issues. I totally recommend this place for concerts, and I wouldn't mind going back at all."

After his set we waited through another 45-minute nothingness for the headliner, who performed for barely an hour.This kind of entertainment ratio is insane. Worse yet, the place has almost no seating to speak of, save for a dozen or so wooden cubes around the edges. We won't be back."

Bigger venues like The Fillmore and Bill Graham might have some of the bigger names, but whenever I discover a really great new indie band and see they're playing in SF, it seems like almost every time they're playing at rickshaw. I go to a concert at least once a week, and over half of them have been at Rickshaw, and it's not like I try to go there I just kind of end up there after looking for shows I'll like. It's a small, intimate venue, and much more relaxed than places like the fillmore. I've seen people standing on benches and even sitting on the piano (down on the floor, not the stage) and no one seemed to mind. This could be handy if you're short, especially since it's a fairly low stage so if you're shorter it can be a little harder to see (it's not too bad for the short folks out there though, in addition to standing on the furniture you can pretty much show up 10 minutes before the music starts and secure a spot in the front, or go off to the side if you don't mind the awkward angle but still want to see).The sound system sounds great, though I'm not audiophile so I cant really say much about the quality other than it seems perfectly fine. I can say though that they've probably got the best lighting system of any similarly sized venue in town, and they've just put in four brand new high tech led spotlights that look fantastic, and this is in addition to what was already a really nice looking set. Once the music starts it looks absolutely gorgeous on stage, and unfortunately your phone camera will never do it justice.The shows always are listed at 8, but they always start the music 40-50 min after, it seems to be a rule that the artists wait until at least 8:40 to start. The headliner will usually start at around ten.I don't drink, so unfortunately can't tell you much about the drink quality or pricing. They do always have a drink themed on the band that'll be playing, so it's kinda fun to see what kind of drink related puns they come up with.My biggest complaint is the lack of box office hours, you can only buy the tickets online or at the door of the specific show (can't buy tickets for a different show). I've heard you can buy the tickets for there at the independent and some other places, but I've never tried it. Also it's cash only, which is kind of annoying. But hey, buying the ticket is always the worst part of a concert right?This is a great venue, very conveniently placed (right smack in the middle of town and two blocks away from bart/muni underground), cheap tickets (usually around $14 at the door), great sound and lighting, and most important of all always having the best acts, I plan on returning often"

Someone came up to me that worked there and accused me of scrubbing the x'es off of my hand that indicated I was under 21. In all honesty I DID NOT do that. I used the bathroom about four times while I was there and washed my hands each time so the x'es of course washed off slightly but you could still see them on my hand. He asked me to go back to the bouncer in the front to re-mark my hands in which I was completely cooperative with, even after feeling very offended and  accused. The bouncer asked me what had happened and again I repeated to him that I had used that bathroom several times that night to which he accused me of drinking before hand and would not let me back into the rickshaw, AFTER I had paid beforehand for the specific DJ playing that night. With no protest, my s/o and I left and I feel extremely upset at the way this situation was handled tonight and will be letting ALL of my friends from college know that this place sucks going out to.

They sell 30 tickets at the door but even when buckets of rain were falling from the sky there was a line of people who had been waiting 30+ minutes for these standby tickets.- Line up ~6:30p if you want seats and a clear view- Come with an open mindThe venue was easy to find by Van Ness and Fell. Plus there will likely be a long line forming anyway. The location itself lacked seating leaving many on the floor and uncertainty whether there was a clear escape route (say if I needed to visit the ladies room). Thankfully people at the floor sat down and my view from a chair was perfect. They serve food and drink if you are hungry but I personally didn't feel like throwing $8 for a grilled cheese. As for nerd nite itself, I appreciate that there were 3 different topics; however it really is a hit or miss. It is best to buy a ticket if you have interest in at least one of the topics because otherwise these are volunteer lecturers and not professional speakers."

    "review": "There's no doubt about it, the Rickshaw has been my favorite venue since I was in high school. Not too far from Civic Center of you don't mind trudging through the  Burger King favela, you'll find yourself at this oasis on Fell, a place with cheap drinks ($10 card minimum guys, sorry!) and the best artists, be they well-known or relatively unknown. The place has one charming quality that I can't seem to find anywhere else-- intimacy. To come as close as you can to your favorite artists, completely in their element, there's something raw and authentic. Someone will miss a note or botch a cord and nobody feels shy about it, artists feel a certain openness here that is unfound anywhere else I've been. When I see a show here, it's always a chill crowd and an honest, interactive experience. And at be end of the night, I stumble through the homeless encampment with my stolen band poster (sorry again Rickshaw!) and grab some chicken fries before I hop on BART.   The to-go spot."

    "review": "Rickshaw Stop is such an intimate venue. It's VERY small. I've been here twice now for two different shows -- one was for a sold out show (Oh Wonder). The merch table is usually set up by the front door, near the restrooms. There's a bar downstairs. $20 minimum on cards. A beer & a jack & coke was ~$14. The stage is set up downstairs and it's literally the smallest stage I've ever seen. There definitely isn't very much room on the stage, but the dancefloor is decent sized. It makes the shows very intimate since you can get right up close and personal with your favorite artists. There is also an upstairs balcony area, which is nice when you go to the really packed shows. If you're short like me, it's fantastic being up there because then you can still see LOL. Sound quality is pretty great, since the venue is so small ya know, it's not too hard to see/hear everything very well. What else is there to say? Great bar/venue to see some of your favorite artists in a super intimate setting. I would definitely recommend checking out a show here if you get the chance!"

Despite the small size, the venue can still pack quite a number of people, so if you're attending a sold out show, go early if you want to be close to the front. There's a balcony as well. I didn't get a chance to check it out, but there are seats up there (ground floor is standing room only). The people working there were nice, and I'd probably go back if there's ever an artist I like performing there."

Thanks to Dan, Harp, and their team, we had the best corporate holiday party our staff has ever had! Dan was incredible to work with and made sure we got a great deal. He was easy-going, helpful, and genuinely excited about the event which made planning so much more enjoyable. They made setup and cleanup a breeze, allowed us to move things around to fit our party's needs, and even helped decorate with the holiday vibe we were going for. You could tell everyone wanted to help us have a good time and keep things running smoothly. The drinks were good (they let us have 2 custom drinks on the menu which was fun and popular among guests), the bar service was fast and easy (we used the drink ticket approach), and Dan was fast and easy to communicate with throughout the entire process. Parking and safety were non-issues, there was plenty of space for our 150+ guests, and again the vibe the space lends itself to is just right for a trendy mingling and festive atmosphere.If you're looking for a hip, cool place to throw a party, this is it! Seriously, give them a call."

It was so loud that you could not distinguish one guitar from the other...the bass was this huge thumping drone, and forget about understanding any lyrics. At one point (on 12/14/15) Murray Lightburn from the Dears was onstage with just an acoustic guitar doing a beautiful song with quiet dynamics, and it was still so loud that everyone kept their earplugs in. It's just ridiculous. In an intimate atmosphere you should be able to hear EVERYTHING. I actually went up to the guy at the booth in between bands and politely said it was too loud. He just shrugged. The same deal at the Bottom of the Hill...volume to the point of mandatory earplugs and total quality distortion. Disappointing....because the venue is great otherwise."

Rickshaw is small enough so that if you get there early, you can literally be inches away from the performers, but it's also large enough so that you can get down and groovy upstairs and in the back. However, it does get insanely packed, so be warned if you're going to a sold out show. If a show is sold out and you are kicking yourself in the butt for not getting tickets in time, have no fear! They usually sell a limited number of tickets at the door, so get there early if you want to score tickets. There is also an open dance floor after the gig is over, which is always fun. The performances are always fantastic and if you're from the bay, I highly recommend seeing a show during your time here. It's definitely a bucket list venue for the avid concertgoer."

It's also a great place to get a pint of red bull and vodka for $8 (WHAAAT?)I'm a bit of a concert fiend, if you will.  I find myself at all the hottest venues seeing all the major acts before they become big (humblebrag?).  Rickshaw is one of the great places to do this.  In truth, you don't know what you're going to get at this place, but it'll probably good.  In truth, I had a friend whose purse got stolen here and that was kind of a bummer.This city needs more venues like Rickshaw Stop.  However, beware dear reader that some shows are 18+ and some are 21+ and you might not be sure which one you're about to go see (gasp)!  If you're a 21+ kind of person then double check before you agree to get down with that musak.One of the major pluses of Rickshaw is that you can get so close to the stage you can practically smell the sweat of the performers, if you're into that.  It's intimate, small, with good acoustics and great acts.  There's a bit of a swindler crowd that likes to prey on the vulnerable, but if you come lightly dressed you should be okay!"

I've always known it can get a bit full and you need to get there early to secure a seat or a spot on the floor. We arrived right at 7 when the doors opened, grabbed a seat at a bench upstairs near the rail. At 8 when the show started we were told we couldn't sit at the bench and needed to find a new place to sit. After an hour of securing that spot. There was no place to even stand and half the people standing near the bar couldn't see the presentations. They pack the bar in past maximum capacity, the staff is unbelievably rude and it is no longer worth going to nerd nite because of how crappy the venue is."

Saw the Fratellis and Monarchy here. Sound for each band was pretty great. I think they could have kicked it up a notch when it comes to the loudness, but then again we don't all wanna be deaf right? The venue itself is small enough for you to get a pretty decent view of the band from wherever you are. They've also got a pretty nifty little upstairs balcony if you want to have a seat as well. Perfect for those post-25 concert vets whose knees can't take standing for hours on end.They've got themselves a bar, but that's about it when it comes to that. They usually have a few nightly specials, but other than that it's just a kinda small bar. The Rickshaw is a pretty fun spot for concerts. Yet another reliable venue in the city!"

When we walked in, we decided to take a look upstairs, where there was a small bar and a balcony with a view of the dance floor and stage. The ceiling was pretty low on the second level. Back downstairs, we bought a couple drinks (there's a minimum if you wanna use a credit card) and made our way toward the stage. The sound was pretty good. Props to the lighting guys too. There wasn't much decor except for the velvet curtain that wrapped around the venue and the visuals that were projected onto the screen behind the stage. Ladies room had 2 stalls..it wasn't super clean, but we survived. There was one spot on the floor where a fan was blasting..good if you need some air, bad if you're trying to keep your DO in one place.The cool thing was that the performers could only access the backstage area by walking through the left side of the dance floor, so we were able to say hello and grab a photo with Brodie as she walked by. Total fan girl moment.I was stoked to finally get tickets to a show at Rickshaw Stop since it is a pretty intimate venue.

The stage isn't raised very high and there isn't any noticeable security or barriers set up so it's a great experience to watch the bands perform up close (just watch your head for any flying limbs from the circle pit at punk/metal shows). Btw, there's a mezzanine level with two levels of couches and benches if you want to stay out of the mix.Lastly, the shows are typically super cheap for SF standards ($10-20) as are the drinks.

So he wasted 10 minutes of our time harassing her when he could have just let her in because it was all ages. We missed the opening of the Moth and we were just there to support the event! He marked her hands with 2 huge Xs in sharpie (very dramatic) and said you better not wash these off, you better not wash these off etc. We told him we weren't interesting in drinking we just wanted to see the show but he was relentless to show us he was on a power trip and in control.

As long as I have something to lean on, standing ain't so bad. Bud was $3, which was incredible. I expected beers to be a minimum $6 since it's a concert venue, but that was not the case. A little annoyed a bearded bartender man bussed a half full beer I had on the bar (I ran to the bathroom, guess I should have went napkin over the top), but another bartender, upon hearing my plight, comped me a Dos Equis for the trouble, which was awesome.

Maybe the theme is downtown Thailand?)3) Usually a good crowd4) Effective layout5) Nice sound system The acts that pass through tend to be on the underground side, but that tends to be the draw of this place. Go on a random night with some friends and you might find yourself with the next Lorde or LCD Soundsystem."

A great DJ opened up the night, definitely got the crowd moving.  Then a two band set - Echosmith and Birds of Tokyo...never heard of them before but they are now on my radar.  Drinks were cheap and generous, bartenders cool and the crowd completely random.  Will definitely go back."

There is a great mix of people (rockabilly, motorcycle riding dudes, old dudes, yuppies (is that still a thing?), hippies, etc.) which makes for good people watching. Ended up standing during most of the show, which was nice. Much love to Rickshaw Stop for cranking up the A/C above the stage - vents facing the audience - once people started moving and the interior temperature started rising.Super friendly bartenders. The bathroom was as clean as you are going to find in a bar/music venue."

Funny I was seeing and Iowa band cause the Rickshaw reminds me a lot of the Vaudeville Mews in Des Moines, IA.. With the excellent stage site from the balcony!  The sound in the room was fabulous and the bartenders were wonderful!One of the bartenders saw my Minnesota Vikings credit card, and pulled her's out and said, \"You are drinking for Free all night!\"  This was not the case but lucky for me they did have some cheaper brews then most places I hung in San Fran.This place some might consider a diver bar, but I thought it was defiantly pretty clean and the bathrooms were well taken care of! All in all a stellar music venue and a must stop if your going to check out a show in San Fran!"

Like other reviewers of this place I was a little discouraged to find out the super late starting time of the show (doors at 9:30!) but as soon as I walked in I felt acquainted with the pseudo-hipster yet unique vibe of this small 200-person or so venue.I'm a big fan of the 2 level upstairs balcony if you can manage to snag a seat before the show.  The sound quality is decent, the drinks are moderately priced and there isn't really a bad spot in the house.  Most acts that play here are relatively underground but that's part of its charm."

I have seen a lot of good bands here, that end up getting super popular like a year or 2 later.  The people who book shows here know up & coming talent.  POPSCENE is great!.I took my 11 year old honor roll daughter here for a sold out Sky Ferreria show (All ages) last year at her begging request.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a super cool dad, and have seen, and done it all, but even I was reluctant to take my child to a late night music venue.Rest assured, we had such an awesome experience together, and every person in the jam packed house was super nice, and were even going out of there way to make sure she was comfortable in viewing.  My daughter felt the vibe fast, and fell in more love with the people of SF, and the regulars at this spot.This was our experience, and I thought it was worth sharing."

    "review": "Rickshaw Stop is, along with The Independent, one of the top live music venues in San Francisco. While their sound system is not absolutely amazing, it's more than adequate and the space lends itself to some pretty intimate experiences. I shook hands with Penguin Prison before he went onstage and thanked him for playing. I saw an amazing set by Tesla Boy (their first ever in the US) and was about five feet away from the stage the entire time. The Drive Tour was fantastic with Anoraak, College and Electric Youth all playing full-length sets.Rickshaw Stop has already provided me with memories that will last a lifetime and I hope there are many more to come. Definitely check out their regular Popscene nights where you'll be sure to discover a hot new act before they go on to play much bigger (and lamer) venues."

Even on the inside, it's rather austere, though the rickshaw is an interesting, nice touch.I cannot comment on the food or the drinks, but as a concert venue, it's amazing. The ground floor is rather large, so it's well-suited for the acoustics. If the show's ever too wild, there is also a second floor viewing deck. Though it may be case by case, when I went, DSLRs was allowed, so as a photographer, that was definitely a plus.I came here to see Boris and Deafheaven, both of which were amazing acts. For groups that had a really powerful sound impact, the venue and setup did them justice. It was an intimate affair, and I much preferred the atmosphere compared to a larger venue.The lighting of this place is also amazing, so props to whoever was manning the lights that night. My pictures turned out well, the atmosphere of the concert was chill, and even the people were very relaxed - much unlike what you may find at a more typical concert.If Rickshaw Stop ever hosts an act I'm interested in, I'll be sure to come back.TIP: DSLR Photography is allowed (or at least at the concert I went to), so feel free to shoot away!"

Backing up:  went to the cool Movie Video Race event last weekend and loved being washed over by the hippity-hip-hip-hipsters. Even standing in line was awesome - \"hey - I went to a silent disco on twin peaks last night\" etc. Damn, the things you learn when you get out a little.  Got inside in time to actually get a spot with our backs to the bar to hold us up as the place filled up....and up.....and up. And we were right next to the free water station so once we were packed in like sardines, we got our body rubs free as people moved past us to get their free H20.Anyway, started with a drink special with tequila because they don't have a stout that sounded interesting. It wasn't so great and definitely teeny, so went for the sangria.  Hallelujah, I hit the motherlode!  $5 and the wine is laced with a hefty portion of brandy, so by the time I was two sangrias in and my friend showed up, I'm sure she didn't recognize my sentences as english.The bartenders were very friendly and the place reminded me a smidge of New Parish, for you Oaktown folk.  I could see the band that played fairly well, and the video screens were high enough up that even the amazonian people in front of us didn't block them too much. Seriously - hubby's 6'2\" and there were MASSIVE quantities of people taller than him in front of us. Is this younger generation living longer AND getting taller? Not fair man, not fair.Oh - final stamp of approval for the Boffo cart out front that sold the Yams. Holy sriracha sauce, them puppies are delicious!  And spicy enough that we shamelessly drank someone's open and forgotten bottle of IPA that we watched sitting there on the bar for 20 minutes with no one claiming it.  So there ya go - even got a bonus drink out of it. (Don't judge - you'd have done it too, I swear.)"

I'd never even heard of RICKSHAW STOP..but, it was an all ages event (my son is 16), the location was decent, and the tix were only $12, so I took a chance. We arrived at 8 (posted start time) and waited in a long line outside. My ID was checked. My son was not required to show ID, but the back of his hands were marked with giant X's to signify no ID/underage. Once inside, we began to explore. Upstairs is a cute little room with a foosball table and a classic skee-ball game. Cool! Lots of chairs and couches for chillin upstairs. There are also 2 small tiers of balcony bench seating with a stage view. These spots were taken..so we went back downstairs. The staff was nice, and, although I didn't order a drink, the bar seemed organized and moving along at a good pace. This was a sold-out show (Sky Ferreira, How To Dress Well, and The High Highs) so I was pretty surprised we snagged a spot at the stage. Everyone was respectful..no cursing, drunken fools pushing up against us like at other venues. Sound system was amazing. Speakers took everything the bands could dish out with no distortion. Volume was loud, but not obnoxious. Watching each band set-up and tear-down inches away from us kept the 'down time' interesting. Security didn't trip when I snapped a couple pix (no flash) which was refreshing. The entire place (including restroom) was clean and well maintained. Can't wait to come back to this venue!!"

Everywhere on their website and one the performer's website it sited that the show started at 9pm. well its midnight now and their headlining act hasn't even started. Okay I get it. Some super stars don't like to start on time. But 3 hours later? thats a bit much. I got fed up and decided to leave, so I went to close out  my tap. The male bartender scoffed at me and preceded to take 4 other orders before even trying to close my tap. I politely asked the female bartender (while I witnessed him serving 4 other people) to check on it and she gave me some bitchy attitude saying they're busy. I understand you're busy. I fucking work in the service industry and I get that thursday-sunday are your busy nights, but don't give me that 'holier than thou' bartender attitude that you think you're deserving of. Then I went to ask for a refund of my money, since I waited 3 HOURS to see someone play, all I got was attitude.Your venus is OKAY at best with your shitty acoustics. Your bartenders are less than personable. Here's a tip. Hire better bartenders who don't give attitude TO PAYING CUSTOMERS, and don't advertise for a certain time and start 3 hours later"

Change over between bands was quick and efficient.  Matt Pond complained about some problem with the monitor mix, but it sounded good in the house.Some earlier reviews talk about how hot it was, but that's not true anymore.  They must have heeded earlier complaints and installed an air conditioning system that blasts cold misty air over the stage into the audience.  If anything a little too cold, but better than roasting.The grill upstairs isn't terribly impressive; perhaps they serve food to qualify as a restaurant that can allow entrance to people under 21.  If so, good on them, because clearly some of the crowd wouldn't have qualified otherwise."

I only have one problem, and it's quite a big problem.When I come here for the performers, there are a great number of photographers that attend as well. I don't know whether they are the performers' photographers or the venue's, but every time I have been at the front they end up jumping and standing right in front of the other concert-goers and I. They love to move their arms around to get every possible angle taken on their cameras, blocking the view of the people who were standing in the front originally, and it's an extreme disappointment for those who have stood in line outside and stood right in front for an hour waiting to see an artist that the photographer could care less about.I have had more than one photographer talk down to my friends and I, and I've even had one elbow me in the face--with no apology--while he was taking pictures at extreme angles.It's very unfortunate for everyone who paid to be there, and one could only hope something could be done about this."

I am all for intimate venues. This was such a hole in the wall venue and the fact that it was smaller made the event all the more meaningful. No doubt about it, I want Rickshaw to be my go-to spot from now on for live music. I was there to see Jessie Ware and you could tell that each person who was in there was a die-hard fan. Acoustics: TOP notch. The sound of the bass player & drummer were incomparable to anything else. It was literally like I had a private session with them -- that's how good their sound was live. On top of that, you can head upstairs where there's a beautiful balcony that overlooks the stage (perfect view if you're lucky to snag a good spot first), as well as a couch for anyone who wants to chill. My friend and I were posted there during the opening act. Only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of the heat. I was prepared after reading the Yelp reviews but I was still dying while I was in there. They need some ventilation :) But hey, we were in awe of Jessie's talent so it didn't bug me too much."

The second night was to see more of a rock/punk/grunge act.  Both nights were really fun.  The Thursday night show was kind of like a gay dance party and the Friday night show was more like a normal rock show.  The venue is small and you can see well from anywhere.  They don't mind cameras and while most the drinks are pricier than I prefer, there were at least a couple drinks each night that were affordable.  I was able to find street parking nearby as well."

I understand this is at times an all ages venue but this being my second (or third) time going, I was kinda put off by the bouncer and bartender. I know I'm young and I'm Asian but I swear to you my ID is real sir and \"did you need something?\" doesn't seem polite when walking up to a bar. Other than that, positive reviews for this place cuz of the venue itself.. I love their video playbacks and the second story which is a balcony with couches for more tired and comfy couples. I believe there was more space and seating further back upstairs.. Only thing is, this place gets really packed, based off of the few times I've gone here.....But that's because of the awesome artists that come thru. There inbetween sets music is awesome as well. not so crappy house/electronic music that's more my style and the crowd varies from both young to old. Sound is great too (especially with Tom Krell's voice it was absolute magic)Bottled beers are $4 and there are in and outs only for 21+The shows themselves are fairly inexpensive... Paying only $14 to see How To Dress Well (i'd even pay more just to see him &) ) Overall, nice place.. For the few times I've gone, I've always wondered why I haven't gone more. Hopefully next time I don't get awkwardly started at for looking like a 16 year old :C"

Sound!The sound on stage was absolutely superb.Most venues only care what the sound is like for people watching the show, but leave the sound on stage as an afterthought.  Normally it's just a cacophony of all sounds overwhelming each other leaving me guessing what's going on. But not at the Rickshaw, where the sound on stage was amazingly clear.  I could actually hear the guitars, the vocals, and my bass.The stage is great as well.  It's big, with lots of room to move around.  It's not too high or too low, so we have a good view of the crowd and feel like we're right on top of them. And lighting was fantastic as well.  It actually went along with what we were playing, mood-wise and tempo as well.It's a great venue to play a gig at, which in turn makes it a great venue to watch a band as well.  We hope to be back soon!"

    "review": "My first time at the Rickshaw Stop, was a disappointment. I really wanted to see Paloma Faith, love her music, so a friend & I drove two hours to SF for the show.  It was supposed to be my birthday present to him.  I saw three different promotions for the show, they all said 8PM show.  It also said it would open with DJ music, so I guessed Paloma wouldn't start at 8, but hopefully not too late as we had to drive home the two hours so my friend could go to work the next day- but we figured if the show lasted til 11, we could get back home by 1.  Well, we stood in line out in the cold windy sidewalk for an hour, they finally opened the doors at 8:25...some guy kept coming out to look at the line, but wouldn't say when the doors would open.  OK, so we get inside at 8:45, get settled in upstairs and listen to the DJ play Motown 60's, which was great.  By 9:30, my friend is getting stressed about how late the trains run to get back to our car, and after 10 more minutes, said he isn't really in the mood to wait any longer.  The place had filled up long ago and we noticed some people were giving up their seats and leaving (mostly older folks, it was a really mixed crowd.)  It wasn't so much we minded losing out on our $15 admission, but we really wanted to see Paloma perform and felt like the 8pm time was really misleading.  As we left, I asked the doorman when Paloma would actually  play, and he said 10pm.  I guess my biggest gripe was the lack of clarity of the schedule- if I had known the show didn't really start til 10, I wouldn't have bought tickets.  I liked everything else about the Rickshaw, I only wish the venue would be more transparent in their timetable.  It gave me the feeling they wanted people in two hours early to buy more drinks.  Hey Rickshaw, would it really be so hard to say \"doors open at eight, showtime at 10?\""

Granted, they had their own sound engineer, but all the levels were perfect and the songs sounded so crisp--even a bit better than my other favorite little SF venue, Bottom of the Hill. The only drawback to the live show was being stuck behind a bunch of obnoxiously tall people--I wish more small venues like this had sloped flooring for us shorter people. If the opening band sucks (like this one did) see if you can snag the big comfy red couch by the merch table--and if that's full, traverse upstairs for somewhat limited \"mezzanine\" seating. Apparently there is a smoking room up there, so be aware if you're sensitive to that. They have a good drink selection and have cute specials that are themed after the performers (the \"Van Etten\" consisted of white champagne grapes and other yummy ingredients). I stuck with an Ace cider. This place is in a weird area, but it sounds like people actually don't have too much of a problem parking around here?

Summary: Casual clubbing with games and drink specials including special events with a cover.Somewhat big \"dance\" area with a crazy mix of music, hippies were everywhere!  I like how casual everything was, it really reminded me of a house party.Berlin ping pong - paddles are just laying around, a circle forms around the table, everyone pounds on the table to commence the start of the game, once everyone wanting to play has joined, the 1st player hits the ball and moves to the side, the opposite returns then moves to the side, the players walk around the table hitting the ping pong until they mess up.  Fun, easy, chill, can play while drinking, and awesome way to get to know your \"neighbor\".  Drink specials - changes all the time2nd floor: has a over view of the entire dance floor, has a rickshaw, skeet ball, and foosball (1 of the guys is missing feet), sofas, and chairs.

I am like i know. Sorry. But she did not pour my coke without ice! She was not finished making the first drink yet when i corrected my order! And ofcourse has not charged anything. I was so shocked with her rudeness that I just accepted it. Now I am pissed. oh and coke was $4! The reason I am so pissed is that she went out of her way to be rude.  It's one thing if she already had poured the coke in the glass with ice and had to waste that coke to give me correct order.  I would totally understand. Even though most of the people would make a new drink to make customer happy. So in the end I paid $20 cover and four times the actual price of coke just to be greeted in such a \"nice\" way.

In theory, it would be the perfect spot to Party Like A Rockstar then crawl underneath my desk, wake up the next morning, and hope no one remembers what I wore the previous day. Ok, maybe not because I'm a lady after all.Rickshaw Stop is a club that has live band performances specifically Indie music. They also have Bhangra nights which is some sort of Indian folk dancing.  When we ended up here last night (not by choice) for a Popscene party, I pretty much sobered up after seeing shirtless men doing interpretive dances.

I went here back in July for a concert during the week. Everything as far as the staff, bartenders, and overall atmosphere were really nice. I especially liked the upstairs chill area - a nice place to go to get away from the bottleneck that is the entry way. Now for the bad. First off, this place was RIDICULOUSLY HOT INSIDE. It was retarded... no AC, and although they have tons of fans on the ceilings, they wouldn't turn any of them on. I've been to countless overpacked venues and this place was stupidly hot beyond all others. Secondly, the sound system SUCKS hard. sucks so hard that it's just laughable. What's with the arrogant DJ not turning down the sound for a second so the band can do a decent sound check? The band had to ask multiple times and the dude would NOT turn it down. They had to just start the show without going through a full sound check... which probably let to the multiple problems with the sound throughout the show. The tremble would knock out the speaker ever so often and the speakers would constantly crackle from the vocalist. It was sad.thankfully the tickets were super cheap, but that doesn't take away from the fact that this place blows."

The staff is friendly and relaxed, the ambience is great, and the shows are darn cheap!If you are looking for a cheap show and you don't care who the band is, then do I have the place for you.  Generally the most expensive show they have will cost around 12 dollars, no service charge at the door.  The stage is a bit small, but the venue is a bit small.  You can get as close as you want because the floor is pretty big.  I saw Miniature tigers and Neon Indian here and that was the most packed its ever been.  So no worries about sweaty drunks shoving their elbows into you.  There are about three rickshaws around the place that you can sit on, along with more comfortable furnishings.  There are plenty of couches and chairs upstairs for people to sit on, but they get snatched up quick.  I do wish they had some more seating up stairs for this reason.  It is nice to watch the show from a comfy green couch or stare out over the crowd. They have Bhangra Dancing once or twice a month, but I have not been yet.  The shows they have here are generally pretty small, indie bands, so don't expect a huge crowd to show up.  The drinks are pretty varied and well priced.  (Jack and Coke $6)Parking is on the street, but i've never had a problem with it.  This is a great venue.  I've loved it from the big shows to the small.

Swingin 1960s French music with Brigitte Bardot playing in the background and balloons floating around. Fabulous! Rickshaw has a huge dance floor and upstairs seating area with a balcony. Service at the bar is good, drinks are reasonably priced and everyone seems down to party. But it gets hot and you will get sweaty. Like, your clothing will stick to your body, your hair will frizz and you will walk outside looking like a complete disaster.But it's fun if you are in the mood to get down with you bad self."

    "review": "Rickshaw Stop has so many elements going for it to make it a fun night spot but somehow the overall experience comes up just short. It's a nicely-sized club that feels intimate with easy access to the bar where responsive bartenders pour you reasonably priced drinks. The dance floor is reasonably roomy and the lights are pretty awesome. Here's the thing that is a little odd for me though - folks on the dance floor seemed more intent on \"posing\" versus just dancing and having a good time. Very strange. Still I liked the music and had a good time with my friends. Not my favorite spot to spend the night but I won't be opposed to going back to Rickshaw Stop with the right folks."

It's also fun to head up to the balcony and see the show from there. Tickets are always affordable and they book great bands. Sometimes if they sell out they'll release a limited number of tickets at the door. It's always a great crowd - I love this place!"

It had been a hectic few weeks, and I felt like when I went in to The Rickshaw Stop, all of a sudden everything mellowed out. The atmosphere was both calm and friendly. The red curtains gave the place such a nice feeling. Everyone seemed in good cheer and sharing that energy with everyone else, which was something I hadn't felt much since moving to California. The upstairs was pretty cool too, with the bike and the couches. The bar served reasonably priced and creative drinks (the special is always themed with the evening's features.) One of the staff asked me for my I.D. because I fit the description of someone who had apparently stolen someone else's purse, and then, unlike in most situations, when I tried to inquire and help, instead of being a jerk, he was cooperative and instead of what could have been a terrible experience, it was a pleasant exchange, and i made sure to let him know that and thank him for handling the situation so well.I came back for a bunch more shows, all of which were also satisfactory and beeming with good vibes.Lastly, I was so elated to find that Nerd Nite not only exists outside of Boston, but is so well attended in San Francisco!I loved living right across the street from the Rickshaw Stop for the brief time that i got to do so. I miss being able to cross the street to see a great show, enjoy myself without worrying, and then cross the street again and go to bed at a decent hour."

They seriously do have bad ventilation, it was so freaking smokey/foggy in there. But honestly, just because a venue is so-so isn't really going to stop anyone from coming to see their favorite band. Its no staples center but it still kind of has this cozy feel to it. From the outside, you can't even really tell it's a music venue or that its a really long building but it is!Some annoying things were a bunch of hs hipsters with their huge ass fake glasses and beanies with plaid or ripped shirts always seem to be smoking while waiting in line- i guess to pass the time.

There was a mosh pit, where a crowd surfer came about two inches from landing on my head, a young man who more or less head-butted me, and a head banging chick who kept violently running into me as she could not see through her mass of Cousin It-like hair.  The stage was only raised by about two feet, as evidenced from the two baseball sized bruises on my knees from being pushed into the stage by never ceasing, pounding waves of human bodies.  Needless to say, despite the near concussion and other injuries, it was a great time.Also helpful: I found the bartender to have supernatural hearing, an admirable quality when attempting to shout my drink order mid-song.  I couldn't even hear myself, but somehow, amazingly, he was able to ascertain the drink order and get the requested alcohol into my hand.  Amen."

I didn't go in, but I eyed the smokers with envy as I'm a sucker for skeeball. Well, maybe it wasn't even skeeball.. I don't know. Looked like it from the outside looking in.If you like to sit, like I do, then head upstairs. No seating on the main floor.Upstairs has two levels. Both with various seats. My man and I snagged a love seat couch and yea, we made out. It was fun watching couples cram into rickshaw seats. If you want to ensure that you can actually SEE the band/stage then make sure you are on the lower of the two upper levels and bellied up to the rail. Because as we found last night (Freelance Whales and Miniature Tigers, vg btw) when the main acts come on stage people will come stand between you and the rail thereby blocking your view if you are seated. Upstairs bar has no tap and only bottled beers/Bathrooms were nasty! But that's normal in these venues.Crowd was very young. Lots of high school kids with back packs. Upon entry I joked with the bouncer that we (me and my main squeeze) would probably be the grandpa and grandma in the club. He took one look at my ID and said \"I think you already win that award by a long shot\". I would like to note that I saw at least 3 men in their 60's here. So we did not win that prize. There were also dads chaperoning their underage kids. That was funny, watching the kids ignore their dad as dad tried to engage said children in conversations.As far as local venues to see up and coming acts in a small setting. This one was pretty good.

I have no idea what it's like as a club, but from some of the pictures posted, it looks like a lot of drunkies dancing with brightly colored beverages.As a music venue, I've enjoyed Rickshaw overall.  The place certainly has personality including random rickshaws placed around the space.  The bar is conveniently located on the side and is cheap.  The venue itself is a good size with a smaller balcony in the back for people trying to avoid the standing room crowd.My only complaint about the venue is the crowd sometimes errs toward the young'uns side, which can make me feel like an old creepy dude scouting.  Once I went to a show where the opening band was clearly from the local high school as the front of the room became heavily populated with kids with backpacks.  They began moshing to music that probably shouldn't be moshed to.Another time, I went to watch a Wavves show and a young man jumped on stage and started dancing like a chimpanzee on crack.

Not only was I dismayed to find the cover at the door for the night was 50% higher than was advertised on their website, but the night got worse from there.I was invited by some friends to come out and see/hear this apparently great DJ, but when I got there the club was nearly empty, but my friends were there, and I guess that's what really matters.  I had one drink and then switched to consuming little plastic cups of tap-water.  I hadn't been at the club much more than a half an hour when I decided to go outside to check the BART schedule on my smartphone (due to crappy reception in the club).  I carried an almost empty little plastic cup of tap-water with me to the door.  The bouncer, or at least this very non-official-looking skinny guy by the door informed me that I couldn't take my drink outside.  \"It's okay, it's just water\", I said.  \"You can't take alcohol outside.  There's an open container law\", he replied.  \"No, it's just water\", I said again, thinking he hadn't heard me, and I attempted to walk past him.  Suddenly, he swiped the cup from my hand so violently that it tore in half and he started shoving me.  Of course, at this point I began to protest, yelling \"What the h*ll\", and insisting that I was only carrying water.  The 'bouncer' escalated his violence in turn, yelling and shoving.  He was quickly joined by a short young woman (who I believe was the one who had collected my exorbitant cover charge) in the yelling.  The 'bouncer' demanded that I leave and threatened to call the police.  I freely admit to yelling and hurling a few expletives at these two, but at no time did I do anything improper or touch either of them.  I demanded that they \"get out of my face\", but the shoving and cursing from them just continued.  Suddenly, they were joined by a third small young man in the yelling match.  I demanded several times to know who all these people were.  Only the small man answered me, claiming to be the club owner.  I was shocked by this, as he was clearly much younger than I.  He appeared to be not far from college age.  The yelling and shoving continued, yet at no time did I raise a hand to any of these three, despite my outrage.  I haven't been in a fist-fight since middle school, and I certainly wasn't about to stoop to that level again.  Finally, I turned and walked away.  I suppose the entire altercation couldn't have lasted more than one or two minutes.In conclusion, you should not give these aggressive a**holes any of your hard earned money.  The owners and employees of this club are the dregs of humanity and should be avoided at all cost.  Please find somewhere else to hear music and buy a drink with your friends."

I sipped it while exploring the upstairs seating area, envying the people who scored a spot on a bench with a snake face carved into one end.We took ownership over a wooden structure to the left of the high-up stage on the main level. When I leaned back far enough into the lush, red curtain, I was relieved to discover a wall. Usually when I have a few drinks, I don't act stupid or anything--I just become uncontrollably tired. Thus, after one Clarissa's Wired and two sangrias, I passed out on the wooden structure. My head rolled  around throughout the show because I wanted to stay awake so badly, attempting to nod my head and stomp my feet. But alas, my Clarissa's cocktail left me anything but wired."

    "review": "Let me say that I have been to many music venues the size of the Rickshaw, and the Rickshaw is definitely one of my favorites, mostly because of the vibe. It's laid back and not too full of itself, or full of unnecessary security, or inflated ticket prices.They have a bar in the back of the main floor, which I prefer to the side bar layout of the Fillmore, mostly because the traffic to/from will walk next to you going forward/back instead of constantly in front of you going side to side. The drinks aren't great, but they aren't high-priced either.Upstairs is a small balcony and a bunch of hipster-style victorian furniture. When we've gone it hasn't been so crowded downstairs that you really wished for a place to escape, but the couches do still provide a great respite from standing and getting bumped. All in all, you can go here and enjoy a show without the annoying crowd factors you get at some other places."

I'm glad I finally decided to give Rickshaw Stop another chance - cause if you do it right - it's definitely what's up.All you gotta do - is show up early. Make a mad dash to the top floor. Find a big padded soft couch right by the balcony railing. Plop down. Kick back.  Take off shoes. And don't move for the entire night. Unless you have someone to save your spot for you.Where else in the city can you relax and lie down on a soft lovely couch, with a killer view of the stage, while listening to seriously on point music?huh?Trust."

The stage is hard to see if you're standing anywhere near the back; other venues in SF seem to be set up better--e.g., the stage is higher, or the floor is slightly angled.  The upstairs seating/standing area was nicer, but tiny.  And the bartenders were kind of rude and served tiny, weak, very expensive drinks.  The whole place was hot and stuffy, as other reviewers have mentioned.  I'd only come back if I was pretty excited about whoever was playing (in this case, Junip and Jose Gonzales--good show)."

I would love it there was a Rickshaw down here in these parts of So Cal but then I guess going to the Rickshaw when in the City would lose its charm. Love the bi-level atmosphere, when venues do this it always earns points with me, that way I don't feel cramped up and can get away to a different spot.  I am not familiar at all with the dance nights that most people review about just only about seeing live bands. So I say if a friend hits you up to check out their band then I say go, you will probably have a decent time."

They also have a smoking room upstairs for the smokers. The Phantogram show wasn't packed at all so it was very comfortable however the Mayer Hawthorne show was sold out and it got seriously hot in there but it is a small music venue and this is what happens when you pack in a shit load of people into a small venue.

    "review": "OMG!! This has to be the WORST club I've ever been to !!  Expensive, rude staff, aggressive crowd, and their bathrooms are less than sanitary...I came here last night (Non-Stop Bhangra) for a friend's birthday, and I have never had such a bad clubbing experience - in any country!  Summary on the night's events...-- $20 cover-charge for everyone!  Doesn't matter if you're with a large party or rock up late - it's $20!  I don't normally believe in paying a huge cover to enter a club, because they overcharge you on drinks once you're in there, but because it was for a friend's b'day, I didn't say anything.-- $3 to check anything into the cloakroom, and $2 each time you want to retrieve anything!  My friend was buying drinks & he was $1 short, so I asked the girl who had just checked my bag in, if I could access my wallet - she was going to charge me $2, to get $1 out of my bag!!  No way!-- The guys there are aggressive!  I don't know what was in the air, but my friend (John) nearly got beaten up trying to rescue me from this guy who kept trying to dance with me, even though I'd already politely refused him earlier.  I think the guy thought John was cutting in on him, so he started getting really pissed, until I assured him that John was a friend of mine.  Even so, the guy was like, \"Let's take it outside\", and wouldn't leave us alone until another friend stepped in to pacify him.-- The best part of the night was when they (temporarily) lost my things at the cloakroom when I went back to reclaim them... Not only that, but the girl was really rude about it!  First, she pretty much ignored me for 5 min., even though I was standing right there holding my ticket, and started tidying up/rearranging stuff inside; then when I asked if I could please get my bag out, she pretended not to have realized what I was waiting for.  Next thing I know, she starts texting on her phone!  What the?!?So I asked again (more directly) - \"Err... could I please have my bag - now??\"  And she said, \"We're having a little trouble finding it - I'm just calling the guy who was minding the cloakroom earlier - maybe he moved it.\"  How stupid!  Why would he do that??So then I asked if I could please come in to take a look, cause I'd recognize it - but she wouldn't let me and continued texting.Finally she asked me what it looked like; I described it; and after taking a 3rd look, she found it - it was right there the whole time!!But she didn't say anything or apologize for wasting my time - and my friends had been there waiting with me the whole time!Anyway, the night was saved by the fact that I was in good company, but I vowed NEVER to come back here EVER again!!! - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - EDIT: The next day, I discovered huge reddish-brown stains all over my JC velour handbag!! Can't figure out what the hell it is, but it has bleached the material, thus making the bag unusable.  Thank you very much to the crappy cloakroom staff!!"

I went for a Morning Benders show and was disappointed to find that all of the opening bands SUCKED, and the audience was a bunch of annoying hipster fucks who kept pushing me. One girl was so drunk that she broke a glass beer bottle IN HER HAND then proceeded to bend to the floor for about 20 minutes picking up the pieces of glass one by one, while her hands were bleeding everywhere. It was disgusting. Right after the show was over I saw some guy doing a line off his friend's hand right in the middle of the floor. Classy! But the worst part was some drunk bitch threw up all over my boots, and right afterwards didn't apologize or go to the bathroom to clean herself up or anything, just kept dancing. Ridiculous."

Definitely a different scene then downtown SJ. Blow up used to play electro, house, dance and just all in all shake your ass jams. They also had eclectic DJ's come in. I loved it and wish they didn't have to shut it down! This place is 18 and over so the crowd is definitely different from what I'm used to. It gets stannnnnnky, sticky and very sweaty very quickly! But if your sweatin up a storm your probably having the time of your life! Everyone I've taken to Blow up absolutely LOVED it! I wish there was something similar in SJ...but because its not in the city will it still be an adventure?! Most the time I came here I never had to pay a cover :) but once in awhile i did which was $10 for 21 and over and I forgot how much it was for 18 and over. It was about $5-$10 more if I recall correctly.5 stars for the entire experience and BLOW UP in general4 stars for the venue. Its a small place but who doesn't love red velvet curtains!? Hahahaha.  The upstair's lounge area was cool too. Definitely where I was when I didn't want to get hit on or sweated on!!!! And the smoke area is located upstairs but beware there are no windows! So if you have virgin lungs like I do, I don't suggest going in there! But for you smokers.......its perfect for you!Took one star off due to some incidents that I've encountered with SOME of the KIDS who are under 21 who are absolutely rude, immature and disgusting. Everyone is out to have a good time but fuck did you really have to forget your manners AND how to take a piss and shit like a normal person!! We are not camping! Gross.One more thing, OMG the coat check was expensive! So if you decide to bring a coat and all that good stuff expect to pay a hefty fee for it."

[rant]Event Organizers know people are coming to see someone who's musical genre we probably prefer, so why do they always pick openers that play a completely different type of sound? For my sanity and physical health (the ears were about to start bleeding) I had to step outside plenty of times between openers and even DURING a few. [/rant]It's smaller than other places, but for the size of the crowd that night: ideal. The rickshaws were cute, the ambiance much like the old-school dive bars I've seen in Bali, and the bartenders friendly. I had a few cocktails - two people made them delicious (strong yet sweet), another guy used the cheap stuff that tasted like mouthwash without the minty freshness.If you get there early, you could save yourself a seat in the loungey zone upstairs and hang out while all the openers do their thing. We got there at 7:55 and 4 bands + a little over 3 hours later, we heard Zee Avi. The highlight of that night was Zee Avi's performance, then running into her in the restroom and chatting with her for a bit."

Finally last night, I got to see 'em funky fresh in the flesh! To be brutally honest though, I didn't really care too much for the opening acts. The first guy sat there playing his acoustic guitar damn near had me ready to swallow razor blades. The next band, Lumerians, were pretty dope but I wasn't in the mood to hear anybody but Garotas Suecas, since that's who I came to see. They brought the fuzzy spaced out funk straight from Sao Paulo son! I met the guitarist who was real cool and he gave me the set-list (I'm such a nerd). Rickshaw's a dope venue coz it's got a nice sized main floor and the extra-dope upstairs with a balcony that has a perfect view of the stage, if you don't feel like punching out the next idiot who steps in front of you after you've been posted up front waiting for the band you been wanting to see. Real talk! Why does that shit always happen though.Big up to Chris the security guy for being a real genuine dude! I got nothin' but respect for security guys who hold it down without being douchey, nah mean?

My completely sober 125 pound boyfriend was standing to the side waiting for Glass Candy to go on while me friend and I were chatting with each other. We each payed about 45 bucks each, a heafty amount for a venue like the Rickshaw Stop, just to see the band play, then leave and go to friend's parties.Some guy rudely bumps my boyfriend to move, despite the amount of space around him that the guy could walk through easily. Then the guy tells him to walk outside with him because he was a sercurity guy. My boyfriend refused at first because they guy was going to kick him out then agreed to sort out what was going on. They go outside and the guy walks away. My boyfriend walks back in confused then the guy picks him up and forcibly carries him outside (RE-bruising an old rib injury my boyfriend had last year). This all happens AT MIDNIGHT.I'm demanding to see the manager and demanding for my money back. What could a 125 pound, well behaved man do to get him kicked out? Standing still isn't grounds to kick someone out. He wasn't drunk (like everyone else), he wasn't high (everyone else was) and he definitely wasn't harrassing people. All he did was refuse to move when someone was rudely pushing him instead of simply tapping him like everyone else does at a show.  The \"manager\" caves after listening to me complain about how his worker is bullying my boyfriend who is clearly sober, no threat and the last person to pick a fight with. He even agreed that my boyfriend didn't look like a threat. The worker even LIED and said that he did tap him on the shoulder to make it sound like his actions were justifiable. We think he was pissed about something unrelated and just wanted to pick on someone smaller than him.Me and my boyfriend have been coming to this venue since we were teens (between 10-14 years). Between us, we have gone to hundreds of shows over the years without any drama and we have NEVER been kicked out of any venue.We are tempted to go back to the venue and tell them that they re-injured my boyfriend's rib. We are also seriously considering talking to the owners about this (we know people who know them). I feel like we spent 90 bucks between us just to have a shitty time at their venue.We used to love this place. It used to be awesome where you could watch indie bands play. This was pre-Blow Up club nights when it really was about listening to good music and not about getting wasted, watching girls do tons of coke in the bathroom and where the people who worked there didn't pick on the wrong people."

This is my first, I made an account JUST to review BLOW UP @ The Rickshaw Stop.I went this Friday with a few friends. Had a TERRIBLE time. We're all in our early twenties but I felt like I was at a high school dance. HALF of the people there were children. Wasted, drugged, annoying, rude, obnoxious high schoolers. How do these kids get in?!It was Blow Up's \"100th Anniversary\" or something. It started off with some HORRIBLE 'performance' by two rapping lesbians. They were terrible. Despite the boos, they finished their act.I can't count the number of times I was pushed, shoved, and ran into without acknowledgment. At one point my friend and I were dance-attacked by some savage teenage girl on E. I had to push this bitch off of me numerous times!! Gays, forget it. I've been here about a dozen times and have never met any nice gays worth knowing. Oh, and I can never tell who's straight and who's hipster. HIPSTERS. Oh god! Don't get me started. So many weird, wanna-be indie hipster kids. So many v-necks, lense-less thick framed glasses, and skinny jeans, I wanted to kill myself.Also, if you DO happen to be underage and drinking, watch out. The bouncers here are ROUGH. I witnessed one of the male bouncers SCREAMING in this girls face after catching her drinking without a wrist band. He was yelling at the top of his lungs and screaming profanities for her to get out. And then a long brown-hair female worker there (bartender? female bouncer?) GRABS THIS GIRL BY THE THROAT and pushes her to get out. I couldn't believe what I was witnessing! Hardcore stuff.So yeah, in a nut shell. Don't waste your time on Blow Up. The ONLY saving grace of this event is the music... Not going to lie, its the only reason I lasted longer than an hour... Love the tunes! Oh, and if you go with some easy-going friends who love to dance.. you might be ok."

You have to expect your clothes to smell like cigarettes. Although, there is a smoking area upstairs, the smoke makes its way downstairs. So why was I surprised that I left my rainjacket underneath the lit christmas tree downstairs to find that it completely stunk of cigarette smoke? d.) You have to expect to be somewhat sore the next day...that and maybe a combination of sore and hungover. PLUSES:-I have never been disappointed. I have been to Blow Up, Cockblock and Rebel Girl.

Awesome.-Ins and outs allow for some breathing roomMINUS:-Please do something about the floor in front of the bar. That area is slippery as all hell. There really should be someone mopping/drying that area down. -18+ events, watch out for hot messes EVERYWHERE. You can tolerate this more when you have had 2+ drinks in you.

True, lots of 18+ kids who party here probably attend the local art school wearing their most expensive & trendiest outfit that mom and pop financed but if you ease up a bit most of them are just looking to get to know others with the same interest. It's what some would call a 'hipster' scene, but who cares? That doesn't stop most people from partying in SJ's Motif or Suite 181 when I call it the 'ghetto' scene.Expect the young, fabulous, trendy, tattooed & pierced type here! If you don't like this type, then obviously don't come here to ruin everyone else's good time with your negativity and sniveling. What I love about partying here for Blow UP is they constantly have different artists & DJ's coming here to bring you some fresh indie & electronica beats to dance to  a la Steve Aoki, Dan Oh, Skeet Skeet, Designer Drugs, Micky Avalon, etc. Richie Panic & Jeffrey Paradise are the usual DJ suspects here.Once when I came here with friends during the summer it was so hot we literally left the place drenched in sweat. I know it wasn't the weather that evening, but rather it was caused by everyone's dancing and enjoying themselves.Definitely worth it imo. Don't forget to say \"Hi!\" to Ava Berlin, she is such a sweetie!"

It wasn't that crowded at first but around 945 the crowd started arriving for the class. I recommend standing in front so you can watch all of the moves.  It's actually pretty hard and some people need to learn to wear more deodorant. As you know, bhangra requires lots of arms up in the air and I smelled lots of BO. EwieAll in all it was fun. It gets pretty hot inside  so stay near the fans. Drinks are relatively inexpensive. They had a pretty good sangria for $5."

I have been going here since i moved to SF 2 years ago and it's still one of my favorite places to dance!! It can be so hard to find a place that plays good indie music that i never hear any where else! (CSS, le tigre, crystal castles, yeah yeah yeahs, basement jaxx, etc) Breath of fresh air!!The Big Ole is also a rickshaw staple, PINT size vodka redbull. I don't have to tell you that more than one of those can be dangerous!!They also have a projector screen that they play videos on. It sits up on the stage, which you can dance on right by the DJ.The upstairs is cool as well. They have couches and a balcony area that looks over the dance floor that's nice to sit at when you need a dance break. Free foosball table, coat check and another bar as well. The smoke room is in the back and so if its damn cold out or crowded by the door, you can just smoke upstairs. There is a cover, but when i plan to go to the rickshaw i always spend the entire night here anyway."

You could go to City Nights and feel like your back at a high school dance but if your at all into electronic music and just enjoy being around cool people with good vibes I would definitley recommend checking Blow Up out at the Rickshaw Stop. It was actually the first club I ever went to and I was not disappointed, the music is great with mixes bringing back the Jackson fives to Queen and Benny benassi. Not only that but the cover charge is only $15 for 18+ and $10 for 21+! The only downside is that after 11pm the line will go around the block so if your not trying to wait in the cold I would recommend coming a bit early and try not to wear too much makeup because you will sweat it off!"

I'll probably like this place even more when my cousin turns 18, so I can drink here and she can escort my drunk ass home.  A rum and coke costs $5.  The cover charge is reasonable for the quality of acts they bring to the stage.It got a little too hot at the last show I went to, but it was sold out, and any dancey crowded place is going to get sweaty.

Loved the crowd, and loved the venue--they have a lounge and bar upstairs that was surprisingly empty. We only used the bar upstairs (there's one downstairs too) but were thoroughly impressed by the girls bartending. They weren't too chatty, but the drinks were well-made and the girls were generous. The only issue I have with this place is that the music felt very repetitive: a friend described himself as \"feeling as though [he] were listening to 20 minutes of one track, then 3 minutes of another track, and then 20 more minutes of the first track.\" The Tenderlions were playing, and it was a joy to watch them, but listening got old quickly. I'll probably come back again when someone else is playing and see what I think then."

Knowing that I can come here on Fridays to blow off some steam and burn about a billion calories dancing and sweating for a few hours is the only thing that gets me through the week some times. It's $15 for 18+ and $10 for 21+, and well worth it at that.Jeffrey Paradise and Richie Panic are the resident DJ's and are a couple of the cities finest. Let me make one thing clear: Yes, this is an 18+ club, yes this means there are a fair amount of 18-20 year olds there, NO this does not ruin the club experience. This is a hip club. Meaning it's mainly a bunch of hip-kids decked out in American Apparel, Urban Outfitters, and/or various thrift/vintage shop clothing. It wouldn't matter if these kids were 16 or 30, they all act the same.If you're looking for a lounge to sip cocktails and relax, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU. If you're looking a wall to wall dance floor to 'blow up and get down' while getting absolutely soaked in your own (and everyone else's, mind you) sweat, this is your new mecca. And don't worry, if there's not enough room for you on the dance floor, there's a stage and piano you're more than welcome to conquer."

SHIT WAS CRAZY! I kid you not! Once we were in around 10pm, as soon as people started getting inside, they were pumped and ready to get down, busting out moves randomly, psyched for the night ahead. As people got comfortable inside and had some drinkies, the party was jumping way before the Tenderlions and Twelves even came on! At the end, a bunch of people, myself included ahah, got up on stage and started grooving right along with the Twelves. Saying that it was just a good night would be an understatement.**Entertainment for the night apart from the music?- A somewhat attractive, almost Casey-Affleck look-alike, drunk French hipster who was not pretentious! but rather like I said, just very drunk later on. He did not trust his friends with hats very much and knew how to bust a move...sober.- London-native wannabe playa who was the French guy's friend although he was kind of funny to talk to."

So yea, I guess that's a solid 3 stars right, simply functioning as intended with no real stand out qualities?The drinks were mediocre, yet another 3 star designation, again nothing to really flip out about. They have coat check which is a plus.

I was cuddling with my friend on the couch and had a hand over my eyes to sort of meditate and feel better when the bouncer came up and told me i'd have to leave if i wasn't \"more energetic.\" i thought he was joking, but he came back 10 minutes later and said \"i saw you napping, i'm going to ask you to leave.  the boss said that's not ok.\"  i replied incredulously \"what?\" and he said \"did i stutter?\"  i told him i wasn't feeling well and he said \"that's too bad but i'm still going to kick you out if you don't start showing some more energy.\"WTF? since when is a club a pep rally?i suspect that they are running a shady deal where they pack their club past capacity, then pick out people to throw out for whatever reason so they can keep their money but not be *too* packed.don't worry, mr bouncer, i'll never darken your club with my floopiness again."

One of my friends got sick while she was there (and all she had to drink was a ginger ale in this hot and stuffy club). She sat down on the couch by the merch table to take a short break, but apparently 'the boss' didn't like this. One of the employees came by--a stocky bald guy with terrible facial hair--and said that she wasn't being \"energetic enough.\"  My friend told him that she was getting sick and just resting for a second.  Rather than offering her some water, he said that he was going to \"kick her out if she wasn't more energetic.\"  The douchiest part: she said \"I'm sorry, what did you say?\" and he did a poor Bender impression and said \"did I stutter?\"I hope that the next time he gets sick and needs medical assistance, he only gets quotes from John Hughes' movies.Read all the other 1-star reviews, and you'll see that I'm not alone in this opinion.  I saw another bouncer throwing more people out tonight than I've seen at all the times I've been out at clubs in SF.I suspect it's a scam: the club was filled way past its legally allowed capacity (it's posted on the wall), and I think they throw people out so they can keep their money and pretend that they comply with the fire laws.Hopefully a fire marshall will show up one night, shut this place down, and put these douchebags their out of a job.

Doors were supposed to open at 9pm, but the line was still moving pretty slowly to get in; but major props to the ID checker at the front for trying, constantly screaming for everyone to get their IDs out and ready. Upon entering, you might have to fight through the bathroom queue to get anywhere. Ceilings are pretty low, but don't worry they shouldn't cave in--just keep walking, get your drinks and shake that thang! What I loved about the venue, was wether upstairs, downstairs, bathroom or bar, the ambiance was very home-y, almost an intimate gathering of friends (don't worry, I'm not an emo or a hipster). Drinks were awesome: great Tokyo Iced Tea. AND woot woot for the upstairs smoking room! The openers were fun--they really got the audience going. Then Ms. Diva Sovereign managed to get through four songs before walking off for a second and final time. Needless to say, everyone tried making the best of the situation, but one of the guards did not like it when a friend walked on stage and grabbed the rest of the Diva's crate of beer (Dos XX's but free is free). I understand that the Diva just wasn't feeling it, but come on. So, the jerk of a guard huffed and puffed and through us all out, even though the DJ said everyone could split her beer. Still managed to have an awesome time though. Glad/Proud we got kicked out of a place we no longer wanted to be. So, to reiterate, Yay for Rickshaw and poo on the Lady Sovereign (you should put that in your pipe and smoke it before your next show you sorry twit--oops, might still be a bit angry with her)."

The behavior of the employees here Saturday night was honestly shocking and really took me aback.Let me preface this by saying I was not that drunk. I know that sounds like the \"drunk girl's motto\" but I was very clear headed when dealing with the staff. Now, I had been dancing in the middle of the club with a friend, who, to put it simply, dropped me and I fell hard in front of everyone. I mean hard. Super embarrassing and probably made me look a lot drunker than I actually was. After my moment in the spotlight, I scurried away to the bar to avoid the stares, and that's when the fun started. I went to get my 2nd drink of the night (the first of which I shared with my friend), and essentially got cut off. He probably saw my fall. He didn't even say this, or anything for that matter, and when I asked for a drink he basically scoffed and said \"don't think that's happening,\" turned his back, and ignored me. I didn't understand what was going on.But whatever, it wasn't that big of deal and I didn't make a fuss. When I came back later in the night to close my tab (for the 1 drink I had bought), I asked him if he really thought I had been that drunk, to which he responded, \"yeah, drunk or on roofies, something is going on.\" Who says that? It was the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard, and he was clearly just trying to be insulting. When I asked him what his name was, I again got the silent treatment, and he went in the back room. The other bartender was also ignoring me and nobody would give any names. Maybe they knew I'd write a bad review? If you're going to treat somebody like shit, man up and give them your name.The place was closing down, and having been there with the band, I was waiting on the stairs for them to get the car and load up. You know the face that women make, and that tone of voice, where someone is pretending to say something nicely but really they are trying to be really mean? Kind of a like a little tilt of the head/smirk/raised eyebrows look? This little asian chick employee comes over to me (I'm donig absolutely nothing) and tells me I need to leave in the rudest way, with that face. I told her I was with the band and that I was just waiting for them, and she essentially said, again in a really venomous way, that she didn't care who I was with, I needed to get out. To which I replied, \"fine but you don't have to be such a bitch about it.\" Yes yes, I know I should've just held my tongue, and I am generally quite tame, but it was the culmination of the entire staff marking me and treating me like !@#$ for the duration of the night that did it. Of course she, and the 3 other employees at the bar immediately start screaming at me, 'YOU need to get the !@#$ out of this club NOW!\" Which, at that point, was warranted.And here is how you know it wasn't just me. The guys were loading up the van in front of the club, at 2:25 or so, and one of the angry bartenders (who was leaving to go home, not knowing that I was in the car), yells at one of the band members for parking in front of the club and having all of their shit around. He tells him to have some respect. HE'S PACKING UP! He just finished a show! It was crazy.It's unfortunate that the staff (at least, I guess, on a saturday) is so horrendously rude because otherwise the space as a music venue is not bad at all."

    "review": "The Rickshaw is a pretty cool place for live music and dancing. Upstairs is a mezzanine with chairs, benches, and couches, in case you don't want to be down on the dance floor and just want to chill back.Downstairs is a low level stage so you're not being towered over by the band(s) and have easy access to jump on stage and dance, if thats what you're into. The atmosphere is super fun and upbeat, and usually have some really good bands performing. They have a small bar, but serves just about everything. They have killer deals on drinks: $5 for a pint of redbull and vodka? YES PLEASE!Sometimes I think the cover charge is outlandish for certain nights and no name bands, but if you're willing to pay the price, you can still have a good time."

Good beer on tap.They have Absolut Ruby Red.Crowd was pretty good.Parking nearby.Upstairs seating is great if the dancefloor is packed.Has a similar vibe to the Casbah in San Diego---which is a place I miss, so ya, I dig the Rickshaw---OH! and duh, they have cute rickshaws and bicycley paraphernalia you can sit on/in!!"

Not to mention it is expensive as FUCK.The last time I went here must have been about a year ago. My friend and I (we were both under 21 at the time) got kicked out because we had used the restroom and washed our hands. The place didn't have any paper towels(of course) so we were drying our hands off on our pants. A bouncer walked by and kicked us out because he said we were trying to get the \"X\" marks off of our hands so that we could drink, although they were still very visible because that is not at all what we were doing. We tried to explain ourselves but he was on a power trip and began yelling at us in front of the line. Keep in mind that we were not even drunk. My friend had checked his bag and coat in at coat check so he asked if he could go in to get his shit so we could leave. NO. We proceeded to ask a staff member to go and get his things out of coat check since we were not allowed back in. NO. We had to call someone we knew from inside to come out, get the ticket, and retrieve the belongings. This place is not worth your time and money."

    "review": "How could you turn down a crowd that gets their sweat on so profusely that as they turn, after the stage is completely taken over, the sweat flies off of them? I know I can't. It's right up my alley.Some of the crew and I rolled out deep for Non Stop Bhangra night at Rickshaw stop. Walking in, we were a few early, which was just fine. We got our drinks, posted up in the corner and put on our dancing shoes, ready to be taught some of the elegantly simple and artfully infused dance moves that are, well, Bhangra. I had never heard of it before, although I had seen that style many times in Paris. Nights flew by listening to raj music while in underground clubs by the Louvre as the locals went mad. The people that frequent the small club with an upstairs are die hards. It was incredible to see the different flavors of people jam packed in there literally letting it all go and getting their groove on. I sweated through my clothing, and for once, wished I had worn kicks instead of heels so that I could have really gotten down and dirty in it. No drama, no problems, just a ton of people all there with a common thread, they love to dance. The beat inspires them. What could be more perfect than that? I didn't get skeevy men dripping on my ass for once, no one attempting to take the two of us home that night. It was refreshing. Just make sure you're not claustrophobic, as it's as tightly packed in there late at night as sardines in a can. Oh, and wear something you don't have to dryclean, cause as a forewarning, you're gonna get drenched. If it's not from your own sweat, from those around you."

Isn't that what Non-Stop Bhangra is all about? The problem is that they pack you in there so tightly that you can't move or breathe for that matter, as the place can't hold enough oxygen for so many people. It is a popular event so have it twice a month so people can actually do what they came to do--DANCE!! Don't be a greedy club owner!! Luckily the Fire Marshall didn't get wind of this mess. I won't be going back. Too bad. But I love the Bhangra so I'll be planning to host an event like this somewhere else, where the profits don't trump fun."

Minus .5 stars for the $20 cover charge - Thats effin pricey!Plus 1 star for the music which was pretty awesome. Rocked my socks, YEEEEEEAAAH!!!Minus 1.5 for the cramped and stuffy experience. The place is Oh-mi-god super stuffed. Its tough to groove without getting stepped on. I thought I was excellent at manouvering and not getting stepped over but in the end I nearly fell on my face. And I was'nt even buzzing yet. LOLMinus 1 for the gin and tonic the bartender made. My honey fell sick after downing that despicable concoction.Its gonna take a lot of convincing for me to go back."

Though I have been to this club when it's been less than packed and had a really good time.  I've also seen a band play here and liked the venue for that.I think that I am just too old to really get into the whole smooshed together with sweaty underaged boys wearing no shirts and Oakland A's hats groovin' out with glowsticks and spilling Red Bull and vodka on my brand new shoes.Dude, what's happened to me?

    "review": "This place can be a hit or miss depending on the music that night, but if you pay attention to the calendar and plan ahead, you'll have a great time.  Great place to go to grab a few drinks and enjoy some good music.  Beware of Friday nights if you don't like partying with a bunch of kids since it's 18+ those nights.  I randomly went there on a Friday night not knowing what to expect, and I felt like I was at a high school party.  The staff is great and friendly, especially the bartenders ;)  Just don't act like a dumb ass and you'll earn their respect, same as any bar you go.  There's also a foosball table upstairs!  Upstairs is a great place to lounge and enjoy the music.  you can sit on one of the many couches they have up there or chill by the balcony and watch the band play.  There's even an actual rickshaw upstairs that you can sit on (as long as you're not a fatty fat fatass)."

    "review": "Note: This review is more a review of a particular club night, maybe not on the establishment itself. In my experience the people that work at the Rickshaw Stop are great people, it just seems like its something about the Blow Up promoters that get under my skin and here is why: It was pretty dead earlier in the night but soon the trying-to-hard-hipsters started to make their way in. The DJ was moderately good the entire night but much to arrogant. Its hilarious watching these young girls hang on to these guys like rockstars. They didn't like the fact that I went up to them and asked them to play a song. Okay DJ's maybe you don't have to play it, maybe you don't want to play it, but don't be an ass a simple \"I'll try to get it in there\" would be awesome. Don't be a pretentious fuck just because I'm not a coked out whore asking to blow you.The more packed it got the more the temperature started to rise. It becomes unbearable by midnight. I was with a group of friends but I instantly noticed how people here are not as friendly as I have encountered at other places.It also took way to long to get a drink at the bar which surprised me because on other nights I would be served rather quickly.So, on Blow Up nights, the standard for this place is lowered. It becomes much to chaotic and the people who run it don't seem to care about the patrons. However, the crowd doesn't seem to care how they are treated for the most part either. The young kids, some probably with fake id's, are much more concerned with getting their picture taken making out with a stranger or with their left nipple hanging out.Maybe I am just much to old for this?I def want to attend a Cockblock or other gay/lez night and hopefully make up for the experience on this night."

We had pre paid for tickets and stood in line for just a few minutes. We walked in and could feel the excitement. The actual venue is not Schick or sophisticated. Its simplistic, retro, and very functional. You walk and see  a bar on your right. On the left stair stairs lead up to another bar and more seating. We quickly and easily got our drinks from the 1st floor bar. From that point we walked straight into a huge open room. One end was the stage. We made our way to the side of the room and were able to score a low table to put our drinks and jackets on (and later stand and dance on).The band rocked. Everyone was in a great mood. No one was worried about appearances or glam. Everyone here was mellow. I SSSOOO appreciated being able to go out in just a t shirt (a fancy one) jeans and chucks. We danced and jumped all around all night.Bottom line. Fair drink prices. Friendly Staff. No dress code. PRICELESS!!!"

I was plesantly surprized because I ended up having a good time. The whole place reminded me of High School! Not in a bad way, and no, not because I was a couple of years older than the majority of the folks there but because of the setup and decor. The venue set-up reminded me of a HS auditorium because it's a widely spacious dance floor that faces a stage. There's also an upstairs bar + balcony with vintage decorations like old school bikes and 80s looking tables. The crowd was dressed uber trendy. For some reason I noticed a lot of boys in fashionable hats. A good handful of girlies were wearing party or cocktail dresses. Their best threads for the friday night school dance. I keed, they all looked cute, I swear!Electric music. Heard some Kanye, 80s, brit pop, and other uppity beats while I was there. I love dancing to it! Anything goes, and ANYONE can dance to it. Folks were wyling out and letting themselves go to the beats. Good for them for enjoying themselves! Drinks weren't bad: $3 for beer and $6 for wine. Contrary to other reviews, the bartenders aren't jerks either. Don't think I'd come back by choice but Rickshaw is okay in my book."

It's so worth it just to listen to the dope DJ's spin some sick songs you've never heard.The only reason I don't give this place 5-stars is because it's an 18+ place.

No pictures, not even the ones they take of themselves will do Rickshaw justice. The lighting and visual was fantastic but I don't recommend getting too shit faced unless you wanna give the people waiting in line a good show (on stupidity). Been to a few clubs now, and have been to neko to go on stage but this time some stranger just pulled me up and I had a blast. AMAZING in comparison to Club X. Like my friend explained, trashy people go where trashy people are, regardless of the club. Blow up is lucky to have down to earth cool people. Had NO problem whatsoever about the space issue, I like that so it works for me. Guys were tasteful and I was never surprised with a random bulge humping my backside like Club X.DEFF going back. deff."

The place is rather drab looking when the seizure lights aren't all over the place, the bar is nice, and I quite adore the smoking room. Blow Up is always crazy packed and if you haven't seen the collections at American Apparel, then come here. $15 for 18+ and $10 for 21+. The music is pretty good, really crammed, and sweaty. I've started to really like going out dancing and this is place is reliably fun with the right group of friends."

I gotta get my dirtying dancing on sometime, but since there ain't no Havana Nights to speak of, Rickshaw does just fine.The crowd is pretty mixed here, but I always have a good time. It's always about the crowd of people you bring with you though. Just dance like no one's watching (save the photographers and video recording). They play some pretty sick mixes here so I've been here again and again.It would be accurate to say that this is a hipster hotspot on Blow Up nights, but it's not like you're out of place because I'm mos def not a hipster.

They offer my favorite pear cider there. 3. If you love live music- this is the place to go.4. The people are mixed, hip, and good-looking5.
