Events begin around 9, that's only 3 hours if you get there right when it opens. That's about $10/hour! Which is insane considering vibes don't get good until at least 1 hour after opening. The music was good but any positive feeling left all of my group when we realized we had overpaid for a 2 hour experience. Will not come back until they increase their hours and lower their prices!",

I had the Avocado Burger with fries and 2 beers (Cornerstone Blonde).  They tasted great.  I also liked the 4 TV hanging above the bar area, where you can watch several different sporting events.  When I went to the restroom, I noticed the concert area for the live shows.  Rather small for a concert area for my tastes, but if I ever see an event to my liking, I will try to come.   The staff was friendly and helpful, big shout out to them.  I will try to come at a later hour on my next trip here, just to see the larger crowd that come here.",

If I'm hungry, I go for the burger and fries (sweet potato is good too). They've got quite a few beers on tap and some ciders too, and the last time we were here, there was a promo happening for a tequila company so we got some free shots! Can't speak for any mixed cocktails though - I've always gotten beer or cider. If there's a game on, folks do stop in to enjoy them on several of the screens lining the walls. Great spot for groups! Service is usually pretty smooth and friendly, but we tend to nosh early and haven't experienced super slammed bartenders or servers. There's also a bar at the music hall, and a  mezzanine level to sit and watch the show from if you don't want standing room only on the main floor.",

As far as restaurant/bar/outside seating, I also really enjoy this spot! The bartenders have always been on point, super engaging and speedy. Their drinks update regularly and they're always strong and tasty. Their beer menu is extensive and impressive. There are a lot of TVs and they always play the games! The outside seating is also enjoyable. It's a fun vibey yet low key place. I am definitely biased cause I met my boyfriend here two years ago so it has a special place in my heart.",

To solve this issue, glasses guy in charge put the tall guy in the VIP area?? Then, anyone who stood near dancing wife got assaulted. No one will do anything about it. But I kept getting bumped into by the people fighting, security, and staff. We left before the band went on. I'm so disappointed I could die. I think this so what happens when a venue serves alcohol for 2.5+ hours before the band goes on and has bad security and people in charge who are dumb. The last time I saw a comedy show here I thought it was a really weird venue but it was seated with cheap fold out chairs and uncomfortable wobbly stools. Bad vibes 100%z",

I was left standing waiting to order while the bartenders talked for a few minutes and looked at me as though I was inconveniencing them.  When one of them finally came over to me they acted annoyed and like they did not want me there.  I wish the staff was nicer because I live around the corner and would come here on the regular but I will take my business to other places for now and maybe try again in a year or two.",

        "ReviewContent": "As a music venue, this location is fire, right next to a bookshop and many other glorious Berkeley food options. Their AC/ventilation was killer (which is crucial for a hardcore concert in August) and the setup was simultaneously intimate but spacious and professional. Things were kept super tidy and welcoming in the concert space and the setup just worked. Not to mention, the show (Hail the Sun) was absolutely phenomenal with regards to lighting and sound. The only thing that lost this sick venue a star was the kinda crappy service from specifically the venue area staff. The bartenders and restaurant hosts were awesome, but the guys dealing with ticketing and admission were short, snarky, and not super helpful while my group had a minor ticketing scanning complication. We were pointed in three different places before getting the problem sorted by manually checking the attendant list (lol). They also didn't have bag checks/detectors at the door but that wasn't a concern (esp. given there was security present in the venue during the show), just an fyi for others. Ultimately, this place is a solid venue that I'm looking forward to revisiting one day.",

The first positive point is that the place is cavernous, as several other reviewers have stressed.  If you come with a group and camp out at one of the tables, you'll have plenty of room to stretch and lots of opportunities to walk around.  The second is that the beer list is extensive and really interesting.  There were about four or five Christmas ales this week, plenty of cloudy IPAs, a bunch of sours, etc., etc.  If you want to taste a beer or two before ordering your pint, no problem.The people who work here seemed awful nice to me.  I absolutely wanted to point that out.On the negative side: The kitchen closes at 7PM on some weeknights, even though the bar is in principle open until midnight.  Don't come looking for food unless you're sure that it'll be available.  The food menu is A-OK, but really nothing special.  I ordered an All-American Burger and was only vaguely satisfied with it -- it was cooked more than I had specified and didn't have all that much taste.  The food here takes a back seat to everything else.  That's fine if you're coming by to watch some sports on the TV and to knock back some excellent beer, but I don't see any Michelin stars on the horizon.",

What time does the music usually start and what's good on the menu? I don't know was the answer and order down there was the rest of the reply. I was confused but walked on down to the middle of the bar where it looked like someone was bartending. I couldn't figure out where a menu was so I picked up a \"taped\" menu but accident ripped it off the bar! Omg so embarrassing sorry I said. The bartender said \"Yeah. That's on there for a reason\", finally I got someone's attention! Yay ! I continued to apologize. But by the time I decided on what food to eat the bartender was walking outside of the bar with tape and scooted me over to retape the menu. WTF.... He was annoyed and I was still confused. There are just so many ways to be nice. Choose one.   A new bartender came to help. I asked about beer because it's a brewery I thought, she had no idea what dark beers were on tap.

I cannot recommend this venue to anyone due to their unprofessional behavior.  It would be nice if they saw this review and responded to me but somehow I doubt it.",

I'm a sucker for sweet potato fries and these are top five, they gotta be. Maybe I'm trippin' but that price had me dumbfounded because if I put that amount of food on a plate ( or attempted to ) I'd be out over 100 bucks and would likely fail in the taste department. Best bang for your buck pre dinner, pre concert, pre party -whatever. I can't wait to find any excuse to return ASAP.",

        "ReviewContent": "My partner and I Have really enjoyed coming to this place we are both bay are natives and out all the places in the Berkeley/ Oakland area we always seemed to make our way back to corner stone. HOWEVER since the pandemic there has been less staff attending to customers. We understand that maybe on a Saturday night when it's busy it'll take a minute until someone notices that we're at the bar and is ready to take our order. Most of the time we go is during the week day when it is slower. We have gone there when there is maybe two bartenders at the bar and we are the only customers there. It has happened several times we will arrive sit down at the bar which would be completely empty except for the bartenders And it will take them 15 to 20 minutes to even greet us or acknowledge that they see us. A lot of the times will have to flag someone down or ask if we can get service. They don't really seem to want to help anyone. And if they do they seem to be in a rush and not really want to help the customer. For the most part service has declined a lot in the past two years. Aside from the fact that they don't have enough staff,  the little staff they do have are rude and never seem to want to help anyone. It is unfortunate because my partner and I really enjoy that place and we work not too far away so it's very convenient. But as of lately haven't been so motivated to return because of the horrible customer service. Sad because this place use to be great, hope something can be done soon.",

This restaurant is apart of a 3 store franchise but the other two places are permanently closed. One would think resources would be put into this place . No one greets you when you walk in, they usually  have 1-2 bartenders , no waiters or greeters . Just always short staffed , there is usually a line at the Bar to get food or drinks but it's not really organized or uniform. It sucks because this is one of our favorite spots . We live and work around the area so this was our go to ----- service was so bad we went to Pappys - which is the same owners but Pappys is closed permanently . This place has the potential to be and stay as #1 bar , food, music venue but there needs to be a major step up in customer service.. cornerstone gets busy so if it is busy , forget about.....Getting a food or drink",

We waited a few minutes at the front where a host/hostess would be but weren't acknowledged, we realized the was a line in front of the bar and that was it.Other than that we enjoyed a delicious burger, wings and beer before the show.The venue is small but feels big and has a cool balcony area.

I ordered the wings & my husband the burger, the service was fast & friendly & the food was delicious. You order both food & drink at the bar, which was kind of confusing because there wasn't really any instruction when you enter; we stood at the entrance by what looked like where a host would be standing & noticed no one acknowledged us we saw a line at the bar & decided to follow the crowd. The venue was great! Clean & small. My husband & I went up to the balcony, where they had stools to sit. They had a full bar inside the concert venue with beer & liquor with limited cocktail availability. My husband & I ordered a mojito & old fashioned and had to go into the bar in the restaurant to get those drinks as they don't have the ingredients inside the venue.

The decor is pretty sparse and the place fees empty once the show has begun, I'd imagine on other nights the main room fills up more.Cool and helpful staff, the prices for everything are ok, parking is pretty bad as you'd expect in downtown berk but you can park on the street and expect to only have to walk about ten minutes. Solid selection of beer.Keep walking to the back and you'll find the entrance to the venue - it's surprisingly large, has its own bar, cool stage with a full lineup for the month, great crowd.

If you come during the day, chances are that Justin will be your bartender. He is a very cool (and personable) dude that knows his beers and cocktails He will recommend something to you with confidence based on your palette. He will even let you have a small taste of what's on tap just to be sure. Justin isn't a big IPA drinker; however, he has recommended a plethora of IPAs for me that are now considered my favorites. Yep, I am primarily an IPA beer drinker; however, I have learned to appreciate other drinks like the Old Fashioned and Vodka Martinis for the days that I want to change things up (thanks to Justin and Cornerstone). RJ (the beer selector/buyer), Gio, Lee, and the rest of the staff are amazing as well. Come by and visit for the music, drinks, and food.

Looking through my photos, I'm going to review places where I've been, in reverse order. First up is Cornerstone, and I have to say that I'm proud of this photo. A basket of fries and pint of Death & Taxes, sitting on my table in the evening light, took on the gravity and artistry of a masterwork by Vermeer or Degas. Anyhoo, after a solitary start with my beer and fries, it ended up being a big group - a post-lockdown work reunion - and I think everyone was pretty happy with their night. I like Cornerstone because it's one of those bars where you're more likely to mix with more people (within your own group or randos) rather than somewhere like Jupiter where people tend to not leave their seats. Not that I don't love Jupiter - the two places are similar in some ways but Cornerstone adds a level of chaos (but in a good way!). Good selection of beer and food, spacious and pretty - what more do you want?I'm also giving the Cornerstone 3.5 out of 5 \"Green Stars\" for social and environmental impact, based on this:* Large emphasis on local draft beer, which is so much better than packaged beer from afar.* On this visit, the staff ran out of clean glasses and switched to plastic cups. Generally that doesn't happen but hopefully it won't become a trend.* The food menu caters well for vegetarians and fairly well for vegans.* No info is provided on social and environmental impact (e.g., food sourcing, staff benefits, etc.)* According to Glassdoor, a server/bartender earns around $16/hr plus around $10/hr in tips.",

This spot was perfect for what we were looking for and served up some burgers and appetizers. They had an assortment of beers on tap as well.I ordered the barbecue bacon burger and my gf had the avovado burger .  We also ordered some  wings for appetizers. The wings came out and I must I was very disappointed. They were on the smaller size and just a huge miss.But the burgers were on hit and so were the thin cut fries. Burgers were very filling and served ona sesame bun. My barbecue burger had your standard tomatoe, pickle, lettuce, and onion between two buns but the bacon and sweet tasting barbecue sauce were on hit.Cornerstone is also a concert venue spot just about every weekend. So check out their concert listing. Be prepared to show your vaccine card upon entering or you won't be able to dine at the tables. Another thing, to order anything we had to make line and put in our order at the front counter. No biggie, the line went fairly quick. Dining area is very spacious and there's even a back patio with a fire grill to enjoy.",

There were only 2 servers walking around, both were maskless, didn't say a word to us or ask if we needed anything. We walked up to the bar to order our drinks and a slice of cake.Drinks were great as usual, but as soon as I took that first bite of the cake I felt something plasticky. We showed the server the piece of plastic (picture attached), she didn't say much, took the cake back and sent out another slice.We've definitely had better experiences here before COVID, still shocked that neither of the servers were wearing masks or gloves.

I swear we've waited at least an hour and a half in line. Beware: There are security guards that will try to hit on you. My boyfriend was not having it.

There's live music with DJs (yes they play all the bangers. from throwbacks to new music. it's lit). There's high tables, booths, and an outdoor patio.I couldn't tell you much about the day time scene or the food.

My friend recommended Cornerstone. I called ahead to get an idea of the vibe and spoke to a gentleman named Mendoza. He told us he would take care of us and he did. We showed up right before the time we were told it would get crowded. We had a table outside near the fire pits, in ear shot of the DJ. It was awesome. The food was great, drinks were yummy and strong ( for me but I'm a cheap date My husband said they were perfect). Delicious German beer that my husband loved. Staff came around often to check on guests. As the night went on the crowds got bigger. All wearing masks. I'm glad we stayed outside, inside was a bit too crowded for me as the night went on inside, but outside remained perfect. But it made me happy to see people dancing inside. I was worried this was another club like atmosphere full of 20-30somethings and we would look out of place, but not at all. People of all ages were present ( we are in our 40's). The DJ played music from 90's Era to present..Bar tenders were attentive. It was all around great business. Can't wait to go back. We were told live music will begin again soon.

Also got a lot of strange looks from what seemed to be the \"regulars\" there - just a strange/judge mental vibe that is difficult to describe. Overall not a great experience and won't be back again!",

They offer both cocktails and beers, albeit somewhat of a limited draft list. For the beers, they offer both 10oz, 16oz, and pitchers that were well-priced. Cocktails were available for about $10. You can also try ordering cocktails off-the-menu, but they weren't able to make some of our requests as they have limited mixing ingredients.Saw a table next to us who ordered a burger that definitely had me salivating and would need to try it next time I'm here.",

It is conveniently located near BART, has an attached restaurant for ease of eating, and it's small for a close view of the artists playing. Food: I've gotten the vegetarian tenders, brussel sprouts, fries, the vegetarian shepherd's pie, and the big ass chocolate cake. All of which have been pretty good food at reasonable prices. I would recommend any of it. Their beer and cider selection is also pretty decent. My friends also love the apple berry tart here. Service:Each time I've come, the servers and staff have always been super nice to interact with. Depending on the time of day, it is either self seat or you see the hostess. TL;DR - great music venue in Berkeley with a lovely attached restaurant",

Props to the place for extending their hospitality for a fundraiser, but the concert venue itself has very little seating. If you're looking to sit, you should head upstairs where there are bar stools and a couple couches. You may need to barter or battle for them.Since my preferred adult beverage is bourbon, there was little choice at the bar, but it was a decent pour and the bartenders were friendly despite being slammed by the large crowd.",

It took a while to get acknowledged once we were seated - the staff was slammed pre-show, so we  were starting to look at where else we might eat when Marissa came up and apologized for the wait.  From then on things went well - service from that point on was excellent. I had  ribs.  I would have liked a less sweet sauce but that's a matter of taste- the ribs were cooked perfectly.  Our beers were high-quality drafts and the lines were clean.  I liked the Cole slaw that came with my ribs.  More of a vinegar than mayo dressing.My partner really liked her tri-tip with French dip sandwich and her sweet potato fries were really tasty.The place feels impersonal and sterile - it's a big room, but I'd definitely return.  As a live music venue- sound was pretty good and the room is a nice size.  Big enough to hold a fair number of people but nobody is very far from the stage.  I'd definitely come back to see other acts there.",

        "ReviewContent": "Last night was our first time coming here.  We decided to grab a bite to eat before our friends went on stage with their band.  Our server was OK.  She brought us menus within a minute of us sitting down and took our order quickly.  After our food came out (brought out by someone else), she was a little hard to flag down but we were not neglected.  Our food came out less than 5 minutes after we ordered which was surprising.  We shared Brussels sprouts that came with a *delicious* dipping sauce.  The sprouts arrived piping hot and perfectly cooked.  They were excellent and the highlight of what we ordered. The pretzel was OK.  There wasn't a lot of flavor (was missing the salt) but it was soft and fresh.  The olives were good but the serving was enormous for 2 people.  The prosciutto was good, came with mustards, cornichon pickles and a few slices of bread.  The prosciutto was sliced thicker than I like but it was good.   I love the vibe of this place.  It was easy to walk around and mingle with others we knew there.  The food was good.  The beer was flowing.  The concert we came to see was good.  It was $5 cash to get in.  Between Mr and myself, we had $7 in cash and the girl smiled and waved us in.  Thank you!  The sound was good although the vocals were really hard to hear.  This was a fun place and we will come back again.  It would be a fun place to come to celebrate a birthday with a group or even come for a casual date night.",

I had to attend another concert the same night at almost the same time so this was my second stop for the night.  I decided to park my car near Cornerstone and take Uber to the first concert and Uber back to Cornerstone so I wouldn't have to find parking.I was lucky to find a parking spot about 1/2 a block away on Shattuck!  Talk about Parking Karma!  Then when I came back on Uber to Cornerstone, I went to the box office on Durant and the doors were locked and the box office was closed at 11 pm!  The sign on the box office said to enter the concert venue through the restaurant.  The host at the restaurant tried to contact the concert venue but no one answered so he finally decided to let me walk through to the concert venue but put a wristband on me to indicate I was of drinking age, thank you very much!Unfortunately, time was running out and I just wanted to watch my friends perform so at the entrance to the concert venue, I was told there was only 30 minutes left to the show and that they would only charge me $10.  Originally the cover charge was $15 at the door and $12 in advance but when you added the fees, it would cost $16.72, more than the door price.  So I got to see the last hour of my friends' performance and the concert venue was intimate and there was room for dancing!  It was standing room only; however, I didn't mind.  I went straight up to the front to take photos and videos!  There's a bar in the rear but since the show was already on, I didn't get a chance to try any of their beers.  But I hope to the next time I'm here!  The sound system was awesome and my friends looked great on that ginormous stage!",

Actually, it reminds me of the Hollywood venue in the CHiPs episode in which Ponch is the singer in a new-wave band, and there's a punk band that's up to no good, because in the world of CHiPs, disco and new wave are good, but punk is bad.My dear friend Brenda (RIP) and I had tickets to see Agent Orange here in 2017, but she died a few weeks before the show.  I went with my brother, and it was emotional for many reasons.  It was a great show, and we came to see the English Beat the following year, and that show was even better.The floor is where all the action is, but the view from upstairs is pretty good, and you're not that far from the stage.  I was surprised that bands as big as Agent Orange and the English Beat still played in venues this small, but I'm glad they do.If someone offers you a free ticket to see someone here, take it.  Sharpen your elbows, be prepared to pay cash for old-school T-shirts and CDs, and enjoy yourself.  Don't get drunk and start a fight.  I saw someone do that during a song.  That was a faux pas.",

I decided to check this local Berkeley bar out with a few friends to see how it changed. I love it! The bar fits the demographic as it caters to the 21+ UC Berkeley crowd roaming around to find a good place to watch the Cal Bears. Booming with energy I decided to take a seat at the very large bar and knock back a couple of cocktails. I went with the Moscow Mule which is one of my favorites. It was strong but just what I needed. You can always ask a bar tender to add more mixer to a drink but you can't always get them to make it stronger. So I appreciated the kick! Lined with flat screen tv's, colorful bar and spacious seating it was right what we needed. If you're in the downtown Berkeley area and you want a good sports bar this is a cool place to hangout",

Kidding...kidding? This used to be a great place that I used to go play pool at. Now...it's a great selection of an inexpensive, hipster, ambient  Plentiful plethora of food, drinks, and music. I have come to see a bunch of punk rock shows here, and I do love reggae so I might be back for that... One thing I have to say is that the sound here is top notch 1 of the best sound systems I have ever listened too.  They have a spacious bar and various screens so you can find yourself coming chillin for sporting events and sleek and sexy patio seating that's in the back, I'd reccomended this place for groups.  One of my friends had his bachelor party start here and we had a great time.... I don't quite remember when we finished. Anyways if you're stopping by at the bookstore or just craving a good night cap this is the place to be.  I have to come back and try their food.",

One friend ordered a vodka cranberry from the female bartender behind the bar, she gave us back a glass of pure cranberry juice (you could tell just from looking at it). We all took sips and said this is definitely just pure cranberry juice. My friend politely asked the bartender who made it if she maybe forgot to add the shot of alcohol into it and the bartender snapped back \"i put an ounce and a half in it\". I took the drink over to the guy bartender with a goatee and asked him to try it, he then confirmed that it definitely was just pure cranberry juice, and he made us a new one.",

        "ReviewContent": "I had a very bad experience at Cornerstone during a private event. My friend and I, who are both guys, were using the restroom and we entered the same stall as we both just needed to pee and the bathroom was very crowded. As we left the stall after going pee, a man who was in a regular black T-shirt grabbed my friend by the shoulder and accused us of doing drugs or having sex in the bathroom. We had only been in there for about 30 seconds and were completely sober. We were not aware that you could not go into a stall together. He told us that he worked there and that we needed to leave after asking us if we were \"gay or something.\"  I told him that I wanted to speak to a manager because the way we were being treated was very wrong. Me and my friend are not gay, however there would be nothing wrong with it if we were. We waited for 20 minutes until the manager can over to see us. Her name was Susan or Suzanne. She refused to provide me with her last name so that I could follow up about this issue but instead told me I could talk to her attorney. I asked for her attorneys contact info or name and she refused to provide it. This is just bad business to not be open with the customer. She then instructed the security guards \"that they need to leave\" and before I knew it I was being grabbed by the neck and shoulders by a huge security guard and roughly dragged. One of my shoes came off during this and my ankle was twisted. I had not said anything rude, and was just trying to work out the situation in a calm way. I was completely sober as I am not 21 and my friend and I were treated with blatant disrespect and a lack of safety sense. It was completely uncalled for to kick us out because we might have been \"gay or something\" and then to have security drag us out. If you want to be treated with respect or equality do not go to cornerstone in Berkeley. There are plenty of better clubs and restaurants that treat their customers with basic dignity.",

One can choose to sit outside, on a couch, at the bar, many places to sit.  The concert area was large enough to dance, but not to big and we could see the performance up close. They don't have chairs in the concert area, well, about 4 tables and a few high chairs throughout.  I think a few more chairs and tables downstairs would be a good idea.  Also we almost missed the main act because our tickets said 8:30.  But, the headliner was at 10:30, we were just about to leave when we saw a sign telling us the Wailers are performing at 10:30.

My favorite was the vegetarian chicken tenders which came with three different types of dipping sauces (chipotle, barbecue, and ranch). They were some of the best tasting fake chicken that I've ever tried. The brussel sprouts, cheese board and pork belly nachos were also really yummy! I decided to try out the tofu and avocado sandwich for my main meal, and I was not disappointed. The tofu was well-seasoned and had a great chewy tofu texture. I was really impressed that this place had an all-veggie main course that wasn't just a veggie burger. I'd definitely come back here for drinks, food, live music or corn hole!!",

It was super empty on a Monday afternoon which was great, and our group was able to get seated at a large high table. There is a large beer selection which everyone enjoyed, and everyone was able to get something that they enjoyed. I shared the Kale & Butternut Squash Salad and the Cornerstone Burger. I definitely would have gotten tired of the flavor of both dishes if I had to eat the whole thing, so I'm satisfied with going half and half. The salad was very refreshing and I love the mix of all the veggies (kale, romaine, edamame, cauliflower) and the additions of the goat cheese, almond and squash were great. Everything was diced up so every bite included all of these items. The burger was heavy but delicious. The mac 'n cheese was a great addition and helped lessen the smoky and barbecue flavor of the burger. It looks like there is live music that happens which I wish was going on, there is corn hole to play, lots of TVs playing different games, and it is located in a convenient spot in Berkeley! Once the food was dropped off at our table, the waiter never came to check in on us so waters weren't refilled and we had to flag someone down to get more condiments (hot sauce, ranch. etc.). Overall, great graduation celebration place!",

Plenty of beers to choose from and the fact that we could do pitchers was awesome! Great place, wouldn't mind coming to watch a show here too....save that for next time!",

The drinks were horrible, and they up-ed the price on my second drink. Who does that?",

        "ReviewContent": "We met up with a group of friends and everyone was having a great time by the time I got there. I ordered the salad with chicken breast and a vinaigrette dressing, I also ordered the Brussels sprouts. To quench my thirst I ordered an iced tea no sweetener. The iced tea was bold, cold and so refreshing. The chicken was cooked perfectly, not too dry and the serving size was average. I was especially hungry that night so I ordered a second serving of chicken. The extra serving seemed to do the trick in satisfying my growling gut. The Brussels sprouts were not hard and raw, they were cooked so they were soft but not mushy. The aioli dressing served on the side (thank goodness it was on the side or I would have eaten it all) was not over spiced, and rich with flavor. From the looks of the empty plates on the table I don't think there was a complaint by anyone as they were all scraped and almost appeared to be licked clean. The atmosphere was so inviting and the fire pits were a blaze whole there was laughter echoing throughout the back patio. It wasn't too chilly out back and a light sweater kept me totally comfortable.I am not a beer drinker myself, but the people that I was there with had great things to say and were trying the selections that sounded interesting to them. The smiling faces were a clue that this was a great time. I can't wait to go back the next time. Hopefully they have an apple cider or something that I can try. Looking forward to my trip back. Thank you Cornerstone. We will be back soon.",

The music area is pretty small making what would either be a somewhat intimate venue or a crowded shitshow. When there isn't concert going on, I think you can also enjoy that space with cornhole and ping pong.I wouldn't get the meatball again, the salads are overpriced but good.

There typically aren't too many students here. This is owned by the same people as Pappy's. It's honestly not a bad bar at all but I have to rate it relative to the other bars in the area (specifically in the Telegraph/Durant area, which includes Raleigh's, Tap Haus and Kips).

Once we sat down, we were able to view the selection of drinks they had posted, but no food menus given to us yet. I can see that there were a total of 8 people working the floor that night (3 at the bar and 5 on the floor). I can see the bar being busy with serving drinks, but the amount of time it took for me to receive a menu was ridiculous. I waited 10 minutes until I flagged someone down for a menu (they said they'll come back to me; never did). Another 5 minutes to realize the person I flagged down is nowhere to be seen. Another 5 minutes to order a drink from the bar and then they helped me flag down someone to hand me some food menus. Then another 10 minutes to flag someone down to order food. I was keeping track of the time because there was a game that night. No offense, but that was a lot of work for someone paying for service...I ordered the chicken pot pie that night and a burger. Both items were delicious, especially the pot pie. I was highly impressed by how flakey the crust was. For the burger, the pickles were phenomenal!

On the second level they have ping pong tables, a stage for bands to play and small standing tables for you to stand and enjoy your drink. This bar seems very college friendly especially with the games they have. The reason this place wasn't 5 stars for me is because they checked my id numerous times (walking in, the bar, and then some random guy outside to give me a wrist band of some sort). Not sure what the wrist band was for but who knows?! Another thing I didn't like was it was Friday night around 10:30 when we arrived and this place closed 30 minutes later at 11pm! What kind of bar closes at 11pm in Berkeley on a Friday night?! I just found it so odd. It's like the guys who were working (by the way they were all males) just wanted to close up just so they can get their Friday night started.

We were all impressed with their extensive menu of really interesting food options, beer on tap, great wines and signature cocktails too! Loved building my own cheeseboard that included roasted cauliflower and brussel sprouts, meats and cheeses, baked olives and delicious aioli's to dip our homemade ciabatta and veggies in! Such a great option for vegetarians! (Minus the meat option of course!) : ) Since there were 5 of us we ordered an array of many different dishes that we all got to sample and that were all great in their own right! Grilled Tofu & Avocado Sandwich, Grilled Meatloaf sandwich, Mac n cheese, Grilled Sausage board, Chicken Pot Pie, French Fries, Stuffed Deviled Eggs, Roasted nuts and a delicious bowl of their Roasted Tomato soup! Yes, we overindulged but the good thing is this Elite Yelper can honestly report that all of the food listed above in this review was flavorful and delicious! I tasted everything!

The show was great (despite starting 40 minutes after the show was advertised to begin) and I liked the venue enough, but this review is for the restaurant.Heads up, the service here on a Thursday night was horrendous. Look at my other reviews - I am not a big complainer about service - I know people get busy! - but our waitress was definitely not overloaded. I saw her standing around chatting with her co-workers several times while I was there. It was extremely difficult to get her attention.I ordered a cocktail and my dinner at the same time. For the record, I got the Grilled Chicken Club, which was actually pretty decent and I would order it again. We also got the big slice of chocolate cake which was tasty, albeit VERY dense, but you definitely get your chocolate fix.However, my drink didn't come at all, and once our food was served, I asked where our drinks were. The waitress looked confused, left for several more minutes, and came back and said it was her mistake. She finally brought our drinks out a bit later. She said something about comping our drinks due to her mistake, which I thought was the right thing to do.I had to go out of my way to flag her down every time I wanted to order another drink or ask for dessert, even when she walked by our table several times. It made me feel really weird and stupid. I've never had to try so hard to spend more money at a restaurant.When we got our bill, I noticed that she only comped my sister's drink, which was a $3 diet Coke. I was charged for all three drinks I ordered. I don't ask for special treatment or anything, but the service was so bad that this kind of upset me. I was honestly expecting her to take one of my drinks off for the mishap.Overall, I would definitely go back to the venue for another show, but there's no way in hell I would sit down for a meal again. There are TONS of amazing options for dinner close to the venue and I would highly recommend supporting one of those businesses rather than going to the Cornerstone restaurant. Maybe I just got a bad waitress or I got someone on a bad day, but it was enough to turn me off forever.",

        "ReviewContent": "Went to a concert here last night, called Wednesday at 12:41 pm to make a reservation for Thursday evening for the dining room at 7 pm as the show started around 8pm, and the headliners would be in around 9:40pm. Reservation was confirmed for 7pm on 12/13 by a younger man on the phone who asked me to leave my phone number in case anything changes. We arrived and were told that a private party had booked the event. I was confused because I looked back through my phone and no one had called to tell me that. A younger blonde woman basically told us \"too bad\" and turned us away because no one had written anything down. She was completely rude and from having worked in the restaurant industry, she should not have be working there just based on that encounter. Unbelievable. It was too late to find another location close to the venue to eat and they do not serve food at the bar. Very disappointed, it ruined my husbands birthday dinner. Only good thing was the music and we will make sure to see them elsewhere from now on. Awful Service.",

Today the consistency went down the drain at the bar, our problem? It took 28 mins to order food at the bar with only a handful of customers but the manager was busy doing tastings and the girl with the blond hair was too busy chatting with male customers we sat down, another guy walked in way after us and got service right away!!! We have never experienced this ever! We were about to walk out and she approached, we stay as is cold and rainy and we didn't want to go anywhere else. We finally get some drinks...we are hungry, no menus she is at the other side of the back with other coworkers and talking to some guys at the other end...we are like really ?we had to wait another 15-18 mins and my friend went down and ask her if we could order food. we got food as we are eating at the bar enjoying the food and finally enjoying our selfs....some guys as he is leaving asked her if she wants tacos later...her reply was; oh no I went to the doctors today and I almost vomited when I was told I was over weight and trust me she is not over weight if anything she could use to eat a little more...my eyes opened wide as the customer right inform of her it is a little chubby and he look at her and than looked down.that's something oh don't say in front of customers that are eating. I am sorry  and what's crazy is the bar  manager all they do is mess around and flirt instead of managing what employers are doing. Tonight was a waste of time and money plus here is our friend from NYC so much for showing \"our favorite spot\" So if you are a guy who is not a ten don't bother while she is bartending. Just no happy with the experience today",

The first time I came here was to see Said the Sky and was surprised that they had such a broad selection of craft beer to choose from next to their dancing arena.The stage set up is next door to the restaurant and craft beer area of the place and they make you put your alcohol in a plastic cup to go to the dancing area. Most recently, I've been coming here for their craft beers! They have a wide selection and there's usually something new here on tap whenever I come back. The beer prices are usually range between $6-$13. The waiting staff are super friendly, nice, and give good beer recommendations! If you're here for the food and you're under 21, they check ID's around 9:30-10PM. I would recommend trying out the sours here! I haven't been disappointed with any of sours that I've tried!",

So many people talking made the first artist cut his set short. The second band played loudly enough that they weren't bothered by the noise but trying to listen to the music with people carrying on loud conversations all around me was frustrating and distracting. I don't understand why people buy tickets to see music and then carry on as if they are in their living rooms listening to their stereo. Perhaps they should stay home and do just that instead of ruining an evening of fine music for everyone else. I would suggest that the management put up signs at the entrance asking people to be respectful of the musicians and other people who came to hear the music. Making an announcement before the music begins would also be helpful.",

        "ReviewContent": "Really cool new spot in Berkeley. Half of it is a brewery restaurant and the other half is a concert venue. The interior of the brewery is really large and spacious with high ceilings, exposed brick, and large seating areas really good for groups. There's also a nice outside area with fire pits. They have an extensive menu with some really interesting beers, some I haven't even heard of before, for example we tried a cider made from pluot fruits. They also have a decent sized food menu consisting of apps, burgers, sandwiches, etc. From their menu it looks like charcuterie is also a thing here, although we didn't try it. The food was quite good, nothing amazing, but up to the standard of more high end breweries these days. The venue is adjacent to the brewery. It has a separate entrance outside although once you're in, there is a doorway to go in between the two. It's a moderately sized club room, maybe fits around 500 people. The sound system in there is really clear and the stage is high enough that you have a good view of the bands playing from pretty much every part of the room. Definitely all makes for a great night out to grab some beer or food before/after an awesome show.",

The food choices are so amazing it was hard to decide. I got the Brussels sprouts then the nachos but subbed chicken instead of pork belly. They have community like tables which aren't my thing so we sat at the bar instead. The venues awesome also. It has a small staircase that goes into the venue. So you could have dinner then the doors opened at 7:30 and you could go in. It has an upstairs so you can watch from above. That's what we did. It's a nice view. Standing only. No seats. Has a small bar at the back of the venue. Had a blast. We will be back. We ubered In so idk how parking is or if there is any. It's a great time for a small price. THe tickets  presale were like $24.

We arrived about 30 minutes before the show started and were directed to the back of the restaurant and up a flight of stairs to the music venue. There weren't too many people in there so we decided to explore a bit. We ordered some beers at the bar and took a seat on the outdoor patio area and then inside on some couch style seating. Once we were ready to head back in, we walked back up the stairs for the show. The sound was alright, but we had a blast regardless - so much so that I lost my voice the next day. The best part was meeting Travis at the end of the concert. He came out to sign some autographs and take a few photos by the merch table in the back of the hall. Hope to be back soon!",

        "ReviewContent": "Updating my review to reflect service on a Friday night ~7:30. I came back with my doggy and was offered a water bowl, and was seen by a server within 5 minutes of sitting down outside. I ordered my own food (big ass chocolate cake and a house coffee) and a side of bacon for my dog, and my server (Robert) offered a plate of dog biscuits and double checked that I still wanted the bacon. He came by probably four times throughout my meal to make sure that I had everything I needed. The patio area is so lovely. They had two cozy fire pits going around some benches, a perfect area for a group of people who are just having some drinks, but the heat reaches to the tables too so it isn't too cold at night. I left my apartment wishing I'd brought a jacket, but felt totally comfortable sitting outside.I came just for dessert this time, and the chocolate cake was SO good. It has layers of moist cake and fudgy chocolate ganache and can easily be shared between two people, even on an empty stomach. The coffee was lukewarm when I got it, so I'm not sure if it had been sitting out for a bit because I'd had the cake for maybe ten minutes already before the coffee and bacon came, but that meant that I could drink it immediately without having to wait for it to cool down. Robert also made an extra trip to bring me out some cream, sugar, and an extra spoon for my coffee. All in all, I love the environment at Cornerstone. Many dog-friendly places in Berkeley serve only beer and have cramped patios with limited to no heat, which is an unpleasant experience for both humans and dogs and makes me anxious about my big guy being a pest. At Cornerstone, everyone wants to give him attention, and there is plenty of room for us to sit without bothering other people. We will definitely make this our regular weekend hangout.",

        "ReviewContent": "Our family and friends came in as a party of 20 for my Mother in Law's 60th birthday earlier this month. My husband and I had high expectations because of the Yelp reviews and pictures, plus the idea of so many draft beers. Our server was polite, and the hostess was courteous when it came to seating because we had children with us, and needed a booth- but she was able to still keep such a large party together. Unfortunately that was the best part of our experience.  I was incredibly disappointed with my sandwich, a Meatloaf Melt, it was super dry and lacked flavor. Our Charcuterie plate was not what we ordered, there was a questionable mystery meat and it was definitely not what we ordered, the macaroni and cheese balls app was like something you'd buy frozen and just reheated. When we first arrived, our server offered to return with a Happy Hour Menu, then came back telling us that there was no Friday Happy Hour, she forgot. A man from our party asked two employees the same question about a beer and was told both times that they didn't know the answer. So instead of saying they'd check on it, or go get an answer for him, like a good employee would be trained to do, they just walked away. My Father in Law pre purchased tickets for the show for that night, this is the whole reason we were there. We had five kids 8 and under with us, it was an all age show. Or party was the first to enter the entertainment area, there was only five other people in there, not including the two bartenders- when a bartender told my Sister in Law that we needed to control our \"rambunctious kids,\" because they were, \"receiving multiple complaints.\" So this means that the other customers waiting for the show to start- that we were talking to- and even talked to about the show and the kids- somehow complained. I will never return. Our family spent a lot of money and the only good part was the show that we could have seen for free closer to home, but thought this would be a fun experience.",

My group of friends and I were taken to a table and were given drink menus, but we were wondering: WHERE IS THE CONCERT?!We had no idea where it was taking place until one of our friends started walking around and all of a sudden saw another room with two open doors and staircases to get into the music venue.So minus -2 stars for that, we weren't exactly told where the concert would be taking place even though we told our host that we were here for the concert and she didn't really direct us anywhere. :(It's a nice small tiny venue, great for intimate concerts!

At the front door of the restaurant, we were told that \"yes, I see your reservation, but you weren't assigned a table, so you'll have to stand in line\". We ended up bypassing the hostess and asked another waitstaff person to help us get a table (which she did). So that worked out, but was odd. We only stayed for about 7 songs of the bands, they were great players, but who ever was mixing had the kick drum and bass turned up so high that you could barely hear the singers, synths or guitars and the volume level was painful. You can rock a house without having to damage people's eardrums. Sometimes I couldn't even tell what key the band was in, because all of the harmonic instruments were so burried. This place deserves a better soundman.",

We were able to ask for some samples before deciding on what drink to get. I had one of their chocolate beers if I recalled correctly...super good! The atmosphere was super chill and spacious! Not so crowded around the time we went and I believe it was a Friday night? We headed over here after dinner so we were all pretty full...which was upsetting because they had a lot of foods on their menu that sounded good to snack on. Maybe next time when I decide to come back I will definitely save some room to order the food on their menu! They have some bands that play too, I believe! Really fun and you can just dance around. Overall, I highly recommend coming here for a night out with friends without having to worry about being too crowded with other people. Their place is huge!",

I am always down to dive into a big pile of ooey, gooey nachos.I came here with a friend around 9:00pm. When we walked into the restaurant, there was a sign that said to seat ourselves, so we walked over to a comfortable booth and got ourselves situated. And... we wait....And... we waited some more...And... we waited even longer...For about 30 minutes we waited, in a near empty restaurant (there were only 2 other groups sitting on the floor and maybe 2-3 people sitting in the bar area). Not once did anyone come greet us, come up to us, not even bring us water.Needless to say, terrible service. This is literally THE WORST service I have ever received at a restaurant. Even some bad service, they at least greeted me and/or brought us water. But here? Nothing. They were still opened for another THREE HOURS; it's not like we came in near closing or something and they just didn't want to serve/wait on another table. They genuinely just didn't care.Some of you may say, 'Why didn't you just get someone's attention?' Well, what's the point of putting up a 'seat yourselves' sign if they weren't going to wait on us anyway? My friend and I ended up walking out, no one even bothered trying to stop us, or even a goodbye. Just like the wind, we left without any acknowledgment.",

In fact, she's probably the least appropriate artist I can think of if you don't count R. Kelly's real life shenanigans. But the tickets ended up only being $5 and I had a group of 4 friends who were down to commute from the city to see her so I was all in event though I'm pretty sure I was the oldest person there besides security. Second, man am I glad we asked about the show and figured out that we needed to move into the second level main stage. When we walked in we saw a pretty quiet family-friendly brew pub, a cute outdoor area, and pretty small stage with a very demure act playing and thought, 'Where the fuck is Cupcakke? This can't be right.'The main pub area is really cute and clean and has an almost preppy vibe to it. We skipped the bar here and headed up to the main stage venue get a good spot... which was actually in the very back by the bar. Somehow it was still a pretty good spot to see the whole show. They've got a water station set up with cups so you can hydrate as much as you'd like and the bar was pretty cheap, as well. Security was so nice and the crowd, even tho mostly Berkeley college co-eds was great. Super respectful, very queer friendly, and everyone just had fun and cheered for Cupcakke and her very NSFW message. I'd go back in a heartbeat now knowing how great the space is and how affordable the shows can be.",

When I got home, my cheeseburger had onions and they didn't give me the jalape\u00f1os. And guess what? I was charged extra $ for the jalape\u00f1os.

        "ReviewContent": "Cornerstone is a nice restaurant and I mostly enjoyed my time eating dinner there. ***Restraunt:Pros: 1. The Atmosphere is attractive and the space is open and inviting.2. The food and drink are impeccable. Everything we ate and drank was better than it would have been anywhere else. Amazing attention was spent on the food, you can tell that the chefs take great care in what they do. Even something as simple as a cheeseburger was beyond perfection and so well done I regret not taking a snapshot to show the presentation. Sadly I wolfed it down before it had occurred to me. Artisan pickles were also a nice touch.3.Great beer, wine, and drink selection. (Understatement)4.Attentive and professional waitstaff. (We tipped well as should you.)**Cons: -1. Okay, I get it, this place has live music.  The woman who performed while we ate in the dining area was so loud my wife and I could not hear our server or each other. I like to talk while I eat, or at the very least be able to talk to the waitstaff, this was made nearly impossible. My wife and I ended up texting to each other after failed attempts to converse. This alone ruined what should have been a pleasant dining experience. I have no complaint about the musician's ability to play, she did a great job and has a pleasant voice. However, I've worked with musicians- and have done gopher work setting up amps. I've done enough sound checks to know that this performer set up her amp as high as she could go because she wanted everyone in the large space to hear her. You are out of luck if you were near the stage as we were. Interestingly enough,  the guy who performed afterward turned it down and we could hear each other. Nice, but she warned us she would be coming back making any desire for dessert crushed.  Cornerstone should pay attention to this because my wife just doesn't feel like it's worth our time.****Performance Space: Attached but not inside the restaurant.--1.Nice and roomy, a good venue for a performance. The music was not too loud and they have an excellent sound system. 2. I didn't use the bar but they seem to have professional staff as I never saw a line at the bar and that's unusual. You can take your wine or beer in from the restaurant but it has to be in plastic cups, no problem.3.Clean bathrooms. I know that sounds trite but that's always a plus at a music venue to me.I think if I could make sure I could sit outside and there would not be music blasting in our face in the restaurant- I might eat at Cornerstone again.However, I'm getting tired of restaurants not getting that people would like to talk and enjoy each others company if you don't get that and don't pay attention to this detail, you could lose customers. (Create the Restraunt you want to eat in. Sit down and eat a meal in the main dining room and hold a conversation with someone, see what happens.) I suggest maybe hiring someone with an acoustic guitar or playing music over the PA that's not too loud. (Or have no music at all, people can always go to the attached Music Venue provided.)",

It was a warm day so we sat outside and watched the Warriors game. Pretty good beer selection. I believe we had the Fieldworks IPA which is my favorite and I really love when places have local beers on tap. I was super stoked they had a vegetarian shepherds pie!  Yum!  We also go the pretzel which was yummy, but could have had a little more of the sauces that came with it.  Over all a really cool place and I will go back again.",

I've not been there in the evenings or when there was a performance going on.If you want a wide selection of beer and beer like drinks and you are downtown berkeley this is where I would recommend. There are a couple of other places but this one has lots of room and an outside area you can sit. I tend to get smaller glasses of each so I can sample around more in a visit.I've had the fish and chips, and well, the fish and chips.  They are really good so I've had them three times now but I've also gone in with other folks for a smattering of other foods for the table and have not been disappointed.My one warning about this place, and the reason it gets three stars instead of four, is it is under staffed. Get a small crowd into the place and suddenly you are waiting around the bar to put in an order. They are good at tracking who is first, but it's still a lot of waiting.",

The food is great, and we specially like the sausages and soft pretzel, but really everything is great. My wife really likes the salad. As far as venue, they have free live music often in the main dining and bar area, but the venue in the back is pretty legit too. Two floors with decent viewing upstairs. My biggest complaint is the bar set up for shows, but there isn't really any better place. Its a bit tough getting a drink and getting in and out of the venue room if you hit the main bar for drinks. The shows they have been getting are great, and we have only been to one, but expect to go to more in the future.",

If you're looking to hang out with friends at night, they have a lot of great beers and pitchers that are well priced, as well as an outdoor area with seating and a firepit and a room in the back with ping pong, cornhole and other games (They also host concerts here!). My personal favorite beer is the Mango Wheat Beer, but most of the stuff I've tried there has been solid. I'm also a fan of the food as well. My personal favorite is the Vegetarian Chicken Tenders which are some of the best veggie meats I've had. It is very crispy on the outside and well made on the inside. I typically get the honey chipotle dipping sauce which is quite spicy and sour, but great tasting. The ranch is a bit too creamy for me, but also quite tasty and good to alternate with the honey chipotle. I also enjoy eating them with ketchup as well. I've also had the fries, pretzel, and hummus and like all of them. Overall, probably my favorite bar in Berkeley because it is classy, but affordable and fits nearly every occasion. Definitely will be coming back in the future!",

Went there last night and it was almost impossible to get a server to come to our table. We sat there for 15 minutes before receiving menus. When we did, it was because I had to grab a waitress running by. We then ordered food and proceeded to wait for an hour before the food arrived. We had tickets for the Berkeley rep and five minutes before the show the food still had not arrived. We informed our server know that we were in a bit of a hurry. We gave ourselves an hour and a half to have some beer and food and we still were not able to get our food in time. She ended up putting it in to go boxes and then gave us our check. No discounts given for the wait. I believe that she didn't put in our food order because we ended up asking another waitress about our food and she said that the order will be put in soon.  No apologies. I always feel bad when servers are shorthanded because it's not their fault however there is no excuse for poor service. Management needed to have at least two more servers working that night.",

We were attending a concert and my wife just got off work and we drove straight to Berkeley from Stockton took forever to find somewhere to park so we couldn't really get anything to eat when I told my wife this is a restaurant! So we went straight in to the dining area and to say it was busy and a little noisy would be an understatement. Keep in mind this was a metal show. So we sat at the kind of bar stool area near the back and my wife flagged down the waitress that ended up helping us who was a very busy lady but a very calm look on her face and she proceeded to tell us that we could order something to eat right where we were and not have to wait for a table! Then she promptly brought us back two menus and beer list. And she came back and took our order. My wife had the basic All American Burger and an iced tea. I had the Cornerstone Burger and a lovely dank IPA whose name I cannot remember at the moment maybe it was pale white IPA or something like that. Anyway, complimentary water was brought immediately followed by drinks then dinner All in less than about 15 minutes. Now for the review of the food, excellent for the time we had I won't go into too much detail but I would come back here just to have a beer and have a burger. Extra special kudos go to the little lady was our waitress who just went out of her way to help us in an otherwise very busy restaurant. She was very cute and very gracious the rest of the wait staff was also prompt and courteous. The $10 tip I gave you was not enough thank you from the bottom of my heart from two weary travellers.",

Their beer selection is one of the best in the area, they have a massive wall of taps featuring many seasonal and longstanding favorites from around the state and are priced to compete. If you come to drink, be sure to grab a seat outside and take full advantage of their fire pit area, it definitely makes an evening more intimate.  The music venue portion of this establishment is great, although its a tad smaller than others in Berkeley, the floor layout provides an excellent view of performers, no matter where you stand. I like that there are two entrances into the venue, this helps shorten lines and brings customers on one end into the bar area while at the opposite end patrons are closer to merchandise tables. The bar inside the venue is not as well stocked as the restaurant, but they still have some tasty brews and mixed drinks being made by expert bartenders.",

Live music is great I always enjoy going to places with live music, cornerstone definitely has a good feel and nice venue to enjoy the full experience. I would definitely come here again and recommend this place to others.",

I've never had McNuggets so I don't know exactly what they should taste like but my carnivorous friend was so convinced he had to ask the waitress to make sure they hadn't messed up the order. I have to admit the texture is creepily meat like. Most fake meat I've had - even if the taste is right - the texture is off, but not this \"chicken\". Am truly impressed by the mad scientists who concocted this.As for the rest of the venue there is some nice outdoor seating with two fire pits. The music venue part is sort of upstairs and basically completely enclosed. There are many beers that seem relatively reasonably priced to me (around $6). There are plenty of TVs and a good amount of bar and regular table seating. The waits for tables seemed to be long in a Friday night but you are free to sit at the bar or stand while you wait. Overall, a great bar in downtown Berkeley. Would definitely return!",

Well they gutted it and turned it into the genius that is cornerstone. I'm obsessed with interactive games and cornerstone offers life size Jenga along with ping pong and other cool activities. The best part is the intimacy of the stage where there are love shows booked throughout the year. There is no bad view because it's really small. And there's a balcony you can get an eagles eye view of the stage. All the bartenders; excuse me, mixologist...they were super kind and quick!!! I didn't have to wait long for my order. And shortly afterwards I got my drink. There's plenty of seating and the option to lounge outside by the fire pit. Cornerstone can give off cool laid back vibes to let's shake it and turn up vibes. Zero to a hundred real quick. That's what I love about it! It facilitates whatever you're in the mood for! Even the food is good!They keep all things organized and it never gets crazy when I am there. I highly recommend seeing a concert here and play ping pong! It might turn into beer pong...who knows!",

They have probably the most extensive craft beer tap list in Berkeley (rotating but kept updated on their website) and (I'm not sure how temporary this is with their relatively recent opening) their prices for most beers are great! In terms of food, their pulled pork burger was pretty top notch, and the pork belly nachos were decent. They seem to have quite a few concerts as well - someday I'm sure a band will draw me to attend one. I came here once on a night where there was not a concert & they had placed a couple ping pong tables and cornhole boards in the concert hall for common use - a great time for a group!",

You go in and order at the counter and then pick your poison of where you want to sit. The beer selection was pretty good. A nice variety of local beers, mixed in with craft beers from elsewhere.

The band was fantastic and we really had a great time and enjoyed the bar, the drinks were great, just wanted to point out a few things that you should be aware of.People were spilling drinks on the floor all night which honestly created a hazard.  I was wearing Uggs and almost slipped and fell more than a few times.  I think if you had more chairs/tables around the perimeter that might make a difference- there really weren't enough places for us old folks to sit.  You had more than a few elderly guests (probably in their 70's-80's) that were looking for a place to sit and watch the show.  We are planning to attend both Zoso and Moustache Harbor and will be calling the venue to see if we can bring our own camp chairs with us.In any case, remembering Berkeley's \"Keystone\" and \"Ruthies\" I am happy that we now have a venue close enough to go hear some great live music, thank you for that.  I will update my 3-star for a 5-star when I see an effort for more seating and a policy of no drinks on the dance floor (somebody's going to get hurt).:) - Cory Gaeta Choulett",

The backroom is filled with 2 ping pong tables, cornhole, and big connect four. They start giving out wristbands at 10PM, don't fully understand why. Our waitress was friendly and had a variety of colored pens to choose from when she brought us our check which was fun! I gave this place 3 stars after some friends ordered from their menu. Although this place is good for sports games and casual drinking, based on the pictures I posted, their food didn't look appeasing. Believe it or not, the tomato soup was served like that! The grilled cheese sandwich was basic to say the least! Anyone can peel off Kraft cheese square and slap it on some bread, toast it, and call it grilled cheese.

We started with a light beer from a brewery in Davis called Sudwerk. Tasty and an easy drinker.We then moved on to a darker porter from San Diego. They also feature many local breweries in Berkeley and Oakland.The main dining room had plenty of tv's and we enjoyed the Saturday college football lineup.  But after awhile our competitive juices were flowing and so we headed into their concert room. Here they have a couple ping pong tables set up along with a couple corn hole set ups.

I had really high hopes for this bar as a place to watch sports, especially Sunday football given that they have about 5+ giant flat screen TV's hanging from the walls..that is definitely not the case. On two Sunday visits, the bar was quiet and not very busy, and while football was on the screens, there was no sound. Instead they were playing jazz/r&b (think Bill Withers) at a barely audible volume. So I can't imagine it was for ambiance..also, the bartenders looked somewhat unhappy to be there..I'm sure the focus is on live music and an overall nightlife experience, but again given the \"sports bar\" feel and the fact that it's open during the day, it's a bit misleading.I know its a new place, and it takes time to iron out the wrinkles, but I hope you figure it out soon.

It looked insanely huge from the outside and I wasn't disappointed upon stepping in . Amazing beer selection (they even had a couple of Gose and Sour beers) and they have a nice patio as well as booth for a perfect chilling experience. I'm glad I came to this place and would definitely bring more of my friends here.Do give this place a try if you want an alternative to Jupiter.",

The second time I came and got it (The Captain's Boutonniere) and yup, still good. Also helps that it is the cheapest cocktail. Food is pretty standard bar grub (burgers, mac and cheese balls, salads, nachos). Wouldn't really come here for it.  Service is a little weird in that you have to wait to be seated even if you just want drinks. The inside is a little noisy which is often the case with live music (which was really good). Patio is nice, but not really too exciting. Interesting mixture of twenty year olds and families. Solid place to hang out!",

Super chill bar! Definitely want to go back.I wanted something sweet so ordered a cinnamon roll but it wasnt that good.

First staff was confused about happy hour. We were told it was until 7pm by two different people but then our server told us there is no happy hour on fridays. He should have mentioned that when we explicitly ordered our drinks from the happy hour menu. They adjusted the bill though. Second the snacks we ordered were mediocre. Both the \"roasted\" brussel sprouts and \"seared\" cauliflower needed both more roasting and searing, they were pretty raw. Dipping sauces were runny and not memorable. Hummus was not too bad but again nothing exciting. Would definitely go back for the space though and perhaps the main dishes would better.",

All for just $9, not exactly McDonalds but a bargain by today's fancy burger-place prices.  Beer was fine too (I'm not a big beer drinker), and they had a very large list of options.

The audacity to call their establishment \"upscale\" is much closer to a mask of elitism that isn't welcomed in an environment of unity and tolerance.

        "ReviewContent": "Happy Hour lasts and lasts at Cornerstone--all the way until 7pm, with $2 off pints! Pro tip: If a beer is available to order in a pitcher, it is applicable for the Happy Hour Special. I've come here twice now for Happy Hour with my coworkers and have loved it both times. If you get here right around 5pm after work, it'll only be starting to fill--a half hour later, this place will be rolling! This is a great place to go if you have a large group--lots of space for standing, and there are several long, communal tables for big groups of friends. It also feels very clean, polished, and organized. While it feels a little upscale, I love the unpretentious air this place has. Their craft-filled beer menu regularly changes based on availability, and is organized into the categories of Hoppy, Dark, Light, Tart/Sour, Specialty/Other, Cider, and Bottles/Cans.  There are at least three or four beers per category, and sometimes nine or ten.  With the menu set up this way, you can take a risk ordering a brew you haven't had before, as you already know that you like a certain type of beer. The servers have always been nice about letting me try beers before ordering them, though. Not to mention, the Specialty/Other section gives you unique beverages like alcoholic root beers or kombucha to order if you feel like having something a little different or \"out there.\"The last time I came here, we had a large group sit outside in the back patio area.  I was really impressed that when more of our party arrived, some folks that worked at Cornerstone helped push tables together to accommodate us. The outdoor seating area is nice, and like the interior there's plenty of space to avoid feeling cramped. What I'm not big on is the food. The pork belly nachos were interesting, but uninspiring; the fries, nothing to write home about; pan-seared cauliflower, fine, but the spicy aioli was bland. With three swings and three misses, I'll stick to drinks here--though I'll admit, the sandwiches have looked pretty good.This is a great place to go with a group of friends for a pre-dinner drink. I'd love to come here for some live music sometime.",

        "ReviewContent": "Accessibility here is clearly a priority. The staff was super friendly and accommodating and didn't blink when we asked for what we needed. More venues should take note from their example! I would give 10 stars if I could for an incredible experience.We bought tickets for the Fastball show as soon as they went on sale and I called the venue later that day to ask about accessibility. My sister preferred not to take a mobility aid if possible so we were just wondering what the layout was and whether we could have a seat somewhere and still see the show. The first time I called, I got someone who wasn't sure, but told me to call back during weekday daytime hours to speak to a manager. I put it off because I was so sure it was going to be terrible like every other concert venue we've ever tried to go to.But NO! I finally talked to Jennie (sp?) earlier this week and when I asked about accessibility she asked what we needed and didn't pause to think or ask insulting questions - she just told me to ask for Cory (again, sorry if I'm mispelling names! Please correct me because these employees deserve proper kudos!) at the box office when we arrived and they'd take care of us and make sure we got seating with a view of the stage. That I should feel free to drop her name since she wouldn't be there (it wasn't necessary as everyone was immediately helpful). Right away we felt more at ease and even more excited to see our favorite band in concert at a small venue!We arrived a little early so we got to eat in the restaurant next door. They do allow you to take food into the concert area (so later I finished my kale and butternut squash salad with a plastic fork while sitting on the floor) - just no glass (reasonable). There's a bar inside for ordering drinks in non-glassware. The fries and avocado burger were really good and the kale salad was a little sweet, but really tasty. Service was friendly and very fast (have seen other complaints that it was slow and we were worried about that, but didn't experience it). Also, this place is new and very clean (including bathrooms).I asked Katie (sp?) at the box office for Cory as Jennie advised and she told me to talk to any security guard and they would make sure we got a seat, even if all the seating on the sides were taken. She texted the main security guard, TJ, and gave me a description of him so we could look for him specifically. Again, immediately put at ease, going above and beyond the information, super friendly and welcoming.We packed up our meal and got into the concert part of Cornerstone soon after doors opened at 7:30. There was a row of chairs on both sides of the stage. I figured we'd just sit on the side, but we weren't sure if we'd be able to see over people standing in the center. Figuring it wouldn't hurt to ask, we found TJ (such a nice guy!) and asked if we could pull a chair in front of the stage. He said go for it, just watch for elbows and find him if anyone gave us any problems. What?! Front row seat? To be fair, I stayed standing (I didn't need the accommodation and didn't want to take a seat from someone else who might need one) and my sister pulled up her chair. We laughed and felt silly, but also knew this was going to be one of the best concert experiences because we could be up by the band where we wanted to be, weren't going to be in anyone's way, wouldn't have to worry about people standing up in front of us, and could experience the show together. It was beyond amazing. It didn't get fully packed so no elbows went flying near her head, but other people were singing and dancing all around us. She was able to get up and dance for brief periods of time. I got to be with my happy, present sister and not taken away from the enjoyment of the show because she was in pain that could have been prevented by better accommodation (our experience by the end of every other concert).Accessibility here was what it should be - smooth, painless, and reasonable. We were treated with respect and made to feel just as welcome as any other patron. No special treatment - just what was necessary to enjoy the experience and want to come back. It was easy to give, after all. Still, it is far too rare. So if you're disabled and want to see a concert, come here! It's a great venue, has friendly awesome staff, good food and drinks, and a fun ambiance. I'm coming back for the fire pit in the back and the desserts if not for another show asap.",

        "ReviewContent": "So I am here with friends and everyone was having a good time until one of the waiters came and asked me to take my hoodie off. I was wearing it because I was cold sitting outside and was obviously caught off guard when the waiter told me that it's a policy they have. I took it off and looked around, there was a bunch of guys with baseball caps and one guy with a cowboy hat but apparently, the policy only applies to hoodies. I guess head wear is only threatening when it's a hoodie. When we asked the security guard what's this policy about, listen to this: they tell us \"because people in hoodies come and steal\" !!!!!!! after trying to talk out the situation and explain the ban was racially motivated, he looked shocked, completely disagreed, and said it is not and that the ban is also on grills- as though that is not MORE RACIST. We continued talking to him and he had the nerve to say it is not blatant racism but instead implied racism. Unfortunately, although the food, music, and drinks were good, my friends and I cannot tolerate this bullshit in Berkeley and will not be coming back.Update: Just adding an update in response to the owner whose suggesting I am imagining or that I and about 8 other people are stupid. I am not interested in dragging this longer. But I want anyone reading to know, that I know what I and a group of us saw and heard. The guy that asked me to take my hoodie down may or may not have been a waiter or a server, he might've been a security guy, it doesn't matter. He was dressed in all black and he did not shy away from giving us his name. After I was ordered to take my hoodie down, my husband and I also went on to the bar and asked for a manager, we talked to a bartender (who was behind the bar with others so not an imposter) and when he said manager was on a break (supposedly) we asked again if banning hoodies was a policy, he said yes.. we asked why he said that it was for people's safety in case of trouble .. I am not sure what that meant but to give the guy the benefit of the doubt, I asked why are hats and caps not banned too then, he had nothing to say. We asked him to convey the message to the manager and owner. We also talked to the guy himself who asked me to take my hoodie down (the conversation from the earlier post) and another staff member who I believe may have been a server, so 3 different staff members who to be clear we asked were not external contractors. If you think you had 3 different imposters in your business at the same time - I would be really worried. What you're saying is laughable but I think you got the message, so instead of denying I would fix your own personal prejudices and your establishment's policy instead of blaming your poor staff who are only trying to earn a living.",

After we ate a quick bite, we headed into the music venue with its own bar and quick bartenders. We were there to see Shaggy and once again we were impressed with the sound system and diversity of the crowd of all ages.I look forward to going again soon.",

The crowd definitely consisted of nearby college students. Loud music was playing and it was hard to have a conversation. The wait staff was really attentive and worked quick. Bartenders worked quick as well. Lots of seating either indoor or outdoor in the back.I really liked their wall of drinks on tap. I forgot the name of my drink but it contained pumpkin. It was a tiny bit sour with a hint of pumpkin. It was good and something new. I'd really give them a 3.5 stars. The beer selection is great but the crowd kind of draws me out.",

This place boasts a modern yet rustic feel and I like that it easily accommodates larger parties given that (1) they have one long booth, and (2) there's plenty of space for quick re-engineering. I came here with a group of Cal+ students, and the party grew to upwards of 25, if not more. We fit comfortably. You can also select from apparently Berkeley's largest selection of beers on tap. I ordered the evil twin, which was this very dark chocolate-y, rather bitter stout. Quite delicious and a solid 4/5.I unfortunately only got the appetizer (vegetarian chicken tenders, 3/5 at most), which I found underwhelming, so the next time I come here I'm going for the tofu sandwich since that looked yummy.",

        "ReviewContent": "It's times like these I really wish there were half-stars to give on yelp, but I will err on the side of 4 star for the vast tap selection, especially having three ciders and a handful of sours.I came here on a Tuesday evening this week with coworkers for happy hour and noticed that the happy hour here isn't really very helpful, unless you like cocktails, as it doesn't seem to cover food or very many of the taps; of those that are available as 10oz./16oz./pitcher, you can order a 16oz. for the price of a 10oz. ($2 off).The place looked pretty empty (but it is also pretty massive for downtown Berkeley) so the waitstaff was really attentive, and checked back in with those of us still deciding (I and one other arrived a little behind) without feeling pressuring or naggy. They were great about refilling our water glasses regularly too.I started with a mixed-fermentation sour beer by Paradox Brewery, Skully #50 \"Strawbasil\" (10oz. $12, 7.7%) and midway through enjoying it (and enjoy it, I sure did!) I ordered the deconstructed smoked pulled pork sandwich, which is $12, not $9 as the menu online shows. Their menu last night included the MAINS section (no longer coming soon) and it looks like prices changed too. That kind of irks me, but I bought what I bought. The sandwich says it comes with vinaigrette slaw, barbeque sauce, mayonnaise, and a sweet French roll, and while delicious, there was nothing deconstructed about this sandwich, unless they meant that the slaw and sauce were outside the sandwich? But that's how I'd prefer it anyway. I'm realizing now there was no mayonnaise, but that's probably for the best. It also came with a big cup of fries that were toasty warm (not too hot for me) and fluffy (not too crispy dry). The sandwich was pretty big and came with a bowl of slaw that I actually really enjoyed! I was expecting it to be too vinegar-y but it was really balanced and fresh, to complement the smoky, umami pork and tangy-sweet barbeque sauce.My coworkers all seemed really content with their meals. One had a margarita she said was very strong, and was happy with the Cornerstone Burger ($12) that comes with pulled pork and mac & cheese balls ON THE BURGER; honestly I kind of wish I'd pulled the trigger and ordered that for myself. I tried a bite of another's pork belly nachos (to determine if I wanted my own) and they were pretty yummy, but the white cheddar sauce was a little too creamy and not enough cheesy for my taste. I really like the build your own board trend, and that'll be my order next-time I'm here. One coworker got the vegetarian chicken tenders and said the waitress was right in her appraisal of them as \"they look, taste, feel, chew just like real chicken tenders.\"I ordered a second drink, a cider by Golden State with light flavors of spearmint and lemongrass, appropriately named Le Mint (10oz. $7, 7.5%) and it took a little longer to come out, presumably since it had gotten a little busier.I should note during our meal, one of my coworkers realized that he'd been given a 10oz. beer but had ordered a 16 (that should have been included in the happy hour special pricing). The \"fix\" they offered was a free beer/drink, which was fine for us - he happily ordered a third but if he hadn't wanted another, someone else in the group would have taken the opportunity - but if it was a smaller group, that might not have been ideal. Another server also brought out a free beer offered to anyone in our group who wanted it. That was a nice touch I thought, since we were a decent sized group there for a while (and giving them a bit of money).When the check came, they had included an 18% gratuity even though our group was only 7 (the menu says included for groups of 10 or more). Not a big deal but a little detail. Once we'd calculated who was putting how much on their card, taking care of the check was quick work.The restrooms are clean but I feel like when there's a musical guest, they get crowded. Berkeley is kind of a parking nightmare. Be careful you don't walk past the place since there's no big name on the front (apparently the previous tenant didn't have that either).Overall, I'm really happy with the selection of taps here and I'm sure I'll be back to enjoy more ciders and sours, with or without food.",

My girlfriend and I came in from Seattle with Washington State driver's licenses and they said they were fake and wouldn't let us order a beer. The bartender even showed her manager and he couldn't determine that they were real. When I asked why they didn't scan them, the bartender replied that they didn't have one of those devices.

The owner's wife developed these build your own meat, cheese, veggie boards that are perfect for a group appetizer. The last time I went, I had a broken leg and I wanted to try it out as a concert venue. I brought my husband to see George Clinton for his birthday. It was an incredible evening. The owner went out of his way to accommodate my broken leg and my husband had an amazing birthday because of his hospitality. Can't say enough good things about this place.

The place itself seems nice enough. Walking into the music venue in the back I was impressed and happy that such a place existed in Berkeley.But then the show started. The sound was AWFUL. Every frequency was muddled. Vocals cut in and out. Every instrument distorted. This might have been the fault of the group's own sound person, but as someone who once managed a live venue, I know that it's up to the hosts to law down the law when it comes to sound. And rule #1 is: NO RED LIGHTS on the mixer. I tried wearing earplugs for a couple of songs, but it was still unbearable. I'm not going to ruin my ears just to listen to an unlistenable show.

Unfortunately what stood out more than the great design was the fact that we had a hard time finding a place to sit because so many tables were filled with dirty dishes, silverware and glassware. The beer selection was good plenty of styles to choose from. Nice they offer pitchers but with so many good beers offering flights would be a nice additionWe had some apps and they were average at best. Mac and cheese bites are presented well but nothing outstanding as far as flavor goes. The vegetarian chicken nuggets were a good size but again nothing outstanding. Sauces taste mass produced straight from the big plastic jug with cafeteria style carrots and celery as garnish. Pretty cheap so I guess you get what you pay for.What mostly made me give this place two stars was the bartender who fulfilled the requirements of serving us foods and drinks. However failed 100% at making us feel welcome or even giving us the perception that she gave two sh*ts about getting our business. I honestly don't care if she actually gives a f*ck about our business but she could have done a much better job of faking it. So owners managers if you give a sh*t as opposed to most industry people who read these and say well f*ck that dude maybe you could have people working who care about the appearance of your awesome space and could try to make guest believe they are valued.",

So much more spacious and airy, with tons of seating at the long bar, as well as couches, and low and high top tables inside, as well as the outdoor patio in back (with fire pits for chilly nights!)I had lunch here early afternoon on a Saturday- there were a decent amount of folks at the bar and some tables, but it was relaxed and chill. It gets much busier at night, especially on show nights.The food was fantastic! Gastropub style with high quality ingredients. Nice selection of salads, sandwiches, burgers, and entrees, with a few desserts. A very nice selection of apps and shared bites - everything from charcuterie to nachos. I had the pulled pork sandwich, and it was absolutely delish! The pork was super juicy - not dry at all. And, I loved that they served the sandwich \"deconstructed\" - the BBQ sauce, mayo, and slaw were all on the side, so you can add just the right amount of everything to your own liking. The BBQ sauce was really flavorful!! Oh, and I loved the homemade pickle slices on the side, too. Fries were also excellent!Just be aware, during the slower daytime hours, there are no servers on the floor, so if you plan to eat, just order at the bar and grab a table. The bartender will bring your food out to you.If you are a wheelchair user, there are a number of low- top tables over in the front by the windows, as well as in the back by the patio entrance. I do wish the seating was a bit more integrated, with less high-tops.I didn't have any libations on my first visit, but there is a full bar and lots of beer on tap. A perfect spot for a few drinks and a nibble or for a full meal - I will be back very soon!",

We chose the \"Build Your Own Board\" option and chose a variety of cheese and meats, and ordered the cheese fondue all for a very affordable price ranging from $4-6 per selection. The full bar was busy, and was relatively generous with their alcohol. The only down side was that the security guards checking IDs snapped my friend's driver license.

Only to find out, the concert is around the corner, and food is not served at the same venue.  So we sat in the restaurant, sacrificing what would have been a great spot in the line.  3 of us ordered apps and drinks.  Apps showed up within 10 minutes which were ok.  Drinks came 15 minutes after the apps.  We ordered more food, which was decent. ( apps were soft pretzel with fondue, mozz stuffed meatball, and macaroni & cheese balls.  Our later order was pork belly nachos, and a shared burger.  Burger was pretty darn good.  Mac & cheese balls were pretty good too.  All else was mediocre.  Drinks were comped, and our server was tipped $20 on a $65 tab because it was not her fault.  Bar staff needs some serious training and help.Now for the concert venue.....The stage was nice, and the space was intimate... we were excited to see Stick Figure in such an intimate setting.  Well, it was so hot in there. Easily 85 defrees + and Zero ventilation, and we lasted 45 minutes.  The plus;  good drinks at a fair price,  and cheap concert tickets.Cornerstone, dial in the bar at the restaurant, and please cool down the concert venue.  Figure out a way to bring in that beautiful bay air.  You are doomed without either",

DRINKS: With several beer options on tap, anything can be enjoyed by anybody! I will say on the pricier side of places, but now that the Bay Area has gotten more expensive, that $7 pint of beer now is more of the standard. They have a ton of local choices as well some normal distributed beers from across the nation, so you can really find whatever you like. Although beer is their specialty, you can always get something else here too. ATMOSPHERE: There's the outside seating area and then there are plenty of tables and space inside the bar. There are even 'concerts' here according to some of the pamphlets around the bar. I will say, you can bring a group of friends and snag a table to get comfortable and enjoy a round of drinks. Overall, one of the better establishments now in the downtown Berkeley area for a good drink and socializing time. The weekends will obviously be cramped and full, but when a place is this good ...!",

The times I've visited hadn't offered food yet, but I see from Yelp that this has changed. Hell yeah. Their outside area is wonderful. No wind or street noise because of how closed off it is. My favorite area is the game room, which offers table tennis, corn hole, and giant jenga.

I mean, Thalassa is a way cooler name, which if you didn't know, means \"sea\" versus Pangaea meaning \"land.\" It was a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu-ish moment walking up to the entrance, bringing me back to my college days.Anyway, the issue here is that the service is super whack. Maybe the bartenders are young or they don't like dealing with the young college crowd, but dang they are slow and it's as if they are ignoring you. I get it, burn out is real. So is a customer service job though.This place pretty much has everything that people who like to chill, want.

I know it's standard practice to turn on the lights but this felt excessive for a small venue like this. The number of security guards was also kind of excessive, not the first thing you want to see just as a dreamy set by Polica is over. The drinks were cheap but not good.

Since it was not crowded we got to hangout at their live performance area where they had two ping pong tables, a giant jenga set and a few corn holes. We played ping pong for about two hours as we didn't have anyone waiting on the tables and it was so much fun to do that with a pint of amazing beer.They also have an open backyard with fire places to chill.

        "ReviewContent": "I used to like Thalassa a lot and have been hoping some good businesses to fill this empty spot. My experience at Cornerstone was pretty nice, although I went there on a weekday night, which might not be quite representative if you are looking for some large crowd experiences.As a bar, they offer plenty of drinks, including more than 30 beers on tap. Also, for most of their tap beers, you can choose a smaller short footed glass beside the regular pint glass. This serves very well for some of my friends who want to try different kinds but not drink too much. The bartenders were very friendly as well. I have never tried their food though.The entire setup was very nice as well. It is very spacious and seats are big and away from each other. While half of the place are general tables for food and drinks, the other half have a stage and a big open area. When there is not a show, the area is equipped with two table tennis tables, two corn hole setups, and a giant Jenga. Besides, there is an outdoor area with fire pits. Overall, I think this setup can basically satisfy a wide range of preferences.",

I didn't see any signs saying \"no crowd surfing or stage diving\" but security was dragging people out in choke holds acting like they just committed a major crime. And every time security kicked someone out for doing the above, it took like 5 of them to unnecessarily bulldoze through the crowd and knock people over. I've been to so many different shows at a variety of different venues and have never seen security act like this. Either put some signs up or chill out when you see people crowd surfing at a punk show!",

La Note graciously pushed back our reservation so that we could try out Cornerstone. My wife enjoyed a great white wine, while I ordered two Manhattans, made according to the preferences of the Bar Dude. The Bar Dude is legit. His choices for mixing drinks proves it. This place isn't just hip, it's also cool and, if you're old enough, swell! Oh, also check out the color-coded beer menu, it's a smart way to help choose a drink.",

        "ReviewContent": "When Thalassa closed, I was excited to see what would replace it. We happened upon this place since we were driving down Shattuck the night before and saw that the lights were on! Came here with a big group around 8PM on a Friday night and it wasn't packed (but given this place is huge). It seemed like a soft opening when we came so we really got to check the place out. Compared to the old Thalassa that was dark/mysterious/and a little sketch at times this place was open/bright/and clean lol. It's an interesting place since you have a sitting area in the front, large bar to the left, firepits/smal stage in the back, and ping-pong/cornhole/larger stage in the back left. TBH I think this place has a lot going on. Good or bad, I guess we'll have to see.  I can't give this place a 5 yet since there were tons of ping pong balls on the ground in the back since they don't limit how many you can check out, but have it in a big bowl. The place would be better if they let you write your name down to check out a table/limit your time there since people were at the tables for hours. Same for the cornhole. I like that they'll probably have open mics or artists playing throughout the night since they were doing sound checks. However, it did get hard to chat with people & hear once they started doing that. They have a good assortment on tap & seems like they'll be opening another bar area near the ping pong tables. Drinks seemed cheaper than usual though since we got around 6 drinks for only $35. No complaints on my end though since they did have some Golden State, Goose Island, and others that I've never heard of before. They're still not up and running completely, so I did feel like there was something missing from the place/to make it the next go to spot. Come check this place out while everything is still new and clean!",

They might need fans to keep the flies away from the open air areas. They are not fully up to prime time. Food service is slated to start next week during Spring Break (last week of March)Their taps are numerous, extensive, and clean. They also have a full bar for cocktails. I'm sure they will improve over time but I think I'll wait to return in a few months",
