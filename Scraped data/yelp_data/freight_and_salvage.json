During intermission, everyone crowded to restrooms, fortunately, the venue has gender neutral bathrooms (and not single stalls either!) on the upstairs area that were clearly labeled and easy to get to.",

His voice was so close to the octaves he hit with CSNY, that i could scarcely belive my own ears.  I've seen the band many times since 1968, and Graham is the real thing that makes up the heart and soul of musical genius. Last night he filled the hall with storys, acoustic music, electric music and harmonies that are almost as good as the oldend days with Crosby, but reallly, that is impossible to recreate, ever again. Loved the guy as he left us in Berkeley and flew off to Geneva, etc.  I only wish he played Chicago, my pesonal anthemn.",

They have some sort of programming every day/night: folk nights, Sundays with Bobby McFerrin (the 'Don't Worry Be Happy' singer) to a renowned singer from Mali. I also spied banjo classes and so much more.My experience with F&S has only been for The Moth nights. Approximately once a month they host these storytelling evening where attendees can share their 5 min prepared story on a certain theme. Stories are voted on by selected judges in the audience and one special storyteller walks away a winner. (def look it up if you want to know more). A few things: they still have strict mask policies and they don't allow food or drink in the theater portion (you can consume in the lobby). They do have a parking garage next door although it's a bit pricey.As I have yet to see music, I can't share critique on acoustics, but for The Moth nights, the place can handle a small-medium sized crowd and serves as a great community center!",

Nina and I attended and the concert and the memories shared by friends and family members were wonderful.  While we were there we bought tickets to hear Samara Joy, a 22 year old singer w/ a magnificent voice and amazing stage presence for someone her age.  The concert, on September 22nd, was stellar and the sound, as usual, was perfection.  Covid protocols are strict, which I appreciate, because that gives me the sense of comfort I need to attend.  Vaccination verification is required, as are masks while you are anywhere in the facility.  The Freight is one of my favorite concert venues.",

The Freight made it clear that they wanted all patrons to wear masks, despite the City's  posiiton that indoor venues recomend but not require masks (Berkeley has its own health dept and can set its own guidelines). I wore a mask as did all the patrons I saw. However, I and others were reprimanded quite vehemently  by a staff mask nazis if our masks did not meet the staff person's ideals. When I was reprimanded a second time because my mask did not completely cover my nose, I left. I will not be going back. There is a fine line on enforcing personal standards. Using volunteers who may have some sort of animus attached to the issue at hand is not an approach I would recommend for a business dependent on public support.",

After missing Taimane's visit in 2019, I finally came to The Freight for Taimane's Hawaiki concert tour. I came to find out that the venue is a nonprofit community arts organization that is dedicated to promoting music rooted in and expressed through regional, ethnic, and social cultures around the world and is supported through the shows, grants, benefit performances, volunteers, and donations.For the concert, the tickets were general admission which is open seating in the venue.  Getting there shortly after the doors opened, we selected fourth row center aisle seats. But with its size, it appears that most seating on the lower section allows for a good view of the stage. The sound system was superb as the system was designed and installed by Berkeley's Meyer Sound Labs.The Freight requires all attendees to show their vaccination cards and to be masked in the venue. The workers at the check-in and in the venue were friendly. I'll be checking out The Freight's calendar for performances and will be back for Taimane's next visit.",

Been a loyal customer from the days when they were still at their old location by San Pablo Ave But what they're doing with the entry requirements is baffling. The result is a really strange , stale & cold concert going experience. Nowhere else in town is requiring medical records & masks to be worn at all times. No drinks & no food. I feel like I'm visiting a nursing home. This is summer of 2022. I look forward to updating this review when they regain some sense of sanity ...hopefully before they turn all their customers away. Most people under the age of 70 have stopped going because of these restrictions. Better to go hang elsewhere where you can see your friends faces, have some fun, & not be subjected into these invasive requirements",

They have a nice little beer and wine selection.Inside the theater, food and drinks were not allowed.  This may be the first time I've seen 100% mask compliance recently, and it did not detract at all from the enjoyment.  I'm going to be checking their calendar for other musical events, and will be seeing if any friends want to go again to The Moth with me.",

        "ReviewContent": "I am reposting my review based on the comments that I made after attending a concert there. I saw Bobi Cespedes with her ensemble. I saw a couple of friends their. The go regularly and are not of color. I also received a comment from them asking what black musicians I'd like to see there . I didn't answer because the Bay Area is dripping with local African American talent. Insulting, like the comments of the woman from the Jazz school. The place is a nice venue for a concert, small and intimate, however, they have some issues as you can read in the reposted view below. It was hard to fully enjoy the experience, in light of the following...This is a space that I usually make fun of because the events they have aren't accessible \"interesting\" to me. But they had a concert with Bobi Cespedes, so I had to go support her. I miss the old Conjunto Cespedes and it was wonderful seeing here there with Lichi Fuentes and Marcos Diaz!I thought they were of the same ilk of the Jazz School. And I think that it may be. But my husband and I ran into Tito Gonzalez at the Berkeley Farmer's Market and he was passing out flyers for his show. We said, \"I didn't know that they allowed black people on stage there, and he proudly said that he would be on. We couldn't make the show, but a Cuban friend went with her boyfriend (Italian) and they had a fantastic time.And while, I still find most of their events, not of my taste, meaning that I don't understand why there isn't more of an African American blues presence, considering that some of the blues clubs (Eli's Mile High, Biscuit and Blues, etc.) are gone - one temporarily (hopefully in the case of B&B). They like their bluegrass, blue-eyed sould, etc. But I digress.The only black people they seem to like speak Spanish and the only problem is that black people speak many languages, mostly English in this area. But there's also French, Arabic, Portuguese - you get my drift. That's great for Tito and Bobi, but for the rest of us, there's no there there.For more stars, I need to see more diversity.",

I have seen several shows, for some I needed earplugs and others were perfect for me. I suspect that the artist has control over the volume. Being a nonprofit allows them to book a variety of artists that you will not see at other places. We were on the guestlist for the last two shows we saw here, so I can't really comment on the ticket prices. In the past ticket prices have always been reasonableWhat I really enjoyed was the framed calendars that lined the hallway to the bathrooms. \"The Freight\" has been around since 1968. It was interesting to see all the different performers that played there over the years, some became famous, others are pleasant memories, and some I have no idea who they were.",

It's actually more like a small music hall with auditorium style seating, a large, bright lobby and a great snack bar with lots of higher-end food choices (sliders, soup, vegan and vegetarian, etc.). Everything looks new and stylish. The sound was really good, because it's a venue designed for performances, which a coffee house really isn't. Freight & Salvage was very accommodating to my friend who uses a wheelchair. The staff helped me move seats so that her wheelchair could be in the front row. My friend has a hard time drinking from a bottle, cup or can without a straw. The venue didn't have any straws but the young woman working at the snack bar went across the street to another restaurant to get a straw and brought it to my friend so she could drink her Coke. That's service above and beyond! Thank you Freight & Salvage! (We were there for an acoustic Kris Allen show, which was great. I don't live in the area, but I will definitely keep my eye on the F&S calendar and find other shows I want to attend.)",

They have a great variety of talent including roots, folk, jazz, celtic, latin, afro-fusion, country, although we have only been here for Hawaiian music.  We were here mostly for Uncle George Kahumoku and other slack key greats he is touring with like Nathan Aweau, Kawika Kahiapo, Jeff Petersen, and Led Kaapana.

We didn't realize that the auditorium was mostly seating with hardly any standing space. We also noticed that 90% of the audience were Caucasian senior citizens (hmmm...). Sadly, the performance was terrible most likely due to the fact that the band just doesn't play well together or that age has manifested full force. It was reminiscent of a couple of friends jamming out in their parents' garage with little consideration for staying in tune. I love Booker T.J. but not enough to pay $40 for an ill-performed show in a coffeehouse full of senior citizens. I strongly feel that the price had something to do with the name and not the quality of the music. I hope they keep jammin' together and hone their skills as musicians. On a good note, I applaud the musicians for putting themselves out there and trying to do their best. I'm sure there are more 'fitting' bands that should be playing in a theater-like venue such as F & S. I may or may not come back for a second show but it was nice to check out a new place in a new part of town.",

The acts that play here are diverse and talented.  You might see Hawaiian Masters one night and Hot Tuna the next.  I recently saw Paris Combo there and the entire delightful show was in French.

You will line up   outside like a tool until they open the doors an hour early. You finally get through the door, run to the front...and there you see ...that is why you lost three stars all the front row seats have reserved for..\"The privileged.\"That is why you lost three stars. Who are these people. The second row was taken also by reserved signs. Now you are left with seats you could have had if you just showed up like a pedestrian. Then right when the show starts...(As you waited like a nice normal person for the show to begin...) The \"reserved\" privilege walks in an interrupts you and everyone else in the house, because \"they\" apparently just show up in the nick of time with their coffee and beer. They seem oblivious to the  patron around them. You do the right thing and ge online and buy tickets. That was your first mistake. It seems the venue has some friends that they hook up. I should try to get to know people at the Freight and Salvage so I can get VIP treatment also.",

I had purchased tickets for a show I wanted to see so badly. It was a bucket list show I was surprising my mom with. We had always wanted to see Rita Coolidge. Well the morning of the show my family member passed away. They worked with me so the tickets would not be a complete loss. The gentleman who helped me was exactly that, a gentleman. I wish I could remember his name but my mind was not real clear that day. He even gave me condolences. I know that doesn't sound like much, but it is my experience these days that people are just not very thoughtful anymore. So I do not take it for granted. I will definitely be supporting this business with a heart, when I'm feeling more up to it. I'm a musician and I've heard many good reviews from many of my fellow music lovers, in the business. Can't wait to go myself. #frieghtandsalvagecafe #goodpeople",

I hope to go back soon, with my sweetie and maybe my son....or perhaps my sister. We had a fun time seeing the Squirrel Nut Zippers and the opening band was great too. Awesome horns especially. Nice intimate setup, good sound, a snack bar and very reasonably priced tickets I thought. No dance floor, but aisle dancing is permitted if that's your thing. We showed up when the doors opened per a friend's advice but it would have been fine to get there a bit later. We lucked into Milvia Street parking (free on Sunday) and being able to get into Angeline's without a reservation for pre show dinner a short walk away. Perfect 'Nawlins' themed evening.",

While I've enjoyed the band in smaller honky-tonk venues that fit their style better, I was impressed by the comfort and style of this medium sized theater-type venue. Clean, comfortable and spacious (from the lobby to the aisles to the seating): great sight lines and acoustics. The bar service was efficient, friendly and very reasonably priced. Will call pick up and entry was also super friendly and warm. Restrooms clean (women's room much larger than men's: resulting in line equity, something I've never seen before)!  The show started on the dot, was fantastic and smoothly if simply produced.  The only negative: some sound  problems with mikes on a couple of instruments.  Great area-lots of food options. Reasonable parking just north off Berkeley Ave. Look forward to returning.",

I just love live music and this venue didn't disappoint.I enjoyed the vocal stylings and music of Molly Holm & Her Fab Band. There isn't a bad seat in the joint. The sound is great and you can view the band from any seat with near to no obstruction (unless the person in front of you plays basketball for Cal or something).I really look forward to years of visiting this place.

The seats are comfortable. The sight lines to the stage are clear and unobstructed. The sound system is excellent. There is a snack bar where they sell some of the best brownies, cookies, and drinks.  Often, after the show, the musicians come out to the lobby to talk to fans, sign autographs, and sell a bit of merchandise. Many shows sell out. Buy tickets early and often.

Nice, relaxing, semi-reasonably priced venue. Great Experience! !Now special note of the staff: Exceptional!  Small crew, of extremely dedicated exceptional staff. I recently had need to avail myself of their ADA ...what impressed me most....was the courtesy call inquiring about any preparations needed to ensure a successful experience. I don't know if they are always able to reach out personally,  but it brought tears of gratitude nevertheless.  This is a truly exceptional venue being run by exceptional people!

I had never heard of the venue, and after looking it up on Yelp, I knew it would be a nice and intimate show. The night of the concert, my boyfriend and I were running late due to traffic coming across the Bay Bridge. Luckily, we were able to call in and transfer the tickets easily to my friend's name so we didn't have to wait in a line when we arrived. We went in at around 7:40pm and were able to find seats just behind the sound booth. Like other patrons have said, there is no bad seat in the house. Allen Stone's show was almost 3 hours including a 15-20 minute intermission, so we definitely felt like we got our money's worth. The sound was great and even more amazing to me was that almost no one used their phone to record during the set. Way to be present and enjoy the music, folks! The venue had 2 bars with wine and beer and there was a table for artist merch just outside of the auditorium. Security was lax and we got in with no problems. Do arrive early to circle around for some street parking or better yet, hop on BART and walk over. We ended up parking in a lot for about $5 for 2 hours.We hope to see another show at Freight & Salvage soon!",

Advance general admission tickets for Jon McLaughlin were just $17 ($20 at the door, I believe). Hardwood floors, wood panel walls, chandelier style lights hanging from the ceiling. Quite lovely. The space isn't huge which I really like because it makes for more intimate performances.Would be interested in returning to check out some other performances! And also to try out their \"concessions.\" There's a bar that sells some alcohol, coffee, water, not sure what else. The performance I went to included an intermission.Probably hard to find street parking around here, as it is in downtown Berkeley.

That could be in part because it hosts plays and local charity events as part of the community, but this place is just lovely.I went here a few months ago to see American singer-songwriter/bluegrass aficionada Sarah Jarosz perform, and... Let me tell you a story. Sunday night. Left late. Decided to skip on the opener. Since tickets were sold out, I went in for Standing Room only. No ticket bystander was at the box office. I heard the musician playing overheard over the front-of-house speakers. I thought to myself, \"Oh my gosh! I'm missing it! Is this how I'm going to experience this show? Outside the venue as I happily listen to her perform over the speakers?!\" Luckily I was able to ring the buzzer and the lady came to me and let me go in and enjoy the rest of the show.Might I add, there is not one single bad seat or view in the entire room. The stage is centered downward as the audience seating angles upward all around the venue. The music and acoustics are GORGEOUS. You can hear every little sound, as I would like to think this place makes for a great live recording venue as well.They usually house American bluegrass singers and songwriters and local music groups, which makes it more of a community-driven all-American venue.Transportation is EASY as you just walk a block or two from the Downtown Berkeley BART station. Parking can be a little difficult as it is downtown, but there are little spots and alleys all around (and Berkeley makes for such a great and easy walk-around).I absolutely fell in love with this venue and would love to go again. Although they house more musicians that I am unfamiliar with in the Americana song branch, I would definitely come again... Book fair? Readings? Speakers? Local choirs? If something catches my attention, I'm there.  The venue itself is gorgeous, classy and clean and serves its musicians and audience right.",

They even have beverages and pastry, and I've never failed to find street parking within a couple of blocks.  And there are plenty of restaurants and bars close by.  What not to love!",

        "ReviewContent": "***200th Yelp Review*** (sheds a tear of joy)For me, there is no better performance to write about than the night I learned how to dance swing.While cruising in downtown Berkeley, I often passed by the outside of this performance venue and wondered why a place advertising itself as a coffeehouse looked so much like a theater. I chalked it up to the fact that Berkeley's buildings can be rather eclectic. On one July evening, I decided to check this place out during a performance by a New Orleans-based band called Tuba Skinny. The interior is much larger than the exterior would make it seem (similar to a certain phonebooth). First I walked through the spacious lobby where tickets were collected and merchandise tables (that only accepted cash) were being set up. While looking for a bathroom on the second floor, I couldn't help but admire the colorful decor and the sheer number of flyers for events that have been hosted here in the past. The auditorium was something else entirely. As mentioned in several other reviews, it's a large and wood paneled space with many rows of seats and a bar serving rather pricey refreshments in the back. This performance was open seating, so I decided to hop up front. Interestingly enough, there was a large blank space between the front row and the stage, and a small crowd of people waiting on both sides (which I assumed was the standing room only space). The musicians entered, set up a myriad of instruments, and began to play some of the most toe tapping and melancholy New Orleans jazz I have ever heard. And the people waiting on the sides swarmed onto the dance floor in a beautifully chaotic mix of swing dance styles. I was totally caught off guard by the two performances happening simultaneously, as the band comfortably shared the spotlight with the dancers. Most of the audience watched silently in the background (clapping at the end of each song of course), but occasionally the people sitting next to me got up to try their moves out. The music and the dancing in front of the stage mixed to create a completely immersive performance experience unlike anything I had ever seen before. In short, it was cray and in a good way.I couldn't help but jump up and try to dance myself, but confession time: I didn't know how to swing dance. An old gentleman next to me tried to teach me some of the moves, but after a bit I decided it was best if I just watched, and sat down sheepishly. But once I got back to school I began taking social dance lessons and am now at a more proficient level, so I hope if/when I return to Berkeley, I'll be able to tear up the dance floor with the best of them.",

I may as well mention , said bathroom was up to date and very clean !  The parking garage was only a few doors down & reasonably priced. ($5 flat for the evening )   We liked the comfortable padded chairs and moveable seating ! It let the venue create a dance floor for the headlining band, Rusted Root . Cuz you gotta shake your booty to \" the Root \"   The whole vibe was \" community playhouse/theatre \" more than \"concert venue\". It made things seem a little more \"upscale\". As did the beer & wine selection . They had local microbrews , ciders&A varied selection of wines --- much more than the usual \" red? Or white ?\" Also nice snacks of nuts or pretzels.The bartenders were all friendly & paying by card was easy with their modern touchscreen payment system --- that let us save our cash to buy a T-shirt from the band !",

The acoustics were amazing and you can still hear the music out in the lobby. And there are tables in between the seats so you can bring food and drinks in. What's even better than enjoying a live performance? Watching it with a plate of oysters and a flute of champagne in hand (or on table). They also have a small wine bar outside in the lobby area.If you want to check out local Bay Area performances in a more intimate setting, I would definitely make my way out to the Freight & Salvage Coffehouse in Berkeley.",

And I wish they had tables instead of theatre seating. But the vibes are good, nice wood d\u00e9cor, and the staff is friendly. Good sound system. Reasonable prices for concerts and drinks. $5 parking next door and street parking too. And they are a non-profit organization that supports traditional music, another reason why you should go there. They have classes and workshops here too, check them out...",

We had purchased tickets and had them mailed ahead of time, so we walked in a sold out show (The Milk Carton Kids-Amazing!) after a short wait in line. Got a isle seat 3 rows back, so shorty here could see perfectly! Again acoustics were spot on, everyone that we came in contact with at Freight & Salvage was super friendly. Loved the reasonably priced refreshments, got a cup of pretzels for a buck! What a magical night for this first timer.",

It was one of the best concerts I've ever heard.

But I think the people who run the event have preferential treatment for their friends, which seemed like a lot of them. So it's probably like 15 slots to the early birds. The system is flawed. The acts were all terrible the night I went with no diversity in the music. You're not going to catch the next rising star at this open mic because they make it so that promising young acts would never want to go here. YOU PAY for the open mic and then they say you might be able to play if someone doesn't show up. It looks like a bunch of old hippy folks run the event and just love putting their preferred acts on. It's a shame that a great venue would never capture the next great thing. For someone who loves music this was a painful event I do not want to relive.",

        "ReviewContent": "Beautiful concert venue! Not sure why they kept the coffee house part in the name; it's really just a small-medium concert hall. I guess they do serve coffee, tea, beer, and wine.They bands they host are excellent, and the staff/volunteers are very friendly and passionate about music. We had the privilege of seeing Ruth Moody and then stayed around for 15-20 min talking with the people from the box office and buying tickets for other events. They were kind enough to recommend 3-5 shows from their list of 60+ bands, they also even took the time to play some samples of music for us and told us what would sell out. That's dedication!I should also comment on the seats. Really, really comfortable with side tables every 3-4 spots to hold drinks. There is plenty of legroom and space between seats so you don't feel to close to your neighbours, but can choose to lean against your significant other should you choose too.The only thing that holds this back from being a 5 star venue is lack of beer selection, and the lack of anything on draft. I would love to see draft beer here from a local micro brew.Oh and another tip: buy tickets in person. They are cheaper (no $1.50-$2.00 surcharge and ANYONE UNDER 25 GETS 50% OFF ALL EVENTS!!!)Can't wait to come back in a couple weeks to see The Milk Carton Boys!",

There isn't a bad seat in the house, it isn't that big, perhaps 600 seats? I love that they give you a very generous amount of legroom.

What a stunning job they've done -- translating the relaxed, comfortable vibes of the old digs into this incredible new space.  Acoustics are stellar -- they sound engineers are spot-on.  And such an amazing line-up of performances, with something for every musical taste.  Plus, they offer classes for an amazing array of music, including Uke (yay!), guitar, harp, flute, harmony singing, and more.  The coffee house portion is nice -- you can get hot tea and coffee, some nice sweet and savory treats, and wine and beer.  The staff and volunteers are always friendly, helpful and accommodating.  Parking garage right next door makes for an easy, seamless evening out.  I just wish there were more good restaurants in easy walking distance.  Seems like a sushi place on the corner would be ideal!  But within a 5-block radius, you can find some nice places for a bite to eat before the show -- my favorite recommendation would be Angeline's.  Tip:  Especially if you're getting tix for several shows, it is worth it to stop by and purchase them on-site.  The online service charges are steep!",

When I sought advice from a mentor (who is a Grammy Nominated Artist) she said 'go to the freight open mic and start playing it whenever you can'.  I practically grew up going to the freight for my favorite live folk shows, so I figured I could give it a shot and see how I felt about it.  I now go to every one.  I am very fond of this venue.  The acoustics are fabulous and the history of the organization is honorable.

The sheer variety of performances being held at the Freight demand that all music lovers take time to peruse the calendar and pick something to attend.  If nothing else, come to and open mic. Maybe you'll see the next big thing!",

She's from the area so she performs sort of regularly around the area, I hear.  Her show was phenomenal and they let you drink and eat the concessions they sell.  What a fantastic and intimate space.  If Vienna ever comes back, I'll be there.  She even stayed around after the show to sign autographs and speak to her fans.  She's a gem, as is this place!",

I had never been to the previous location of F&S, but I love that this location is so easily accessible by BART.  Please note, all show planners need to be mindful that the nearby parking garage closes at midnight (at least it was supposed to that Friday), and the LAST BART train leaves at 12:30 AM.  I had to miss part of Dennis Kamakahi's performance because 1) it was getting really late and I could not keep my eyes open and 2) because I did not want to miss the last train back to San Francisco - or else we would've had to get a room somewhere in Berkeley, potential nightmare!  The coffee bar was open throughout the show, so that was nice to get some drinks and snacks, and you could munch away in the auditorium during the show too.  The seats were real comfortable - looooved that.  And the sound was GREAT!!  Can't complain.  I would come back to see another show, and I would recommend this place to see and hear great live music.  Mahalo!",

Why?THIS PLACE IS SO EXPENSIVE THEY EVEN CHARGE FOR OPEN MIC NIGHT! That said, glad someone is still doing this kind of music. WISH I COULD AFFORD TO GO MORE.Also wish they'd include more interesting, innovative..weirder stuff (Sean Smith, Glenn Jones) but perhaps such would be too modern for the steady string of hippie oligarchy patrons (the eco-elite as another reviewer said) who can afford this spot.Admittedly, some of the high cost is due to the venue's choice not to sell alcohol, but I have put on many shows in my day and made the same choice without charging $18 for local bands. The whole situation perplexes me. They are obviously not greedy, and for the most part have a great vibe and a good reputation with artists, as well as the all-important good sound.

Although this is probably not the Freight's fault, we we quite disapointed that the Ditty Bops' second set was extremely short, perhaps 4 or 5 songs at the most. They then deigned to give their highly appreciative audience only one encore, after which they walked off without even so much as a fare thee well. Granted they seemed tired from their daytime hike in SF, but still, come on ladies. #2.  Despite what some of the other commentors have to say here, the seats in the new theater are horrendously uncomfortable. For one, they have no armrests, forcing one to fold one's arms across one's chest for the entire show, or otherwide risking put one's arms (hands) somewhere where they shouldn't be. Secondly, the backrests are at the wrong angle, putting so much strain on the lower back that after a few songs I was ready to leave (only the great music kept me in my seat).  So watch out. If you have any back problems, find another venue; you will hate these seats.",

It is led by Jorge and is a Spanish immersion class in which he exposes the children to all kinds of musical instruments and songs from latin culture. I am a musician myself and educator myself, and I give this class two thumbs up! It is great for the music, stimulation, as well as the Spanish-speaking environment. (Jorge is bilingual so no worries if you aren't fluent!) It is also well-priced. The only negatives would be I do have to work at finding a parking spot before class. Be sure to give a little time for that. 2nd, I have a hard time getting them to answer the phone when I call with a question. You are better off emailing.It is a fantastic facility for classes- lots of clean, well-lit rooms. The bathrooms are easy to access and clean, too.

We're from LA, and have been to quite a few acoustic music venues all over the country, so we have some context by which to judge.Positives:- Decent, not awesome, sound.  Vocals mixed too low.  Didn't knock my socks off like the acoustics at Old Town School in Chicago or McCabes in LA. But I am nitpicking; it was solid.- Good crowd.  What's the definition of a good crowd?  They shut the f*** up when the artist is playing.- Great sight lines.  Not a bad seat in the house. The chairs are  comfortable, too.- Close to BART.  It's a block and a half away from the downtown Berkeley station.  Whoever said it was a trek from the BART through a sketchy neighborhood ought to visit Detroit or Baltimore and get a reality check.Negatives:- A coffeehouse should have good coffee.- Leave the babies at home.  Why why do parents insist on bringing noisy babies to concerts.  I love kids, but it's annoying to pay $60.00 for tickets and listen to baby noise. Next time it happens I am going to ask for my money back.  It's selfish for those parents to (1) bring their kids out late at night. The concert ended at 11:00.  Those parents should be ashamed of themselves.  Kids need to be sleeping in their beds and (2) it's rude to the other patrons sitting around them.  Enough already!- No bar.  It's nice to enjoy great music with a beer or glass of vino. Note to management: put the bar in the lobby, not in the performance hall.  And cut off sales when the artist plays.If you like folk / americana music this is a really nice venue and the people who run it have a commitment to the artists and and fans.",

        "ReviewContent": "Ok. So.  This one will tip my street cred because I write positive reviews for some places that others disdain, but I do not mind.Freight and Salvage is a coffee house that has enjoyed 3 locations since its inception in 1968.  It is now directly across the street from Berkeley Rep just a block or so from Shattuck Downtown Berkeley Bart.The new setting is classy, but it still retains a warmish feeling inside, with comfort and a great staff.There is a young woman with short hair who was worth the price of our tickets to see Glen Phillips and Grant Lee Phillips last evening, for she is one of the front staffers and more talented on stage than many performers in this wonderful world.  Funny and good timing in her delivery of the description how she loves that the new carpet doesn't surround her with a burst of dust when she goes to the microphone.  I loved her description of the upcoming events and the show had not even begun.  The bar serves a limited menu but home made cookies and brownies, beverages.  We were very very pleased that halfway through the show it was mentioned that people should not be videtotaping.  We had one woman just in front of us who almost taped Glen's entire show.  We hoped her battery would die but alas, she has some sort of future digital device that keeps on giving....The restrooms are in two locations, plenty for everyone.Everything is convenient and clean and the staff extremely knowledgeable and helpful.  I highly recommend this venue as a newly done coffee house that with its warmth and the enthusiasm of the returning fans, makes up for not being a small typical coffee house spot.  The doors were opened well before 7, they allowed people to choose seats for the 8pm show, and I have already invited others to join me for some shows. Bear with me as I have never been to F&S nor have I heard the two artists in the show, having been living overseas for years in the 80s and 90s.  My dear cousins turned me on to both of them, who were amazing performers, and of course I have fallen in love with their music and turned to my iTunes post haste.The intimacy came in here, not related to the newness of the new digs, but to the design which was so well crafted to have a closeness for the audience and the performer for interactions.  There is a comic component to the Phillips/Phillips performers that was rendered very very effective because the people are up close.One comment I would make is that it appeared some very young people behind us were not at all reprimanded for disrupting the program.  All of Berkeley was outside for them but they chose to stay and no one approached them because we were all so interested in seeing the show.Walking to Bart from my place at Lake Merritt and from Bart in Berkeley to the theatres represents a whole new way to spend my money and I surely will.",

        "ReviewContent": "There aren't too many places like this around, a smallish venue that serves coffee/tea and has really good live music.The Freight's new digs kind of takes it out of the \"smallish\" category, but that's easily forgotten.  Its new arrangement, in theatre-style seating, however, means that if you bring coffee back, you have nowhere to put it, unless you're sitting right next to one of the rare tables.Oh, another note:  they say on their website that they open doors at 7pm.  They don't.   Also, their sound system, while brand-spanking new and totally up-to-date, seems temperamental.  I could tell that the onstage monitors weren't working well (if there were any), because the pianist had a hard time following the guitarist.  I imagine they'll work those issues out.I suspect every seat is great, and for live entertainment, I found it fairly cheap.  I noticed, however, that it wasn't sold out, and because of all the new seats, I suspect they rarely sell out.  They somehow need to find a way to get butts in the seats.The chairs, by the way, are a far cry from what they had before:  they're padded and wide enough for even the larger butts.",

        "ReviewContent": "We went on a Friday to see Chris Smithers, with Tim Erikson as the opening act. The new hall looks modern, although the reclaimed boards stuck on the side walls try in vain to give a rustic feel. The seats were very comfortable. We arrived way early and sat in the front row. The sold out show was fine. Surprisingly, I liked the opening act a lot more than Mr. Smithers.The crowd is mostly aging white Berkeley, with Birkenstocks and grey pony tails. The were polite and restrained in their response to the music, tapping their feet, but no dancing. I get the feeling they would ask you to leave if you did that. The line for the coffee bar was too long, so I can't comment on the quality there.  The acoustics were good (I listened a while from the back) throughout the hall. If you like the artists, this is an ok place to see them. You will be surrounded by old hippies.",

        "ReviewContent": "My trio came out for the first open mic hosted at the new location. This is by far the nicest open mic venue to play at. Hands down the nicest stage I've played on. The people are nice. Acts are a good variety mostly acoustic and a lot of original material. Some better than others. Suzanne was a nice host and moved things along very well. Would have been a 5-star if it weren't for the following. Lighting - Too bright on stage you can't see your audience. Sound - Great equipment. I'm sure they'll learn how to use it. There was no or little monitor mix on stage yet they have 4 or 5 monitors. This made it hard to hear ourselves esp our vocalist and we had an electric bass which couldn't be heard at all on stage. Bass players bring your own amp or you won't hear your part.Only two inputs for instruments but there were plenty of mics on stage. Don't move 'em around though. They don't seem to like that. You have to pay to get in which is fine esp since it is a first class stage. The coffee and snacks are a little pricy they could consider lowering those items since people are already paying to get in. I'm not much of an open mic fan but this place has the potential to be one hell of a place to get some original talent exposed. They could bring a good draw but just need to work on the stage sound a bit. The sound from the audience's perspective was fine.",

        "ReviewContent": "Ok.  I know this post is a bit much, but it's one of those I just have to share.I love all kinds of live music, from folk to blues to thievery.  And I appreciate musicians who continue to play music because they love it.  Maybe my friend and I went on an off night (a Friday?).   And maybe we had suddenly slipped into a parallel universe.  But oh my GOD!  I don't appreciate being charged a cover to sit on folding chairs, with no bar, to watch hippie dudes playing out of tune guitars singing off key the most terrible rendition of songs they seemingly wrote while stoned - at age 12. The freakiest part?  The entire crowd (ahem - crowd of 30 people) was nodding along and slapping their knees and getting into it.  It was the first time in my life I thought I was on candid camera... that the joke was on us... and this was all a ruse. Once I realized that it wasn't, I was seconds away from (again, another first in my life) the loudest and most inappropriate outburst of laughter in the middle of somene's performance.  The feeling of my body convulsing in uncontrollable laughter began to take over my system, but I was torn between that and the rudeness of getting up *in the middle* of his performance and being just as obvious.So I leaned into my friend's shoulder and commenced what I've coined the \"snaugh\" - which is a sneeze, a cough, and a violent laugh all mashed together.  I was horrified.  I couldn't stop.  I was crying.  I was helpless.  By the time the song was over, I was hysterical, in the craziest sense of the word, and we barely made it outside before I fell to the ground in a display of entirely involuntary and uncontrollable fits of hyperventilating laughter and diaphragm spasm, and near asphyxiation. My rational mind was awed by my inability to take over the controls of my own physical system, and to this day I have not had an experience remotely close - and I doubt I ever will.",

Sopping wet wit, a great stylized fingerpicking blues/bluegrass and an old beatup looking guild guitar that reverberated out 35 years of music every time you thumped it. He fit the freight just about perfect.Berkeley houses a lot of great folk/blues/bluegrass/etc talent and the freight is one of the places they gather (performers also come from far and wide). So the music is really top notch. One more side note... my dad used to collect up a bunch of the brownies and cookies at the end of the night, head on over to Flints BBQ and trade a bunch of them for a robs/links plate. Then he would ramble home and find me still awake, at which point we would share a BBQ and Brownies. Obviously nostalgia probably clouds the hell out of my judgment on the brownies, but those dry little light brown nuggets taste like ambrosia somewhere in the depths of my mind - especially dipped in hot sauce.",

People go here for the great performers, but I don't understand the genuine affection a lot of people hold for this place.UPDATE:And now they're taking over the downtown Berkeley Capoeira studio, which was a thriving, all-day, all-ages community center. Like downtown Berkeley needs yet another place that targets white, boomer clientele. I'm disgusted with the City of Berkeley for letting the capoeira studio go.

        "ReviewContent": "i love the freight!  it feels like a home, a musical home away from home, to me.  i give them four stars because they regularly feature musicians that i really want to go see, folks that don't turn up at other places and who i love-- Patty Larkin (witty modern folk/rock), Mike Marshall and Hamilton de Holanda (mandolin masters), Chris Smither (acoustic blues), Mary Gauthier (singer/songwriter of spare songs that quietly break you heart.)folks there are warm and welcoming, and the sound is pretty darn good.they are just affordable enough for me to keep going back: $15 to $30 for an open seating ticket.  they are just accessible enough, too-- no steps, and with rows of armless chairs that can be moved around to maximize seating room.  that said, those chairs aren't very comfortable and need an upgrade!they cheerfully sell bottled water and soda, cookies, snacks and coffee/tea.  there's also water available for free in cups, which i appreciate.sometimes there's an uptight \"eco-elite\" crowd in the audience, who push all my buttons and make me cranky.  management not responsible, i'm sure!i look forward to seeing their new digs when they move.  i hope it's even more accessible and a more comfortable venue.",

        "ReviewContent": "My girlfriend takes me here for shows on a semi-regular basis, for which I feel pretty lucky. It's unique among music venues in the bay area, for sure. Where the hell else can you see Chris Smither AND mandolin master Hamilton de Holanda? And while rubbing shoulders with the Berkeley's eco-elite, no less. That's the downside. The crowd varies from show to show, sometimes it's fine and sometimes I feel slightly uncomfortable surrounded by all the thin healthy white people. Your  mileage may vary.The seating is about 75% armless, movable chairs. Which is especially nice if you're on the wider end of the spectrum. You can be pretty comfy there, fat or thin. If you want to sit anywhere close to the front. you need to get there seriously early and line up ouside. I recommend bringing a chair for this activity. Perhaps your submissive can take the chairs back to the car after you've gone in to get the good seats. If you show up later, you will definitely be sitting in the back. Which is pretty ok, as long as you're not on the part of the floor that slants backward.  Yeah, the space could use some work, but they're moving soon to a new location, I hear. Fat friendly rating: 4 stars.",

This is my home away from home, I always feel like I'm heading across the Bay to my other living room to get cozy with the people whose music I have loved or grown up with or just discovered or haven't heard yet.  Where else can you wait on line for the bathroom with the All-Ireland Championship fiddler (Liz Carroll), or shoot the shit with Ramblin' Jack Elliot while he changes his socks, or have conversations with any of the performers while they're on stage 6 feet away from you, right in the middle of a set?  Only at the Freight.  And to top it off, the tea's organic, the vegan cookies are the size of your head, and you can dance in the aisle by yourself if you feel like it (well, ok, it IS Berkeley, you can pretty much do that anywhere, but it really is cool with everyone here).

And yes, a decent sound system, but I was at a good show Thursday night with a 13 piece band that was seriously flawed for me because the manager of the Freight and Salvage had gone and hired an incompetent sound guy.  How can you hire a sound guy who doesn't know what he's doing (and shows up 1 1/2 hours late for sound check, from what I heard from the musicians) for a 13 piece band?  That makes no sense, unless you just don't give a crap about the bands that you book.  I'd like to give 1 star for this, but again, this place does book some great acts, and hopefully the manager has better sense than to ruin good bands' shows by hiring terrible sound guys on a regular basis...",

My sister actually met her husband at the Freight.  He was playing guitar for Frank Wakefield at the time and now they are married with 2 kids.  I took my husband on our first date to the Freight to see one of my favorite Bluegrass bands: Dry Branch Fire Squad.  First dates need alcohol and knowing that the Freight only serves coffee, we hit Lanesplitters pizza right around the corner first and had some excellent pizza and just the right amount of beer.  It obviously all worked out for us.  I even volunteered for them for awhile and got to hear some wonderful folk music for free and give back a little to a place that had given my family so much over the years.  You can't beat it!",

I told him I had forgotten that it was my friends Birthday and hightailed it outta there.And ended up here. Where there was no alcohol to ease my worldly pain. Ok, why don't you people serve alcohol here? What are the alcoholics supposed to do? I'm not saying I'm an alcoholic, and I'm not saying that I can't enjoy music without it....but on this particular occassion I couldn't (on account of the crazy animal hater date)The music (Kiki Smith) was good, very innovative. Not really a fan of the folding chairs, but I like the barn atmosphere. That's really the most accurate description. Like you're at a concert in a barn. Because you are. And they don't serve alcohol. So it's like you're at a concert with the amish.Yeah, it's like that.Sorry. I was in a bad mood. I support the local music scene, I swear.I support it more when they serve alcohol there though.",
