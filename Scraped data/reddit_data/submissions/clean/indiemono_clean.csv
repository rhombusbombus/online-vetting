&amp;#x200B;

Hello.

I have compiled a list of underground production breakdowns from not-so underground producers. Each one of the videos shows a professional producers workflow, what sounds they use and how they achieve cohesion in their mixes.

The producers are:

Rival (1.5mil monthly on Spotify - NCS artist, featured on Trap Nation, support from Indiemono on Spotify and has collabed with the likes of Unknown Brain, Cadmium and Jon Becker).

Arcando (600k monthly on Spotify, huge trap artist. Releases under Future Generation, NCS, trap nation. Has collabed with Besomorph, ThatBehavior, and has multiple remixes that have reached #1 on Trap nation charts - one of these links contains and breakdown of that song).

Oddcube (Best friends with Arcando, doesn't have many releases but is an absolute BEAST. Plus we have the same name, so yeah I like him).

***BTW, everybody should watch these. FL Studio, Logic and Ableton included in these links.***

Arcando x Oddcube - Cinema Breakdown (good for seeing how instruments work together and how Arcando does drop synths/atmospheres. FL Studio and Logic Pro). [***https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ApOA0bMrLo***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ApOA0bMrLo)

Arcando x Oddcube - Halsey Remix Breakdown (Good for seeing how Arcando builds drops and how Oddcube creates atmosphere/instruments to work together). [***https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q63OcKaTT6w***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q63OcKaTT6w)

Arcando - How to build drops. (Good to see how Arcando builds his drops and he shows every sound in Serum he uses! Logic [***https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfv27luk2vY***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfv27luk2vY)

Rival - Sleepwalking breakdown. (Good for seeing a professional producers workflow and different elements to build a orchestral-trap song. Ableton). [***https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l69JXYfBzkw***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l69JXYfBzkw)

Rival - Lonely Way breakdown. (Good for seeing how Rival makes heavy drops, uses real and sampled strings, and Caravn, the vocalist, explains his process for all you song writers. Ableton). [***https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w7iVZMIEJQ***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w7iVZMIEJQ)

It's easy enough to submit on their page and if they like your music they usually will pass it on to more curators on your behalf. They are trying tp push their paid service so there's constantly messaging to upgrade and pay but there's no harm in just staying free.

a7flz1,1545169435.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,WthNCellsInterlinked,PSA: Indiemono playlists a scam?,"So I just released an album, and in an effort to get it on some curated playlists, I searched Google for some free-to-submit playlists. I've been hearing a lot about the Spotify ""fake song"" or ""fake artist"" scams going on, so I was wary of anything having to do with Spotify's broken playlist-based algorithm. I went ahead and submitted a few songs to Indiemono, despite their website having a few wierd ""red-flags"" (mostly just bad grammar, but not anything that looked too terrible).

In order to submit a song, I had to click a link to ""unlock"" the submission function (another red flag), which took me to a Spotify permissions page similar to when you connect a distributor account to Spotify.  I went ahead and allowed access to ""Toneden,"" which I later found out is an automated advertising service.

After a few hours, I looked at my playlists on Spotify, and 4 playlists which I had not followed showed up: 2 of which were playlists I submitted my songs to, and the other a top 40s playlist and a ""sad songs"" playlist. Now, I do NOT listen to top 40s, and I'd never follow a sad music playlist, so I'm wondering if when I added Toneden as an allowed interface, the automated service went and added me to follow these playlists which I have not followed. It makes sense that this would be a way for Toneden to generate followers for Indiemono playlists using real users accounts.

What do y'all think?",0,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/a7flz1/psa_indiemono_playlists_a_scam/,PSA Indiemono playlists a scam?,psa indiemono playlists a scam?,"So I just released an album, and in an effort to get it on some curated playlists, I searched Google for some free-to-submit playlists.
