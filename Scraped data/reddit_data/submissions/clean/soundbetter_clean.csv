I figured I might be able to find people willing to do it for free simply for enjoyment. However I’ve also considered paying somebody local, or hiring somebody on the website “SoundBetter” or some equivalent to meet at a studio just to record particular parts I want.

So I just had one of my songs mixed on SoundBetter and omg, the rough mix I sent him (Which I did myself and have no real knowledge in mixing) sounded 10x better than what he sent me.

This is my second time using SoundBetter to get my song mixed and both ""Mixing Engineers"" were the same. I felt like they didn't read or listen to my rough mix before.

A while back I used to get my song mixed by some guy and he did great (Sadly I can't afford his services anymore) so I know the potential is there.

Basically my question is, whats the best way to find a mixing engineer that's actually good?

My budget is around $250 so I can't afford the best mixing engineers.

I have been releasing 1 new song every 5 weeks so that I am always pushing out content and feeding the Spotify algorithm. With each new release, I promote the song for 5 weeks. I use Instagram Ads, Facebook Ads, and playlist pitching (SubmitHub and Groover). I have grown my IG from 500 to over 3k. I average at least 10k monthly listeners on Spotify and have over 200k total streams across 12 releases. I am even starting to grow at a steady pace on Apple Music just off of my ads campaign. So I'm not HUGE or anything, but I would consider myself as starting to become established. My music has high quality mixing, high quality production (I hire a professional producer on SoundBetter), and is professionally mastered. So, naturally, my music has a professional feel to it and it is something I'm proud of. So why then, does Groover troll me? Let me explain. 

Initially, I really liked Groover, mostly because it has a HUGE curator base. But after using Groover for over 1 year, I am finally convinced that 90% of the curators on this site are just trying to get paid. Why do I say this? Because, although my music sounds ""professional and on par with the industry standard,"" my song is almost NEVER added to playlists on Groover. Let me show you some screenshots:

Keep in mind that this song is a Pop Ballad with a Rap in Verse 2. So it's a Pop/Rap song with like a Marshmello type beat. It sounds very similar to something Juice Wrld, The Kid Laroi, JB, Post Malone or Halsey might put out. It is a sad song about how hard it is to let someone go with a very catchy hook, and again professionally mixed, mastered, lined up, and produced.

161efzi,1693005255.0,mixingmastering,JcTheWiz,Time and standards for Mixing in a pro studio?,"So I think I’m finally ready to visit a pro studio. I’ve been recording in my friends makeshift studio for a little while. After recording I’d just send to an engineer on sites like soundbetter. But I think the quality of the raw vocals have limited the potential of my songs, and my friends agrees. The upper limit for my budget is 80$-100$ per hour, with 100$ being absolute max if I was just completely wowed by a studio (I know price isn’t everything, but I know you get what you pay for). Because most studios seem to have a “contact for pricing” situation, I have no idea at what price Is “pro” pricing.

What I’m confused about mostly is mixing in a pro studio. 

1. Does mixing happen during booked time? For example, if I book 4 hours, and I finish tracking in 1 hour, can I dedicate the next 3 hours to mixing? And is the mix a separate price from what I paid to book the hours? Or is booking pretty much a “full package” type of situation? 

2. How long to expect a mix to be done? I’m only doing vocals, with a beat. One of the 2 songs has the beat in pretty much one track, while the other has all the different elements of the beat in separate tracks. I assume the song with the one track beat will be much shorter to mix. I just wanna gauge an average for speed per song so I know how much time to book total.

Thanks so much!","so i think i’m finally ready to visit a pro studio. i’ve been recording in my friends makeshift studio for a little while. after recording i’d just send to an engineer on sites like soundbetter. but i think the quality of the raw vocals have limited the potential of my songs, and my friends agrees. the upper limit for my budget is 80$-100$ per hour, with 100$ being absolute max if i was just completely wowed by a studio (i know price isn’t everything, but i know you get what you pay for). because most studios seem to have a “contact for pricing” situation, i have no idea at what price is “pro” pricing. what i’m confused about mostly is mixing in a pro studio.  1. does mixing happen during booked time? for example, if i book 4 hours, and i finish tracking in 1 hour, can i dedicate the next 3 hours to mixing? and is the mix a separate price from what i paid to book the hours? or is booking pretty much a “full package” type of situation?  2. how long to expect a mix to be done? i’m only doing vocals, with a beat. one of the 2 songs has the beat in pretty much one track, while the other has all the different elements of the beat in separate tracks. i assume the song with the one track beat will be much shorter to mix. i just wanna gauge an average for speed per song so i know how much time to book total. thanks so much!",9,262

Hi! I’m now working with this SoundBetter mixing/ mastering engineer. And have already payed 260$

I studied mixing and mastering at college and have mixed/ mastered many songs and had clients before. And I know what good vocals and songs sound in terms of mixing. My ears r trained really well.

And I just wanted to get my song mixed by another person to see how it sounds. Cuz mixing and mastering can take up a lot of time. And I’m not too picky as long as they make my song sounds clean and good.


But this first draft he sent me was.. just beyond awful. I’m not shitting on his hard work but the vocals are crackling, it’s the most awful part literally way too crackling and mushed. The levels all over the place and such. 

He’s a nice guy.. but when I listened to the song it sounded like he doesn’t really know lol how to mix.. I don’t really wanna work with him. And I just really don’t know what to do about this I’m like so in shock right now.

Going to rework the lyrics (you can write your verse if you want) and redo my part since it's off a bit. We'll trade off and the other will do the harmony during the others lead (if that makes sense). If you can't hit the harmony don't sweat it you can sing the lead and I can create the harmony through melodyne.

You can use the song however you want and I'll provide you with a lyric video to go with it if you wanna do anything with. All I'd ask is a link to my Spotify and credit but IDC about the money. You can have half the money it makes on my spotify as well which will be close to nothing since music is a soul sucking business!! : )

&amp;#x200B;

Looking for a collab otherwise I'd hire someone off of soundbetter so please don't text me your rate!

All you need is a way to record clean vocals and send me a wav or aiff that's in time. in tune and noise free! You don't need a studio. 

I can help you with the tech if you're not 100% on it. If you have a great voice and just wanna try something different hit me up!!

If you think I suck and just wanna do it solo that's fine too, this is out of my genre but I kinda like it so I just wanna see it through rather than add it to the pile of B sides I never release!!

So I have been toplining songs in my spare time for about 4 years now but up until about 6 months ago, I never knew what the word ""toplining"" really meant. It all started in 2019 when a DJ reached out to me and asked if I would write and sing on his track and gradually more producers and DJs started approaching me for collabs. 
This year, I decided to really lean into this field since I'm trying to do music full time but my largest barrier is my inability to produce my own songs. I've started going on my own Spotify page and looking at my artist radio, then reaching out to the artists (mostly EDM) on instagram and asking if they want to collaborate. So far, I've had pretty good success and have about 10 projects coming out this summer due to me dm'ing artists on instagram. However, going through and messaging people one by one is very time consuming and I'm not being paid, just a royalty split- which is totally fine with me for now, but eventually it would be awesome to get paid for my work. I signed up for websites such as Vocalizr and Soundbetter but I haven't really gotten any views on my profile yet.

Join us as we sit down with Char, the mastermind behind the epic metal opera Echoes of Bronze, to discuss his journey from studying aeronautical engineering to creating a concept album inspired by Greek mythology. Char shares with us his early musical influences, from his dad's vinyl collection to his love for metal bands like Symphony X and Dream Theater.

We also dive into the making of Echoes of Bronze, including Char's decision to create a metal opera format to convey his vision for the Trojan War, his search for the perfect producer and vocalists, and the challenges of recording and mixing the album across multiple locations. Throughout the conversation, Char's passion for both music and aerospace shines through, and he shares how he balances both worlds while maintaining his personal relationships. 

Join us for a fascinating discussion with a talented artist who has blended his diverse interests into a truly unique and inspiring project.

zxezg2,1672247493.0,musicproduction,PikmanDude01,How to deal with meticulous perfectionism in musical project management? I keep running in circles,"I’m a jazz/instrumental composer (and attempted producer), and I’ve been working on eleven tracks for the past three years. I’m an obsessive perfectionist, and find myself very unwilling to release my music until it is perfect or very close to perfect. I’m finding myself constantly changing my mind with regards to who should perform the music, who should mix and master, and other things.

I wanted to hire freelance session musicians from online to play on my tracks, so that they’d have more of a human feel than the VIs. However, I’ve learned that Fiverr is not the best option for me, as the vast majority of the (15+) orders I’ve made have come back unsatisfactorily. This generally boils down to performers not playing with the expressive touch and phrasing I have in mind, playing rigidly and robotically even when reference material (piano recordings I made to indicate dynamics, supplementary to the sheet music I write) is provided. Sometimes, though, the performers are outright unable to perform the music correctly at all, but accept the money anyways. On a handful of occasions, I’ve paid people only to have them submit recordings that sound wholly unpracticed.

I then circled back to focusing primarily on VIs, resolving that it’s unlikely that human freelancers will be able to pick up on the nuances of my musical visions through asynchronous recording sessions organized through a budget freelancing site. In a large number of cases, these do the job well. I’ve had people tell me that they sound indistinguishable from proper recordings (particularly my bass, drums, and orchestra sections). However, there are a handful of instruments, such as saxophones, for which there don’t seem to be any satisfactorily lifelike software emulations. SWAM saxophones just aren’t there yet, IMO. So, at the very least, I need one or more human saxophonists.

Searching for human saxophonists led me to continue searching for other instrumentalists, as well. I do not think I need to hire a trumpeter because good ones are extremely out-of-budget and okay ones likely won’t provide anything usable (my music often wanders into the extreme upper range of the instrument). I’ve received quotes for human performances of almost every track on my album, and, on SoundBetter, the average price per recording hovers around $250. I’m a college student on a limited budget; I just can’t do that to my bank account.

I want to produce professional-quality music, and I think that I’m working healthily towards that point in my composition and arrangement, but in terms of production and project management, I’ve been wandering in circles, throwing money at the walls in hopes of a miracle for three years. This album has turned into a spending problem, which may soon tangibly affect my life. One of my chief life goals is to be a successful and renowned jazz creator, but in terms of releasing an actual product I’m proud of, I’m lost. And that’s not even touching on mixing and mastering.

Tip 14: Mixing for other people

&amp;#x200B;

**Now in a bit more detail:**

**Tip 1**: Invest in some half-decent headphones

Investing in my first proper headphones was a huge step-up for me. I could suddenly hear detail that I couldn’t before, and it’s very difficult to tweak things you can’t hear!

I like my current Sennheiser 650s, but here are a few other good options:

ATH-M50XBT2:

beyerdynamic DT-770

beyerdynamic DT-1990

More importantly is getting to know the headphones and how they sound. Do this by listening to a lot of music on them!

**Tip 2**: Use reference tracks

I don’t know any producers worth their salt who don’t reference other music, particularly when it comes to the mix. If you load in a reference track to your DAW as similar as possible to what your are creating (in terms of vibe and instruments), attenuate the volume by about 12dB peak (to account for the fact it’s already been mastered), then use a spectrum analyser, it can help with visual cues (as well as the aural comparison, of course).

**Tip 3**: Balance levels and EQ in mono

Personally, I find the stereo image can make determining what’s going on from a transient and frequency perspective trickier, so I just get rid of it! Put a mono-switch on the master channel, and simply switch from mono to stereo and vice versa to check the mix still works. A mix that sounds great in mono will sound amazing in stereo.

**Tip 4**: Use a hierarchical approach to mixing

Mixing 70 or 80 tracks can be daunting. Start with the most important elements and work down in order of hierarchy. So, with dance music: Kick, then the bass with the kick, then the clap (or snare) with the kick and bass, then the lead vocal or synth, then hats, etc. etc.

**Tip 5**: Kick-anchoring at -10dB peak

If you anchor your kick so it’s peaking at about -10dB - leave it alone - and then mix everything else to work with it - the chances are you will have plenty of headroom on your master channel and not run into clipping issues.

**Tip 6**: High-pass almost everything

If you high pass EQ everything apart from the kick and bass at at least 100Hz (but usually higher, depending on the instrument, e.g. a hi-hat), this will leave lots of low-end headroom for your kick and bass. It will help clear up mud in your mix.

Caveat: Please be aware if you do this too extremely you will probably end up with a thin, tinny mix.

**Tip 7**: Separate the sub bass from main bass

Having a separate mixer channel for your sub bass can just make balancing your low-end easier. It also allows you to control the stereo width of the main bass and the sub bass separately. You can either run another track with a second synth for the sub-bass, or just split the signal of your bass in Ableton with an instrument rack. Hi-pass everything below 120Hz from your main bass, and low-pass everything above 120Hz from your sub bass.

Note: You can do this with one bass instrument and no split, e.g. EQ-ing it accordingly, but having completely separate signals allows more (and easier) control.

**Tip 8**: Kick &amp; bass buss

Sending your bass and kick to one buss is a great way to glue them together with a little saturation and a touch of compression. If your tracks low-end thickness and cohesion, this is a great way to solve it.

**Tip 9**: Auxiliary channels for spatial effects

Using auxiliary channels for spatial effects like reverb and delay gives you way more control than having them on the channel itself, as you can process the signal separately from your dry signal - particularly with regards to EQ. (note: sometimes spatial effects on the channel itself is useful, like if you want to push something back in the mix, automate some cool delay effect or want to add compression AFTER the reverb or delay).

**Tip 10**: Side-chain compression on auxiliary reverb

This ties into the last tip. If you side-chain compress your aux channel vocal reverb from your dry vocal, you can push it out of the way slightly when the dry vocal is playing, and then allow it to breathe back in the gaps between the vocals. This was an absolute game-changer for me, and allowed me to work on pop records where the vocal is front and centre.

**Tip 11**: Room reverb aux channel

Particularly good for separate drum sounds, but works on everything. Having an aux channel with a short, room reverb allows you to feed in a small amount of most elements in the mix. This will glue everything together and help it sound like it’s coming from one place.

**Tip 12**: Saturation

Another game-changer. A great tool for adding thickness and perceived loudness to a mix - particularly at the group level, as it glues elements together, too.

**Tip 13**: Checking your mix on multiple systems

If you’ve ever wondered why your track sounds good in your studio, but rubbish in your car, it’s because each system highlights certain frequencies and reduces others. This is why it’s essential to check your mix translates well across multiple systems.

This used to take ages, as I’d have to export the mix, listen to it on two or three systems (comparing it to my reference tracks), go back into the DAW, make the tweaks, and export again! 

Now there is a tool called MixChecker, which is really useful. Of course, if you have a studio with several monitoring options set up, this is quick too.

**Tip 14**: Mixing for other people

This will give you a much broader understanding of music, how to fix problems in the mix and turn out commercially viable mixes! It’s also a great way to earn money from your skills, as there are a lot of people looking to have their music mixed. It’s way easier to monetise your skills nowadays, too, with websites like Fiverr and Soundbetter to offer your services. NOTE: You might consider doing a couple of projects for free to build your portfolio, but don’t make a habit of it. You can also download stems online to practise mixing with.

Hope this helps!","i’ve mixed hundreds of songs over the past 25 years, and there are 14 “plateau-smashing” mixing tips that have had the biggest positive impact on the quality of my mixes (and career), allowing me to make a living from music. some i got directly from better producers than me, some from magazines, some from youtube, some i figured out myself. every single one of these mixing tips was a watershed moment for me that markedly “upped my game”, and unlocked a new level of possibilities. i hope you find them equally transformative! i’ve also recorded a video so you can hear examples, if you like  **tldr** tip 1 invest in some half-decent headphones  tip 2 use reference tracks tip 3 balance levels in mono tip 4 use a hierarchical approach to mixing tip 5 kick-anchoring at -10db peak tip 6 hi-pass almost everything tip 7 separate the sub bass from main bass tip 8 kick & bass busstip 9 auxiliary channels for spatial effects tip 10 side-chain compression on auxiliary reverbtip 11 room reverb aux channel tip 12 saturation tip 13 checking your mix on multiple systems tip 14 mixing for other people &x200b; **now in a bit more detail** **tip 1** invest in some half-decent headphones investing in my first proper headphones was a huge step-up for me. i could suddenly hear detail that i couldn’t before, and it’s very difficult to tweak things you can’t hear! i like my current sennheiser 650s, but here are a few other good options ath-m50xbt2 beyerdynamic dt-770 beyerdynamic dt-1990 more importantly is getting to know the headphones and how they sound. do this by listening to a lot of music on them! **tip 2** use reference tracks i don’t know any producers worth their salt who don’t reference other music, particularly when it comes to the mix. if you load in a reference track to your daw as similar as possible to what your are creating (in terms of vibe and instruments), attenuate the volume by about 12db peak (to account for the fact it’s already been mastered), then use a spectrum analyser, it can help with visual cues (as well as the aural comparison, of course). **tip 3** balance levels and eq in mono personally, i find the stereo image can make determining what’s going on from a transient and frequency perspective trickier, so i just get rid of it! put a mono-switch on the master channel, and simply switch from mono to stereo and vice versa to check the mix still works. a mix that sounds great in mono will sound amazing in stereo. **tip 4** use a hierarchical approach to mixing mixing 70 or 80 tracks can be daunting. start with the most important elements and work down in order of hierarchy. so, with dance music kick, then the bass with the kick, then the clap (or snare) with the kick and bass, then the lead vocal or synth, then hats, etc. etc. **tip 5** kick-anchoring at -10db peak if you anchor your kick so it’s peaking at about -10db - leave it alone - and then mix everything else to work with it - the chances are you will have plenty of headroom on your master channel and not run into clipping issues. **tip 6** high-pass almost everything if you high pass eq everything apart from the kick and bass at at least 100hz (but usually higher, depending on the instrument, e.g. a hi-hat), this will leave lots of low-end headroom for your kick and bass. it will help clear up mud in your mix. caveat please be aware if you do this too extremely you will probably end up with a thin, tinny mix. **tip 7** separate the sub bass from main bass having a separate mixer channel for your sub bass can just make balancing your low-end easier. it also allows you to control the stereo width of the main bass and the sub bass separately. you can either run another track with a second synth for the sub-bass, or just split the signal of your bass in ableton with an instrument rack. hi-pass everything below 120hz from your main bass, and low-pass everything above 120hz from your sub bass. note you can do this with one bass instrument and no split, e.g. eq-ing it accordingly, but having completely separate signals allows more (and easier) control. **tip 8** kick & bass buss sending your bass and kick to one buss is a great way to glue them together with a little saturation and a touch of compression. if your tracks low-end thickness and cohesion, this is a great way to solve it. **tip 9** auxiliary channels for spatial effects using auxiliary channels for spatial effects like reverb and delay gives you way more control than having them on the channel itself, as you can process the signal separately from your dry signal - particularly with regards to eq. (note sometimes spatial effects on the channel itself is useful, like if you want to push something back in the mix, automate some cool delay effect or want to add compression after the reverb or delay). **tip 10** side-chain compression on auxiliary reverb this ties into the last tip. if you side-chain compress your aux channel vocal reverb from your dry vocal, you can push it out of the way slightly when the dry vocal is playing, and then allow it to breathe back in the gaps between the vocals. this was an absolute game-changer for me, and allowed me to work on pop records where the vocal is front and centre. **tip 11** room reverb aux channel particularly good for separate drum sounds, but works on everything. having an aux channel with a short, room reverb allows you to feed in a small amount of most elements in the mix. this will glue everything together and help it sound like it’s coming from one place. **tip 12** saturation another game-changer. a great tool for adding thickness and perceived loudness to a mix - particularly at the group level, as it glues elements together, too. **tip 13** checking your mix on multiple systems if you’ve ever wondered why your track sounds good in your studio, but rubbish in your car, it’s because each system highlights certain frequencies and reduces others. this is why it’s essential to check your mix translates well across multiple systems. this used to take ages, as i’d have to export the mix, listen to it on two or three systems (comparing it to my reference tracks), go back into the daw, make the tweaks, and export again!  now there is a tool called mixchecker, which is really useful. of course, if you have a studio with several monitoring options set up, this is quick too. **tip 14** mixing for other people this will give you a much broader understanding of music, how to fix problems in the mix and turn out commercially viable mixes! it’s also a great way to earn money from your skills, as there are a lot of people looking to have their music mixed. it’s way easier to monetise your skills nowadays, too, with websites like fiverr and soundbetter to offer your services. note you might consider doing a couple of projects for free to build your portfolio, but don’t make a habit of it. you can also download stems online to practise mixing with. hope this helps!",9,1238

w1xkg6,1658145611.0,soundbetter,sabiansoldier,SoundBetter User Experience- suggestions,"So I'm a big fan of the platform and have been using it for many years. But unfortunately the site has not developed much at all in all the time I've been using it. There are some extremely annoying and obvious improvements that need to be made but they never come.

Some might remember that SoundBetter went through a big update some time back but it was such a broken disaster they rolled it back to the old version, which is where it has stayed ever since. What's amazing is that the new version didn't even fix most of the problems in user experience,, they just gave it a sleek new appearance!

So here is my top list of irritations about the SoundBetter platform

&amp;#x200B;

* **There is no ""Mark Order as Complete"" button.**

Providers deliver the work in a message and then have to hope the buyer marks it as complete. If the buyer ghosts you or forgets to mark the order as complete, you have to get support involved before you can be paid.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Can't respond to buyer inquiries without including a price.**

The flow goes something like: Buyer reaches out to provider about their job, provider draws up a proposal, buyer accepts and the workroom is opened. The problem of course is that the buyer often doesn't include enough information about the project for the provider to be able to accurately assess it. But we can't respond without quoting a price! Surely we should be able to respond to the query without having to quote a price right out of the gate. I get around this by quoting a fake price $12345 until I get enough information out of the buyer to give them a real price. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Messages display the newest messages on the top, oldest on bottom.**

What kind of messaging system has it this way?,, it's ass-backwards! This is one of the things the ""update"" fixed, but alas that was so botched that now we're stuck with the old site apparently forever. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **No persistent DM thread between provider and client**

There is no message thread that persists over the lifetime of the client, there are only individual ""workrooms"" that are specific to one project. If a client hires you multiple times, you end up  with several workrooms with that client, and your conversations quickly become a sprawling mess of messages spread over numerous locations. Trying to find one specific file or message the client sent a while ago in an old workroom? Good luck finding it. There needs to be a persistent thread for general communication, and ""workrooms"" that are specific to a project.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Lack of development on the website**

I alluded to this above, but in five years I have seen little if any real development on the platform. It's basically the same as it was in 2017. The only notable thing on the user experience end was the disastrous overhaul that was rolled back.  What little development there has been pretty pedestrian. Really just adding small features nobody asked for. Here's some of the more recent changes:

&amp;#x200B;

* Added document signing in the workroom
* Enabled self-serve refunds for Premium Providers
* Added Bonus Payment feature for Premium Providers
* Updated the payment checkout for clients (no more payment issues!)
* Added a language filter for clients to help them find the right pros
* Added the option to add your discogs credits in your provider profile
* Added a quick view of 'recent jobs with this client' to invites from repeat clients
* Added 'private notes' to the workroom (track project to-dos)
* Added 'Favorite lists', enabling clients to favorite and save providers in lists for different projects or needs
* Improved the accuracy of the dashboard
* Added an attachments area in the workroom
* Launched 'Rapper' and a 'Dolby Atmos' categories 

&amp;#x200B;

Personally I'd be more interested to see a major overhaul of the core user experience. Fix the problems that have been around since the site launched and forget about adding trivial features.

Anyways those are my biggest grievances with the functionality of the site.

vr4hq4,1656931024.0,soundbetter,sabiansoldier,Honest review of SoundBetter from a premium provider," Just thought I'd  share some thoughts and my experience as a SoundBetter premium provider for the community- I’ve been premium a little under six months now and so far, so good.

I submitted my application around sometime in 2019 and right around February 2022 I got an email out of nowhere saying I’d been accepted. Kind of unexpected but I was happy about it, nonetheless. Decided to see how things pan out.

The first thing to say about premium is that it’s pay-to-play, and it’s hefty AF to be sure. $99 per month or $999 per year. But I figured if I managed to get commissions there worth at least that much, it would be a net positive, and consider the subscription as a cost of doing business.

There are two benefits to being premium according to their marketing page:

1. Premiums appear above basics on the search pages, getting more visibility and more job invites.
2. Sending proposals to jobs on the job board. The job board is accessible to Premium providers only.

The first is a bit hard to measure, but I can confirm that since I have gone premium, I do seem to be getting more commissions organically. Who knows if that’s to do with the search result boost of premium or whether my profile is just picking up steam on its own- my profile is among the oldest and most reviewed in my little niche so it’s impossible to say.

The second is easier to assess- I have been scouting the premium jobs board most days since I got in, and I have gotten hired on quite a number of decent projects that way. Considering my niche is quite specific, it’s a bit surprising how many jobs are posted for it every day. SoundBetter offer email notifications for jobs matching your specialty, which I have. It’s really important to get in there quickly because even as premium you’re still competing with other premiums, and the early bird gets the worm. That said, it is nice to have the opportunity to be proactive in seeking out projects, even if it feels like a rat race sometimes.

To stop premiums from spam applying to every job, they’ve limited the amount of jobs you can apply for each month. This is how they put it

&gt;There is a limit of 10 proposals per month. This optimizes the fit of the proposals and balances the amount of proposals each job receives. Receiving only a handful of proposals provides a better experience for the client, significantly increases the chances they will close with someone, and ensures less competition for you.

The way this works in practice is that you have 30 “credits” that refill each month. Each application costs 3 credits which would make up your ten applications per month. However you can buy extra credits if you run out- for the low low price of $39 for 10 extra- almost $4 per job application! Pretty scandalous price but they have to make money somehow. I’ve never done that and don’t plan to.

So overall I’d say for me it’s just about worth it. It hasn’t changed the game significantly or anything, but it just opens up another way of landing jobs that isn’t available otherwise. Since I seem to be breaking even on the subscription cost it seems to make sense. If that changes then I’ll be dropping it like a hot potato.

Any other premium providers here have any experiences with it?

uaem4w,1650747313.0,edmproduction,RrentTreznor,"Approaching $100k in revenue and over 1 million streams across 6 years. How I ""made it"" as an unconventional electronic bedroom producer.","**Cross posting this from /r/ WATMM - I thought it might be worth sharing here as well:**

**Disclaimer:** If you're looking for a clear-cut way to establish your brand as a producer, you may want to look elsewhere. I wish I could say my success was the result of talent, hard work, and a fundamental understanding of the system - but that's not true.

I'll start by saying I don't know music theory. I can't play a keyboard upon request. Can't jam with a band. My musical creation process relies on a whole lot of chord progression designs through trial and error. Since I don't have an especially clear concept of what notes create what chords, it's a bit more cumbersome of a process than those musicians who can translate a sound from their head straight to piano roll.

My life has always revolved around music, but exclusively from a listener's perspective. It wasn't until I was in my mid twenties that I download a phone synthesizer and began messing around. Then, I graduated to Garageband and, eventually, Logic Pro X. In 2015, I spent about a year creating a couple dozen cheesy songs and releasing them under my own name on Soundcloud.

At this point, I was ready to make my first (of two) monikers and release a single on Spotify. I snagged a royalty free stock photo, manipulated it a bit, and I was live. Fast forward a couple more song releases. I decided I wanted to release another song I just made under a new moniker because it was stylistically a little different. This is where things went bananas. Around 2016-2017, someone in the Editorial dept. on Spotify became my cheerleader and began adding my songs to some high profile playlists for moniker 1. Then moniker 2, which I have no reason to believe anyone knew to associate with moniker 1, ended up getting posted on New Music Friday. A couple hundred thousand streams and multiple lands on the Spotify Viral 50 list for both monikers later, I was as confused as I was excited.

For reference, at this time, I had only the most basic understanding of reverb and EQ. I paid an awesome gentleman from Italy whom I found on Soundbetter $80 a track to mix and master for me. I was pretty picky that he didn't do much stylistically to change the song during his mixing process, but he definitely helped to create a more radio-ready tune - in addition to expanding the mix space a little bit.

Fast forward a few months, and I get an email with a notification that my publisher, CD Baby, is sending me a few thousand dollars. I had gotten a few hundred for the streams so far, but this was something different. It took me about 2-3 more deposits of many thousands of dollars for me to finally figure out what had happened: CD Baby hooked me up. They discovered one of my songs and submitted it for placement in Spotify Ad Studio commercials (I think these are the commercials that folks who don't pay for premium listen to every third song or so).

Fast forward about two years and $40,000 of additional revenue from this one very simple song, and I get a message from a fan saying they saw another song of mine in a Samsung commercial. I thought they were mistaken, but when they sent me the link, there I was. Featured in a Samsung Galaxy Buds Live commercial that went as far as showing my song playing from a phone - on display for the world to see. CD Baby came through again with another placement for another song.

Fast forward tens of thousands of dollars later (same Spotify Ad Studio song), 400,000 streams for my moniker that I stopped releasing in after 2017, and approaching 1,000,000 streams for my current moniker, I look back on the whole journey and don't fully process it. What's interesting is I am still sort of riding high on the coattails of good things that happened to me years ago. Sure, I continue to get paid for my music, but if you combine all the streams of my last ten or so songs, it might add up to half of the streams of just one of the 4-5 singles I put out early in my career that took off.

If I were to surmise why that is, I'd say the reason is twofold. First, I simply didn't capitalize on all that success that occurred at the start of my career. I didn't establish my brand, nor did I go wild on social media trying to keep the party going for as long as I could. That, coupled with the fact that I got in at just the right time, with a sound (featuring a lot of vocal sampling) that hadn't necessarily been repurposed and regurgitated to the point it has today. But, with each new release, I got a better sense of just how saturated not only my market, but *the* market, had become.

With that said, I think I made some interesting tactical moves to make myself known. I picked cool names for my monikers and provided some neat album art. In retrospect, I genuinely think that was half the battle - just finding a way to stand out amongst a sea of album covers and band names - before you're ever even actually heard.

**Note:** There's one important factor I need to add here. I was a playlist curator before I began making music. I love curating music, and still run my low-key indie blog featuring all my favorite new music. But back in 2014-2015, I had a decent following that translated to a couple thousand Spotify followers. And what happened, without any planning on my part, was that when I converted my profile in Spotify to my music moniker, all of those followers immediately became followers of said moniker. My guess? I had some Spotify employees following my playlists and they, in turn, discovered me through that avenue. Pure. Random. Luck. This was not a strategic maneuver on my part, kind of like how Lil Nas X developed a massive twitter following posting memes and videos before releasing Old Town Road. My circumstance was kind of like a poor man's version of that - and completely unintentional.

And now? For me, things are good. I have a supplemental income that allows me to fund my passion and provide for my family. I still don't self promote much, and I don't much submit my music to labels, curators, or ad agencies, but maybe someday I will. I think perhaps my glory days in regards to my music career might be behind me, but I feel pretty confident that my best music certainly isn't.

I wish I could say my success was the result of talent, hard work, and a fundamental understanding of the system - but that's not true. I'll start by saying I don't know music theory. I can't play a keyboard upon request. Can't jam with a band. My musical creation process relies on a whole lot of chord progression designs through trial and error. Since I don't have an especially clear concept of what notes create what chords, it's a bit more cumbersome of a process than those musicians who can translate a sound from their head straight to piano roll. My life has always revolved around music, but exclusively from a listener's perspective. It wasn't until I was in my mid twenties that I download a phone synthesizer and began messing around. Then, I graduated to Garageband and, eventually, Logic Pro X. In 2015, I spent about a year creating a couple dozen cheesy songs and releasing them under my own name on Soundcloud. At this point, I was ready to make my first (of two) monikers and release a single on Spotify. I snagged a royalty free stock photo, manipulated it a bit, and I was live. Fast forward a couple more song releases. I decided I wanted to release another song I just made under a new moniker because it was stylistically a little different. This is where things went bananas. Around 2016-2017, someone in the Editorial dept. on Spotify became my cheerleader and began adding my songs to some high profile playlists for moniker 1. Then moniker 2, which I have no reason to believe anyone knew to associate with moniker 1, ended up getting posted on New Music Friday. A couple hundred thousand streams and multiple lands on the Spotify Viral 50 list for both monikers later, I was as confused as I was excited. For reference, at this time, I had only the most basic understanding of reverb and EQ. I paid an awesome gentleman from Italy whom I found on Soundbetter $80 a track to mix and master for me. I was pretty picky that he didn't do much stylistically to change the song during his mixing process, but he definitely helped to create a more radio-ready tune - in addition to expanding the mix space a little bit. Fast forward a few months, and I get an email with a notification that my publisher, CD Baby, is sending me a few thousand dollars. I had gotten a few hundred for the streams so far, but this was something different. It took me about 2-3 more deposits of many thousands of dollars for me to finally figure out what had happened CD Baby hooked me up. They discovered one of my songs and submitted it for placement in Spotify Ad Studio commercials (I think these are the commercials that folks who don't pay for premium listen to every third song or so). Fast forward about two years and $40,000 of additional revenue from this one very simple song, and I get a message from a fan saying they saw another song of mine in a Samsung commercial. I thought they were mistaken, but when they sent me the link, there I was. Featured in a Samsung Galaxy Buds Live commercial that went as far as showing my song playing from a phone - on display for the world to see. CD Baby came through again with another placement for another song. Fast forward tens of thousands of dollars later (same Spotify Ad Studio song), 400,000 streams for my moniker that I stopped releasing in after 2017, and approaching 1,000,000 streams for my current moniker, I look back on the whole journey and don't fully process it. What's interesting is I am still sort of riding high on the coattails of good things that happened to me years ago. Sure, I continue to get paid for my music, but if you combine all the streams of my last ten or so songs, it might add up to half of the streams of just one of the 4-5 singles I put out early in my career that took off. If I were to surmise why that is, I'd say the reason is twofold. First, I simply didn't capitalize on all that success that occurred at the start of my career. I didn't establish my brand, nor did I go wild on social media trying to keep the party going for as long as I could. That, coupled with the fact that I got in at just the right time, with a sound (featuring a lot of vocal sampling) that hadn't necessarily been repurposed and regurgitated to the point it has today. But, with each new release, I got a better sense of just how saturated not only my market, but *the* market, had become. With that said, I think I made some interesting tactical moves to make myself known. I picked cool names for my monikers and provided some neat album art. In retrospect, I genuinely think that was half the battle - just finding a way to stand out amongst a sea of album covers and band names - before you're ever even actually heard. **Note** There's one important factor I need to add here. I was a playlist curator before I began making music. I love curating music, and still run my low-key indie blog featuring all my favorite new music. But back in 2014-2015, I had a decent following that translated to a couple thousand Spotify followers. And what happened, without any planning on my part, was that when I converted my profile in Spotify to my music moniker, all of those followers immediately became followers of said moniker. My guess? I had some Spotify employees following my playlists and they, in turn, discovered me through that avenue. Pure. Random. Luck. This was not a strategic maneuver on my part, kind of like how Lil Nas X developed a massive twitter following posting memes and videos before releasing Old Town Road. My circumstance was kind of like a poor man's version of that - and completely unintentional. And now? For me, things are good. I have a supplemental income that allows me to fund my passion and provide for my family. I still don't self promote much, and I don't much submit my music to labels, curators, or ad agencies, but maybe someday I will. I think perhaps my glory days in regards to my music career might be behind me, but I feel pretty confident that my best music certainly isn't. I've never been all that into promoting myself, and I doubt that will change. So, it might require a little more good luck if I want to sustain all the positive events that have transpired so far in my career.  And back to that disclaimer.

I’ve been a singer since I was two years old, and although I do write songs as well, it takes me a very long time to finish them and I’m admittedly not able to write in the style I actually want to perform. I’m really at a loss for where to start or find collaborators and was wondering how practical it is to hire songwriters say, on Soundbetter or Fiverr? It just doesn’t seem sustainable longterm to me.. so would I be better off just trying to befriend songwriters organically? 

I’m teaching myself production right now and considering taking a songwriting class to improve my skills, but I worry that the ability I’m hoping to gain can’t be taught. It’s just a huge roadblock that I’m for the time being, unable to write music that’s actually fun and effortless. A lot of my songs are heavy personal shit, don’t really have a beat, or are written explicitly for the acoustic guitar; and while music like that has its place in the world, I know it’s not what’s going to sell, and though having a more commercial focus may be taboo in the music scene, it does and has always mattered to me. I want to put out music that showcases my voice to the greatest possible extent, and the lowkey songs I actually pen just don’t do that, “fun” factor aside. 

I know I have the vocal talent that it takes to be successful, and certainly enough writing chops to contribute in some way to my own projects, but I can’t do it alone and I get discouraged because I have no idea how to go about making those connections.

sj77g3,1643854787.0,AutisticAdults,lacitygirl88,Successful Burnout Recovery?,"Hey everyone- I'm 26 NB going through the worst burnout of my life. I didn't realize I was autistic until last fall. I have such a little capacity for anything right now and working is killing me. My partner and I were going down to one car anyway and I am using some of the money from selling my car to take one month off work to hopefully recover. 

I am a musician and actor with my ""day job"" teaching private students. I work anywhere from 10-25 hours per week, which doesn't seem like a lot, but it is exhausting. I've realized in the past few months it's because I have to mask the entire time during those hours which is just SO much. I hate feeling like I have to be ""on"".

During my ""leave-of-absence"" as I'm calling it, I plan on brainstorming other ways I can make money that will minimize my need to mask (probably doing remote studio work via Soundbetter as I am trained as an audio engineer as well). 

I've taken breaks before but never felt like they helped; they simply put a band-aid on the solution. It feels like the state of burnout immediately begins again when I have to work again. I have no energy for my own music, for any kind of self care, for cooking, cleaning, ANYTHING.

Every person may also find a suitable artist for his or her hits via online freelance sources as a Fiverr. Here are worldwide freelancers and from a wide variety of areas from sales copywriting, from design to vocalists. Fiverr isn’t concretely designed for audio directors and artists, but it’s really light to pick those freelancers who work in the concern margin.

**SoundBetter**

puycp6,1632539013.0,audioengineering,DoNotSexToThis,Soundbetter or worse?,"Recently finished a song as the producer and mix engineer. Figured I'd try getting the song mastered by someone with an outside perspective and more mastering experience and environment. Had a specific mastering house in mind but decided to try, for the first time ever, Soundbetter.

The platform itself is fine, so I find basically the highest-rated mastering engineer that also apparently specializes in similar music and we're off to the races. Their promoted masters sound AMAZING in my studio so I'm excited.

I send 32 bit mix no dither and a LOT of headroom, clarity, no bus processing, etc. along with my own mastered version at 16 bit Pow-r 3 dither for vibe reference, in addition to a reference artist whose music is very similar and contextualizes the sonic goal (which was definitely not utilized).

First return is a massively bricked (literally distorting at some points with THE LOW END ITSELF being a flat chopped waveform) master. No other apparent treatment except a reduction in some offensive high freq and maybe multiband stereo field adjustment from what I could tell.

At that point I realized I should have given more information, so no fault of theirs. I clarify some things and I also ask if there's anything I can do in the mix to facilitate the goal. No answer on the questions, none. I had this idea that they could recommend problematic mix issues from their perspective I could address to assist a better master. No. There was none of that.

Info given and unanswered questions asked, second master comes back quick as hell which ultimately amounts to a dial back on the compression / limiting threshold and seemingly the removal of a sub generator or multiband extreme lift on the low end. Second master now sounds like a louder version of my own master except muddy and less dynamic.

I get it, my mix could require improvements to get where I'm aiming but I don't get any feedback on it at all. So I pay them and thank them for their time. 

Never again.

Anyone else have experience with that service? Is it better to send to a specific mastering house? Any suggestions on that front? (Electronic music but not the kind that needs to be loud and abrasive)

The only two things I'm unsure about still are the vocal possibly sounding harsh/""stingy"" and the amount of bass possibly varying throughout the track.

In earlier notes I asked to reduce the harshness of the vocal since it was bugging me (like it kinda felt a bit uneasy listening to it) and it's better now but I don't know if it's good now or not since I've listened to it a lot already.

The other thing being the amount of ""bass"" (as in frequency) was a bit different in different parts (or so I thought) but the guy said it was the same but he still bumped it up here and there and I'm not sure about that either anymore. Like I felt that the drop had way more bass than 2nd verse but he said he mixed them the same and it's the same bass track.

Anyone wanna spend a quick minute to check the vocal and what do you think about the bass ""difference"" in, say, the second verse and the drop?

I’ve been producing edm for 10+ years now, but I’ve recently found that I love writing and producing songs in different genres like pop, country, edm. Traditional route would be to work with artists and try to flip those songs with them and be a songwriter on those tracks. However, is there space for a producer that just likes writing/producing songs from all kinds of very different genres and releasing them? I know diplo is doing this somewhat with some of his tracks - but is there any producer you can think of that puts out a traditional country tune followed by a modern pop tune for example? 

Reason I’m asking is that I really love making these tracks from all over the place, but the concept of being an “artist” can be so confining when you have to think about your “sound” and pleasing a fan base. The concept of having to pitch these tracks to artists is also a pain in the ass since the artists you want aren’t the artists that answer, and the artists that answer aren’t typically the artists you want (I know I’m generalizing here but you get the point). It would be so much cooler to just write songs I like, pay a singer on SoundBetter, and then market each track individually.

Thanks all.,so i’ve recorded acoustic and vocals in 44.1. they sound great. i’ve comped these tracks and pulled a really nice sound. this song is the third in a series which will eventually be mastered. the previous two were also completed made in 44.1k. i’ve just had a session player record some drums for me over on soundbetter. he’s exported the files in 48k. should i downsample these and continue the track in 44.1 or re-record acoustic and voice over the new drums in 48k? any other suggestions? i was under some assumption that making all tracks the same sample rate is better for mastering as a collective. thanks all.,4,109

I'm mostly asking because currently, I just have a SoundBetter account and a Fiverr account but it's been hard finding clients and the clients I do have are more through personal connections. I know one of the ways to get more client work is to start off by meeting people and building a genuine connection but those take time (even though I prefer that route) but how would one go about ""quick-firing"" your service to people without it coming off as bad or like too much self-promo?

kmtxyj,1609298795.0,AskNYC,cutedeadgrrl,Musicians in large cities: How do I find other musicians/producers?,"Hi! I am a vocalist in NYC and I make a lot of indie pop music that is similar to Phoebe Bridgers, Julien Baker, Norah Jones, Lianne La Havas, Corinne Bailey Rae, and T Swift's recent album ""folklore"". So, basically, very vocals focused and simple instrumental backgrounds that really suit the voice. So far, I've been producing my works by myself and with people at my music college because I'm a music student, but it is quite difficult. I was wondering if there was a way to meet other musicians or producers so I can hopefully collab with someone. I know soundbetter and vocalizer exist, but I want something more in-person.

the only catch- leave an honest review on my soundbetter page on your experience with me and the quality you received. 

the last time i ran this deal i has great experiences with the artists and i actually took up 3 projects because i had the time, but i received no reviews from them so if that continues then i don’t think i’ll do this very often. 

if you aren’t one of the first few people then you are still eligible for a deal! -shoot me a message on soundbetter and let me know you saw this post on reddit and you will receive a $35 mix and master (over 50% my price) up to 4 songs. visit my website below, go to submissions and pm me through soundbetter :)

I know you get what you pay for in this business. But I’m gonna be honest, I can’t afford close to the full on professional mixing service costs (which seems to be at least $300 per song). At best I can afford half of that price per track. At the same time I want to release my tracks on streaming services. 

I was wondering the best places to look for any mix engineers that can fit my budget? I’ve checked Fiverr, but I’ve seen people say it’s hit or miss. Checked soundbetter, which seems legit. Or is searching on Reddit the perfect place for someone in my situation?

gkxzjt,1589648219.0,edmproduction,ChrisColtonNYC,A beginner-intermediate composition question I cannot find the answer for (so turning to the best community out there...),"I have been producing music for three years. I still know nothing but am improving everyday thanks to this community and YouTube. I have been working with vocal samples (outside of Splice as they are used everywhere) and things are turning out OK. With that said, I want to take the step to work with real vocalists (Fiverr or SoundBetter).

**That said, I have no idea how the process even works in terms of actually making the music.** 

With the vocal sample (or remix), I can build the entire track either utilizing the melody in the verse for the drop (or making up another melody) with my own chords, bass lines, rhythms, percussion, fx, etc.

With a vocalist, am I just giving them a sheet of music (which I wouldnt know how to do - all my reading of music is confined to FL studio) and the lyrics? They come back with wav/midi files I can dump into my project?

How do more seasoned producers do it? There are LOTS of artists on Spotify with sub 10,000 followers (an amazing accomplishment) that are banging out tracks on a monthly basis with new vocalists. Are they using similar services or do record labels just have singers on demand. Are they taking an already established verse / piece of music and turning it into a full process? Is it a collaborative process between the two? Does someone just lay down chords and then a jam session and voila?

Tl;dr: How to transition to from instrumental tracks to ones with professional vocalists (not using existing samples)",3,0.72,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/gkxzjt/a_beginnerintermediate_composition_question_i/,A beginner-intermediate composition question I cannot find the answer for (so turning to the best community out there...),a beginner-intermediate composition question i cannot find the answer for (so turning to the best community out there...),"I have been producing music for three years.

Ran a search through the subreddit but I don't think I was able to find what I was looking for. So thought I'd ask here.

Last year I attended the Global Game Jam, and did some lyrics/dialogue for the game. The composer on our team approached me and admired my work enough that he wanted to hire me to help with his song lyrics (and potentially other work - mixing or composing, but primarily lyrics). 

We would both like to draft a contract, but I am unsure where to start. He believes offering an upfront fee for the work + royalties would be fair, and is more than willing to go back and forth to figure something that works out for both of us.

Problem is - I've been looking at various contract templates and I'm totally lost on where to begin! I read that SoundBetter is one way of doing it. He's asked me to draft the terms of agreement, which I also read that he's supposed to do first? I'm just not sure where to start, what would be fair, what are general stipulations of this kind of agreement, etc.

Any help would be appreciated!

The 10 Tips are:

1. Record Bands Or Artists For Free
2. Shadowing
3. Don’t Ask For A Job
4. Build Up A Portfolio
5. Study
6. Lead Magnet
7. Build Meaningful Relationships
8. Apply For Jobs/Projects Online

bxl3oc,1559850473.0,edmproduction,Hypersaw,How could I find a (really) good producer to hire ?,"I am a songwriter and a composer, I write my songs, my music on piano, and then I would love to record vocals and chord progression + melodies, and find a talented producer to produce my songs to a pro level.

&amp;#x200B;

My favourite genre by far is progressive house, songs similar to this :  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mX6LyBvUes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mX6LyBvUes) 

&amp;#x200B;

You may ask : ""Why don't you become a producer yourself ?"" =&gt; Well... I have a bad hearing, and everything I would do (as a producer) would sound very amateur. This is one of the reason.

&amp;#x200B;

When I see ghost producing websites, wich sell ghost productions (I don't want to buy one, but I look just for informations), 95% of the productions are lifeless, most of the progressive house / EDM are very bad sounding, cheesy melodies, cheap synths, bad arrangement it all sounds horrible.

It feels like this kind of people are beginner and/or just make badly produced tracks in hope of easy money.I can understand them because having our name hided once the track is released isn't motivating to make good work.

&amp;#x200B;

So, to make it short : should I directly contact producers that I like (most are independants producers and not superstars, or should I go with a specialized in working for other artists producers ?

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, there is a Soundbetter website too where you can hire a studio producer.

&amp;#x200B;

Many are EDM producers, and most of them, if not all, are professional. But I doubt they really master each specific genres of EDM, and so I am a bit worried about hiring one of them.

I’ve payed for mixing before, but it’s been difficult to find someone reliable. Looked on Soundbetter for awhile (terrible search algorithm) but the prices are very inflated for the quality in the previews on the users’ profiles. I just need a mix that sounds glued and halfway professional.

b7qkdh,1554055052.0,musicproduction,Hypersaw,How much cost a music producer in EDM ?," 

Hi ! I decided to work with a music producer to produce and mix my music, in a professional way of course.

The reason I do that is that I have hearing loss on high frequencies, so mixing would be very difficult for me.

But to be short : I am into Pop/Progressive house. I write my lyrics, compose my music, so the producer will NOT have to compose everything by himself.  
I will record many instruments (piano, guitar, violins, etc.) and vocals and then send him to work on. For the drop part (especially for progressive house), I will make a quick draw of what is needed. But I will also give him the melody, many layers (I use Nexus2 a lot and you have plenty ready to use sounds).

So basically the producer have to mix/master, and work on the arrangement. He will have an important role in the music creation, because he will add many instruments (kick, effects, layers) and a big role on the song structure (making breaks/risers). But the core of the sound would be from me.

So, here is my question : what would be the price for an EDM professional producer ?

On a forum discussion, someone said that it was between 900 dollars and 4800 dollars on average, and that basically 900 dollars would be a very bad result (wich is absurd for me, why would you pay for something bad ?!!)

And I contacted many pro studio producers on Soundbetter. One of them is a Trance producer wich is played on A State Of Trance by Armin Van Buuren, and which has his music published on Armada music.

Obviously his music sound very good.

And he say me this : ""Budget wise $600 per track would be a honest industry standard from what I know as well from Armada, especially with mixing and mastering the track too "" to produce my music.

I contacted some other producers. One said 700 dollars, the other said me his minimum charge is 790 dollars (mix/master included).

So it is far far away of the 2500 euros per track without any mixing.

Could you explain me what are the most common price for an EDM production ?

1) I understand I'm supposed to send them the track (either stems or the final mix) and my vocal tracks. So would I send them a wav of my main vocal, another wav of my adlibs, another wav of my backing vocals etc?

2) Is it still worth it to use online mixing services even though I can't get the best dry recording at home?

a40502,1544191335.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,TiltAbricot,Finding the good pro and creative mixing engineer for my songs,"I produce my songs. I strive to have a professional sound, I do it very carefully. The number of tracks is quite high (50 to 80). The style is indie rock, I guess (the drums are played on electronic drums by using superior drummer, but I still have drums instead of a beat, and quite a lot of guitars).

My problem is to find a mixing engineer for them. The thing is I would like a guy with a sound of his own, someone being able to bring a creative perspective on the project. Ideally someone to work with on the long run.

For me the options are :

1. Soundbetter / upwork / Gearslutz etc. Where you can find a pro, but it's a ""generic"" pro. You see he can mix, but I'm not sure that he really has a sound. I am usually not impressed. Usually for up to 300 to 400 $ a day (I guess you could mix one of my songs in a day)
2. At the opposite end of the spectrum, as I am a very big fan of the Shins and Fleet Foxes, I asked Phil Ek and for the Tame Impala sound I asked Dave Fridmann! :) Fridmann never responded but I got a response from Phil directly which was cool. Obviously the price is higher (between 1000 and 2500$ per song, not including studio fees)

=&gt; What I'm looking for in between the 2. Somebody with a real sound and accomplishment but just below the Phil Ek/Dave Fridmann level. I keep scratching my brain for albums that I like that would be not the superstar status, to find the mixing engineer on discogs, but it's quite hard. Maybe the next still unknown genius in the indie sphere :)

I'd like some perspective. Anybody has experience on the subject ? Am I overthinking this ? 

I am not asking for names (although if you do in the same vein that would be cool) but more if the method makes sense and if you have tips.

6rjt3e,1501845666.0,Songwriters,Ed_Bokonon,Some advices for the old_school guy.,"Hello to everyone !

I need to some advice.

Maybe a short note about me at the beginning to helps you understand my case.

I’m songwriter (not producer) and kind of hook/riff_maker (someone who gives an ideas / catchy themes and can easily transform them into whole arrangement track or song).

Perfectly finds myself to work in larger groups, especially with topline writers, lyrycist and producers.

There is no matter in which music genre I would work on - I think I'm kinda versatile.

And now, questions:

1) What city in the whole of the US offers the greatest opportunities for growth and engaging relationships that lead to broader collaboration and music industry presence ?

2) Can you recommend me places worth visiting, communities worth getting into, and career paths that I should take ?

3) How far today's realities are away from the romantic myth that if you want to make a success you just should come to a big city with good songs / ideas, knock to the door of a famous producer and start working with serious people on serious projects.

4) I've got songs to produce for other artists - what should be the next step / where I can send it to have a resoned hope someone will listening it and maybe someday give me a feedback.


5) Where I can find A&amp;R managers base and labels I can send my music to ?

6) What about SOUNDBETTER ? Does it really helpful to reach the people I could work with ?

Thanks in advance for any feedback !

P.S.

I’m open for any collaboration - we can always talk about it privately !",5,,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Songwriters/comments/6rjt3e/some_advices_for_the_old_school_guy/,Some advices for the old_school guy.,some advices for the old_school guy.,"Hello to everyone !

I am a beginner bedroom music producer, and up until now have always mixed my own tracks. But I decided that, for my latest track, I'd pay some money and get a professional to mix it to see how much of a difference it would make. I put it up on soundbetter and got a 5 replies immediately. 

There is one mixer whose examples I liked a lot and would be willing to add some extra sounds in, but I was also contacted by Yoad Nevo, who has mixed for SIA/Petshopboys/etc. saying that he likes my song, and wants to mix it too. However Yoad would just be mixing, and not adding extra instruments or anything like the other guy potentially would (keeping in mind I'm using the logic stock instruments).

I am leaning towards the other guy for this reason, but am I crazy to not go with someone like Yoad who seems like a bit of an industry legend? Also, am I letting this get to my head way too much?

5qcac9,1485459446.0,audioengineering,alexanderalright,What I learned from my first outside mastering experience,"Recent responses in another thread here made me want to post this. I hope it helps others in some way and also opens up a discussion because I could, of course, have done something differently or had the wrong expectations.  

1) I shouldn't have been desperate to hit a timeline. I read many articles that pinpointed 'ideal' release dates for new artists and became fixated on hitting a date. When many inquiries for mastering on sites like SoundBetter didn't get replies for months I got concerned and honestly paranoid - maybe my music was so terrible that people didn't even want to be paid to 'polish a turd'. Desperately wanting mastering put me at a disadvantage when I found someone who would work with me.  

2) I shouldn't have paid everything up front. Just like with major work on your house or car, I should have held money back as a final payment once I was totally happy with the product I was receiving. Maybe others with experience in the field will tell me this isn't how it's done or have more detail to add. 

3) I was asked to leave a review before two of the tracks I requested changes on were sent to me. I felt, perhaps incorrectly or just from paranoia, that he wouldn't have fixed the tracks without me leaving a higher rated review. I should have waited and been honest in my review. 

4) I should have asked for, even at additional cost, a review session. Or maybe that should have been included. Basically, he sent me a few tracks 'completed' but then listed all of the problems he had with them like conflicting bass in sections. If I would have known about that then I would have fixed it before he did all of the mastering, instead of sending him a revised file he expected to be paid a second time for mastering.  

5) For details/comparison for those getting quotes, I paid $1100 for mastering on 7 tracks. I'm generally happy with most of them, but the audio levels were not consistent across all tracks, and some key audio on some of them were turned down much much too low. I don't know if I over or under paid, but I do know that after contacting over 10 people about mastering, he's the only person who replied (he did have samples of his work and a website).  

Comments and feedback are greatly appreciated, as this was my first experience and I'm sure there are other things I could learn about this process.
