1auqssj,1708358582.0,musicmarketing,saitej_19032000,How to get initial traction (based on comments from this subreddit),"Hello everyone,

One of my posts did very well recently and I got a ton of feedback on 'how to get initial traction on songs.'

This post will summarise all the advice I got.

Original Post: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/musicmarketing/s/QDpQUwh53V


Tips to get initial traction.

1. Collaborate with other artists - This was the most common advice of all. Doesn't cost much and is fun too. Only problem, there aren't much platforms that allow us to do this automatically, so you actually have to reach out to people.

2. SubmitHub - spend some bucks and you get a good deal, problem is that it is hard to predict how much you can make out of your investment.

3. Spotify and Meta Ads - ear what you can chew type

4. Live shows, open mics - personally, toughest one but well worth it 

5. Instagram Reels/Tiktok - they help you get the attention of labels and make your life easier. A chance to go viral. Hardest part is being consistent. (? Maybe an app that has templates to simply record and it automatically posts it for me..idk)

6. Repostexchange - this one is pretty old. Takes time to get results. Good for getting feedback.

Thankyou all for responding. If you all have any more ideas, feel free to share them below. I'll add them as they come 

Fun Discussion - submithub and repostexchange are great platforms, but not the best for us, if you want an app, what features would you need it to have?

1atbd23,1708201450.0,musicmarketing,jimmyslaysdragons,"Blessed by the Release Radar algorithm on our previous single, but not on our current one. Any insight?","Hi all, my indie rock band is currently releasing our new EP as singles with the waterfall method every 6 weeks. 

This is our second EP. Prior to releasing the first single from this new EP, we were averaging only 25-30 monthly listeners on our original EP and we had \~60 followers.

For whatever reason, our second single got picked up by Spotify's Release Radar and was streamed by an extra \~1,500 listeners above our normal amount. However, this did not happen for our first our third single, even though we do the same thing for each single: Pitch to Spotify editorial 1 month in advance of release and then pitch to \~15 playlists on SubmitHub on release day.

* Single #1: Released and submitted to playlists on SubmitHub. Got on 4 playlists. \~400 streams in the first week. \~20 streams from Release Radar.
* Single #2: Released and submitted to playlists on SubmitHub. Got on 5 playlists. \~500 streams in the first week. \~20 streams from Release Radar in the first week. **BUT** in the **second week**, it suddenly got another **1,500 streams** from Release Radar. We gained 25 new followers and peaked at around 2,200 monthly listeners.
* Single #3: Released last week and submitted to playlists on SubmitHub. Got on 4 playlists. \~300 streams in the first week. \~40 streams from Release Radar. **Did not get added to more Release Radar playlists in week 2.**

After Single #2's unexpected success, I was hoping that Single #3 would get the same Release Radar bump, but it didn't happen.

Anyone have insight into what happened here? We have 2 more singles in the pipeline and I'd love to increase their chances of getting that Release Radar bump again. Thanks!

1akm9xz,1707257447.0,musicmarketing,NoName22415,General Question - Where should I spend money on promotion?,"Hello,  
New to this community, I did read through the commonly asked questions and still just wanted to get a feel for others' experiences out there. I have a band, fairly newly formed, but has kind of built a small amount of momentum.   
We do all the self promotion stuff, have used submithub and submitlink, gone through the tedious processes of finding playlist curators and reaching out directly, all that stuff, basically if it can be done for free, we have and continue to do it.  
Personally, I do not like submithub or submitlink, and it has a lot to do with our music. We do reggae rock, and often the feedback is overwhelmingly positive, but we are either too heavy or not heavy enough to be appropriate for playlists, though we have gotten onto a few pretty good ones - its just not nearly the success rate that would make me want to continue to throw funds at these sites.   


The majority of our plays now come from spotify radio, which is nice, but we really want to see what we can do to push it to another level.   


We have a song releasing March 1st, and I am contemplating using Spotify Marquee, but there is so much conflicting information online. I have also heard good things about groover and haven't tried it, same with Playlist push.   


What have your experiences been? Have any of these services shown actual positive results for you? Did you go a different route and possibly hire a marketing team, and if so, how did that go?

I am attaching images for everyone to be as transparent as possible, its really hard to get a good idea of how things work within submit hub if you aren't getting the numbers.  
To start, I have used Submit Hub before with moderate success, I could get songs accepted before but I have drastically improved as a music artist and producer. I changed my name to Oriiaell and then really started the push to build in music about 3 months ago and was previously at 12 listeners per month at the beginning of January.

**Current Listeners Per Month:** 705, I don't know if it's a gimmick or if that will stay as long as I am stay consistent.  
**Money Spent:** $80 with submithub to get premium credits to submit to playlisters  
**Effects of Jumping up in Spotify Listeners:** Nothing has changed in my opinion so far, it didn't lead to a spike in more followers on my personal platforms. I can't really read into these numbers to pull concrete facts of what a jump in 700 plus listeners has done. This isn't a complaint, haha, just answering that question if someone has it.  
**Artist Name:** Oriiaell, I put this here so you can look it up or visit my reddit profile to verify im legit  
**My Genres:** HipHop &amp; RnB Mainly  
**Would I pay money again:** To be determined

**Tips for Submit Hub:**

* I really went through most of their playlists and made sure to strongly categorize my song, the song I used was SomeWhere, I produced, recorded the vocals, mixed, and mastered it. I also made sure to pop out an instrumental version so I could shoot 2 shots at one time. 
* I chose emo rap and sad songs because that is the energy and vibe that it has.
* Be very particular about the playlist, as most of you know, they will be picky about your song
* Songs under 3 minutes do best 
* If you use a lot of autotune, check to make sure they like that, I know that sounds weird to hone in on, but I have had really good songs with great feedback from playlisters get denied because they don't like autotune, I find its either playlisters like autotune or completely hate it haha
* Cover Art Matters, from the image it is plain as day to see what I put together for the artwork to invoke a certain response, the visual hook is there to at least make a person ask what could this song be
* Arrangement: Intro (usually foreshadows what the chorus will be), Verse, Chorus, Verse, Outro - This is the arrangement I usually follow. I am not telling you to copy, I just find this creates a solid storyline that most people can understand. I do see music as a rollercoaster ride with chapters. 
* When submitting I write one pitch for everyone that usually states, ""HI there, I really like your playlists and felt this sad emo song would be a good fit for it, thanks for listening"" If you can't clearly define what category your song fits into, your going to have a hard time get approvals.
* Create your own lists of playlisters that have accepted you or at least give feedback that makes sense. I say this because if a playlisters gives me a bullshxt response that makes no sense, I make sure to cross them off my list to never submit to again.

Effects of Jumping up in Spotify Listeners: Nothing has changed in my opinion so far, it didn't lead to a spike in more followers on my personal platforms. I can't really read into these numbers to pull concrete facts of what a jump in 700 plus listeners has done. This isn't a complaint, haha, just answering that question if someone has it.

**My Genres:** HipHop &amp; RnB Mainly

**Would I pay money again:** To be determined

**Tips for Submit Hub:**

* I really went through most of their playlists and made sure to strongly categorize my song, the song I used was SomeWhere. I produced, recorded the vocals, mixed, and mastered it. I also made sure to pop out an instrumental version so I could shoot 2 shots at one time. I chose emo rap and sad songs because that is the energy and vibe that it has.
* Be very particular about the playlist, as most of you know, they will be picky about your song
* Songs under 3 minutes do best
* If you use a lot of autotune, check to make sure they like that, I know that sounds weird to hone in on, but I have had really good songs with great feedback from playlisters get denied because they don't like autotune, I find its either playlisters like autotune or completely hate it haha
* Cover Art Matters, from the image it is plain as day to see what I put together for the artwork to invoke a certain response, the visual hook is there to at least make a person ask what could this song be
* Arrangement: Intro (usually foreshadows what the chorus will be), Verse, Chorus, Verse, Outro - This is the arrangement I usually follow. I am not telling you to copy, I just find this creates a solid storyline that most people can understand. I do see music as a rollercoaster ride with chapters.
* When submitting I write one pitch for everyone that usually states, ""HI there, I really like your playlists and felt this sad emo song would be a good fit for it, thanks for listening"" If you can't clearly define what category your song fits into, your going to have a hard time get approvals.

I'm low budget but maybe try SubmitHub to for the first time see if others will subscribe to my YouTube channel and maybe try to sell my first song, Indie Folk, me singing and playing solo acoustic guitar... on a place like Spotify.  Also, can I sell my song on CD Baby at the same time, or is that taboo? 

SubmitHub help said they no longer submit to record companies, so does this mean playlists and blogs are the primary option SubmitHub offers for promoting my song? 

How far does $100 go? 

Does SubmitHub try to place me or do I have to do that job via SubmitHub ""SH"" to get anywhere? 

I don't know anything about self-promotion which is why I want to try SH. So before I promote myself through SH I better have my song already posted for sale at Spotify, right? 

Also I've asked SH help several times what box, should I check in their submission process, ""Released (public)"" or ""Unreleased (private)""?  

They also haven't answered if the premium membership is very beneficial to someone like me who is an unknown musician/songwriter? What have your experiences been with SH? 

Is being an Indie Folk singer and my first song to promote, a sad unrequited love song, an unpopular genre? Any feedback is greatly appreciated!

I spent time recently doing some more in-depth research into what’s in Submithub playlists from some of these curators. I’m having a hard time finding a good genre fit for myself. Doesn’t seem like it should be that tricky.

I feel like there should be some thing that works for my music. Doesn’t seem like it’s that out there. Just not finding anything. These playlists all sound the same. is it because this is just the kind of music people are making? Or is it that the people that are drawn to make playlists all have the same taste?

18ohtu3,1703259875.0,makinghiphop,Xarlie770,Submithub questions and frustrations,"Submithub seems to be good for music that has clear-cut genre categories. But there genuinely just doesn’t seem to be many curators on the site who deal with genre-blending or genre-defying music. At least not that I’ve seen. 

For example, one of my hip-hop artists has a Rage Trap-styled song which intentionally flips the genre on its head by introducing more traditional, positive, punchline-styled vocals over classically “rage” styled instrumentals. The song keeps getting rejected but it doesn’t seem that it’s for the song quality. It seems to be the fact that it doesn’t fit neatly into the existing genre-based playlists. According to the feedback, it’s either bc the vocals are too traditional and “punchline style” for the playlist or it’s because the instrumentals are too new wave, unconventional, and not traditional enough for the playlist. 

So… am I just using submithub wrong? Is there a way to find all the more experimental curators who are less concerned about genre? (Maybe more “mood” based playlists or even some meant to push the boundaries of genre). Or Are there other submission sites that are more fitting for genre-defying/genre-blending music? 

I know there can be plenty of good music worthy of playlist placements which does not fit into a genre. And I’m 100% sure there is a market for it. I just have no idea how to find curators who are on the same page to pitch some tracks too.",1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop/comments/18ohtu3/submithub_questions_and_frustrations/,Submithub questions and frustrations,submithub questions and frustrations,"Submithub seems to be good for music that has clear-cut genre categories.

I started releasing tracks in october, 3 tracks si far, with Distrokid. On Youtube, wierdly, I had listeners pretty quickly at the beginning. The second single worked well (for a beginer). I recently released a 3rd track (which I find is the best so far) and it was not pushed as much by the aglorythm, through the ""impressions"" system and is now stagnating. 

I thought it was because people did not like the song or the visual as much as the 2 previous tracks, so I asked for Hot or Not reviews on submithub and every review is good so far... the track was also accepted on some curator's spotify playlists.

I'm quite lost with what makes a content work or not with Youtube, i'd appreciate your insight if you have experience in the matter... Thanks in advance!

One of my songs got featured on what I thought was a high traffic prominent playlist. I was on the playlist for about a month and got almost 5k plays from it. 

Today I log into my distrokid and that one song got me flagged for botting, it's my first strike ever for something like this. I check my metrics, and the 5k streams I got from the playlist in question had been reduced to 4 plays.

So, needless to say, I'm simply off of the playlisting hustle. It's too difficult to vet whether streams are being inflated on them. It seems like you're faced with two options:  
a. spend an enormous amount of time to get features on playlists that can only get you 10-15 plays tops.  
b. focus on higher traffic playlists, which runs the risk of getting your account flagged.  


Learn from my mistake, don't bother focusing on playlisting anymore. Spotify is cracking down hard on the fake streams, and it will only result in you getting fucked.

18d82ny,1701989676.0,musicmarketing,Kypathos,Would it be a mistake to pass on this deal?,"Hello! 

I'm a *very* small instrumental/lo-fi experimental artist (and by small I mean under 300 followers on everything + double digit avg. streams) but I love what I do and would like to get it to more people. I'm really bad at marketing and have wasted time and money over the years in places like submithub, instagram ads, cold emailing etc. to no avail. Haven't sent to any labels because I'm really not sure my music is at that level yet.

For the past year or so I've just been putting out music with no promotion outside of occasional social posts, and my latest release happened to catch the attention of someone who owns a small record label. The owner contacted me, mentioned he loved my EP, and said he wanted to talk about doing physicals for any upcoming music I have. I don't know what specifically the offer would be, but I'm sure I wouldn't be making any money and it'd be purely for the exposure, which I have no problem with in concept.

The label is really small, but is followed by a couple larger labels. It has less followers than I do (barely over 100), and has released work of artists larger than I am with somewhat of a fanbase. None of them are even remotely close to the type of music I make (they're completely rock/hardcore/pop-rock music), so I feel like any audience they may have would not take interest in my work. *But then again, I have relatively no audience.* 

Is (potentially) the wrong audience better than to just continue what I've been doing, throwing spaghetti at the wall until something sticks?

I really enjoy listening to instrumental prog bands like (Intervals, AAL, Arch Echo, Bilo, Olly Steel, etc...) to name a few. I also make instrumental prog music, and have been doing it for a long time purely out of passion.

First of all, i understand that this style of music is extremely ""niche"", which makes it very difficult to get heard especially as a solo artist who does not tour nor live from my music.

I recently educated my self in terms of playlist placement (submithub, groover) and there isn't many prog metal related curators available. I also missed the deadline to pitch my latest album to spotify's curators (bummer😒)

I think the vast majority of us, myself included, have been rejected way more than we’ve ever been accepted. But I just wanna remind everyone that there is absolutely no objective reality in music. I don’t even wanna hear about “you can just FEEL the emotion in her voice maaan. It’s *undeniable*” or anything silly like that.

You could show me your favorite song of all time and I might think it’s total shite for totally arbitrary reasons - so if that’s your taste and what you deem as your favorite song of all time, the chances I will like your music are pretty much zero.

The proof is in submithub / labels / any sort of gatekeeper rejections I’ve ever gotten. “This is too poppy for us” and “this isn’t poppy enough” have very often been the feedback I’ve gotten on THE SAME SONG(S). NO ONE hears things the same. I’ve submitted film score music using the top composers’ tracks as a reference in parallel, making sure my tracks matched their energy, loudness, dynamics, and emotional impact to the point of not being able to hear a difference when AB’ing and surprise!.. I have had those tracks rejected again and again. As a side note, I’ve found that gatekeepers like unique and the general public like familiar, so have fun figuring out which audience you want to create for if not for yourself.

I’ve been rejected so much being in music that I’ve only now started to become more immune to it, which is positive. The only negativity or bitterness I have comes from this idea from the general public that there is any such thing as objectively “good music” and that “the cream rises to the top” or the classic nonsense advice of, “be so good it’s *undeniable*”. Wtf is good? Your ‘good’ is my garbage.

Anyway, if anyone’s constantly facing rejections, there’s definitely a chance you’re still improving. But just know that for as long as you’re making music, it will never stop.

183szf1,1700944851.0,edmproduction,Facts-and-Logic-999,Help decoding dumb feedback from Submithub curators,"Okay, so I released this dubstep tune a few weeks ago, not my first time around the block, but I would describe my production skills overall as decent but not great. Upon the release, I sent my track to about 15 or so blog/playlist curators on Submithub and Groover and it was unanimously rejected across the board.  Can't say I'm terribly surprised based on my experience in the scene so far, but I am a bit caught off guard and frustrated by the feedback that I got, and what I understand to be dubstep-industry-isms that just don't really make sense to me. 

I'm actually very open to feedback and using it to improve my skills and music quality, but in order for me to do that, it has to actually make sense. So therefore, I'm wondering if someone could help translate dubstep-gatekeeper-speak into plain english for me? I'll list some of the feedback points I got in order from most stupid to least stupid:

&amp;#x200B;

1. ""It sounds like you're using too many presets""

Well that's funny, because I'm literally not using any. I might have used some pads or something from Omnisphere or Kontakt in the background, but all the basses/leads/arps etc. are created by me from scratch 95% of the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

2. ""Your sounds sound too old""

Old? I made them all for this track and have never used any of them before. I've not listened to every dubstep track in existence, but I don't know of any other tracks that have used these exact sounds. I'm sure there are examples of similar sounds out there, but it's not like I'm ripping off any particular track or artist.

&amp;#x200B;

3. ""Your mix/master has problems""

I literally hired a professional engineer to mix and master it, but ok.

&amp;#x200B;

4. ""Your drop isn't loud enough""

By ""not loud enough"" I'm assuming they mean ""not compressed enough"", because if you look at the waveform of the track, there's really not much if any headroom left in there during the drop. My engineer and I had tried further compressing the bass group, but it ended up sounding messy and distorted, so we opted for only moderate compression on the bass sounds. I guess this the closest to a valid point of the things listed here, but it's hard for me to picture an average listener going through a playlist and saying ""eww sounds like this producer didn't use enough sausage fattner on their basses"", especially considering how many boring/uncreative tracks are on those same playlists.

&amp;#x200B;

So what is going on here? Clearly I'm in the dark about some things, so please enlighten me. Thanks.

This is my 6th studio album release as a self funded artist playing acoustic rock with very minimal commerical success. 

For my latest album, I recorded overseas in Austin, Texas and decided to put as much strategy as possible into marketing my latest single, an upbeat pop-punk, fast tune as best I could.

I've tried a number of different techniques: playing open mics, playing album releases, touring, submithub, playlistpush with limited success. I reached a max of 3,000 streams on Spotify and some isolated community radio plays.

I asked around and was advised to hire a PR company to try to ""break into radio."" Here in Australia we have only one station to promote new artists that aren't signed to a major label, and that is Triple J, a government funded station with a quota for a number of Australian artists they have to play each week. 

I approached a number of different agencies with minimal success, the only agency who took me seriously was Beehive PR, based in Manly, Sydney. I spent $1500 AUD (about a month's rent, approx $1000 USD) for ""Editorials and Radio Pitching."" They were a pleasure to deal with, very professional, slick and easy, but I 
- barely saw 1,000 streams on Spotify, 
- had a total of three write ups on small magazines, with no new followers on social media as a result
- and the same isolated community radio play I had without a PR company. 

I asked about larger radio stations, namely the pop-punk and heavy show short.fast.loud on Triple J and was told unfortunately they had ""passed"" on the track. 

At this point, I'm really lost. I don't know what to do. I think either
a) my music stinks
b) there's something I'm missing here, whether it's a paywall/labels in control of triple J/marketing/social media.

What has been your experience with SubmitHub? What’s the stream:followers ratio been like with bigger playlist placement versus the smaller guys? What percentage of the bigger Spotify playlists do you think are bot followers/plays or just other artists using SubmitHub like us?

She’s can’t seem to find her footing. Her music is definitely different, it’s very Cocteau twins influenced, with harder elements (similar to hole or L7 mixed in) 

She feels like her music is being reviewed by a lot of people who don’t understand the vocal style, it’s supposed to be ethereal, sort of ghostly or spirit like. Also she really liked the idea of playing hard rock music but with a soft angel like vocals instead of upfront aggressive vocals. 

First question, do you feel like the vocals do not match the instrumental? She was very specific in what she was going for and  is confused by this feedback. 

Second question, is there a place better than submithub for this kind of niche music?l where she will be more understood?

 Only constructive criticism please!

17dhhap,1697936776.0,musicmarketing,LaSirena_666,Submithub feedback options,"Hey everyone!

I’m new to putting out music and just discovered submithub. 

I’ve been submiting a lot and found that I have about a 20% acceptation rate. I appreciate the platform and even though I’m generally a very sensitive person (working on it) I’ve been able to take the feedback like water off a ducks back. 

I want to talk about the 3 feedback options on submithub. First there’s “Specific and honest” which by the way, if anyone here selects this option (god bless, you must be made of steel) I wanted to ask how harsh exactly is the feedback? Does anyone have any examples they would be willing to share?

Then there’s “please be gentle” option. This is the option I always pick. The feedback generally rejects you in the nicest way possible, but then you’re given a reason for why they don’t want to select your track. 

My next question is, what is the point of this? The tracks we submit are a finished project that we paid money to complete. It’s not like we can go back in time to fix what the listener in this situation doesn’t like, plus this is all extremely subjective. So basically I don’t think the feedback could be constructive at all even if they wanted to be. 

The feedback I’ve received is that they like my instrumentals but don’t like my vocals. And thats fine but what am I supposed to do about that? I can’t change my voice or the way I sing, so I don’t understand what the point is of saying that to someone. 

I would prefer to get zero feedback and just a notification that the song was declined. I know I could just not look at the comments but I suppose it’s my own fault for being too curious.

My next question is if anyone knows why the approval rate is so much lower when you receive no feedback rather than the harsh/gentle feedback. The approval rate for no feedback is 12% vs. 28% if you do receive feedback. 

Thank you for listening and please be gentle. I’m just a soft sensitive artist who wants to know your opinions, I don’t need anymore harsh criticism and suppose wanted to vent to some other sensitive artistic souls. 🎃👻🧡",1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicmarketing/comments/17dhhap/submithub_feedback_options/,Submithub feedback options,submithub feedback options,"Hey everyone!

1730o02,1696775733.0,musicmarketing,RYOsmoker,Don't waste your money on submithub,"Ymmv, I will give specific reasons.

Playlist Curators

There aren't many playlist curators to begin with, especially true if your music falls outside of pop. You may find 100-300 listed, but the vast majority don't really accept your genre. It still lists them though.

The paid curators do not and do not have to listen to your song for more than 1 minute. They are only there for some very quick and easy cash. They are not coming there to find new or good music.

The feedback is nonsensical. As an example on of one of the paid curators said my hook lacked variation. Lol Hooks aren't suppossed to have variation, that's what makes them hooks. To be clear my hook isn't short and repeated over and over, here is the hook.

The cost of a dollar is higher than it's ever been.

Evils of men that used to live within

Are now on the outside looking in

A badge of dishonor they wear like skin

I fought for everything I have I own my scars

Won't bow to the kings or the queens or the czars

Devour their towers strip their powers

The world isn't yours It's ours

Blogs

Be serious, almost no one goes to blogs to find or read about music, maybe some gossip blogs that don't actually cover music.

Youtubers

Only a couple out of around 180 on my search did youtube submissions. That's very low.

TikTok

I didn't bother with this. You'd have to ask someone else.

All curators

The majority of them don't have many followers or listeners 30-50 per month is about the average. Very few of them are on there to find new music. Even if a few of them are, theynhave no reach, so no real impact on your music's exposure. So, what exactly are you paying for?

Hot or not

This is ok but not great. 100% of the feedback on there was extremely positive. The thing is, the ratings are all over the place. Someone says something like, ""This song is amazing! It's the best song I've heard all year."" But they rate it a 68, above their average rating of 58.

Skips pull your average rating score down too. So, if you have a intro section to your song, good luck. Some people are simply trying to rush through giving reviews to get their own songs reviewed.

I have been releasing 1 new song every 5 weeks so that I am always pushing out content and feeding the Spotify algorithm. With each new release, I promote the song for 5 weeks. I use Instagram Ads, Facebook Ads, and playlist pitching (SubmitHub and Groover). I have grown my IG from 500 to over 3k. I average at least 10k monthly listeners on Spotify and have over 200k total streams across 12 releases. I am even starting to grow at a steady pace on Apple Music just off of my ads campaign. So I'm not HUGE or anything, but I would consider myself as starting to become established. My music has high quality mixing, high quality production (I hire a professional producer on SoundBetter), and is professionally mastered. So, naturally, my music has a professional feel to it and it is something I'm proud of. So why then, does Groover troll me? Let me explain. 

Initially, I really liked Groover, mostly because it has a HUGE curator base. But after using Groover for over 1 year, I am finally convinced that 90% of the curators on this site are just trying to get paid. Why do I say this? Because, although my music sounds ""professional and on par with the industry standard,"" my song is almost NEVER added to playlists on Groover. Let me show you some screenshots:

Keep in mind that this song is a Pop Ballad with a Rap in Verse 2. So it's a Pop/Rap song with like a Marshmello type beat. It sounds very similar to something Juice Wrld, The Kid Laroi, JB, Post Malone or Halsey might put out. It is a sad song about how hard it is to let someone go with a very catchy hook, and again professionally mixed, mastered, lined up, and produced. All of these curators proceed to tell me the exact same thing. Then tell me that it's not a fit for their playlist. I go to their playlist and guess who's on their playlists. Juice Wrld, Post, Kid, JB, etc. It's honestly all a load of crap. ""Your song is AMAZING, well produced, sounds professional, but we aren't gonna add it. Thanks send us your next track.""

1. I’ve uploaded my first single to distrokid about a week ago but my Spotify for artists isn’t showing up yet so I can’t submit to playlists through Spotify for artists. The song is coming out on October 6th. I was wondering if anyone else ran into this issue and if they were able to use Spotify for artists on time to submit to Spotify playlists?? 

2. I just started submitting on submithub and created a musosoup campaign today. I’ve gotten denied 4 times on submithub already, but I’ve received 10 musoup offers within the past 7 hours so that’s pretty exciting. The only thing is that they’re all small blogs with barely any followers and their playlists basically have the same songs, like they just send offers to everyone on the page. I did get one offer from a pretty big tiktoker that I’m excited about though. Anyways, I was wondering if since this is my first release, I should take all the press I get in hopes that bigger curators will take notice, or should I accept the playlist adds and only take blog offers from reputable press so as to not dampen my artist brand?

16tbpq5,1695791865.0,musicmarketing,oldjack,Groover is trash,"(1) The website itself is terrible. After you search, you have to click on a curator to see whether they have 17,000 Spotify followers or 42 or 0. This forces you to click back and forth constantly. There is no way to sort by followers so you waste time checking if anyone is even worth your money.

(2) Curators misrepresent their interests. They claim they want multiple genres of music and then reject you because they only accept one specific genre. This is an obvious bait-and-switch designed to get your money. Or they broadly claim they want artists that sound like ""Post Malone"", ""Radiohead"", ""Blink 182"", ""Kendrick Lamar"", and ""Tame Impala""...wtf is this? And the curators that actually have focused interests have zero following so they're worthless.

(3) The technical feedback proves the curators are clueless. I'm totally ok if someone simply doesn't like the style of my song. But when some unqualified curator says ""the vocals are too low in the mix"" when they objectively aren't, or the guitars ""have too much compression"" when they're not compressed, it shows these people are just pretending to sound knowledgeable. One curator even suggested our singer should sing in a completely different style-- as if an established band with published music is gonna change their sound for one random person. Totally illogical feedback.

To be clear, I've had songs accepted and rejected on Groover, Submithub, and Daily Playlists. I've got reasonable feedback and dumb feedback on all three as well.

Playlist Push requires hundreds of dollars and you don’t get to see who you submit to until after you spend your money. It’s a huge gamble. You could find out after they take your money that half the playlists weren’t even a good fit in the first place 

Submithub lets you do research beforehand which is cool but they pay less. It’s a lot of work to be a quality curator/influencer and they deserve to get paid. It’s better for promoters to be somewhere like PlaylistPush because they get paid more, but this hurts artists 

If submithub raised its prices it would attract more quality promoters and we as artists could make more educated decisions. We also wouldn’t waste as much money.

Something’s gotta change because music promo is too expensive. You either have to be a TikTok fiend and post 5x a day or you have to spend 500$+ on mystery playlist promo and get ripped off. Or run ads but that’s also expensive and has a high learning curve

These mystery box playlist companies like PlayListPush have got to go, or be more transparent. And submithub should do a better job of amassing quality. I imagine that means increasing their prices a bit. The max is 4 credits? Folks on PlaylistPush can make like 10$ per submission.

1622fa7,1693073888.0,edmproduction,alfiealfiealfie,I'm a curator on Submithub - here's what I've learned being on the other side of the fence,"Hi

I use Submithub lots to submit music to curators and it's terribly difficult getting anything placed. But recently, and due to my niche blog, I've become a curator. Here's what I've learned and what might help you get more success:

1)Personalise your pitch. Often times folks have zero pitch (booo!) or other times its generic (meh). But it really makes me sit up and pay attention when folks have gone the extra mile to read my blog and cross reference their music with what I've written about. It shows you care. 

2)Mono control your mixes. Sometimes due to where I am and time constraints I'll listen on mobile. My mobile plays in mono and you would not believe how troublesome some songs sound when played in mono. Please check your mixes in mono. I do cross check later on my studio set up so I can hear the difference when played in stereo, but I don't always do this. Mono control FTW

3)When I offer to write about you I'll ask for more information about the track; how it was written, influences etc. You would not believe the amount of folks who don't reply to this request. Getting more information from you about the song helps me personalise it. 

4)I write about EDM, and Japanese music. After the first few weeks I got a lot of submissions outside my genre selection so I updated my bio to say what genres I can't write about due to lack of knowledge or taste and yet I'll still get some submissions in those genres. I'll still listen, but I'll be on the back foot. 

5)Even if you get rejected, still send stuff over. I can see if you've submitted before to me and I like your tenacity. +1 point for you.

But recently, and due to my niche blog, I've become a curator. Here's what I've learned and what might help you get more success 1)Personalise your pitch. Often times folks have zero pitch (booo!) or other times its generic (meh). But it really makes me sit up and pay attention when folks have gone the extra mile to read my blog and cross reference their music with what I've written about. It shows you care.  2)Mono control your mixes. Sometimes due to where I am and time constraints I'll listen on mobile. My mobile plays in mono and you would not believe how troublesome some songs sound when played in mono. Please check your mixes in mono. I do cross check later on my studio set up so I can hear the difference when played in stereo, but I don't always do this. Mono control FTW 3)When I offer to write about you I'll ask for more information about the track; how it was written, influences etc. You would not believe the amount of folks who don't reply to this request. Getting more information from you about the song helps me personalise it.  4)I write about EDM, and Japanese music. After the first few weeks I got a lot of submissions outside my genre selection so I updated my bio to say what genres I can't write about due to lack of knowledge or taste and yet I'll still get some submissions in those genres. I'll still listen, but I'll be on the back foot.  5)Even if you get rejected, still send stuff over. I can see if you've submitted before to me and I like your tenacity. 1 point for you. 6)If I don't like a song I'll say so but I'll also say why. I try to be accurate and honest in my feedback.

I finished a new song and posted it on Submithub. While most of the feedback is what I expected, more than one person noted the production quality as something to work on. I don't know for sure that it's the mix that they mean, but that's what I'm assuming.

I'm still new to audio engineering, so I'm thinking I just don't have the ear yet to really hear the difference between what I'm doing and professional mixes. Would someone with more experience than me be willing to give some thoughts about what I can work on and things that stand out in the track as being unrefined? Feel free to be very frank, you aren't going to hurt my feelings :)

Thank you so much in advance.

15gek3m,1690996116.0,musicmarketing,marklonesome,Could this be working??,"I, like many of you. Have been looking for ways to promote my music without gigging and using social media.

While I know that is the most reliable/best way to do it. I'm stubborn and I don't wanna play out and I fucking loathe social media.

With that said, I've been doing playlist placement with sites like Submithub etc...

As expected I'd get a few hundred streams and added to a handful or private playlists. 

Recently I tried moonstrive and they put me on some pretty big playlists.

I checked them out and it's what you'd expect. A huge spotify playlist that has little relevance to my music... I'm basically sandwiched between Elvis and The Beach Boys... and I'm not at all in those genres.

But here's where the interesting thing happened. 

I got about 2000 streams through that playlist but when I went to check it out the other day I had been added to about 8 other playlists that I didn't submit too or pay for and they're all relevant to my music. 

Does that mean that this is somewhat working??

I know it's never going to be as good as doing it the tried and true way (gigging and social) but in as much as this road CAN get you somewhere.....

The music I make I would describe mostly as Cosmic Rock'N'Roll which is very influenced by 1960's/1970s rock and roll with artists such as The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, T-Rex and thin lizzy as well as strong influences from 1950s rockabilly, country, motown and blues. I also have other songs influenced by 60s folky psychedelic pop.

Recently I have been getting feedback on submithub which I have really enjoyed seeing but something that surprised me and interested me was getting comparisons to artists I dont really listen to or play in genres that I dont play in myself. An example  that suprised me the most would be getting comparisons to pop-punk and bands like green day and blink-182 neither of which I have ever really listened to and didn't influence me. I have also had comparissons to artists i dont really listen to but I can understand why they might guess their my influences with bands like kiss, beach boys and david bowie. Having had this feedback I can actually hear were people are getting these vibes which has really interested me. At the same time normally people generally can hear my actual influences but I find it so cool the way people can perceive my music in a completely different genre to me!

15afew7,1690400131.0,musicmarketing,conversebasin,Where to Start with Label Partnerships,"Hello, I'm having trouble figuring out where to start with labels. I'm on pace to finish 50 songs this year in the indie pop/rock/electronic genres. Strayed away quite a bit from my DJ roots as I evolve as an artist.

I could prolly do more songs, but I have a full-time job and am doing an undergrad voice program at Berklee. Also, the songs have to be written, practiced, and recorded. One song a week is quite a bit of work to actually finish.

Thankfully, I am working with a pro producer, so my role as the artist is mainly singing and songwriting.

My question is, where do I start with finding a label to partner with? Should I release singles, should I just submit all of them to labels and let them be broken up into wherever they go, should I form 3 albums out of them?

It seems there are 3 distinct types of songs (indiepop, indierock, and indietronica), so could do 3 albums, but I don't know of a label to talk to who would be interested in 3 albums. Labels are all about singles, but my projects tell a story, and I think should be released together.

Any ideas where to start besides labelradar, submithub, or groover?

Is it best to just put them all out as singles, let them all spread their wings in different directions, like a pack of butterflies? That might be a bit chaotic, but it sure would plant a lot of seeds.

So, the question is, how to make your music promo ads pay for themselves? Here are three monetization strategies to achieve a return on your investment. Let's dive in! 👇

Strategy 1: Earn ROYALTIES on Spotify! Get paid between 0.003 to 0.005 cents per stream. Compare this to ad costs on Facebook or Instagram, ranging from 10 to 50 cents per listener. Break even by accumulating 50-100 streams from each listener. Patience is key! ⏳

Strategy 2: Become a PLAYLIST CURATOR. Create a themed playlist, add your tracks, and curate other artists' songs. Use platforms like SubmitHub or Groover to earn money while curating. Grow your playlist, gain more listeners, and promote your own music. 🎧💡

Strategy 3: Another strategy to fund your promotion campaigns is making money with MERCHANDISE. Create unique products like t-shirts or accessories featuring your brand or artwork, and sell them to your fans. The profit earned can be reinvested into promoting your music. 

It's a win-win!

I put out one song in August of this year, had to wait a bit until song #2 due to funding but I plan to release a song a month from now until next summer. 10 songs total and I really want to grow along the way. 

I have been given advice from a friend who is using meta ads. He grew from 0 to 25k consistent monthly listeners on Spotify. Didn’t worry about playlisting but I’ve also been given multiple things to try including some saying to trying to do playlists. 

As of now, I have tried submitting on submit hub and have had luck, I just started using a tool that does lifetime pre-saves instead of pre-saves per song and I have not tried paid ads with Meta. I did one on tiktok and it goes to like ratio was good and I picked up followers but I wouldn’t consider it highly successful either as I am very unsure of how many people streamed the song. I didn’t have a way to track that with how I did the ad. 

I am trying to learn and figure out what’s best for me so I’d love to connect and hear y’all’s stories. I shared my linktree with my music if you’d like to check it out. I grew up listening to John Mayer and Ed Sheeran so that’s kinda the direction I’m going with my stuff I guess if you wondered about style of music.

There’s a list of thing I’ve been doing for the past few years, but honestly I’m not sure if I’m doing my best, and I’d be happy to hear new ideas and tips. These are some of the things I’m doing:
- Pitching to Spotify editorial playlists (never worked)
- Sharing on all social media platforms, sometimes advertising
- Sharing a live cover of my own song
- Submitting to different playlist curators on platforms like SubmitHub
- Emailing different YouTube channel owners to be included in their compilations
- Emailing to different radio stations I can find online

One thing that I’m not good at, but might be worth doing, is coming up with content for TikTok and Instagram Reels, and sharing those as well.

I've been lucky enough to have received BBC Introducing 'Track of the Week' for the first 3 of my tracks, but the listener count is super low, and I've not had any luck on playlists.

I've pitched my stuff through the Spotify for Artists page (which is a great resource),but I've not had any luck. I've also spent cash on campaigns in SubmitHub, but I've only had 1 placement to a small playlist, and I must have submitted to 50 or so.

Lest you think I am just a shill, I also share my bad experiences, such as this post from several months ago about how playlist push is terrible (An opinion I still stand by) [https://www.reddit.com/r/Songwriting/comments/veeuse/comment/j2vsw8i/?%2524](https://www.reddit.com/r/Songwriting/comments/veeuse/comment/j2vsw8i/?%2524)

Prior to using yougrow, I used the aforementioned playlist push as well as submithub and groover. The problem with all 3 is they make you go through and pitch yourself to the playlists, and many of their playlists are terrible. So I get so many responses with them from playlisters saying ""your song is great, but doesn't fit my style"" Then why did your algorithms recommend this person to me? And many of the playlists I have got from those services were worthless and gave me a couple dozen streams. And if you're wondering why I particularly think playlist push is a scam and not submithub or groover, it's because of price. The latter 2 charge you a buck or two per send, so not a big deal if you strike out. PP charges hundreds, or thousands depending on the package, and gives you no guarantee you'll get on any playlist. 

Someone actually on here recommended yougrow to me, and it's worked great. For one, after you pay them THEY pitch your song to playlists they think it is a fit for. And you get your money back if they can't get it placed. So I chose their ""starter"" package which was like 67 bucks for 2-6k guaranteed streams. The playlist they got my song on had more than 225,000 likes (or saves or whatever they are) and the song so far has got 25k streams and counting, obviously way more than even what was promised. The song also got a lot of saves which has helped with the spotify algorithms, and I've obtained 135 new followers. In spotify streaming revenue, I've already made back like half my 67 dollar investment. 

Now, one thing I can't vouch for is their higher priced options. For example, if you choose the yougrow ""superstar"" option  for $1200 will you start getting millions of streams? I don't know.

120nydt,1679672220.0,musicmarketing,Recent_Childhood9863,Release and Promotion Strategy Opinions (Bass House Song),"Hey Guys. I am planning to self-release a song, which is a bass house / electro house song. So this is a typical EDM-ish, club track. My fanbase is really small, a few followers on Tiktok, Insta, Yt etc. I've showed the idea to many people and groups and people seemed to like it. I need your opinion and advice on my strategies.

So I would use Distrokid, Radio Edit on streaming (Spotify, Apple etc.), Extended Mix can be bought on Beatport. I've done an FX visualizer, and I will make soon music video (basic idea, imitate  to ""play"" the stems in 6-8 videos at once). I am planning to do some mashups with my song. I would also make a lunatic Hardstyle remix just to spice things up. (found a good service, so I would pay for a cover picture also).

Next is promotion. Before the release I wouldn't do much towards the public. After setting the release, first is to use Spotify for Artists for playlists and Apple Music also. Also would try the Spotify campaign, where it boosts the algorhythm for some percentage of income. I would rather send it to people (cold DMs), such as DJs, Music producers and influencers (there are a lot of people with music lists and ""hot or not"" style shorts). I would do some SM content (as everyone, Tiktok, Insta, FB, Youtube). Stuff like behind the scenes, some fun with the hook of the song. Some submissions (for artists, webpages, channels, radioshows). And I would try some paid promotion. Labelradar has some good options for promotion channels (for instance on Youtube). Submithub for some influencers and playlists. Maybe I would try Toneden io also for some stuff (Hypeddit is so expensive). I wouldn't do FB/Insta/Tiktok ads, I think it's not a good idea.

Of course it would be a big minus in money. But I want to start from there. What do you think? Is it a good strategy idea?

11zvacx,1679601266.0,makinghiphop,vicenormalcrafts,"If you want good feedback for your music, invest in professionals","I see most of the rappers here really are hungry for feedback and exposure. And for that, you’ll fall for the trap of paying to sub some washed up rapper’s live stream to hear what they have to say about your music. 

Last night, I had the displeasure of tuning in to a bad stream where they tore everyone down (some of them REALLY good songs, I might add) but gave their own tracks the highest marks. On tiktok I constantly see streams just like this too, and what’s crazy is that artists are paying these washed up nobodies $5 to review their music. Insane.

I’ve been there. This was going on since Ustream in the late 2000s, (and if you’re active in your local scene) or paying to sell tickets at a showcase. It’s just failed “veterans” taking advantage of hungry artists. And it’s disheartening.


Don’t ever subject yourself to being judged by some bitter, failed musicians who just want to push their bad music on you, while making themselves feel better by knocking you down. 


Instead, do this:


- Submithub isn’t perfect. But the artists chat is probably the best feature on there. Share your music, network and get feedback. It’s free.

- Focus on international outlets. They, for some reason, are more accepting and give better feedback than American outlets.

- Use premium outlets. Free credits are cool, but you get what you pay for.

- Have fun with your music. Experiment, don’t worry about what or who may not like it.



My 20+ years of experience have shown me that “Veterans” tend to gatekeep, and they turn into reviewers when they can’t find success. You ever wonder why they still play their lyrical spiritual individual music on these streams? That shows their heart and sense of fun was never in it.

11kzssi,1678196863.0,beermoneyeasteu,Determinaator,Submithub - make money with your Spotify playlists and/or social medias with music,"[Submithub](https://www.submithub.com/by/beermoneyeasteu?ln=et) is a website for playlist curators or individuals with a social media presence who enjoy music and want to earn income by helping promote music that musicians send to them.

Here's how it works:

Playlists

* You have playlist(s).
* People send you songs on SubmitHub.
* You listen to the songs people send you.
* If the song is a free submission (artists get one a day to send to people), you don't get any money. However, it's still a good idea to check them out, keep your activity up, and you may find some good music.
* If the song is a 'premium submission' (i.e., the artist paid SubmitHub to send it to you), you get paid if you accept (and add the songs to your playlist(s)) or decline the songs (and not add them to your playlist). You earn $0.50 per submission, either way.

Socials

* You have an active Instagram or TikTok account.
* People send you songs on SubmitHub.
* You listen to the songs.
* Either you accept the songs (and play them in a TikTok video or Instagram post) or decline to do so. Either way, you get paid $0.50 per premium submission you accept or deny.
* That's it. As long as you have some playlists or social media presence, every day or so, people will send you songs you can listen to, and you'll get paid whether or not you decide to accept it (e.g., add it to a playlist) or deny it (e.g., decide you don't like it enough to add to a playlist).",7,0.83,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyeasteu/comments/11kzssi/submithub_make_money_with_your_spotify_playlists/,Submithub - make money with your Spotify playlists and/or social medias with music,submithub - make money with your spotify playlists and/or social medias with music,"Submithub. * People send you songs on SubmitHub. * You listen to the songs people send you. * If the song is a free submission (artists get one a day to send to people), you don't get any money.

10o8onq,1675001957.0,melodichardcore,deddeCR,🔎 Looking for MxH bands to fit in my playlist “Melodic Hardcore - New &amp; Classics”,"👋 Hey, guys! As the title says, I’m searching for some new bands to fit in my Spotify Playlist.

At the moment, the playlist has over 3.000 followers and it generates 200-300 monthly plays.

But I receive so few playlist placements requests… I would like to fit more bands ‘cause I know there are tons of people who deserves to be listened to!

So:

🎧 if you’re a MxH fan, feel free to follow the playlist if you enjoy it.

🤘 If you’re in a MxH band, feel free to submit your song to me through SubmitHub or Groover.

Yes, you have to pay for these requests.

I would love to do it for free but I have also other playlists and I spent so much time to listen to some people stuff…

… and I often listen to many inconsistent/low quality sh%t 😂

So, for just 1$, on my side I am able to filter bulls%it from the real music, and on your side you can submit your song and get results you won’t get with classic advertising (especially if I really enjoy the song and if I decide to keep of in playlist for months…!)

Here’s my link guys, hope I could be of any help for you and I hope I can really support the scene.

Take care! 🙂

Influencer Marketing for me is: Pitching your tracks to influencers so they use ur track and it gets exposed to their audience.

zchoul,1670179256.0,truespotify,nick_minieri,"very sudden 4x increase in followers on my spotify artist profile, followed by a purge - is this normal?","Hi! Have a question about some weird activity that happened on my spotify artist profile recently. Up until the beginning of this past November I had steadily been growing an organic following on my artist page to around 250 followers. Then this huge spike began where I started getting anywhere from 10-25 followers a day until peaking around 700. I figured this wasn't natural at all and these new followers would be purged. And surely enough, I've lost about 100 each day over the last 3 days.

I've heard bad feedback about MySphera - apparently their customer service is very poor and the artist telling me this felt the whole thing was built to grab money, rather than help artists. (Yes, I know all sites try to make money, but some are sincere about trying to help). So, feedback would be great. 

I've been using Submit.hub. 20% approval rate, which I think is around average. 

Genre of music seems to be a big factor in getting positive responses. Most popular songs fall into the EDM / HipHop and Lo-fi genres. Also, choosing a genre that suits the SONG and not necessarily the ARTIST.

We're running national press &amp;amp; radio campaigns simultaneously. So far, Submit.hub, Sound Campaign and Facebook advertising are driving the majority of Spotify plays. However, this illuminates the nature of audience building, which is seeding, joining the dots, following up every lead and connecting with fans.

xywrhk,1665245941.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,EdinKaso,"I got 10,000 monthly listeners in under 3 months with no label, team, or money. Here’s what I learned.","This is not a promotional post so I will not be posting any links. Rather, I want to focus on the invaluable lessons I’ve learned and what helped me in this short but eventful time.

Just a disclaimer: I am not a professional and do not work in the industry, but these are the things I’ve found really helped me.

**1. Hold your music to a professional standard and keep trying to improve.**

No matter what genre you’re in, you want to ask yourself “Do I see this being played on the radio?”. I’m personally always trying to improve, and even though my music has been very positively received, I still feel like there’s so much to improve in everything (which I came to realize is a good thing. Because it means you’ll keep improving).


**2. Network with others.** 

I see a lot of people making amazing music but just keeping to themselves in their little bubble. There’s nothing wrong with that, but if you are trying to grow your listeners…you’re honestly missing a huge opportunity. Networking allows you to reach so many people who would enjoy your music. It helps you to get into playlists, it helps you to get more fans, and just helps with exposure in general. Side note: never pay for any promotional service or to get more listeners!


**3. Know your audience.**

You could be the most amazing classical composer in the world, but if you’re sharing your music with Gen Z or Alpha, no one will care. Find your audience. And going back to point 2, networking helps with this too.


**4. Accept this fact “No one cares until everyone does.”**

This was a truth that hit me hard. I worked so hard on my first release back in July, and when I released it…no one cared, including most of my social circle. But I realized this: “no one cares until everyone does”. This actually ended up being a comforting thought. What it means is you could be making the most beautiful music in the world, and most people still won’t appreciate it, until there’s social validation or social proof. Until they see others liking and listening to your music. It’s kind of a sad truth about human nature but…you can actually leverage this to your advantage. Whatever milestone you reach, share it and use social media to show “social proof”.


**5. Know your music theory.**

This is absolutely fundamental. Learn and really understand this. Don’t learn it for the sake of memorizing, but learn it and see how it applies to real music. Learn it to apply it. A lot of people will say “but (insert artist) never learned theory”. The truth is these people never learned conventional music theory, but they still understood music theory in their own unique way. They don’t just sit down and make music without understanding the patterns and connections in music.


**6. It takes a lot of time before you become good.**

To the outside world, I just started making music 3 months ago. But what most people don’t see is the thousands of hours I’ve invested beforehand. I started learning instruments at the age of 12. I started making music in my teens. In my early 20s I put in thousands upon thousands of hours into properly learning theory and technique (I’m a pianist). And at the age of 27 now people say my music is “professional”.


There are so many more things I would like to share that have helped me, but this post is already getting too long haha. But I really hope this helps. I wish you guys all the best in your music goals!

Edit: I just want to add, some people have brought up that I might be paying for playlists (or botting streams). I never have and never will do such things. Only thing I have experimented with is submithub, which is pay for consideration.

Think about this:
Why would any sane artist who takes a lot of pride in their work want to ever compromise to such things that can get them banned? To destroy all their hard work? Especially when they know their music is good enough for real ears? And why would any artist who takes pride in their work want fake listeners? You can listen to my music itself and tell that I put a lot of love and care, and take pride in it.

I’d take 1 real listener and fan over 1000 bots any day.

Edit 2: Sorry I can’t reply to everyone. It’s a bit overwhelming, the amount of replies. But I wish I could reply to all of you. I’m really glad to read this post helped many of you though! :)",677,0.89,160,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/xywrhk/i_got_10000_monthly_listeners_in_under_3_months/,"I got 10,000 monthly listeners in under 3 months with no label, team, or money. Here’s what I learned.","i got 10,000 monthly listeners in under 3 months with no label, team, or money. here’s what i learned.","This is not a promotional post so I will not be posting any links. Rather, I want to focus on the invaluable lessons I’ve learned and what helped me in this short but eventful time. Just a disclaimer I am not a professional and do not work in the industry, but these are the things I’ve found really helped me. **1. Hold your music to a professional standard and keep trying to improve.** No matter what genre you’re in, you want to ask yourself “Do I see this being played on the radio?”. I’m personally always trying to improve, and even though my music has been very positively received, I still feel like there’s so much to improve in everything (which I came to realize is a good thing. Because it means you’ll keep improving). **2. Network with others.**  I see a lot of people making amazing music but just keeping to themselves in their little bubble. There’s nothing wrong with that, but if you are trying to grow your listeners…you’re honestly missing a huge opportunity. Networking allows you to reach so many people who would enjoy your music. It helps you to get into playlists, it helps you to get more fans, and just helps with exposure in general. Side note never pay for any promotional service or to get more listeners! **3. Know your audience.** You could be the most amazing classical composer in the world, but if you’re sharing your music with Gen Z or Alpha, no one will care. Find your audience. And going back to point 2, networking helps with this too. **4. Accept this fact “No one cares until everyone does.”** This was a truth that hit me hard. I worked so hard on my first release back in July, and when I released it…no one cared, including most of my social circle. But I realized this “no one cares until everyone does”. This actually ended up being a comforting thought. What it means is you could be making the most beautiful music in the world, and most people still won’t appreciate it, until there’s social validation or social proof. Until they see others liking and listening to your music. It’s kind of a sad truth about human nature but…you can actually leverage this to your advantage. Whatever milestone you reach, share it and use social media to show “social proof”. **5. Know your music theory.** This is absolutely fundamental. Learn and really understand this. Don’t learn it for the sake of memorizing, but learn it and see how it applies to real music. Learn it to apply it. A lot of people will say “but (insert artist) never learned theory”. The truth is these people never learned conventional music theory, but they still understood music theory in their own unique way. They don’t just sit down and make music without understanding the patterns and connections in music. **6. It takes a lot of time before you become good.** To the outside world, I just started making music 3 months ago. But what most people don’t see is the thousands of hours I’ve invested beforehand. I started learning instruments at the age of 12. I started making music in my teens. In my early 20s I put in thousands upon thousands of hours into properly learning theory and technique (I’m a pianist). And at the age of 27 now people say my music is “professional”.

I've tried submithub. Curators seem to make totally random reasons not to include you and even when it has worked i don't think it has bought me any new legitimate followers. I am skeptical they are even real streams. 

I'm not sure even delaying your release to pitch to Spotify is worth it because they get 60,000 new releases daily and I can't imagine how they could possibly have the time for new artists. I think I would rather just have the song out there asap. 

All of the success stories I've researched are just from people putting things up without any paid promotion or being on any particular playlist. They have just been posted for free and picked up by the algorithms and gone viral so I think that's what I'm going to do going forward.

So I'm about to release my debut single, it's a dream-pop song with lot's of synths and vocal harmonies.

I have a 1000$ budget per each single that I'm about to release and I'm thinking of how to use them.

What I currently did:

\-Set a release through Distrokid, 3 weeks ahead of time, to all platforms, mainly so I could get on Spotify's playlists.

\-Put about 20 credits on Submithub - currently got 7 declines out of 20\~

\-Planning on a FB/IG campaign that will lead to Spotify listens (Not sure how to go about this one yet).

\-Used PlaylistSupply to make a list of applicable playlists to send to after the single's release.

I have two more singles to drop prior to the EP.

xasbls,1662824208.0,musicians,RenegadeAngel2020,Is this the most effective way to promote yourself?,"What do you think is the best way to promote yourself to get more followers? I think posting o Reddit or Facebook threads has not yielded very much, neither on sites like Submithub (even if you get on tons of blogs and playlists). 

I think the best way to grow fanbase is through Facebook ads since it lets you target people. You can for instance target people who both like  ""independent artists"" (who like to discover new music), your music genre  and some artists you sound like. This gives a huge real boost and following. People will add yourself to their playlists and other will  take it from there. Our song 'Journey into Madness' did get on a few hundred playlists that are a perfect fit for our genre and tons of followers  and reaching about 20 000 plays on Spotify! No need to pitch to playlisters who do very seldom have a great playlist that fits your music. It is also likely many of these ""huge playlists"" have mostly bots that follow and stream these songs!

Facebook Ads is also very cheap. We  haven gotten contacted by some decent labels too, but they tend to want  you invest a big budget ($1500) for EP release, but that includes them printing out 1000 cds that they send out as promo. However, most of  these artists have much less listeners, followers, radio plays and such than us,  so have opted out to be ""semi-independent"" (smaller label: Inverse  Records)

Did try out Youtube ads for the Spanish version of the song and it got 50 000+ views. However, for  some very odd reason this song started to play on childrens show even if  you could target ""metalheads"" (you can see what videos your ads is  played on in Googles stats) and engagement was pretty poor.  However,  when it worked properly it was pretty great too.

We have now let the record label do all promoting,but also uploaded the song to our own Youtube Channel and done no paid promo and not that  active promo of it (some posts here and there) and have gotten about  1000 views in 2 weeks. So, I guess we at least some ""real followers"" :) Here is the  newest song: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szMib96YOS8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szMib96YOS8) . If you like traditonal heavy metal with some elements of power metal then you might want to check it out. Gotten mostly 3 and 4 out of 5 stars reviews in most ""major magazines for our genre"", so I guess most think it does not completely suck...haha.

I've received a lot of positive feedback on Submithub, so, I hope you will like that. It's #electronicore / #groovemetal track with some positive energy. It's very close to soundtracks of action video games or movies, so, if you like that - I sware you will like **RMSHN - HDBNGR.**

Also I'm open for **any collaboration**, especially with vocalists and electronic musicians. We can make new versions of this song, we can work on new material. You don't need to pay anything for mixing/mastering etc, just record your part. Everything about managing, distribution etc is on my side.

I'll be happy to get **any recommendations of playlists** where I can send my track. I already did everything that I could with Submithub and Groover, so, if you have any contacts, links etc that are not discivered there - I will appreciate that.

I've made **my own playlists** and one of them started to grow organically, so, I'm very happy about that!

w7siu7,1658764588.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,swimNotsink,Subjectiveness of Track Mixing vs Artist Vision,"Hey guys,

   
So recently I've just released a track I wrote together with a producer and I'm sending out pitches to submithub to promote it.   
The responses are extremely polarising. Some say the mix was done well, while others say the mix has serious issues (like too much reverb/ too central vocals).   


A little background, during the mixing sessions, the producer showed me a mix version that sounded very different from the rough mix. Which I rejected because the version presented was 'too commercial'. Basically clean sounding (but 'tin-ny' tone), minimal reverb pop template. My vision was more of a 'empty room visual' hence, heavier reverbs but only at the end of phrases as a compromise. I'm more influenced by London Grammar type of sound.   


I guess I'm just trying to process some of the feedback I'm getting from my song pitches. While I understand song preference is subjective, I try my best to learn from 'objective' critiques. Hence, I always filter out the technical comments to try and improve. Now, I'm not a very experienced artist with tons of releases so there are plenty of things I have yet to learn but getting 'mix is bad' comments is stressing me out.  
   
Its like 'what if I had seriously considered the original mix draft proposed by my producer ? Would it have been better? ' but then again what about the people who thought the mix was decent?    
Am I personally satisfied with how the track conveys my vision? Yes.   
But should I compromise my vision just to satiate 'mix issues' with the bigger population? I have no idea...   
Also, I wrote the song (base chords etc.), lyrics, melody and produced the song. While my producer mainly helped in arrangement composition. Has anyone else felt this way before? Or perhaps faced something similar?   


Tldr; Directed track mix per my specifications and released a song. Polarising comments with people loving the mix and others saying mix has serious issues.

vu754h,1657274371.0,edmproduction,alfiealfiealfie,My take on writers block / writing songs /getting stuck - just my experience.,"I'm seeing a lot of folks today stuck with starting or finishing or just stuck with writing stuff. Here's what works for me. It's not right or wrong, it's just what works for me.

**Finding number one**
It's not what you start with but how you harmonise what you start with. The most basic chord progression you can totally flip around with a bassline + melody + other chord voicings on top. You can stretch a basic chord progression with so many harmonisations around it. So don't stress too much if your initial chord progression is uninspiring  - it's how you work with it that matters much more.
edit: helpful link about harmonisation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHyuhsAles

**Finding number two**
Can't finish a track? Make it shorter. Don't feel bad about making a 2 minute track. Finishing it in any form is psychologically important.

**Finding number three**
Really really hate your track? Permanently delete it. The fact it exists is negative karma and distracting. It's like having a vase of mouldy flowers in your kitchen. No one wants to see that. Yes, this is really contenscious but its for the few very rare tracks that end up as total dumpster fires. This happens very rarely. Like once a year. 

**Finding number four**
Use Twitch. You can also see what other folks are producing and how they work with their DAW. This is a huge learning opportunity for you. Use it. I've learned so much. 

**Finding number five**
Use feedback channels. This sub has one, there's loads on the aforementioned Twitch and Submithub has an anonymous feature called Hot or Not where you can see how your music fares and often times gain useful insight into your work. Feedback channels have improved the way I write. 

**Finding number six**

Here's what works for me. It's not right or wrong, it's just what works for me. **Finding number one** It's not what you start with but how you harmonise what you start with. The most basic chord progression you can totally flip around with a bassline  melody  other chord voicings on top. You can stretch a basic chord progression with so many harmonisations around it. So don't stress too much if your initial chord progression is uninspiring  - it's how you work with it that matters much more. edit helpful link about harmonisation  **Finding number two** Can't finish a track? Make it shorter. Don't feel bad about making a 2 minute track. Finishing it in any form is psychologically important. **Finding number three** Really really hate your track? Permanently delete it. The fact it exists is negative karma and distracting. It's like having a vase of mouldy flowers in your kitchen. No one wants to see that. Yes, this is really contenscious but its for the few very rare tracks that end up as total dumpster fires. This happens very rarely. Like once a year.  **Finding number four** Use Twitch. You can also see what other folks are producing and how they work with their DAW. This is a huge learning opportunity for you. Use it. I've learned so much.  **Finding number five** Use feedback channels. This sub has one, there's loads on the aforementioned Twitch and Submithub has an anonymous feature called Hot or Not where you can see how your music fares and often times gain useful insight into your work.

veeuse,1655477246.0,Songwriting,Big-Association-239,Plalylist Push is a Scam,"So, I play 2-4 gigs a month and get paid a few hundred bucks apiece for them, nothing near enough to become a professional, but I thought I'd take some of that money and reinvest it in my music and delve into the wide world of music marketing services. I'm posting my results here for others who are thinking of paying to promote their music. I also would love any advice from those who have done this sort of thing 

To begin, as noted in my title, Playlist Push is a complete scam. I repeat, DO NOY WASTE YOUR MONEY ON PLAYLIST PUSH. I paid them $300 to send a song to their list of ""curated playlists"" the song got put on zero playlists. That's right, 300 dollars for literally nothing. Worse, I got many responses from playlist owners that the song was really good but didn't fit the style of their playlist. So why did Playlist Push send to them? What a joke, so much for ""curated."" Even worse, I sent the exact same song to 15 playlist curators via Submithub and got 2 accepted. So I got about a 10% acceptance rate -- versus 0% -- doing it myself, and more importantly only cost about $20 worth of credits to do so on Submit Hub. If you take one thing away from this post PLEASE DON'T USE PLAYLIST PUSH!

Some other services I used to varying degrees of success:

OmariMC, which claims to get you guaranteed listens. I used their ""bronze""  tier which for $77 says they will get your song 500-5000 plays on spotify. Mine got 1200 as of now, so that's nice. I'm under no illusion that 1200 people actually listened to my song, I'm sure they use bots, but at least I got something to show for my money, unlike Playlist Push.

I decide to use twitter ads, boosting a tweet I sent that had a link to the song. I spent 100 bucks to boost for 5 days. While the tweet got over 100 likes it only got 1 rewteet, resulted in only 1 new follower and had only  13 clickthroughs on the link to the song. So, not great.

I also paid 25 bucks through Reverbnation to have a ""digital ad"" show up on Facebook and other social media platforms. Unfortunately these ads lead those who click on it to your reverbnation page and not spotify/youtube etc and i have no idea how to monetize reverbnation. I also don't trust their statistics; they claim I am the 33rd most popular artist in my region; Well I am in the NYC region and I seriously doubt with all the signed/professional musicians in the NYC area plus the thousands of unsigned acts that I am number 33. But the ad did get 40-50 people to listen to songs on my reverb nation page. For 25 bucks, probably the best value of all the things I did.

I wanted to post this to give real life examples to those who are considering paying for a music promotion service. I was able to reinvest my extra money from gigs into this, but I know many musicians do not have the extra 5-600 bucks to throw at promotion so wanted to help anyone thinking about it. Definitely avoid Playlist Push at all costs. I guess for value the reverbnation ad and submit hub got the best bang for my buck. Omari delivered on what they promised, but I suspect they use bots.

v5lwzv,1654461101.0,metalmusicians,Whyunopraisethesun,"My debut album got 4,400 streams on Spotify in one week and here's how I did it"," I consider the release of my debut album ""Vampiric"" a success. I am a bedroom musician working alone, as many of us are, writing, recording, producing, releasing and promoting music all by ourselves. The tips I've read about promotion are rarely that good or simply outdated. That's why I want to share some concrete advice everyone could have some use for.

**The stats**

During the first week my album got [4,400 streams on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/1jESTrMysbrWrEWc0fC4Ts?si=ba7d9076399e4e13) and [2000 streams on Bandcamp in the app](https://clayshaper.bandcamp.com/album/vampiric-2). 61 fans decided to purchase the album for a price they found fair and 171 downloaded it for free. I earned around $200 just from sales.

**The hard truth** 

Nobody gives a shit about you or your 'new' music. Making good music is just the bare minimum of getting any attention at all. 2022 people are very, very, focused on the visual aspect of whatever you're trying to promote. Pure music is neither visual nor easy to access as most people on their phones won't put in headphones or start the sound just for some random guy. Good music can spread by itself, but it's so rare it's almost a myth at this point. But there are ways getting around this.

**Social Media presence**

[My main channel of communication is Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/clayshaper/). I've found that by using hashtags, following and talking to interesting people and releasing simple videos of me performing my music is the best way to reach out. Battling the algorithm is much harder on Twitter and Facebook, even though sharing links is easier on those platforms. I focus all my energy on Instagram, cross post everything on Facebook, copy paste and shorten for twitter and release longer, high quality content for Youtube to promote my music. If I have vertical video of a performance I will post it on IG Stories, TV, Reels, Youtube Shorts and TikTok. 

**Getting around it**

If people want visual, I give them visual. I started sharing my own photographs and curated contemporary/old art I like (always got permission if it wasn't in the public domain) and transitioned into posting my own art alongside videos of me performing my music. Now people stay for the art and may give my music a chance. I've been doing this for four years and are near [22,000 followers on Instagram.](https://www.instagram.com/clayshaper/?hl=en) Cross platform I have around 29,000 followers (Bandcamp, Spotify, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok). I put no effort into the other ones, but they keep growing there too because of the cross posting.

**Growing a fanbase**

\* Every platform wants to keep it's users on that platform, so I rarely use links just to see my YouTube views get inflated by a couple of clicks, for example. Build a fanbase by grinding on that platform, and call to action down the line when it matters. Don't expect to grow by spamming links.

\* Content that's purely music is hard to pierce the buzz, especially extreme music. Are you a streamer? Artist? Videographer? Photographer? Do you like to cook? Lifestyle enthusiast? Dancer? Working with clay? Literally anything else that's visual can be used to boost your music. But this is just how I like do it.

\* Releasing singles keeps the attention of your fans. Releasing an album creates a bigger buzz. Don't bother sending singles to journalists and reviewers, but absolutely make an effort to promote an album.

**Chronological: The release**

\* Completed the album and put it up on a music distribution service. [Distrokid is popular](https://distrokid.com/vip/seven/1416772?gclid=Cj0KCQjwqPGUBhDwARIsANNwjV7ufQT9m2FUheHzP027Tw0EDIghNMPYra6XawyJzzeWmC84ljnucbcaAnAoEALw_wcB) and has a monthly cost but unlimited uploads. I use [Emubands](https://www.emubands.com/simple-pricing/) to keep all royalties and do album uploads with one time lifetime costs.

\* Claim my Spotify artist page and pitch a song on the album to their editorial theme. My song didn't make the cut, but if accepted it's huge. Do this at least a month prior to release.

\* Began posting short snippets of me playing the new songs to create a hype.

\* Filmed and released a [music video all by myself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnDVvCeRMMU). Posted this on Reddit and submitted the video to YouTube channels like BlankTV and Black Metal Promotion.

\* Ran a small giveaway (band patches) for people who pre-saved the album on Spotify via [smart.url.](https://manage.smarturl.it/)

\* Looked up reviews of bands that sounds like me, gathered the email addresses of those blogs and news outlets. I gathered around 150 of them and blasted out a press release consisting of album art, pictures of me, the songs, a private album stream, some information about the album and my band and quotes by me about the album. This got me featured on [MetalSucks and a couple of other sites](https://www.metalsucks.net/2022/05/26/exclusive-album-stream-clayshaper-spread-their-black-and-poisonous-wings-on-vampiric/). Make it easy to write something interesting about you. Bloggers love fast and easy content.

\* On release I put out [one more music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lwxHgefgm0) video done with a single camera and me in the woods.

\* Submitted my music to 17 metal playlisters on [submithub](https://www.submithub.com/). Was accepted by half of them.

\* Ran Spotify ads on Facebook for $50 for great results. [I followed this tutorial to set them up.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klB5Iq8e7sU)

**Ending**

I have made over 30 demos on compilations and EP:s since I started CLAYSHAPER back in 2018. I know 4,400 doesn't sound like much, but seeing actual people listening to your music in real time on Spotify's dashboard is a cool feeling. Receiving comments about AOTY is also humbling.

ureqvv,1652763008.0,Music,KI2Ds,I really need help to find my actual genre based off my new album.. backstory in the text,"I’m aware asking to check out an album is a bit of a time consuming task. Maybe a few tracks will do.. anyway, I take music very seriously. I have less than 400 followers on Instagram, but still make it a point to pay for the beats I use (not ripping from YouTube) and paying out royalties to the producers as stated in the contracts. I have just released this album produced by Boyfifty (~49K IG followers) and even managed to secure a feature with a notability bigger artist, LIL DUSTY G (~28K IG followers, ~500,000 monthly listeners on Spotify).

Needless to say I put a lot of time, effort and money into my music.. which is where the help I need comes in.

two services I use to promote my music are Playlist Push and SubmitHub. They are both non-guaranteed placement services, meaning you could spend money with 0 results. Regardless, I love it because it’s reaching real people, and I’d much rather have a small amount of organic reach instead of an insane amount of bots streaming my music. However, no matter how I label my music as a genre, it seems the curators/influencers tend to say the tracks are good, but not the genre they are looking for ( I opt for harsh, honest feedback so I don’t think they’re trying to let me down easy)

I’d consider my music alternative hip hop. Although I’ve seen people call this type of  music Alternative rock, emo rap, indie and Lofi rap which to me are all fairly different genres that I wouldn’t consider entirely my genre. I guess I just need to know the most overlapped genre for my album so I can better target curators. I’ll leave the SoundCloud link but will leave any other platform link upon request.

&amp;#x200B;

I think i speak for all of us, when it comes to recieving some attention and recognition on our music. We can use a lot of different platform/websites to try and publish our songs to a wider audience via playlist curators, which then add your song to their playlist for a bigger audience to listen to it. (F.e. submithub is one of the more better known websites regarding this process). So far so good.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently submitted one of my songs to some playlist curators on submithub. But the song was either not interesting enough for the curators, so they either didn't reply, or most of them just straight up rejected the song. No problem here, no one cared. Music is always very subjective and these days there's a lot of really astonishing music producers and therefore music out there. The important thing here is to not give up and try to get better and better !

&amp;#x200B;

But when I checked my spotify account a few days later I was surprised to see that nevertheless I went from absolutely 0 listeners to 78 within less than a day. 99% of these listeners originate from one country and were from ""Other listener's playlist"" - 1 playlist. So you may ask where's the scam now ?

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where things get interesting. When I checked which playlist these plays were coming from (spotify shows in the section ""found in"" playlists which contain the music profile, and there was only one playlist for my account). The playlist name and curator both were advertising a website. The website lets you buy streams for real money... The playlist itself has hundreds of thousands of plays, but the spotify curator account barely has 25 followers. So all the plays that were coming from that playlist onto my track are fake. I won't go into any names here but I suspect that one of the submithub curators or someone close to them must run this website hoping they can make money of ""desperate"" music creators which actually seems clever and extremely disgusting at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

(f.e. submithub is one of the more better known websites regarding this process). so far so good. &x200b; i recently submitted one of my songs to some playlist curators on submithub. but the song was either not interesting enough for the curators, so they either didn't reply, or most of them just straight up rejected the song. no problem here, no one cared. music is always very subjective and these days there's a lot of really astonishing music producers and therefore music out there. the important thing here is to not give up and try to get better and better ! &x200b; but when i checked my spotify account a few days later i was surprised to see that nevertheless i went from absolutely 0 listeners to 78 within less than a day. 99% of these listeners originate from one country and were from ""other listener's playlist"" - 1 playlist. so you may ask where's the scam now ? &x200b; here's where things get interesting. when i checked which playlist these plays were coming from (spotify shows in the section ""found in"" playlists which contain the music profile, and there was only one playlist for my account). the playlist name and curator both were advertising a website. the website lets you buy streams for real money... the playlist itself has hundreds of thousands of plays, but the spotify curator account barely has 25 followers. so all the plays that were coming from that playlist onto my track are fake. i won't go into any names here but i suspect that one of the submithub curators or someone close to them must run this website hoping they can make money of ""desperate"" music creators which actually seems clever and extremely disgusting at the same time. &x200b; the important lesson here is to not fall for this and keep focusing on your own music skills getting better and better. hopefully this finds it's way to the person who needs it the most, because this might seem quiet tempting starting off making music and not having any listeners yet.",7,420

Initially, we were excited yet cautiously optimistic at the prospect of signing with a label that has access to more marketing and networking resources than we have on our own. Once we got deeper into the signing process, though, we quickly abandoned the deal due to some bizarre occurrences with the label that I will outline here. I've chosen to keep this story anonymous because I don't want any recognition for my band's music coming from this post. Rather, I want to provide a cautionary tale to other bands who might find themselves in our position.

For the purposes of anonymity, I will call the label representative who reached out to us ""Mark."" Mark connected with my band via social media after we submitted to his label on Submithub, which means that none of our conversations occurred on Submithub itself.  I submitted our music this label because we are a coed band and many of the other bands on this label were coed, too, and their collective sounds mixed well with our genre.

Initially, I thought it was odd that a label president would DM us on our social media to start a conversation about a record deal, particularly since our e-mail and phone number are visible on our website and social media. However, I decided to be cautiously openminded about his approach. Mark said that he was visiting our city soon and that we could sign the deal when he was in town. I started asking Mark business and legal questions about the deal. Mark dodged most of my questions at first and emphasized that he likes to be ""personal"" so that he can get to know the bands on his label. I got the sense that Mark was trying hard to put out the vibe that he wasn't some ""corporate"" label suit.

When I asked Mark for a copy of the record contract, he didn't respond to my question at first. Instead, he sent us a link to a video of The Rock and talked about how The Rock is a huge inspiration to him. Mark also revealed that he once tried to take his own life. He said that music ""saved"" him from taking his own life and that he started a label to help advocate for mental health. I'm a mental health therapist in my day job, so, of course, I was empathetic to his struggles and to his label's mission. However, I couldn't help but feel like Mark was somehow being disingenuous. Again, I tried to be openminded, and I figured Mark was maybe just trying to keep things personal before talking about business.

For the next several hours, though, Mark would DM us with more personal questions about ourselves. He said that he ""hates drama"" and then immediately started speaking poorly about bands he rejected from his label. Because all of us in the band were busy that day, we couldn't keep an ongoing dialogue via the DMs. When we went a few minutes without responding, Mark would say, ""Hello?"" and presented as agitated when we couldn't respond immediately.

I finally asked Mark, ""Hey, it's been nice connecting with you on here. Can we schedule a meeting sometime this week to talk about the deal?"" Mark responded, ""No, it's too hard to accommodate everyone's schedules. We'll just chat here."" I said, ""Actually, we are all available in the late afternoon and evening every day for the next several weeks. What day would work for you?""

At this point, Mark became frustrated with us and lamented, ""No one cares about making personal connections anymore. I'll email the contract to you right now, though."" I then replied to Mark, ""Great! I'll have our legal team look over the contract. Can you give us a few days to read over it?""

Now, a typical business person in this position would say, ""Yes, please look over the contract and let me know what questions you have!"" Not Mark, though. Mark became defensive and replied: ""Well, the record contract was good enough for (the band he most recently signed) and their team of lawyers, so I'm sure it's good enough for yours, too."" At this point, all of us in the band were ready to back out right at that moment, but we figured that regardless of the outcome this could be a good learning experience for us, so we decided to keep entertaining the offer.

I sent the contract to two lawyers who work with my band. Both lawyers had serious concerns about the record contract. The writing had poor grammar and diction. According to one of our lawyers, the contract ""looked like a law student taking Contract Law for the first time wrote it as a class assignment."" The legally binding terms of the contract were problematic, too. There's too many problematic sentences to quote here, but here's just one example. Regarding royalties, the contract states, ""The Artist in connection with those Entertainment Services and the parties agree to share the income and royalties generated by the rendering of these certain Entertainment Services by (record company name)."" The contract, however, did not state what percentage of royalties we would split with Mark and his label.

While we were in the process of reviewing the contract with our lawyers, Mark started DMing our singer on her personal DMs. While Mark did not state anything explicitly sexual to our singer, Mark made several inappropriate comments to her that creeped her out. For example, Mark complained about being harassed by salesman at the mall. He bragged about his body size and said he ""dared"" someone to ""mess"" with him again at the mall. Our singer was polite and gave him brief responses because she was afraid of making him upset; however, she was extremely uncomfortable with these DMs and wondered why he wasn't messaging anyone else in the band. This next idea is purely speculative: as I mentioned earlier, all of the bands on Mark's label were mixed gender. We wondered if Mark used his authority as a ""label president"" to put women into uncomfortable conversations and situations. Again, I'm not sure if this was Mark's true intention, but that's how he came across to us.

Given everything I have described so far, we decided that there were waaay too many red flags, so I wrote politely to Mark via email and told him that we were backing out of the deal. We also blocked Mark on all of our social media so that he couldn't contact us there. Mark wrote back to us and said verbatim, ""My opinion of you was clearly wrong. I hope you act more appropriately in the future.""

Submithub isn't perfect, but I do think it's a great way to get immediate feedback on your music. Yes, like many posters here, we have received some baffling and inconsistent feedback on our music. However, I'd say that 75% of our rejection feedback has been constructive and helpful. I think it's so easy to become lost in rejection, though, that you can lose sight of yourself and your art. I wanted to share this story to show you that receiving an acceptance from Submithub may not come with the glory and recognition you seek. We have friends who have been accepted to ""popular"" curators' playlists on Submithub whose acceptances yielded little to no increase in their Spotify audience.

While I'm sure there are many honest and reputable labels on Submithub, this experience showed us that we might be better off networking with labels the old fashioned way. My band has no delusions of grandeur about becoming wealthy and famous from our art, though. We treat our music like a small business. We view money, recognition, and networking connections as resources that will help us to continue making better art. We recognize there's many viable paths to success in music, and we're also fortunate enough to have day jobs we all love that help us support our professional hobby. While the events of this story were frustrating to experience, they reminded us that we aren't desperate to receive a label offer and that we are probably better off just being DIY unless a truly great offer comes around.

1) You can download your own songs from your computer into your Spotify library and create playlists and (?) share the playlist after. But you can't share individual songs links. 

2) You have to use a distribution music service like Distrokid and so many others... and then, you are able to share individual song links and your song can be added to playlists.

tsvpma,1648717727.0,Lofi_Beats_Submission,echoworldco,THE BASICS FOR SUBMITTING YOUR MUSIC! If you don't use dailyplaylists or submithub you're missing a trick (info below),"&amp;#x200B;

To some of yall this might be obvious (if so scroll on!), but this is for those in the thread who don't know, we wanted to remind everyone websites which are made specifically for submitting to playlists:

&amp;#x200B;

Dailyplaylists

&amp;#x200B;

You signup with your spotify account, can submit your songs (and playlists if over 100 followers) to loads of different genre playlists. You get 25 free submissions every week so it's a quick 5 min way to regularly share your music with curators! If you're a playlisters with over 100 followers too you can host your playlist on the website, easily get more followers and have a system which allows you to scroll through submissions and add them easily on the website.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Submithub

Now this one is a little more work! You get new credits everytime you check in to the website (daily), and you can spend 1-3 credits to submit to playlists, channels and blogs. Sometimes curators can be a bit harsh on there but DONT BE DISCOURAGED, it's a daily practice which doesn't take too long if you're looking for another place to share your songs. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, as you all know we offer a completely free list of playlist curators and how to submit to them [HERE](https://www.toneden.io/echo-uk/post/spotify-playlists), so if you want to do it the classic way (email. dm or form) you can use this too.",9,0.84,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lofi_Beats_Submission/comments/tsvpma/the_basics_for_submitting_your_music_if_you_dont/,THE BASICS FOR SUBMITTING YOUR MUSIC!

I've seen mixed reviews here but wanted to see for myself.

We submitted to 18 outlets. 

I specifically targeted outlets primarily with decent Spotify playlist monthly listens and only those with at least a score of 7 for genre match.  I also included some blogs if they were a good match and their description sounded appropriate for us.  I spent about an hour going through the curator options to identify the best matches for our music.

I spent $30 for 30 credits and used 29 of them.

By the end of the 48 hours, we received feedback from 17 of the 18 outlets.

They were all declines unfortunately, but I did find the feedback pretty interesting.  Most reviewers listened to the whole song, some more than once.  There is an interface on submithub where you can see exactly when and how long each curator listened which is cool.

As far as the quality of the feedback, I was mostly satisfied as most provided enough information to indicate they paid attention.


Some feedback said the mix needed work, some thought it was perfect for our style.  Several loved the vocals and one said they couldn't finish the song because of the vocals.  Some loved the guitar and chord choices, some said they were uninteresting.  A few loved the lyrics, some said they were too repetitive. Some really enjoyed the arrangement for the vibe, some found it stale.   Some disputed the genre or made suggestions about where we might fit better.

While it may sound like the feedback is not useful, I actually think it is.  Some curators were clearly not a fan of the style in general and therefore while it's worth noting their criticisms, if it's something about the identity of the music as a whole it's probably fair to disregard. However when some highlight areas they really enjoyed that are conscious design decisions, and also shared specific criticisms they felt lacking, I think this information is pretty useful.


I will say the service is probably most useful if your music fits clearly into an established genre.

As an 'indie rock' band, you could be Soccer Mommy or Pavement and still be under that same genre label where people may love one style and hate the other.

Still, based on the feedback from this go around I think we could narrow the focus if we decided to do it again and I would strongly consider it.


My verdict is that it's a decent way to get feedback from the modern day gatekeepers and see how you stack up to the expectations they have. It can be eye opening.  If you're specifically looking to maximize your  marketing money I don't know that it's the best way to go and probably wouldn't recommend it.

stbjy1,1644954500.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,PHPLights,Info relating to websites like SubmitHub that I just discovered,"So, this may not be of huge news for anyone, but I recently stumbled across a job listing for a ""music blob submissions assistant"". 
Essentially, you listen to submissions and decide if it's a good fit for any playlists, but the interesting thing was: 

THEY ARE INCENTIVIZED TO LISTEN FOR AS LITTLE TIME AS POSSIBLE

Why does this matter?: 

If your track has a 10 second intro, or even a 5 second intro, that doesn't immediately grip them, it's likely they're gonna pass on your song. They get paid per submission listened to, so if they take their time to listen all the way through each song, they won't be making much money.

Submithub is a platform which connects music creators with playlist owners and influencers. In exchange for a dollar (or two or three) you get a chance to get your Spotify track playlisted (or shouted out by an influencer.)

Most of the time it feels like I’m at Vegas pumping money into a slot machine as most of the playlists you get on have minimal listeners or they have a time limit for how long you are on them. But this method that I used ensured that I got some of that money back. Two things to notice.

1. I made sure my music fit on the friendly-genre list. This is a list that helps you determine which playlists have a high acceptance rate to their specific playlist. LoFi typically racks up around 45%. It’s a good genre to get playlisted.

1. I made certain that when I found a playlist that was getting me consistent streams that I found out where that playlist owner was most of the time and I did a little bit of stalking.

I did it all I think- sending music to radios, submit hub and response rate is VERY low! Been played on a few local radio stations but getting into big shows seems hard. Most Spotify playlists which will put your song in are either fake or ask for money (and at the same time they are also likely fake).

Socials are also growing VERY slowly unless you have HUNDREDS of pounds/dollars to throw into ads (which I don't).

rf219i,1639354000.0,musicmarketing,nick_minieri,Zero luck using facebook ads to promote underground house/uk garage releases - any advice?,"Hey there - been an active reader of this sub for awhile now. Having some difficulty running facebook ads to promote several of my recent releases, and wanted to discuss to see if it's a common problem vs something on my end that I'm doing wrong.

Basically I had a deep house release come out last month and a uk garage one several days ago. Set up a $20/day conversion campaign (that I turned down to $5 after a few days) for both with budget optimization turned on, and then did multiple ad sets for each of them. Each set had audiences set to all tier 1 and most tier 2 countries, with detail targeting set to people who like spotify plus both the genre and different similar artist for each set. 

This is where I began running into problems because deep house and uk garage are too niche to even show up, and neither do specific artists in those categories (such as todd edwards or mj cole for garage, mall grab for lo-fi house) so it's a challenge to narrow down my target audience.

For each set I have custom made banners (I know the basics of After Effects so can do somewhat decent animated ones) that has all the important release info pop up quickly on them. I'll edit the banners slightly different for each set, with different sections of the song, to test to see which ones perform better. I also only run ads on facebook and instagram stories. Toneden is set up as the landing page, with a custom URL.

On the Toneden page I can see that I'm getting traffic, but I'm getting close to zero plays when checking my daily spotify analytics. For the november release almost all the plays are coming from the playlists I was added to on submithub, which I actually had decent luck with. I can't even get the conversion rates to under $1.00 per conversion, which I know is really bad.

Is it harder in general to run ads on niche, lesser known styles of music using facebook ads? As an unknown artist I'm obviously not expecting tens of thousands of daily plays, but am surprised I'm not even getting a small handful. I know some people who do more commercial styles of music with vocals have luck, and am well aware of the fact it could be my music just isn't there yet quality-wise. But am curious to see other people's experiences with it in niche genres.

qz4o99,1637529473.0,musicmarketing,westaiko,Advice having exhausted all means of marketing,"Hello! Reaching out to y'all about any alternative successful strategies you've had to getting your music out there and heard.

For some context, we're a 3 piece DIY indie/alt rock band that's been really trying to push to get our music out there. We've been together for about 5 years but only really seriously started trying to get our music out there in the past 2 or so years. We have less than 150 followers on IG, 35 subs on Youtube and just getting start with Tik Tok. We've done everything that's talked about out there from setting up proper facebook targeted ad campaigns to putting together a social media campaign across all networks (tik tok, IG reels, youtube), working Spotify profiles and playlists, and putting together SubmitHub campaigns. We've put out 4 singles now, each time we really put a lot of effort into improving not only our marketing strategy but our recording, musicianship and production. 

All said and done, I feel like with everything our growth is so slow that it's not worth any of the effort we've been putting into any of it. Honestly, social media and marketing is really not our strong suit so we've just been trying to find as much advice as we can through reddit and youtube and put together a strategy that works for us. 

I'd like to put out some on our experiences with various strategies. Just curious what y'all think or if you have any suggestions.

**Facebook Ads**

Not worth it at all (IG as well). Unless you're a major act with a good following to work the algorithms no one who sees your ad is going to care. It probably takes some more clever manipulation of the content of your ad but unless you're paying someone experienced to do this for you then it's probably a waste of time and money.

**Tik Tok and Reels for reach**

Using things like Tik Tok and IG reels to get instant reach is something we've been trying more and honestly still just trying to find an identity and what works for us there. I think one of our hang ups here is that basically you have to be okay with putting out stuff you may not be happy with creatively but if you're spending more than a few hours throwing it together you're wasting time. We like to put a lot of time and effort into our work so this goes against everything that makes us comfortable. But we are trying. Not sure how this will work out for us yet.

**Social Media Engagement**

This part kills me lol but posting stories everyday about whatever is not really in our personality so it's really hard to maintain consistency here. But we have found ways to maintain posts at least on a weekly basis like curating our own playlists and shouting out bands or songs on our stories that we at least find interesting. This is something that is at the very least  fun for us but we still  really struggle here overall.

**Playlisting and SubmitHub/Playlist Push**

We only care about growing organically and will never go near any of those playlist scams. Streams counts also don't matter to us at all. However SubmitHub for us at least seem legit in the beginning. More recently I feel like curators there are just there to take their credits in exchange for some nice words about your song. But in the end they just say something generic like ""sorry but just not quite enough for us."" Our experience here isn't all bad. We've been playlisted only a few times (in our first song of all songs) and found a blog who wrote an excellent article about us. But even with those there didn't seem to be much of a return on our investment. We were feeling best about our most recent song but we've had zero success on SubmitHub despite success in the past.

I've looked into playlist push to automate this process a bit since I'm starting to get an identity crisis and wondering if I'm even targeting the right curators based on our genre on submit hub. Ultimately, the cost for a campaign on playlist push doesn't seem worth it...$200+ for getting exposed to only about 20 curators seems ridiculous to me.

**Spotify** 

Still trying to do all the things Spotify suggests you do...playlist pitch your song a month in advance, maintain your profile page and artists playlists. Haven't really seen any success here yet either but I feel like all you can really do is just keep at it and just hope it pays dividends later. It's ultimately not a whole lot of effort to do so it's the least we can do out of anything.

**YouTube**

At this point I feel like this is the outlet or platform is where we feel most comfortable. I think it's just about putting together more quality long form content and various types of a videos for your song...Visualizers, Music Videos, Performance Videos, Covers...we're going to attempt to do lyric videos and Behind the Scenes videos...but I feel like these are only more interesting once you have a reasonable following. But youtube is where I get the most gratification for the amount of work put in at least. And seems like sometimes you may get lucky with the suggestions algorithm. I haven't really considered Youtube Ads but who ever really watches those anyway...I even pay for Premium just to not have them on the videos I watch. But I've never tried an ad campaign there so not sure if anyone else has had success. No one ever really seems to suggest this as the way to go either.

\---

Anyways, sorry this ended up being so long winded. But if anyone has any alternative platforms or strategies that have worked for getting that initial growth I'm all ears.

qt91mj,1636834132.0,Logic_Studio,RepublicKlutzy9338,Research and portfolio participation?,"Hello  music folks.  Hope you're all keeping well. 

(TLDR   do you make music, would you like to take part in a (free) podcast series?) 


I'm a mature student of Audio Production and as part of my course this year I am required to deliver a creative portfolio concept.

What I have decided to do is compile a series of podcasts that are aimed at engaging with producers, listen to one of your tracks (not review it) talk about it, your identity as a producer /artist, journey, philosophy, aims, purpose, preferred gear etc... among other things, running to 20 to 30 minutes each, (I'm still fleshing out the format) 

The series will be broadcast part of  the college's online radio show and uploaded to the usual suspects, and if the concept gets enough participant interest will run bi monthly over at least the next 2 years, and if it really takes off, will be a feature of the radio production courses the college offers.

We will be building a playlist too both for Spotify and the radio show in general.  There is no cost involved, all totally voluntary. 

I'm keen to understand what level of interest there would be in getting involved as an interviewee and taking part is some questionnaires and pre interview research discussions on the format, it's value to the listener, and participant. 

Level of experience isn't important, though my preference is towards those that are earlier on in their hobby / career as indies, amateurs and tinkerers, though professionals are welcome too, and would/could serve as inspirational discussions/features 

I am aware I could just sign up as a curator at submithub or similar and may well do, but initially would like to structure something a bit more personal and more interested in the person and mindset than the music, if you see what I mean?

 

If you have any thoughts and opinions, please do share them in the comments as any answer is valuable and will be a valid contribution to the discussion and my research. 

Thank you and hopefully we'll speak soon.

Well, I used to work on Soundcampaign for a while and I noticed many things:

\- As curators, the 1st point I explained means that we're the 'bad' guys from the artist perspective, so we can get negative reviews from the artists.

\- Then comes Soundcampaign and say your 'reviews' aren't being good enough (which are very extended and well developed, never had any complaint on Submithub for example) and they use that excuse to avoid paying us for our work.

qb775b,1634632375.0,mixingmastering,JoshFirefly,Dealing with emotions,"Hey, looking for some advice on how you deal with client feedback and resulting emotions.

Background is that I recently finished a mix that I put a lot of hours into to get it „perfect“ and radio ready (talking 30+ hours). I went beyond the norm, did a lot of production tasks too because some things were lacking and some things needed fixing. I did it because I truly enjoyed the song and felt it deserved the extra effort. The result is pretty good, I shared it with some mixing friends who liked it and also got a lot of very positive written feedback via submithub (first time trying that).

I then sent to the client (a band) and got some good feedback but also some that I perceived as non-constructive and negative (e.g. you manipulated my sound, it sounds like an 80s Bontempi, it sounds overproduced).

I am totally fine with the client not agreeing and wanting revisions, no sweat at all and I deliver the revisions with a smile and a “thank you for your feedback“. This is not my first mix and I have learned over time that often the clients do have good suggestions that work.

So my lesson learned is to in the future always ask the client if he is OK with alterations to the sound along the way.

But this instance did eat at me emotionally because I am convinced that the original version sounded significantly better than the revision.

How do you folks deal with this situation that the seasoned amongst you surely have come across…?","hey, looking for some advice on how you deal with client feedback and resulting emotions. background is that i recently finished a mix that i put a lot of hours into to get it „perfect“ and radio ready (talking 30 hours). i went beyond the norm, did a lot of production tasks too because some things were lacking and some things needed fixing. i did it because i truly enjoyed the song and felt it deserved the extra effort. the result is pretty good, i shared it with some mixing friends who liked it and also got a lot of very positive written feedback via submithub (first time trying that). i then sent to the client (a band) and got some good feedback but also some that i perceived as non-constructive and negative (e.g. you manipulated my sound, it sounds like an 80s bontempi, it sounds overproduced). i am totally fine with the client not agreeing and wanting revisions, no sweat at all and i deliver the revisions with a smile and a “thank you for your feedback“. this is not my first mix and i have learned over time that often the clients do have good suggestions that work. so my lesson learned is to in the future always ask the client if he is ok with alterations to the sound along the way. but this instance did eat at me emotionally because i am convinced that the original version sounded significantly better than the revision.  how do you folks deal with this situation that the seasoned amongst you surely have come across…?",3,264

q3rla1,1633672491.0,MusicPromotionTricks,iplaythelaptop,Find Spotify Playlist Curators: How to Get Placed on Spotify Playlists,"Playlists have become the easiest and most effective tool for new artists to get discovered, in the digital era of music. And yet the entire concept feels akin to witchcraft and wizardry for the uninitiated. 

That is fully understandable because playlists and **Spotify playlist curators** can be rather confusing. 

Here is everything you need to know about the different kinds of playlists and how you can end up on each of them. 

## Types of Spotify Playlists

It's important to go through the basics of the type of playlists that exist, before we jump onto the curation process.

**Spotify playlist curators** create a variety of playlists on the platform. The three most common types of playlists are Spotify Algorithmic Playlists, **Spotify Editorial Playlists**, and Listener’s Playlists.  
 

### 1. Spotify Algorithmic Playlists:

These playlists are created for the user specifically based on their listening habits. They are curated automatically for each Spotify user and are extremely personalized to their taste. Some common algorithmic playlists include 

* **Discover Weekly**, 30 new songs that are unheard of by the user 
* **Release Radar,** this playlist includes new songs released by artists that the listener already listens to
* **Daily Mix**, these are 6 playlists that include all the songs that a listener is familiar with 
* **On Repeat**, songs that you have been replaying in the last month
* **Repeat Rewind**, songs that you have had on repeat in the past

Getting your songs included in Algorithmic Playlists, can help your song reach listeners who will most certainly like it. These playlists have a high reach and are likely to make listeners loyal fans. However, you can’t pitch to someone to end up on these playlists as they’re created automatically.  
 

### 2. Spotify Editorial Playlists:

These are massively popular playlists that are made specifically by **Spotify Playlist curators**. These curators are in the editorial teams made by Spotify, and are music and genre experts. The playlists in this category can either be classified according to the genres or even made for certain specific situations. These playlists get a lot of followers and can help in highlighting smaller artists and make them massively popular. 

While creating **Spotify Editorial Playlist** playlists, **Spotify Playlist curators** usually try out songs by the smaller artists in smaller playlists first, and then if they gain traction, they are added to the playlists with a larger following. 

Getting your songs on these playlists can prove to be a huge advantage, and increase your streams by a great margin. To get your song added to these playlists, you can send your song for **Spotify Playlist Submission** a week or two before you release it to Spotify via your distributor. 

### 3. Listener Playlists:

These types of playlists are usually made by the listeners for their own use, but sometimes celebrities, influencers, brands, and companies can also make these and have extensive reach and followers. Some well-known companies that make their own playlists are: 

* [Systemic](https://open.spotify.com/user/oovgpqfyd2zjgkcm5ran58rog)
* [ChillTracks](https://open.spotify.com/user/khjj8khh7av6wbwtgspa3odyt)
* [LazyFrenzy](https://open.spotify.com/user/dbgkpwuxwg4q39w0ze1200ssz)

User-generated playlists can at times draw in huge numbers of followers and can produce a significant number of listeners and streams for an emerging artist. They also have the potential to influence Spotify’s algorithmic playlists: whenever a user adds your track to their playlist, it provides data to Spotify about the type of music they like. With enough data, Spotify can then recommend that track to other users who have similar listening habits, resulting in long-term audience growth.  


## Submitting Your Music In Spotify Playlists

Here's how you can help your songs get placed into playlists that are made by **Spotify Playlist Curators**.  


**1. Submit your song to Spotify** 

This is for Spotify's Editorial Playlists. Submit your songs to Spotify for consideration, at least a week before your release. A feature on Spotify's editorial playlists can really jumpstart a new musician's career. For a higher chance to be selected by **Spotify Playlist Curators** try to have a steady listener count and be specific about your music when you submit it. Make sure your metadata is filled in properly.  


**2. Pitch Your Music to Listener Playlists**

If you are a new musician, pitching your music to Listener **Spotify Playlist Curators** has a greater success rate as compared to pitching your music directly to Spotify. These curators usually charge a fee to listen to your music. Do note that no listener playlist will guarantee a playlist placement, since that is illegal. 

You might feel reserved about spending money just to get your music heard, and think that if you wait around you will get discovered, but pitching to curators is really one of the most efficient ways for new fans to stumble upon your music. These curators are also excited to meet new musicians, so reach out. 

Go for a reputable service like Submithub or StreamCatcher which is a boutique music submission service that brings together a plethora of curators for a lot of genres of music. You can submit your music for consideration for their playlists in exchange for a small fee.   


**3. Categorize your music**

Make sure you listen to a playlist before you pitch your music to it. When you are pitching your music, describe the genre, mood, type, and the works. This will increase the chances of your music being accepted. Don’t be afraid to paint a picture, like “Songs to listen to while driving” or “Songs for Rainy Days.”  


**4. Try to focus on your best song**

While submitting your song to get considered for playlists, submit your best song or the song that you think has the highest potential first. This song should be catchy and get the attention of the listener, ideally in the first few seconds of the song. If you only submit quality songs to a curator, the curator is likely to remember it. The converse is true as well.   


**5. Keep your pitch short**

When you are sending your song to playlist curators, keep your pitch short and sweet. Do your research about the playlists and make sure that your song will fit on the playlist. Tell them why you think it will be a perfect addition to their playlist. Be polite and brief, and never act entitled.

Getting on playlists is surely a great step that can help you get discovered, especially as a new artist.",7,0.9,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/MusicPromotionTricks/comments/q3rla1/find_spotify_playlist_curators_how_to_get_placed/,Find Spotify Playlist Curators How to Get Placed on Spotify Playlists,find spotify playlist curators how to get placed on spotify playlists,"Playlists have become the easiest and most effective tool for new artists to get discovered, in the digital era of music.

piesl9,1630854578.0,musicmarketing,nuxx9,"Lessons from having released with a label, in a very niche genre. Now considering my next steps.","I self released (using Distrokid) my first track back in January 2021, and gained a very small following. I am in my 40s, so an older producer also working in a very niche genre, progressive psy-trance (similar to Neelix, or Ghost Rider). It's not my day job. Btw, psy-trance purists hate progressive (with vocals) psy-trance. It's just what the genre is called (I didn't name it), and it's really popular in Hamburg Gemany, Israel, and Brazil. 

I soon learned that focusing on Soundcloud for marketing was a pointless exercise, since the majority of the small following I have there are just other producers. What Soundcloud did give me, is contact with another producer that agreed to collaborate with me. Back in June I sent him my third track that was almost finished.

He happened to be friends with the owner of a record label in Hamburg, probably the biggest label know for progressive psy-trance, so we released the track with them. My Spotify monthly listeners increased 954%, to 9,000 monthly listeners from that one track alone. This is the power of a label, since they got the track on some big playlists.

While am I a new producer, I have worked with the audio engineering side of things since the 1990s, so I know I have my mixes on-point. I also do mastering, but with this track we had the label do the mastering. However, this is just a hobby for me. I love being creative and producing.

**Lesson 1:** Collaboration. The other producer didn't have to change much about the track. Some effects and a new kick / bass line was added (from a sample pack!) and that's it. The entire composition, arrangement, vocals, synths, and other bits were my original work. From his perspective I am benefiting from his 30k+ social media following and contact at the label.  He told me that this label gives preference to collaborating artists, as it pools together their social media following, and lowers risk. If either of us wanted to do it solo, they wouldn't be interested unless you have a huge following in the first place, and can pull crowds at gigs. Getting signed with a label, and releasing a track or two are completely different things.

**Lesson 2:** Social media. I am not on Facebook, and I don't want to be. I have a new Twitter and Instagram account (&lt; 100 followers), a website, and obviously Soundcloud, and Spotify.  Without a large social media following, I can release a track myself with Distrokid or similar, but nobody will know about it. I can't use ads, since I don't have a Facebook account.  Google ads are a waste of money.  What I have found out from my one popular release, is that 70% of listeners are coming from playlists. 

**Lesson 3**: Playlists. As I eluded, playlists are king especially for niche genre's. Sure if you produce rap, pop, rock, something like that then Spotify's Feel Good Friday, Release Radar, and other playlists are essential. Labels will often have their own, and contacts at massive playlists. Without the power of a label then I will have to rely of something like SubmitHub.

**Lesson 4:** Mainstream tastes. I have just finished my latest track, and it's way better than anything else I've done, including the label release. But they don't want it (unless it's a collab). Other labels I have sent it to haven't even listened to it (Soundcloud stats are useful!). One other label did say this has potential to be a top-tier track, but they'd want 50% royalties, they do the artwork, and they want to add more effects, synth sounds, etc. But here is the thing, I know exactly what they are getting it, but then it'll become the same as the rest of the music out there. It's cheesy. So I could give in, do what they ask, despite it getting ruined (from my original sound)... or release myself again. If I do it myself, I do the artwork, choose who masters it, and have full say over the creative aspects.

So what is next for me?

By day I work in cybersecurity, and get paid well for it. So I am not going to be traveling (post COVID) to gigs doing DJ sets, even as cool as it sounds, this is just a hobby. The question is, I know I can continue to do better and better, but it's getting to the point where I either buckle and change the track to 'conform' to what labels want, or I collaborate and allow others to stamp their mark so I can use their massive social media following. Or... I just release myself and be lucky if 100 people hear it.

I haven't fully decided yet, but I am leaning towards SubmitHub and focusing on playlists again.

pgzgvb,1630649786.0,MusicPromotion,iplaythelaptop,Different Types of Spotify Playlists &amp; How They Can Help You Grow,"Today, a huge part of being successful as an indie artist is getting their music onto well-known playlists. **Spotify** is arguably the biggest in the business when it comes to these playlists. In this blog, we’re going to dig deeper into the kinds of **Spotify playlists** and what role and purpose each of them plays in **music marketing** and helping an artist’s audience grow.

Majorly, there are 3 **types of Spotify Playlists**: Spotify Algorithmic Playlists, Spotify Editorial Playlists, and Listener Playlists. Let’s dive in.

## 1. Spotify Algorithmic Playlists

**Spotify Algorithmic Playlists** are those Spotify playlists that are created automatically for each user on Spotify. This is done by monitoring each user’s listening habits and analyzing this information to curate these super personalized playlists. Here are a few important algorithmic playlists:

## Discover Weekly

Discover Weekly is a weekly updated algorithmic playlist which is personalized and unique for every user of Spotify. Each Monday, this playlist offers 30 songs to each Spotify user that they’ve never heard before. The songs in this playlist can be anything ranging from unheard songs from an artist you enjoy to music from artists similar to the ones you enjoy.

## Release Radar

Release Radar is a bit more straightforward. Each Friday, this playlist curates new releases from the artists that you listen to and enjoy. 

## Daily Mix

The Daily Mix is a set of up to 6 playlists that Spotify curates, designed to provide comfortable and familiar music. It is inspired by your favourite music according to your Spotify activity. It is different from the Discover Weekly playlist because the Daily Mix emphasizes more on familiarity and less on discovery. 

## On Repeat

 The On Repeat playlist only contains the tracks that you’ve been playing the most over the past month. This playlist keeps auto-updating itself.

## Repeat Rewind

Repeat Rewind, on the other hand, is a way to reminisce about your favorite songs from the near past by including the songs that you used to have on repeat from over a month ago. 

## How These Playlists Can Help Grow Your Audience on Spotify:

Spotify algorithmic playlists have an insanely high reach. These are highly targeted towards listeners who are almost certain to love your music. This can bring about a shockingly huge number of streams, especially for talented artists in less popular genres. Spotify users that regularly listen to playlists like Discover Weekly and Release Radar are generally likely to be “active” listeners, who actively search for new music. These listeners, while fewer in number, are much more likely to turn into loyal fans.

## 2. Spotify Editorial Playlists

Spotify has a Shows &amp; Editorial Team which curates the Spotify Editorial playlists for them. This team has music experts and genre specialists from around the world, specially hired by Spotify to curate playlists. 

These playlists typically have large followings and a lot of indie artists have these playlists to thank for suddenly skyrocketing their discovery. Many of these playlists are genre-specific – think “RapCaviar”, “Hot Country”, or “Rock This”. Others are more context-driven, such as “Songs to Sing in the Shower”, “Teen Party”, or “Relax &amp; Unwind”.

The Editorial Team of Spotify will often test out new tracks on smaller “feeder” playlists. For example, tracks that perform well on a playlist like “New Noise” (289K followers) might be promoted to “Rock This” (4.3M followers); songs that gain traction on a playlist such as “Most Necessary” (1.8M followers) might eventually end up on “Rap Caviar” (10.3M followers).

## How This Playlist Type Can Help Grow Your Audience on Spotify

Spotify Editorial Playlists enjoy the undeniable advantage, as far as number of followers is concerned. Most musicians are justifiably keen on getting a spot on these playlists, and for good reason: a placement on a major playlist like ""Your Favorite Coffeehouse"" or ""Peaceful Piano"" can translate into countless new audiences and streams. However, a big chunk of these streams can be ""drive-by"" streams. These listeners can often be more passive about their music listening habits; they’re less likely to turn into active, long-term fans. Note that Spotify for Artists allows you to submit your upcoming releases to Spotify’s editorial team, about 1-2 weeks before your release date. Make sure to do so!

## 3. Listener Playlists

User-generated playlists or listener playlists are those that are made and maintained by Spotify users themselves. These users can decide whether to make their playlists ""secret"" or ""public"". While many Spotify users curate playlists for their own enjoyment, numerous organizations, companies, celebrities etc. curate their own playlists, typically as an approach to expand their brand.

Let’s take a few examples.

* [Stream Catcher](https://www.streamcatcher.co/)

This is a group of expert curators that work with an ever growing network of Spotify curators and Youtube networks. The Stream Catcher A&amp;R team spends close to an hour listening and evaluating every song which comes through, to help artists broaden their horizons and reach a wider and more global audience. 

* [SubmitHub](https://www.submithub.com/)

Created by Jason Grishkoff (founder of the very popular blog IndieShuffle), on SubmitHub, you can pay bloggers, playlisters, radio programmers, Soundclouders and YouTubers to listen to your song for possible inclusion on their (hopefully) high-trafficked site/playlist/channel. 

## How This Playlist Type Can Help Grow Your Audience on Spotify

User-generated playlists can at times draw in huge numbers of followers and can produce a significant number of listeners and streams for an emerging artist. They also have the potential to influence Spotify’s algorithmic playlists: whenever a user adds your track to their playlist, it provides data to Spotify about the type of music they like. With enough data, Spotify can then recommend that track to other users who have similar listening habits, resulting in long-term audience growth.

Getting on playlists is surely a great step that can help you get discovered, especially as a new artist.

This playlist keeps auto-updating itself.  Repeat Rewind Repeat Rewind, on the other hand, is a way to reminisce about your favorite songs from the near past by including the songs that you used to have on repeat from over a month ago.   How These Playlists Can Help Grow Your Audience on Spotify Spotify algorithmic playlists have an insanely high reach. These are highly targeted towards listeners who are almost certain to love your music. This can bring about a shockingly huge number of streams, especially for talented artists in less popular genres. Spotify users that regularly listen to playlists like Discover Weekly and Release Radar are generally likely to be “active” listeners, who actively search for new music. These listeners, while fewer in number, are much more likely to turn into loyal fans.  2. Spotify Editorial Playlists Spotify has a Shows & Editorial Team which curates the Spotify Editorial playlists for them. This team has music experts and genre specialists from around the world, specially hired by Spotify to curate playlists.  These playlists typically have large followings and a lot of indie artists have these playlists to thank for suddenly skyrocketing their discovery. Many of these playlists are genre-specific – think “RapCaviar”, “Hot Country”, or “Rock This”. Others are more context-driven, such as “Songs to Sing in the Shower”, “Teen Party”, or “Relax & Unwind”. The Editorial Team of Spotify will often test out new tracks on smaller “feeder” playlists. For example, tracks that perform well on a playlist like “New Noise” (289K followers) might be promoted to “Rock This” (4.3M followers); songs that gain traction on a playlist such as “Most Necessary” (1.8M followers) might eventually end up on “Rap Caviar” (10.3M followers).  How This Playlist Type Can Help Grow Your Audience on Spotify Spotify Editorial Playlists enjoy the undeniable advantage, as far as number of followers is concerned. Most musicians are justifiably keen on getting a spot on these playlists, and for good reason a placement on a major playlist like ""Your Favorite Coffeehouse"" or ""Peaceful Piano"" can translate into countless new audiences and streams. However, a big chunk of these streams can be ""drive-by"" streams. These listeners can often be more passive about their music listening habits; they’re less likely to turn into active, long-term fans. Note that Spotify for Artists allows you to submit your upcoming releases to Spotify’s editorial team, about 1-2 weeks before your release date. Make sure to do so!  3. Listener Playlists User-generated playlists or listener playlists are those that are made and maintained by Spotify users themselves. These users can decide whether to make their playlists ""secret"" or ""public"". While many Spotify users curate playlists for their own enjoyment, numerous organizations, companies, celebrities etc. curate their own playlists, typically as an approach to expand their brand. Let’s take a few examples. * Stream Catcher, on SubmitHub, you can pay bloggers, playlisters, radio programmers, Soundclouders and YouTubers to listen to your song for possible inclusion on their (hopefully) high-trafficked site/playlist/channel.   How This Playlist Type Can Help Grow Your Audience on Spotify User-generated playlists can at times draw in huge numbers of followers and can produce a significant number of listeners and streams for an emerging artist. They also have the potential to influence Spotify’s algorithmic playlists whenever a user adds your track to their playlist, it provides data to Spotify about the type of music they like. With enough data, Spotify can then recommend that track to other users who have similar listening habits, resulting in long-term audience growth. Getting on playlists is surely a great step that can help you get discovered, especially as a new artist.

oego7a,1625520164.0,Guitar,anx778,[QUESTION] Is it possible to effectively promote your music without performing live?,"Im a solo guitarist, making instrumental metal/rock tracks. I love making music and although I know my weakspots, I really think I am decent in my songwriting and technical skills. Ive been doing it for almost a decade now. Despite my efforts I still have low views on most of my songs. One song has 1300 views on spotify, other one has around 2500 on newgrounds. I managed to get those songs to playlists through submithub and I also got noticed through forum competition which happens once a year. Most of my songs on other platforms get stuck on 5-20 listens which is mainly what I dont like. I dont have much luck with instagram either. I wish the views would constantly increase if at least by 3 plays every week. 

I do know that the most effective way to promote yourself is through perfoming, which ofc is nearly impossible for a solo guitarist, especially where I live. And I dont enjoy pefrorming in general. 

Do you have any advice for someone like me? How can I promote my music, without just spamming links to every social media corner?

And also I am writing from my anonymus account, so that this post does not count as promotion.

nk55k9,1621882083.0,musicmarketing,splitshifts,Music Marketing Starts During Production Phase!,"Hey guys, just wanted to share some tips that I have applied and so far has worked for me whenever I release music. Note: This post doesn’t guarantee a blast of millions of streams for your music release but with consistency you can see the numbers improve over time - some times even years! But let’s be positive and hear me out what you can start off with:

Production Phase:

- Planning the vibe and topic of your song is key. It’ll lead you down to streamlined content creation. It could be about your sexuality, your hardknock life etc.
- Once you got the concept of the song, try thinking of ways to sonically story tell your tracks. You may want to use samples of familiar sounds or others that represent your story. Example, you could use sound bites from your microwave if you’re writing about the food you can only eat out of poverty. Or maybe you could use a sample of the sound of waves to represent what a utopian state is to you. Depends on what you write about, be creative on the sound selection!
- Document every step you took to compose the music. It could be short form or long form videos. You could even do a mini documentary on how the sounds you created and used meant so much to your work and your song.

Once The Mix &amp; Mastering Is Done:

- Give yourself at least 6 weeks before the release. This gives you ample time to plan and execute your social media marketing plans for your music.

Week 6:

- Check your masters and if they are good to go, start uploading onto your distro platforms like Ditto Music and Distro Kid. This will ensure that your release will be on time for the date that has been scheduled to be on all digital streaming platforms.
- Start writing out your press release for the song. The sooner you get on it, the more in depth and meaningful your press release can be. Try to find an angle to the song i.e. the vibe and concept of the song that is news worthy for bloggers to feature.

Week 5:

- Get your press releases vetted by someone who’s good at copyrighting. Or you can get a friend or someone you know to give a third person perspective. Get their common comments that can help improve the press release.
- Engage a photographer to take photos of you for your press kit and another session to angle for your story or concept of the song. Or you can DIY on your own as we know smartphones nowadays are really handy as the camera specs are really good such as the iPhone.
- Prepare a single release banner design to be consistent on all your social platforms. This is to promote brand awareness in Week 4.

Week 4:

- Prepare a press kit for yourself as an artist. Be sure to include photos, bio and your social links within so that bloggers and media are one click away from getting to know you better.
- Get your pre-save links ready from your distro sites to promote a pre save campaign for your song. Be sure to think of a valuable asset to offer your potential listeners in exchange for a presaved link. Be creative! Could be free merch or even sample packs depending on the demand of your audience!
- Update all of your banner on social media to include the release date of your single and the pre-save link.
- Research on relevant blogs that you might think may feature your song. Try searching for blogs that support artists that you sound like or look up to.

Week 3:
- Start posting your short form and long form videos on your socials - video content is key and showing your process and how it influences your single drives credibility and genuinity to your artist self.
- Spread out the video content to weeks 2 &amp; 1 leading up to the release.
- On your socials, this is the best chance to engage with your followers and boost the algorithm to generate more views.
- Set up a brand awareness post on your new single via facebook or instagram ads and drive traffic to your presave links.

Week 2:

- Send out your press release to blogs and spotify playlisters together with your presskit. Be sure to keep the subject header to the angle of your press and stating your new release information - title and release date.
- Send out the song SubmitHub curators. This is where you spend a good 50 bucks for chance to be on good blogs and playlists too.
- Don’t forget your short form and long form videos with the presave link promoted in the post description.

Week 1:

- Do a countdown post to your song.
- Give a pre-thank you post for those who presaved your song.
- Do not stop sending your press releases and continue researching for more medias to submit to. Blog and media promotion usually occur after release day.
- Do a summary video of your long and short form video to reinforce your song’s concept to interested and potential listeners. Listeners like to experience your journey as an artist putting out that special single.

Week 0 and weeks after release:

- Release day!!!!
- Share out interviews and media features.
- Share out seeded playlists.
- Share behind the scenes video.
- Share music video or music visualizer videos.
- Any other content that promotes the growth of your single since release day.

document every step you took to compose the music. it could be short form or long form videos. you could even do a mini documentary on how the sounds you created and used meant so much to your work and your song. once the mix & mastering is done  give yourself at least 6 weeks before the release. this gives you ample time to plan and execute your social media marketing plans for your music. week 6  check your masters and if they are good to go, start uploading onto your distro platforms like ditto music and distro kid. this will ensure that your release will be on time for the date that has been scheduled to be on all digital streaming platforms. start writing out your press release for the song. the sooner you get on it, the more in depth and meaningful your press release can be. try to find an angle to the song i.e. the vibe and concept of the song that is news worthy for bloggers to feature. week 5  get your press releases vetted by someone who’s good at copyrighting. or you can get a friend or someone you know to give a third person perspective. get their common comments that can help improve the press release. engage a photographer to take photos of you for your press kit and another session to angle for your story or concept of the song. or you can diy on your own as we know smartphones nowadays are really handy as the camera specs are really good such as the iphone. prepare a single release banner design to be consistent on all your social platforms. this is to promote brand awareness in week 4. week 4  prepare a press kit for yourself as an artist. be sure to include photos, bio and your social links within so that bloggers and media are one click away from getting to know you better. get your pre-save links ready from your distro sites to promote a pre save campaign for your song. be sure to think of a valuable asset to offer your potential listeners in exchange for a presaved link. be creative! could be free merch or even sample packs depending on the demand of your audience! update all of your banner on social media to include the release date of your single and the pre-save link. research on relevant blogs that you might think may feature your song. try searching for blogs that support artists that you sound like or look up to. week 3 start posting your short form and long form videos on your socials - video content is key and showing your process and how it influences your single drives credibility and genuinity to your artist self. spread out the video content to weeks 2 & 1 leading up to the release. on your socials, this is the best chance to engage with your followers and boost the algorithm to generate more views. set up a brand awareness post on your new single via facebook or instagram ads and drive traffic to your presave links. week 2  send out your press release to blogs and spotify playlisters together with your presskit. be sure to keep the subject header to the angle of your press and stating your new release information - title and release date. send out the song submithub curators. this is where you spend a good 50 bucks for chance to be on good blogs and playlists too. don’t forget your short form and long form videos with the presave link promoted in the post description. week 1  do a countdown post to your song. give a pre-thank you post for those who presaved your song. do not stop sending your press releases and continue researching for more medias to submit to. blog and media promotion usually occur after release day. do a summary video of your long and short form video to reinforce your song’s concept to interested and potential listeners. listeners like to experience your journey as an artist putting out that special single. week 0 and weeks after release  release day!!!! share out interviews and media features. share out seeded playlists. share behind the scenes video. share music video or music visualizer videos. any other content that promotes the growth of your single since release day. feel free to add more marketing techniques in the comments too guys! but as a start hope this helps! cheers and good luck!",6,935
niri4e,1621715786.0,musicmarketing,abdallahharati,"My workflow to release albums, songs and EPs","Hey all!

I've been releasing several singles and EP in the last 11 months. In total 12 singles and one EP. I've written down my own workflow for the releases and thought it would good to share with all of you. This far to be perfect, but at least a start and happy to hear thoughts, comments, suggestions so we can all learn.

Prior to the release:

1. prior to the release, count down posts in Instagram (I'm trying to focus my social media in Instagram)
2. Spotify editorial playlist pitch

Release Day:

1. add song to all my artists playlists (I maintain a playlist with all my songs and another one with several other alike artists)
2. link creation via Odesli
3. update my own micro site with the link (equivalent to Linktree, but I do it on my own website with the WordPress plugin Social Links)
4. update on my website, launching the music, with few lines about the single/EP and Odesli link
5. update on the quick link on my website, so links for the song are always visible
6. MailChimp email campaign to all my contacts
7. Instragram: Story, Reels and Post with the release. Sometimes I do use 3 or 9 images's grid
8. Facebook goes in sync with Instagram. Once I post there, I will share on my personal profile and share in few music groups I'm part of.
9. WhatsApp Stories and posts to few music related groups.
10. Snapshat story update (I do it because it is easy, but I don't have traction there)
11. TikTok quick video. Same as Snapshat, I don't have too many people there.
12. Twitter post
13. As I publish songs with Amuse, I always pitch to their staff picks playlist.
14. I have a list of blogs for pitching, but very limited traction and results so far.
15. SubmitHub - I always put the song there, particularly for the Hot / Not. I network a lot via this Hot/Not tool, which I get more results than the normal/premium submissions.

After the release day: I'm still building my workflow... lots of studies on going.

Other points I am missing: video production for the releases, benefit more from YouTube for the release day,

Adding my results so far my results so far:

\- my audience in Spotify has been around 4k listeners per month.

\- I'm reaching around \~220 streams per day (in all these process I've managed to get one song in Spotify Editorial Playlist, but I have no idea what special I have done to be there)

\- currently 168 followers in Spotify

\- In Apple Music I've reaching in total 1900 plays, few purchases and few Shazams

\- Deezer not significant. Amazon Music very little. YT Music a bit. Tidal I have no idea.

I forgot to say that I'm playing with Facebook/Instagram adds, but cannot share conclusions yet.

The downside is that scammers make good use of this by setting up fake labels and charging artists to release on it.

This might sounds stupid, but it's easy to fall for when you start out and have no idea of how labels work. Especially when these fake labels have been able to trap people that later have become big in the scene, or when they are just impersonating famous producers.

Two golden rules:

1. NEVER pay a label
2. NEVER pay a playlister (unless it's something like submithub; they charge around €1 so people don't spam the curators on their website)

I spent $100 in submission fees. For my genre of (funk, lofi, study, jazz guitar beats) and I’ve pretty much submitted to everyone in those categories.

Regardless of how strong the song actually is, i think I’ve gone above and beyond the average SubmitHub submission rate and the amount of playlists that have accepted me. 

My first single I released 5 months ago, also with this method has a little over 3,000 streams, which is great. But if this is the best model I can do...I think this system is pretty much tapped and over.

n34vjc,1619956345.0,musicmarketing,hazechatos,Playlists: the best way to reach new fans?,"Hi guys,

I’m currently preparing my next release. I put lot of efforts in this single, but also some money on the artwork and mastering (paying for these two was totally new to me). So I’ve focused on making quality this time.

My current fanbase is very small, and I was thinking of targeting playlists on Spotify, to reach more people and maybe fans.

For the moment, I’ve only heard about Spotify pitch tool, directly emailing a curator (pretty time consuming?), or using platforms like Submithub or Groover (legit?).

But if I get this straight, I have to know exactly what genre and what potential category of audience my song has. Which is sometimes difficult at the beginning of a career.

What is your experience with these? Did it pay off? Are playlists the best way to reach new fans?

For instance, if you have the time, which kind of genre/playlist type could I reach with my song, and how?

It's just that I feel that when I release music there ARE people who WOULD enjoy it - but I'm such a loner and such a homebody I have no idea where they are.

and I get it. Upload to Spotify and see what happens.

But Spotify is just an algorithm. 

If I have a song that's good.... there are so many questions in between the finish and how to get it out. Like for example - maybe Indian people  would love my music. But I don't know how I would ever figure that out without hoping and praying it MAGICALLY ends up in someone's feed.

For an example, I had a song get 500 plays in a few weeks on Youtube because Siri was glitching out and recommending some people my song on Youtube when they asked for directions to a local cafe in Kansas. So I had all these comments, ""Siri sent me to your song but I don't regret it!""

I don't feel comfortable hoping and praying for something like that. But it showed that people did like the song if they heard it. But it took an algorithm glitch to get there....

Then there's sites like SubmitHub. I'm not well versed on the blogisphere. I have NO idea WHO to submit to. So I get a ""This is really good. Don't have a fit for it right now. Send me other stuff though!"" on SubmitHub. Ok. Idk what you want nor am I going to make music tailored to your taste.

Is there any helpful service I can kick down some cash to that would at least help get these Spotify links to people who would actually appreciate it? 

P.S. I heard about TAXI, but that looks like people trying to signed to labels. I'm not really into that sort of thing.

m99tg8,1616255813.0,musicmarketing,Clyderouge,Save some time and money on Submithub,"Hey,

I wanted to put this post up to help some people do exactly what the title says. I see Submithub getting a lot of stick in this thread so I wanted to share my experience from this week.

I make House music. Some might say it's Funky House, some might say it's Deep House, some Tech House and some may call it something completely different. And therein lies the problem. For my latest House music release I went on to Submithub to try and find some playlists to submit to. After scrolling though what seemed like around 100 curators with playlists that support 'House' I settled in the end on 5. After actually listening to the playlists the curators have I soon found that my idea of House and their idea of House is often, very far apart. This is not to say I'm right and they are wrong or vice versa, this is simply to point out that genre matching on Submithub and then submitting to everyone who supports your genre is a sure fire way to get disappointed and throw away your money. After listening to dozens upon dozens of 'House' playlists I've found only 5 that I think MIGHT like my track. So far 3 have accepted and I'm still waiting to hear back from 2. 

Sure, lots of the irrelevant playlist have maybe 100k+ followers and I would LOVE to tap into that fanbase but quite simply, they're not likely to want my music. For my last 3 releases I have taken the time to listen to every playlist (skipping through an absolute minimum of 3 tracks per playlist) before submitting and I now have a success rate of about 70-80%. My music is by no means mind blowing or earth shatteringly amazing, I just take more time to carefully select my submissions. It takes a little longer but the time I spend is well invested and I spend way less on campaigns because I don't waste many submissions. This might seem like a lot more effort. It is. But it's also worth doing if you're like me and don't like to throw money away.

So, I'm just saying that the tactic of genre matching alone is really only a starting point for submissions and probably not a green light to send your track to 100 curators that Submithub say have playlists for your style. 

Anyway, have a great weekend!

lt1cv5,1614357078.0,musicmarketing,dudelikeshismusic,Sometimes it's easier to think about what NOT to do.,"Every day I see musicians say something that amounts to ""I'm doing all of the right things, why am I not famous and rich?"" Sometimes we like to think of music marketing as some sort of step-by-step process that will somehow guarantee success and acclaim. I realized that this absolutely does not work for guaranteeing success, but you can sort of do the opposite and guarantee how *not* to achieve success with your music.

I am not a famous or rich musician. But, as a fan and someone involved in the scene, I have seen some things that successful musicians simply do not do. Here's my list, and I'm interested to see what other people have found as well:

1. **Release music less than once per year.** Long gaps between releases will pretty much always cause your fans to lose interest.

2. **Be impossible to find or contact.** Your stuff has to be available within a Google search. If you're not on popular platforms like Spotify, then you better have a good reason. You need to make it easy to find your stuff.

3. **Be inactive on social media.** You need *something* out there. No, you don't have to post selfies every day, but you can't be a ghost either.

4. **Be an egotistical dick.**

5. **Spend minimal time coming up with ideas.** You are far better off curating your ideas. People think that John and Paul just pumped out Beatles material and never threw anything away. They probably amassed 5x the ideas than what actually made it onto the albums. It takes a lot of brainstorming before you have a golden idea.

6. **Fake it.** Fans see right through it when ""artists"" are really just trying to make a cash grab. You have to be genuinely passionate about your art. Yes, all of those ""corporate sell-out"" popstars are passionate, stop lying to yourself. You can't fake being a Taylor Swift or Bruno Mars.

7. **Spend no time on presentation.** Since the 60's people have decided which music to buy based on the album art. Similarly, no one is going to take you seriously if your Spotify page is lacking basic elements, like a banner picture at the top or a bio. It just makes it look like you don't care enough (because you probably don't).

8. **Wait until your songs are perfect before you release them.** You will never release anything. Deadlines are essential (for me anyways).

9. **Rely solely on tools like Submithub and Spotify-curated playlists to promote you.** These tools tend to work best if you are already generating buzz for yourself. A lot of musicians think that their music is so good that they can send it to blog and playlist curators and have these folks bow down to the awesomeness of their music. Good luck. These people tend to care more when they see that people are already talking about your music.

10. **Only promote your music.** No one likes the artist who leaves early at the show. You have to be a fan of other people's stuff too. Be part of the scene. People are far more likely to support you if you are generous with compliments and interested in other artists.",39,0.95,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicmarketing/comments/lt1cv5/sometimes_its_easier_to_think_about_what_not_to_do/,Sometimes it's easier to think about what NOT to do.,sometimes it's easier to think about what not to do.,"Every day I see musicians say something that amounts to ""I'm doing all of the right things, why am I not famous and rich?""

It takes a lot of brainstorming before you have a golden idea. 6. **Fake it.** Fans see right through it when ""artists"" are really just trying to make a cash grab. You have to be genuinely passionate about your art. Yes, all of those ""corporate sell-out"" popstars are passionate, stop lying to yourself. You can't fake being a Taylor Swift or Bruno Mars. 7. **Spend no time on presentation.** Since the 60's people have decided which music to buy based on the album art. Similarly, no one is going to take you seriously if your Spotify page is lacking basic elements, like a banner picture at the top or a bio. It just makes it look like you don't care enough (because you probably don't). 8. **Wait until your songs are perfect before you release them.** You will never release anything. Deadlines are essential (for me anyways). 9. **Rely solely on tools like Submithub and Spotify-curated playlists to promote you.** These tools tend to work best if you are already generating buzz for yourself. A lot of musicians think that their music is so good that they can send it to blog and playlist curators and have these folks bow down to the awesomeness of their music. Good luck. These people tend to care more when they see that people are already talking about your music. 10. **Only promote your music.** No one likes the artist who leaves early at the show. You have to be a fan of other people's stuff too. Be part of the scene. People are far more likely to support you if you are generous with compliments and interested in other artists.","every day i see musicians say something that amounts to ""i'm doing all of the right things, why am i not famous and rich?"" sometimes we like to think of music marketing as some sort of step-by-step process that will somehow guarantee success and acclaim. i realized that this absolutely does not work for guaranteeing success, but you can sort of do the opposite and guarantee how *not* to achieve success with your music. i am not a famous or rich musician. but, as a fan and someone involved in the scene, i have seen some things that successful musicians simply do not do. here's my list, and i'm interested to see what other people have found as well 1. **release music less than once per year.** long gaps between releases will pretty much always cause your fans to lose interest. 2. **be impossible to find or contact.** your stuff has to be available within a google search. if you're not on popular platforms like spotify, then you better have a good reason. you need to make it easy to find your stuff. 3. **be inactive on social media.** you need *something* out there. no, you don't have to post selfies every day, but you can't be a ghost either. 4. **be an egotistical dick.** 5. **spend minimal time coming up with ideas.** you are far better off curating your ideas. people think that john and paul just pumped out beatles material and never threw anything away. they probably amassed 5x the ideas than what actually made it onto the albums. it takes a lot of brainstorming before you have a golden idea. 6. **fake it.** fans see right through it when ""artists"" are really just trying to make a cash grab. you have to be genuinely passionate about your art. yes, all of those ""corporate sell-out"" popstars are passionate, stop lying to yourself. you can't fake being a taylor swift or bruno mars. 7. **spend no time on presentation.** since the 60's people have decided which music to buy based on the album art. similarly, no one is going to take you seriously if your spotify page is lacking basic elements, like a banner picture at the top or a bio. it just makes it look like you don't care enough (because you probably don't). 8. **wait until your songs are perfect before you release them.** you will never release anything. deadlines are essential (for me anyways). 9. **rely solely on tools like submithub and spotify-curated playlists to promote you.** these tools tend to work best if you are already generating buzz for yourself. a lot of musicians think that their music is so good that they can send it to blog and playlist curators and have these folks bow down to the awesomeness of their music. good luck. these people tend to care more when they see that people are already talking about your music. 10. **only promote your music.** no one likes the artist who leaves early at the show. you have to be a fan of other people's stuff too. be part of the scene. people are far more likely to support you if you are generous with compliments and interested in other artists.",10,538

lr6mfu,1614151384.0,musicmarketing,abyssvoid1,"The devil's advocate to Blogs, Submithub, Spotify playlists curators and more","I haven’t been paid by anyone to write this.

Social media ads, blogs, playlists, Submithub and similar services are just tools.

They’re not evil or perfection incarnate on their own. If your song is really good, they’ll likely do wonders, even with a semi-decent, simply-planned marketing strategy. 

I’ll refer to these tools as “multipliers”— If your song is good, i.e. captivates 4 people out of 10 who listen to it, multiplying that number to the Social media/blogs reach could make it a great success. If that number is 0 out of 10, multiplying that zero will do nothing.  
 

All this fury I see against one of these multipliers like Submithub is incredibly dumb. First, a tool is useful only if you know how it works. Second, a tool has to be used in the correct way. 

Yes, of course there’s playlists and websites that promise too much and have obviously fake followers, plays and so on. But I doubt this happens to most tools that gets talked about here, because it’s fairly easy to notice payola or fake streams nowadays. Organic stats go a long way.

It’s stupid to say some blogs or some services are scams that get rich with your money. They are the little guys, in reality. Cheering for Spotify or for ads from FB and IG only increases the monopoly FB or Spotify has, and this only bites the musician in the ass in the long term (even more than usual).  
 

It is not the marketer/small musician’s responsibility to take the big guys down, of course, but it is your responsibility to research the tools that are available, use them correctly, and stop being a whiny bitch if they don’t work or saying anything that comes down to “they took money from me and did not get me the fame I wanted”.

""excellent work""?

he said i clearly didn't understand the music industry, saying ""no company in the world would give in to these demands"". in regards to the question about advances, he said 

&gt;Why would a label pay you for PRODUCING the music and then pay you again for SELLING the content? And after 1 year you'd just leave, because contracts are 'too long' for you? And the label would sit on the PRODUCTION costs and you would release such conten, paid by the label, somewhere elese? Yeah, no, this is not how it works...at all.

i really have to impress how these questions weren't ""demands"" in the slightest, and i never said anything about re-releasing the music somewhere else, he was just barraging me with imaginary arguments and rhetorical questions i'd never asked. when i emailed him back explaining my questions and asking why he was being so hostile, i got this; 

&gt;2 things:  
&gt;  
&gt;1) the contract explicitely states: NON-EXCLUSIVE ARTIST AGREEMENT. Definitely an advantage, if you can read and understand the most simple wording.  
&gt;  
&gt;2) neither was I „hostile“ nor rude in any way - maybe read again what I sent you in my last email when you calmed a bit down...in a day or 2. maybe you'll understand it with a less hurt ego then.

he called my ability to read into question because i wasn't clear on the legally binding contract he'd just asked me to sign, then told me to get my ego in check when i asked him why he was being so hostile. the biggest break i've ever gotten in the 10 years i've been making music and i have to turn it down because their ""A&amp;R manager"" is an absolute fucking bellend.

Definitely an advantage, if you can read and understand the most simple wording.   >   >2) neither was I „hostile“ nor rude in any way - maybe read again what I sent you in my last email when you calmed a bit down...in a day or 2. maybe you'll understand it with a less hurt ego then. he called my ability to read into question because i wasn't clear on the legally binding contract he'd just asked me to sign, then told me to get my ego in check when i asked him why he was being so hostile. the biggest break i've ever gotten in the 10 years i've been making music and i have to turn it down because their ""A&R manager"" is an absolute fucking bellend.  cheers for reading.","so submithub is exactly what it sounds like; it's a hub where you can submit demos. you choose from a long list of youtubers, spotify playlist curators, ""influencers"" and record labels and send them links to your music. admittedly, the record labels are hardly hot shit. you're not gonna get a contract with def jam or warp through submithub, but you can find some labels with pretty tasty streaming numbers who actually know what they're doing beyond uploading your tracks to their bandcamp page and leaving it there. it's a start, basically. the music industry is too saturated with talented independent artists for you to get by on talent alone, you need some business savvy and i have absolutely none. i've got a few hip hop production credits, some rappers are working on my beats and i was actually featured in a whitelight video on watch dogs 2, he even shouted my page out. he got the name wrong, but still. felt good.  i'm about a third of the way through my master's studies and felt it was time to start thinking about the future. i knew that i wanted to get into videogame audio and had to talk to my lecturers and careers advisors about how to proceed, but i decided to give submithub a go for something fun on the side. after a few months of success from labels you don't really want success from and rejections from labels you do, i finally got the message.  ""excellent work. i think your material would work well on a downtempo label we manage. give all your details to us and we'll send you a contract."" ""excellent work""? ""contract""? i couldn't believe what i was reading. indie labels at this level don't hand out contracts, they just chuck your shit onto a spotify playlist with 50 regular listeners and take the 20p's worth of streaming revenue you've earned. i check all their pages and they seem legitimate. 13k soundcloud followers, some artists with a few hundred thousand streams on their biggest tracks, i'd finally hit the jackpot and i couldn't have been more excited. they send me the contract and i get this looming sense of ""hold up, i should get someone to read this cause i don't wanna sign some shit and get fucked over here"". i'm reading things like ""3 years"" and ""we own the rights to"" and such and i get a bit worried. i send a reply in earnest asking about how their payment is handled. i admit that my audience isn't the largest, and if they only pay a share of your streams and they don't put any effort into marketing then i'll be stuck in a hole for 3 years without the opportunity to do anything else with the music. i'd also heard of bigger labels paying advances to artists to fund music production, so i ask about that too, but i didn't *ask* for that. no demands, no negotiation, just asking for clarification before i signed a binding contract without knowing all the details. what i got back in reply was one of the most toxic, degrading and unprofessional emails i'd ever received in my life.  he said i clearly didn't understand the music industry, saying ""no company in the world would give in to these demands"". in regards to the question about advances, he said  >why would a label pay you for producing the music and then pay you again for selling the content? and after 1 year you'd just leave, because contracts are 'too long' for you? and the label would sit on the production costs and you would release such conten, paid by the label, somewhere elese? yeah, no, this is not how it works...at all. i really have to impress how these questions weren't ""demands"" in the slightest, and i never said anything about re-releasing the music somewhere else, he was just barraging me with imaginary arguments and rhetorical questions i'd never asked. when i emailed him back explaining my questions and asking why he was being so hostile, i got this;  >2 things   >   >1) the contract explicitely states non-exclusive artist agreement. definitely an advantage, if you can read and understand the most simple wording.   >   >2) neither was i „hostile“ nor rude in any way - maybe read again what i sent you in my last email when you calmed a bit down...in a day or 2. maybe you'll understand it with a less hurt ego then. he called my ability to read into question because i wasn't clear on the legally binding contract he'd just asked me to sign, then told me to get my ego in check when i asked him why he was being so hostile. the biggest break i've ever gotten in the 10 years i've been making music and i have to turn it down because their ""a&r manager"" is an absolute fucking bellend.  cheers for reading.",28,824

But key takeaways:
there are various submission platforms that put you in touch with curators

they all have different levels of acceptance rates

the playlists vary in quality but some will refer lots of streams to your artist page 

playlists are sometimes run by labels and this can help you gain contacts

submithub has a Hot or Not feature which is very good when you want to establish what genre your music fits best and get objective opinion on your work

get ready for lots of rejections

A few things I’ve learned whilst promoting my latest single, firstly.. promoting doesn’t come free! Pitching sites charge, and there’s also a lot of scammers! but if you think you’ve got a solid track on your hands then check out submit hub! It costs but it’s worth it…

Secondly, be consistent, don’t give up after the first week! Most people give up and move onto the next thing… believe me, I started back in 2006. I’m still here… maybe I’m just terrible! I don’t know? That’s for you guys to judge!

Thirdly, help each other, follow artists on Spotify, add their tracks to playlists, playlists really help with reach!! 

Finally, accept criticism! Don’t let it crush you, learn from it, smile and carry on! Just because a few people don’t like your track, it doesn’t mean everyone thinks the same!

livkt1,1613200008.0,CommunityBlog,totenhorse,Best Music Marketing Agency 2021," Making great music is merely the primary step to successful music promotion. Some people say that the work is all that matters and the music should sell itself. Promoting music is an excellent way to grow your audience and get listeners interested in your sound, but how do you know if you're getting a decent deal on music promotion services? 

**Music Promotion Tools:** 

Advertising is one of the oldest ways to promote music and this method still proves to be effective. Here are a few tools [In A Flashhh Marketing, LLC](https://www.inaflashhhmarketingllc.com/) recommends to its clients.  

* Instagram &amp; Facebook Ads 
* Spotify Ads 
* Show.co 
* Radio Airplay 
* Soundplate 
* SubmitHub  

**Music promotion companies**   

Promotion may seem so simple, but most artists don’t have this part of the process thought out and need help finding the right solutions for marketing their singles and albums. If you don’t have a target, you’re probably wasting money. If you only want to “make it” or “get your music out there,” how the heck will you recognize if you’ve done it? Music promo is most helpful when you’re working for something specific – blog coverage, a particular number of Spotify streams, email list signups for fans. You get it. Some companies even offer [free music promotion!](https://www.inaflashhhmarketingllc.com/store/Free-Spotify-Song-Placement-p273656461) Music promotion companies are worthwhile. It’s the difference between reaching people and sending a song into the void. In the end, you’ve put into the music, you owe it to yourself to make it count.

I've been working on music for the past couple years, and we're at the point now where the stuff we put out is really high quality and the people who hear it are really enjoying it. Trouble is getting those first 100 fans. My instagram is dead as all hell and I've never been super good with social media, so I'm in need of some simple, reliable strategies to garner a small fanbase to get us started.

First of all, from my previous (limited) experience in music marketing, my understanding is that, especially when it comes to hip-hop (which is what we're making), instagram is a good place to funnel fans and listeners. Is this a good starting point? If so, what are some ways I can get more followers going on my insta? I have some money to put into this if I need to and I have a couple of people who might be willing to invest as long as it isn't too expensive. 

I also could use some advice on the wild world of playlist placements. I've been using Submithub to submit to playlist and labels. Is this a valid strategy or should I re-access?

I've also been considering the possibility of hiring a public relations consultant/expert or social media manager. Does anybody have experience with this sort of thing, and in your view was it worth?

I just discovered this community and was looking to share my own experience and get some fresh marketing tips. 

So far, my brother and I started pumping out some acoustic piano tracks on Spotify, and have probably sunk about $30 in SubmitHub credits.

Two months in, we have 8 tracks and about 7k total streams.  Using SubmitHub, we made it onto a couple big playlists (~5k followers) and these playlists make up about 80% of our total 7k streams.  Our plan was to try and use this playlist activity to springboard the Spotify algorithm recommending our songs. 

I guess the big stroke of luck would be landing on the official Spotify playlists - that would be sweet.

So besides spending a bit on SubmitHub and developing our social media presence, do you guys have any further recommendations? Any good playlist curator sites / promotion services?

Hi everybody,
So I’ve been using SubmitHub for the past year or two, with some moderate success. Got lucky that one song had a bit of traffic and more than earned back the investment, so I’m pretty happy with that. However, as anyone who has used the site knows, it’s not exactly straight forward. Not only are there a bunch of bs bloggers/influencers/channels, but most of the time you just get rejections even if you fill out everything properly and match up criteria as well as possible. No biggie, it is what it is.

But I feel like it’s worth it to at least invest a good bit of time and money into continually promoting my work, and I’ve decided on a $150 monthly promo budget for a year, just to see where that might take me. I’ll continue using SubmitHub, but am also looking for other means, and wondering if there’s anything else out there that anyone could recommend and give their 2 cents on why. I do the other usual stuff like reach out to the people who have supported me in the past, use IG (albeit very sparingly cause that place drives me nuts), or just make sure and connect with the listeners as far as possible.

So here I am, willing to spend a bit of cash and put in the time and consistency, but unsure how exactly to go about it. I’m just a one-man gig and tend to spend all my time at the computer anyway. Just as you all, this is my deepest passion and I want so badly to broaden my reach. I’m sick and tired of pouring in thousands of hours with so little happening in return. It’s soul-draining. You know what I’m talking about.

Does anyone have any tips? Anything at all? I’m ready to listen and give it a hard push.

You might think that if your numbers were 10 times or 100 times larger that life would be much better, but in reality it would be exactly the same. We got 100k plays and 1000 followers this year but our struggle hasn't changed at all.","The route to success in music is strange. You need to be really humble and honest with yourself. You may spend some time or a lot of time sending your music to your friends, to randos, posting it on the internet. Maybe you even spend money on submithub or something like that. You hope and pray and hustle and grind for attention... But.

How good is your music really? Like really really? The intentions might be amazing, but are the lyrics really 5 star? They are? Is the delivery of them 5 star? Did you get an amazing recording? Was it mixed really well? Was it mastered really well? What about the beat? Was the beat amazing even before you hopped on? Did you do it justice?

I don't think any of the songs we released this year were 5 star. I don't think any of the songs we didn't release or even are currently working on are true 5 star songs. They are good songs, maybe 1 or 2 are almost great. Maybe they even deserved plays, maybe some even deserved a save or two. But largely our plays and attention are the result of our grind, not because the music 'took off on its own.'

Remember this is an art. Remember these are skills. Remember how much room you have to grow. Realize that even at 10k Instagram followers or with 40k youtube views on your music video that you're not suddenly 'on your way' or 'about to blow up.'

You need a song that is truly 5 stars before your work will really stand out in a Spotify editorial pitch, before a ridiculously high % percentage of friends and random people who hear your song will be inspired to like, save or share it (how you blow up organically).

When you see someone with moderate success like us, you're just looking at someone who is grinding just like you. When you see someone with millions of plays, or someone who landed on a Spotify Editorial, take a listen. I almost guarantee what you're going to hear is at least 1 if not 2 degrees better than what you make. They earned that result by developing, refining and polishing their skills. Maybe they spent a lot of time hustling for attention too or maybe just a little.

Also lowkey-  what do you think its like when you have a song that has a couple million plays? From our friends who have achieved this they've told us - ""It's amazing for a couple weeks. Then I release another song that I think is as good or better and I hear crickets. I'm haunted by that 1 successful song that blew up a little bit.... wondering, how can I beat it?""

Guess what he or she has to do next? Develop their talent, polish their skills... Make better music... The same thing you need to do right now.

Keep your day job and never stop challenging yourself. The music making life you're living right now will be same at 50 plays and at 50 million.

Keep grinding y'all.","the route to success in music is strange. you need to be really humble and honest with yourself. you may spend some time or a lot of time sending your music to your friends, to randos, posting it on the internet. maybe you even spend money on submithub or something like that. you hope and pray and hustle and grind for attention... but. how good is your music really? like really really? the intentions might be amazing, but are the lyrics really 5 star? they are? is the delivery of them 5 star? did you get an amazing recording? was it mixed really well? was it mastered really well? what about the beat? was the beat amazing even before you hopped on? did you do it justice? i don't think any of the songs we released this year were 5 star. i don't think any of the songs we didn't release or even are currently working on are true 5 star songs. they are good songs, maybe 1 or 2 are almost great. maybe they even deserved plays, maybe some even deserved a save or two. but largely our plays and attention are the result of our grind, not because the music 'took off on its own.' remember this is an art. remember these are skills. remember how much room you have to grow. realize that even at 10k instagram followers or with 40k youtube views on your music video that you're not suddenly 'on your way' or 'about to blow up.' you need a song that is truly 5 stars before your work will really stand out in a spotify editorial pitch, before a ridiculously high % percentage of friends and random people who hear your song will be inspired to like, save or share it (how you blow up organically). when you see someone with moderate success like us, you're just looking at someone who is grinding just like you. when you see someone with millions of plays, or someone who landed on a spotify editorial, take a listen. i almost guarantee what you're going to hear is at least 1 if not 2 degrees better than what you make. they earned that result by developing, refining and polishing their skills. maybe they spent a lot of time hustling for attention too or maybe just a little. also lowkey-  what do you think its like when you have a song that has a couple million plays? from our friends who have achieved this they've told us - ""it's amazing for a couple weeks. then i release another song that i think is as good or better and i hear crickets. i'm haunted by that 1 successful song that blew up a little bit.... wondering, how can i beat it?"" guess what he or she has to do next? develop their talent, polish their skills... make better music... the same thing you need to do right now. keep your day job and never stop challenging yourself. the music making life you're living right now will be same at 50 plays and at 50 million. keep grinding y'all.",58,518

k18kuv,1606365999.0,musicmarketing,thesillymedico,Marketing for a band that doesn't perform live (strategy doubts),"LONG POST ALERT : So, I'm an an Anesthesiology resident from India who is working most of the time in OT, ICU or covid care ICUs. Besides this I am half of a composer-producer duo who makes music in all genres, mostly clubbing together different genres with some Indian flavours. Me being in one place and my partner being in a completely different place, who is a busy hard working sound engineer, we both don't get much to work on the marketing side of the music.

My current strategy : usually I design the concept and program the song with my laptop and midi controller. Get a rough version done and send it out to my partner. We brainstorm on it, make the track better. And I usually find similar artists from #covers on Instagram and collaborate with them for vocals. Once the track is (half) done(with my rough vocal take), I get the cover art done, I have my friend who helps me get the press release writeup done (he is really good at it). I try to get a music video done usually animated or some stock or sometimes hire dancers to get a somewhat decent music video.

I email my music, PR and unlisted video out to some good music magazines, bloggers, mainly Indian and a few outside ones. Do a short campaign on submithub and groover. Then a week near the release date I send my music to BBC radio for a feature request. When everything goes well, I get  radioplay, listicles/feature on good sites, and once, we were lucky enough to be noticed by Spotify curators and got on Indiestan editorial playlist.

Once the song is out, I usually run an ad campaign on Facebook/insta stories, which is either a hit or a miss. We have been lucky in that till now.

Besides doing all this, we have around 3k monthly listeners on Spotify, the maximum streams we had was 14000 for one song which was a rap on covid in 3 Indian languages which got on a few good playlists.

All these things I do in my spare time and my main goal is to get exposure for the fellow musicians I work with, my partner who is trying to make a name in the Indian sound engineering scene and hopefully some exposure and fans for the artists we feature in our songs. Mostly all the expenses are paid from my pocket, with all the covid situation going on, I don't usually 0 balance at the end of the month.

 We don't do stage shows as it's practically impossible for me and my partner to do something like that. I make my music with a laptop, and akai mpk mini and ATH M50s. That's all the gear I own. I am a classically trained Pianist who haven't got to touch my piano thats in my home since the last 6 years as I never got to visit my hometown since then.

Where am I going wrong? What am I supposed to do that I'm not doing yet? It's all fun and I enjoy music as well as medicine very much and I would never give up one for the other. Should I consider the expenses that occur now as investments and hope that it will pay out eventually? Or should I be doing less and just hope a song goes viral? I love going through YouTube videos on marketing, messaging bloggers and stuff like that, try my own hand on the marketing biz. But the 0 balance at the end of the Month really frustrates me.",3,0.72,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicmarketing/comments/k18kuv/marketing_for_a_band_that_doesnt_perform_live/,Marketing for a band that doesn't perform live (strategy doubts),marketing for a band that doesn't perform live (strategy doubts),"LONG POST ALERT  So, I'm an an Anesthesiology resident from India who is working most of the time in OT, ICU or covid care ICUs.

I will release a song in two weeks. It will be the first one of a brand new project, and I have 0 followers. Long story short, no one gives a crap about it. So it would be useless to start posting teasings a month before. Also, most of blogs want to post music that is already available on spotify. This makes sense, because even thought people would be curious about the music after reading an article, they won't remember to listen to it a week later.

jflbwp,1603313236.0,musicindustry,thelunaticinthehall,Been Using A Great Playlist Promo Tool (Playlist Supply),"I've been following this sub for a while, been never really posted before. 

I work in the music biz at one of the world's largest instrument manufacturers, but also have previous experience in the PR and Radio promo side, but I'm also a semi-professional musician who's toured the country and played a few stadiums, I've also played shows to an empty bar and even the sound guy left mid set. I've had a few bands and projects of my own over the years, and through my professional and music career I've met and worked with radio promoters, bloggers and music publicists, some of the biggest names in LA/NY/LDN, but have only ever gotten short lasting results (i.e. a few thousand streams on sound cloud, a few good write ups, a dingy SXSW showcase, or single moment FM airplay.) I spent thousands of dollars on all of these things for very little return, all in hopes that something might ""break.""

When quarantine started, I put out a demo of something I'd been sitting on for a few years, and thought that instead of spending money on all these things that had little effect, I should start doing some research on new playlisting apps since that seems to be where the industry is going for artists, especially with shows off the table for the foreseeable future.

 I tried a few out, like SubmitHub, Playlist Parrot and Daily Playlists, all of which landed me at a wall in about a week before needing to hand over money/or more money. These confine your music to a few checkboxes and I also figured out they aren't really pulling in NEW playlists, they would just serve me the same ones over and over (and I wasn't getting any responses). 

I dug deeper, and then on this sub, I came across an app called PlaylistSupply, gave it a try (it's $20 which is pretty affordable, even in COVID times). But this app gives YOU the ability to dictate search terms, not just genres. So I was able to start getting in touch with curators who vibed with my sound. I didn't have to only live in an ""indie rock"" or ""electro pop"" check box, I could search something like, ""workout jams"" or ""road trip."" Within a week of reaching out to curators, I earned more listeners than all my previous bands in terms of getting active Spotify listeners. I was hesitant that my listenership would drop off completely, but the beauty of this tool is I can keep trying out new search terms, looking up new artists I like, and I can keep finding new playlists to reach out to.  

I think what's most interesting about the app is that it looks so low key (almost like a screen out of the matrix lol) but the results are legit. I've even gone back to look up new search terms and found new contacts within them because someone started a new, relevant playlist. 

I can't recommend it enough, especially since it's so well priced and you *could* turn it off when you don't need it. 

If you don't believe me, check out [this review from a music marketer (Musformation) I follow on YT.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtqQyvVYbuQ)

iizvqn,1598733999.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,couchsleepersband,How to get your first 10k monthly listeners — in response to a post made yesterday,"A user by the handle of u/WeakestBeast made a post yesterday with some helpful tips ey had gathered along their journey to 300k monthly listeners. One of these tips was to build a consistent listenership of about 10-50k people monthly before shopping around to labels — this *is* good advice, by the way, because a label needs to see that *you're gonna make this happen with or without them* before they're going invest a dime. But getting that first 10k monthly listeners can seem like an insurmountable first step, so I wanted to talk a bit about our personal journey.
    
—    

**A BRIEF INTRODUCTION**    

I've done this before. Shortly after our first release, we reached a monthly listenership of 50k at our peak. It's been six months since our most recent release (that first album) and we've settled into a comfortable 10-20k listeners consistently. And we do it all ourselves — recorded in my bedroom, mixed on cheap speakers with stock plug-ins, made our album art with an iPhone camera and some worklamps from Home Depot, cold calling playlisters and venues and blogs. Beyond my personal project, I'm involved in several other music projects, which range from 50-100k monthly listeners *consistently*. **While the fact that I've done this is an important qualification to actually talking about, I think probably more important is that I've been involved in a lot of really good bands that never even broke the 2k barrier, and I can tell you why.**     
    
—   

**A DISCLAIMER ABOUT THE FALSE DRAW OF MONTHLY LISTENERSHIP**    

But there's something we need to address before we get started: **monthly listenership is a red herring** as far as your musical success, however you may define it, is. It *is* measuring something, but it has power mostly because we give it power, and an even less precise measure because of that. **In all likelihood, your interest as a musician is not just getting your music in front of millions of people who will only ever listen once, but specifically to get it in front of the people who will resonate with your music.** The people for whom your songs are meaningful, the people who will become fans. I suspect that for many of us, *that* is the truer measure of success (even if we aren't always good at shaking off the delusions of fame and influence). **Monthly listenership does not measure that**. These are listeners, not fans. There are many, many, many musicians with 200k+ monthly listeners out there that struggle to bring 50 people to a show. The rise of the playlist has as a side effect the tendency to render music as ""wallpaper"", an accompaniment to people's days and not something with which they actively engage.

**Given, we and the people we want to impress (managers, labels, press) attribute quite a lot to monthly listenership.** That's the second failing. Goodhart's Law tells us that once a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a useful measure. Which is to say, when we put so much emphasis on monthly listenership, it ceases to be a good proxy for the quality or actual retentive quality of your music. **You can easily imagine that this number could be misleadingly inflated by fame or popularity without any regard for the quality of the music at all.**

So remember that this isn't the end-all-be-all. **Your goal is to reach as many future fans as you can, NOT just random people** — and that doesn't always look like 500k people right off the bat. I don't doubt that there's an audience of that many people for whatever your genre is, no matter how weird. There are a lot of people, and if you like it, odds are someone else will appreciate it as well. But finding them is a much, much, much more difficult task than reaching that first 10k of passive consumers.

—    

**STARTING FROM NOTHING**

The first question to ask yourself is *what you really want*. Do you want this? I know *I* want it, and I'm going to assume you do too. But it's not going to be easy and it's not going to be fair. If you really want this, you need to turn a critical eye to your own music and excise everything that doesn't work. *Commit* to making the best possible art you can. You might not think of yourself as a songwriter, but you need to understand how a good song works. You might not think of yourself as a producer, but you need to know how to make things sound good. You might not think of yourself as a marketer, but no one else is going to do it for you and you need to get your music in front of people. You might not think of yourself as an influencer, but you're selling experiences and *that's the whole package*. So ask yourself right now, **what are you the worst at? What are you the best at?** Think long and hard about these things, then hit Google and commit right now to getting better at all of it.

**I am not saying this is a prerequisite. This is a continuous process. The biggest obstacle any of us will face is time, so don't wait for everything to be perfect. A musical career is just growing up in the public eye.**

But I know you're all doing that already, or you wouldn't be here reading this.

So you've finished your project and it sounds good. Great writing, tight production, well-mixed, well-mastered. Nice. You've got some slick album art. You're excited and ready to drop this project.

But you're not going to drop this project yet. This is the longest part, it takes patience and it's not nearly as fun as making music. No, you're going to wait. You're going to set a release date for two months, minimum, from now. And then you're going to start planning.

—    

**GAINING AN AUDIENCE ON SOCIAL MEDIA**

First, let's get the social media logistics out of the way. Do you have a mailing list? Are you on at least one of the major social media platforms? I recommend Instagram and TikTok, which are by far the dominant platforms right now. Make a YouTube channel. Make a Bandcamp. Make a Soundcloud. Reddit, if you want. You want people to be able to stream your music even if they aren't on Apple or Spotify. Lock down an email address. Make sure your handle is the same for all of these.

The trick to gathering an audience on these platforms is to create something of value. And that value is important because it's specific and in-line with your artistic identity. **I use our Instagram as a place to keep in touch with our community** — I follow and interact with other artists and collaborators, I post daily snippets from the life of the band to our story, little musical videos, I even post about what books I'm reading. People are on Instagram because they're interested in you and your life, so it's nice to see behind the curtain and into the lives of you and your bandmates. **TikTok, on the other hand, seems to be entirely driven by a content-based algorithm** — this can look like a lot of things: funny little videos, covers of songs you like, dances, vibey lifestyle posts, rating different things, more informational stuff (our most popular by far were about DIY audio engineering). TikTok seems to prefer videos that show your face from the front, by and large, and anything that makes use of its in-app sounds, songs, effects, and features. Just a small tip. Do some duetting and reacting, people like that. What, you're not on TikTok? *Get on TikTok!* It makes me feel old and out-of-touch, too, but you've got to excise that discomfort and get after it. Remember, we're committed. **Facebook is useful for scheduling events, more useful if you have an older audience**. But even then, I'd use a mailing list. **The nice thing about email is it gets you away from algorithm-driven exposure** — now you can contact people you care about directly. **YouTube is a great place to do covers and gather fans from other, extant fanbases.** I know that fans of Pinegrove or Death Cab for Cutie will find something to like from our music, for example, so we've spent a lot of time and effort putting together some good quality covers. **I prefer to use Reddit in this way** — I spent years learning a lot from this community and it's great to be able to contribute, now. And who knows, maybe you'll gain some new listeners that way, too. You're welcome to make yourself a website, but to be honest I don't think it's all that important anymore. 

So you're going to spend your two+ months gathering an audience on *all* these platforms by posting regularly, engaging with others, and creating high-value content. Sneak in some promotional stuff for your music. TikTok seems particularly lawless — just post your song and people will start demanding you release it. This is a game of inches. It takes time. **And don't be afraid to direct your friends and family. Learn how to ask, you're going to need to.** Otherwise no one will ever even know you released it. But every person you gather becomes a potential vector of new exposure.

**ADS**

As a brief aside, if you have the money, ads can be really useful. The trick is to make it less of an ad and more of a normal post on social media. Engagement with videos is much higher. Spend some time making a short little video teaser and release video for your music. Music videos are even better! Try to spend at least $10 a day and use a targeted audience. If you've run ads before, try especially to focus people who have previously engaged with your material. You can have Instagram and Facebook promote you, you can have YouTube screen your videos before other relevant artists. And feel free to get creative with ads in the real world, too. Leave random letters inviting people to your show. Put up flyers! Collaborate with local artists to make cool merchandise and flyers!

—    

**PLAYLISTS, PLAYLISTS, PLAYLISTS (AND BLOGS, AND RADIO)**

**Next, get on SubmitHub**. You're going to find yourself a couple blogs — as many as you can — to talk about your release. To be honest, I don't think too many people actively read blogs anymore, but you might gain a little exposure out of it. More importantly, it gives you another measure of legitimacy. People are talking about your music. You're going to share those articles when they're written, and people will be more inclined to check your music out having seen that other people are writing about it. **More importantly, find a couple playlisters to add your song**. With both of these things, it helps be *specific* about your targeting — do a little research. And it helps to have a little money for premium credits, the rate of acceptance is so much higher. But if you *don't* — and that's completely okay — you can earn them by rating others' music on Hot or Not. And **you should add your music to SubmitHub's Hot or Not** as well. Think of all the other appreciative musicians who are on there listening through Hot or Not. Someone might think your stuff is pretty hot! And then you've got a new fan as well.

But playlists. Someone commented in the other thread, ""Playlists, playlists, playlists."" And if you want to up your monthly listeners and *maybe even gain some fans*, this is the right answer. So ask yourself, who does your music sound like? Note, this is not *who do you listen to*, but who do you *sound* like? I love Frank Ocean and Theo Katzman, both have influenced my songwriting and sound *immensely*, and I sound nothing like those artists. But fans of Pinegrove might find a particular resonance with our music. I'm a new fan of Phoebe Bridgers (*Punisher* is such an amazing sounding album. I love Gruska and Mills and Berg's production, wow) but even before I liked her music I understood that others might find similar qualities. What's the strongest quality of your music? Now go forth on Spotify and find user-made playlists that have a similar vibe. Given them a listen. Now's the creepy part — and this process is long and tedious, too. Look at the user. Do they make playlists under their name? Do they have a profile picture? Great. Spotify pulls those things from Facebook. **Go find their Facebook profile, friend them, and send them a message cold.** Be courteous and respectful, be friendly and genuine. Let them know you've been digging their playlist. You really like X and Y artists, and because of their playlist, you found Z artists and you really dig it. You think your song might be a good fit. Send them a link and say, if you like it, I'd love it if you could add it to your playlist. This feels slimey and weird and it was one of the earliest forms of exposure we got beyond our immediate social circles.

**Don't forget about Spotify's playlist submission.** As long as your submit two weeks prior to release, you'll be put on Release Radar, which will let everyone who's listened to your previously know you've got a new song out. From my own experience, Release Radar can also expose you to new likely fans based on engagement, acting as a little mini Discover Weekly. **Discover Weekly is where you want to end up,** because Spotify will just continue shipping your song around to new fans as long as there's engagement. These things are both driven by engagement and sharing by users immediately following release, so all that work you put in above is going to be really important! And of course you can submit a song from each release for Editorial Playlist consideration, too! As always, targeting is key. Find the right curated playlist for your specific song, tailor your pitch to that playlist's vibe and content.

By the way, I recommend releasing a few singles before the project, and scheduling them to be four weeks apart. This way, Spotify will note the consistent influx of new listeners and the momentum you've built up, so it'll start doing some of the work for you. Plus, it gives *you* momentum to outside observers.

On a sort of related note, reach out to local radio stations! The students who run college stations are eager and have such a passion for music. They are fans just waiting to happen, and you'll find they're often friends waiting to happen as well. It is such a pleasure to sit down and chat with a couple students on the air and it costs you just an hour of your time, an enjoyable one at that. Likewise with podcasters! There are so many podcasts these days and I guarantee you know someone that hosts one. Reach out!

**PERFORMING LIVE**

Back before the beginning of the end of the world, we used to play live. **Live shows remain the number one way you'll convert a listener to a fan**. Try to maximize your exposure by playing venues with good foot traffic — venues with enough of a reputation that they bring their own listener base on a regular basis, potential new fans for you — and by pairing with other bands in the scene. How do you meet other bands? Be friendly and sociable, go out to their shows, listen respectfully, talk to them after, buy them a drink. You'll find your scene. Their fans will become fans of yours too, and now you two can support one another as acts! Build a community, collaborate, experiment, make new great art together. Play bomb shows together. And that extends to the people listening as well — put aside whatever discomfort you might feel and play your heart out; invite your audience to come and say hello after the show, to say hello to one another and make new friendships. They'll come to the next show, too, and bring friends.

**I want you to play at least two shows, a month apart, in the time leading up to your release.** More if you can travel (e.g., Brooklyn and Manhattan, separate enough audiences. Burlington VT is small enough that you don't want to oversaturate). Put together all that work for a big release show when your project drops — collaborate with other bands you've befriended, get a good Friday or Saturday spot. Hell, schedule a tour! We try not to release music without scheduling a little mini-tour for that weekend.

**Okay, so maybe you don't have a band, or you don't know how to perform. I encourage you to do it anyway.** Remember that we're committed here. You can repackage your music — it doesn't have to sound like the record. We recently played a live show online from my apartment. Unfortunately it's not really practical for us to play drums and thrashing electric guitars here, so we stripped it down, went acoustic, emphasized the harmonies, I play the piano. A different packaging, but I'm just trying to communicate my vision however I can. I've done videos of myself playing all the instruments. Whatever it takes. You can play out live with a laptop as a backing track. You can loop yourself. Maybe you're just a bomb musician, so you can just play and that's compelling enough. I'm not that way but I know plenty who are. You can do it! Just do it!

In my experience, colleges and DIY audiences are all really willing and invested fans. Colleges will also pay you quite handsomely!

Also the current backdrop to our musical lives is one of global emergency and live shows aren't really happening right now. There are still shows happening, but it's a bit of a different scene. Still, the above applies. Find a venue with a built in audience, find some collaborators within your scene, and put something together! Maybe you record it with your iPhone. You can get a great sound with a phone these days, just spend time getting a good placement. You can do it! Just do it!

**PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER**

Before our first release, I spent multiple hours doing this everyday. I would wake up, submit to blogs and playlisters on SubmitHub every four hours, cold message Spotify playlisters on my bus ride into work. I put together a show at one of the biggest, highest traffic venues in town with a couple bands from the area — friends I'd made by visiting their shows and being a part of the local scene. We collaborated with a local graphic designer to make these awesome posters.  I drove around an hung them at the local universities and all around town. I scheduled a mini-tour immediately to follow, hitting some of the major cities on the East Coast. I invited everyone I knew in each city. I reached out personally! I asked them to bring friends! We filmed parts of our future ad material at these shows with the audience participating. After the show, we packed up quickly and spent time hanging out with friends and listeners, meeting the people with whom our music had resonated. I posted to Reddit. Some of those posts flopped — which embarrasses me and I'm telling you about it now because that's a reality of what we're doing and we need to accept that. It's slow. But this is a game of inches and you have to keep going, right? That's the only way forward. TikTok wasn't around yet but you can bet I'd have been posting on there everyday if it had been. I did as many podcasts and playlists as I could. I reached out to local newspapers and did interviews. My friends and I all streamed the new song non-stop on our phones. I asked everyone I knew to share the song if they liked it, telling them it was a small thing they could do for me that would mean a lot for our band. There's really no way around approaching this with humility. Remember your commitment. Excise your ego. This is music, it's a compassionate act to begin with. You have to reach out to others and connect, and it's in forming that community that you will go farther.

By the time we released our second single, a month later, all that consistent effort and momentum paid off. Release Radar did a little better. We started seeing some consistent listenership. We were finding our fanbase. Finally, by our third single, things started working for us. We got a huge bump off Release Radar followed by a *huge* bump off Discover Weekly. We have two songs now that routinely get peddled on Discover Weekly and that has driven us to so many new listeners and fans — all because of that hard work we put in. And I am still doing it everyday, in between producing our new record and my friends' new record and, of course, going to work. It is very possible that we will never have our tinderbox moment, the big break, and find tremendous success, but I am determined to find as many people to connect with as I can and I am going to keep working as hard as I can to make that a reality. You can do it! Just do it! It is slow and hard work and frankly it is mostly discouraging work, too. But if you want it, I promise you can do it. This will work. It will *take* work, but if you show up and you keep at it you *will* see results. Good luck!",96,0.95,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/iizvqn/how_to_get_your_first_10k_monthly_listeners_in/,How to get your first 10k monthly listeners — in response to a post made yesterday,how to get your first 10k monthly listeners — in response to a post made yesterday,"A user by the handle of u/WeakestBeast made a post yesterday with some helpful tips ey had gathered along their journey to 300k monthly listeners. One of these tips was to build a consistent listenership of about 10-50k people monthly before shopping around to labels — this *is* good advice, by the way, because a label needs to see that *you're gonna make this happen with or without them* before they're going invest a dime. But getting that first 10k monthly listeners can seem like an insurmountable first step, so I wanted to talk a bit about our personal journey.      —     **A BRIEF INTRODUCTION**     I've done this before. Shortly after our first release, we reached a monthly listenership of 50k at our peak. It's been six months since our most recent release (that first album) and we've settled into a comfortable 10-20k listeners consistently. And we do it all ourselves — recorded in my bedroom, mixed on cheap speakers with stock plug-ins, made our album art with an iPhone camera and some worklamps from Home Depot, cold calling playlisters and venues and blogs. Beyond my personal project, I'm involved in several other music projects, which range from 50-100k monthly listeners *consistently*. **While the fact that I've done this is an important qualification to actually talking about, I think probably more important is that I've been involved in a lot of really good bands that never even broke the 2k barrier, and I can tell you why.**           —    **A DISCLAIMER ABOUT THE FALSE DRAW OF MONTHLY LISTENERSHIP**     But there's something we need to address before we get started **monthly listenership is a red herring** as far as your musical success, however you may define it, is. It *is* measuring something, but it has power mostly because we give it power, and an even less precise measure because of that. **In all likelihood, your interest as a musician is not just getting your music in front of millions of people who will only ever listen once, but specifically to get it in front of the people who will resonate with your music.** The people for whom your songs are meaningful, the people who will become fans. I suspect that for many of us, *that* is the truer measure of success (even if we aren't always good at shaking off the delusions of fame and influence). **Monthly listenership does not measure that**. These are listeners, not fans. There are many, many, many musicians with 200k monthly listeners out there that struggle to bring 50 people to a show. The rise of the playlist has as a side effect the tendency to render music as ""wallpaper"", an accompaniment to people's days and not something with which they actively engage. **Given, we and the people we want to impress (managers, labels, press) attribute quite a lot to monthly listenership.** That's the second failing. Goodhart's Law tells us that once a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a useful measure. Which is to say, when we put so much emphasis on monthly listenership, it ceases to be a good proxy for the quality or actual retentive quality of your music. **You can easily imagine that this number could be misleadingly inflated by fame or popularity without any regard for the quality of the music at all.** So remember that this isn't the end-all-be-all. **Your goal is to reach as many future fans as you can, NOT just random people** — and that doesn't always look like 500k people right off the bat. I don't doubt that there's an audience of that many people for whatever your genre is, no matter how weird. There are a lot of people, and if you like it, odds are someone else will appreciate it as well. But finding them is a much, much, much more difficult task than reaching that first 10k of passive consumers. —     **STARTING FROM NOTHING** The first question to ask yourself is *what you really want*. Do you want this? I know *I* want it, and I'm going to assume you do too. But it's not going to be easy and it's not going to be fair. If you really want this, you need to turn a critical eye to your own music and excise everything that doesn't work. *Commit* to making the best possible art you can. You might not think of yourself as a songwriter, but you need to understand how a good song works. You might not think of yourself as a producer, but you need to know how to make things sound good. You might not think of yourself as a marketer, but no one else is going to do it for you and you need to get your music in front of people. You might not think of yourself as an influencer, but you're selling experiences and *that's the whole package*. So ask yourself right now, **what are you the worst at? What are you the best at?** Think long and hard about these things, then hit Google and commit right now to getting better at all of it. **I am not saying this is a prerequisite. This is a continuous process. The biggest obstacle any of us will face is time, so don't wait for everything to be perfect. A musical career is just growing up in the public eye.** But I know you're all doing that already, or you wouldn't be here reading this. So you've finished your project and it sounds good. Great writing, tight production, well-mixed, well-mastered. Nice. You've got some slick album art. You're excited and ready to drop this project. But you're not going to drop this project yet. This is the longest part, it takes patience and it's not nearly as fun as making music. No, you're going to wait. You're going to set a release date for two months, minimum, from now. And then you're going to start planning. —     **GAINING AN AUDIENCE ON SOCIAL MEDIA** First, let's get the social media logistics out of the way. Do you have a mailing list? Are you on at least one of the major social media platforms? I recommend Instagram and TikTok, which are by far the dominant platforms right now. Make a YouTube channel. Make a Bandcamp. Make a Soundcloud. Reddit, if you want. You want people to be able to stream your music even if they aren't on Apple or Spotify. Lock down an email address. Make sure your handle is the same for all of these. The trick to gathering an audience on these platforms is to create something of value. And that value is important because it's specific and in-line with your artistic identity. **I use our Instagram as a place to keep in touch with our community** — I follow and interact with other artists and collaborators, I post daily snippets from the life of the band to our story, little musical videos, I even post about what books I'm reading. People are on Instagram because they're interested in you and your life, so it's nice to see behind the curtain and into the lives of you and your bandmates. **TikTok, on the other hand, seems to be entirely driven by a content-based algorithm** — this can look like a lot of things funny little videos, covers of songs you like, dances, vibey lifestyle posts, rating different things, more informational stuff (our most popular by far were about DIY audio engineering). TikTok seems to prefer videos that show your face from the front, by and large, and anything that makes use of its in-app sounds, songs, effects, and features. Just a small tip. Do some duetting and reacting, people like that. What, you're not on TikTok? *Get on TikTok!* It makes me feel old and out-of-touch, too, but you've got to excise that discomfort and get after it. Remember, we're committed. **Facebook is useful for scheduling events, more useful if you have an older audience**. But even then, I'd use a mailing list. **The nice thing about email is it gets you away from algorithm-driven exposure** — now you can contact people you care about directly. **YouTube is a great place to do covers and gather fans from other, extant fanbases.** I know that fans of Pinegrove or Death Cab for Cutie will find something to like from our music, for example, so we've spent a lot of time and effort putting together some good quality covers. **I prefer to use Reddit in this way** — I spent years learning a lot from this community and it's great to be able to contribute, now. And who knows, maybe you'll gain some new listeners that way, too. You're welcome to make yourself a website, but to be honest I don't think it's all that important anymore.  So you're going to spend your two months gathering an audience on *all* these platforms by posting regularly, engaging with others, and creating high-value content. Sneak in some promotional stuff for your music. TikTok seems particularly lawless — just post your song and people will start demanding you release it. This is a game of inches. It takes time. **And don't be afraid to direct your friends and family. Learn how to ask, you're going to need to.** Otherwise no one will ever even know you released it. But every person you gather becomes a potential vector of new exposure. **ADS** As a brief aside, if you have the money, ads can be really useful. The trick is to make it less of an ad and more of a normal post on social media. Engagement with videos is much higher. Spend some time making a short little video teaser and release video for your music. Music videos are even better! Try to spend at least $10 a day and use a targeted audience. If you've run ads before, try especially to focus people who have previously engaged with your material. You can have Instagram and Facebook promote you, you can have YouTube screen your videos before other relevant artists. And feel free to get creative with ads in the real world, too. Leave random letters inviting people to your show. Put up flyers! Collaborate with local artists to make cool merchandise and flyers! —     **PLAYLISTS, PLAYLISTS, PLAYLISTS (AND BLOGS, AND RADIO)** **Next, get on SubmitHub**. You're going to find yourself a couple blogs — as many as you can — to talk about your release. To be honest, I don't think too many people actively read blogs anymore, but you might gain a little exposure out of it. More importantly, it gives you another measure of legitimacy. People are talking about your music. You're going to share those articles when they're written, and people will be more inclined to check your music out having seen that other people are writing about it. **More importantly, find a couple playlisters to add your song**. With both of these things, it helps be *specific* about your targeting — do a little research. And it helps to have a little money for premium credits, the rate of acceptance is so much higher. But if you *don't* — and that's completely okay — you can earn them by rating others' music on Hot or Not. And **you should add your music to SubmitHub's Hot or Not** as well. Think of all the other appreciative musicians who are on there listening through Hot or Not. Someone might think your stuff is pretty hot! And then you've got a new fan as well. But playlists. Someone commented in the other thread, ""Playlists, playlists, playlists."" And if you want to up your monthly listeners and *maybe even gain some fans*, this is the right answer. So ask yourself, who does your music sound like? Note, this is not *who do you listen to*, but who do you *sound* like? I love Frank Ocean and Theo Katzman, both have influenced my songwriting and sound *immensely*, and I sound nothing like those artists. But fans of Pinegrove might find a particular resonance with our music. I'm a new fan of Phoebe Bridgers (*Punisher* is such an amazing sounding album. I love Gruska and Mills and Berg's production, wow) but even before I liked her music I understood that others might find similar qualities. What's the strongest quality of your music? Now go forth on Spotify and find user-made playlists that have a similar vibe. Given them a listen. Now's the creepy part — and this process is long and tedious, too. Look at the user. Do they make playlists under their name? Do they have a profile picture? Great. Spotify pulls those things from Facebook. **Go find their Facebook profile, friend them, and send them a message cold.** Be courteous and respectful, be friendly and genuine. Let them know you've been digging their playlist. You really like X and Y artists, and because of their playlist, you found Z artists and you really dig it. You think your song might be a good fit. Send them a link and say, if you like it, I'd love it if you could add it to your playlist. This feels slimey and weird and it was one of the earliest forms of exposure we got beyond our immediate social circles. **Don't forget about Spotify's playlist submission.** As long as your submit two weeks prior to release, you'll be put on Release Radar, which will let everyone who's listened to your previously know you've got a new song out. From my own experience, Release Radar can also expose you to new likely fans based on engagement, acting as a little mini Discover Weekly. **Discover Weekly is where you want to end up,** because Spotify will just continue shipping your song around to new fans as long as there's engagement. These things are both driven by engagement and sharing by users immediately following release, so all that work you put in above is going to be really important! And of course you can submit a song from each release for Editorial Playlist consideration, too! As always, targeting is key. Find the right curated playlist for your specific song, tailor your pitch to that playlist's vibe and content. By the way, I recommend releasing a few singles before the project, and scheduling them to be four weeks apart. This way, Spotify will note the consistent influx of new listeners and the momentum you've built up, so it'll start doing some of the work for you. Plus, it gives *you* momentum to outside observers. On a sort of related note, reach out to local radio stations! The students who run college stations are eager and have such a passion for music. They are fans just waiting to happen, and you'll find they're often friends waiting to happen as well. It is such a pleasure to sit down and chat with a couple students on the air and it costs you just an hour of your time, an enjoyable one at that. Likewise with podcasters!

are you on at least one of the major social media platforms? i recommend instagram and tiktok, which are by far the dominant platforms right now. make a youtube channel. make a bandcamp. make a soundcloud. reddit, if you want. you want people to be able to stream your music even if they aren't on apple or spotify. lock down an email address. make sure your handle is the same for all of these. the trick to gathering an audience on these platforms is to create something of value. and that value is important because it's specific and in-line with your artistic identity. **i use our instagram as a place to keep in touch with our community** — i follow and interact with other artists and collaborators, i post daily snippets from the life of the band to our story, little musical videos, i even post about what books i'm reading. people are on instagram because they're interested in you and your life, so it's nice to see behind the curtain and into the lives of you and your bandmates. **tiktok, on the other hand, seems to be entirely driven by a content-based algorithm** — this can look like a lot of things funny little videos, covers of songs you like, dances, vibey lifestyle posts, rating different things, more informational stuff (our most popular by far were about diy audio engineering). tiktok seems to prefer videos that show your face from the front, by and large, and anything that makes use of its in-app sounds, songs, effects, and features. just a small tip. do some duetting and reacting, people like that. what, you're not on tiktok? *get on tiktok!* it makes me feel old and out-of-touch, too, but you've got to excise that discomfort and get after it. remember, we're committed. **facebook is useful for scheduling events, more useful if you have an older audience**. but even then, i'd use a mailing list. **the nice thing about email is it gets you away from algorithm-driven exposure** — now you can contact people you care about directly. **youtube is a great place to do covers and gather fans from other, extant fanbases.** i know that fans of pinegrove or death cab for cutie will find something to like from our music, for example, so we've spent a lot of time and effort putting together some good quality covers. **i prefer to use reddit in this way** — i spent years learning a lot from this community and it's great to be able to contribute, now. and who knows, maybe you'll gain some new listeners that way, too. you're welcome to make yourself a website, but to be honest i don't think it's all that important anymore.  so you're going to spend your two months gathering an audience on *all* these platforms by posting regularly, engaging with others, and creating high-value content. sneak in some promotional stuff for your music. tiktok seems particularly lawless — just post your song and people will start demanding you release it. this is a game of inches. it takes time. **and don't be afraid to direct your friends and family. learn how to ask, you're going to need to.** otherwise no one will ever even know you released it. but every person you gather becomes a potential vector of new exposure. **ads** as a brief aside, if you have the money, ads can be really useful. the trick is to make it less of an ad and more of a normal post on social media. engagement with videos is much higher. spend some time making a short little video teaser and release video for your music. music videos are even better! try to spend at least $10 a day and use a targeted audience. if you've run ads before, try especially to focus people who have previously engaged with your material. you can have instagram and facebook promote you, you can have youtube screen your videos before other relevant artists. and feel free to get creative with ads in the real world, too. leave random letters inviting people to your show. put up flyers! collaborate with local artists to make cool merchandise and flyers! —     **playlists, playlists, playlists (and blogs, and radio)** **next, get on submithub**. you're going to find yourself a couple blogs — as many as you can — to talk about your release. to be honest, i don't think too many people actively read blogs anymore, but you might gain a little exposure out of it. more importantly, it gives you another measure of legitimacy. people are talking about your music. you're going to share those articles when they're written, and people will be more inclined to check your music out having seen that other people are writing about it. **more importantly, find a couple playlisters to add your song**. with both of these things, it helps be *specific* about your targeting — do a little research. and it helps to have a little money for premium credits, the rate of acceptance is so much higher. but if you *don't* — and that's completely okay — you can earn them by rating others' music on hot or not. and **you should add your music to submithub's hot or not** as well. think of all the other appreciative musicians who are on there listening through hot or not. someone might think your stuff is pretty hot! and then you've got a new fan as well. but playlists. someone commented in the other thread, ""playlists, playlists, playlists."" and if you want to up your monthly listeners and *maybe even gain some fans*, this is the right answer. so ask yourself, who does your music sound like? note, this is not *who do you listen to*, but who do you *sound* like? i love frank ocean and theo katzman, both have influenced my songwriting and sound *immensely*, and i sound nothing like those artists. but fans of pinegrove might find a particular resonance with our music. i'm a new fan of phoebe bridgers (*punisher* is such an amazing sounding album. i love gruska and mills and berg's production, wow) but even before i liked her music i understood that others might find similar qualities. what's the strongest quality of your music? now go forth on spotify and find user-made playlists that have a similar vibe. given them a listen. now's the creepy part — and this process is long and tedious, too. look at the user. do they make playlists under their name? do they have a profile picture? great. spotify pulls those things from facebook. **go find their facebook profile, friend them, and send them a message cold.** be courteous and respectful, be friendly and genuine. let them know you've been digging their playlist. you really like x and y artists, and because of their playlist, you found z artists and you really dig it. you think your song might be a good fit. send them a link and say, if you like it, i'd love it if you could add it to your playlist. this feels slimey and weird and it was one of the earliest forms of exposure we got beyond our immediate social circles. **don't forget about spotify's playlist submission.** as long as your submit two weeks prior to release, you'll be put on release radar, which will let everyone who's listened to your previously know you've got a new song out. from my own experience, release radar can also expose you to new likely fans based on engagement, acting as a little mini discover weekly. **discover weekly is where you want to end up,** because spotify will just continue shipping your song around to new fans as long as there's engagement. these things are both driven by engagement and sharing by users immediately following release, so all that work you put in above is going to be really important! and of course you can submit a song from each release for editorial playlist consideration, too! as always, targeting is key. find the right curated playlist for your specific song, tailor your pitch to that playlist's vibe and content. by the way, i recommend releasing a few singles before the project, and scheduling them to be four weeks apart. this way, spotify will note the consistent influx of new listeners and the momentum you've built up, so it'll start doing some of the work for you. plus, it gives *you* momentum to outside observers. on a sort of related note, reach out to local radio stations! the students who run college stations are eager and have such a passion for music. they are fans just waiting to happen, and you'll find they're often friends waiting to happen as well. it is such a pleasure to sit down and chat with a couple students on the air and it costs you just an hour of your time, an enjoyable one at that. likewise with podcasters! there are so many podcasts these days and i guarantee you know someone that hosts one. reach out!  — **performing live** back before the beginning of the end of the world, we used to play live. **live shows remain the number one way you'll convert a listener to a fan**. try to maximize your exposure by playing venues with good foot traffic — venues with enough of a reputation that they bring their own listener base on a regular basis, potential new fans for you — and by pairing with other bands in the scene. how do you meet other bands? be friendly and sociable, go out to their shows, listen respectfully, talk to them after, buy them a drink. you'll find your scene. their fans will become fans of yours too, and now you two can support one another as acts! build a community, collaborate, experiment, make new great art together. play bomb shows together. and that extends to the people listening as well — put aside whatever discomfort you might feel and play your heart out; invite your audience to come and say hello after the show, to say hello to one another and make new friendships. they'll come to the next show, too, and bring friends. **i want you to play at least two shows, a month apart, in the time leading up to your release.** more if you can travel (e.g., brooklyn and manhattan, separate enough audiences. burlington vt is small enough that you don't want to oversaturate). put together all that work for a big release show when your project drops — collaborate with other bands you've befriended, get a good friday or saturday spot. hell, schedule a tour! we try not to release music without scheduling a little mini-tour for that weekend. **okay, so maybe you don't have a band, or you don't know how to perform. i encourage you to do it anyway.** remember that we're committed here. you can repackage your music — it doesn't have to sound like the record. we recently played a live show online from my apartment. unfortunately it's not really practical for us to play drums and thrashing electric guitars here, so we stripped it down, went acoustic, emphasized the harmonies, i play the piano. a different packaging, but i'm just trying to communicate my vision however i can. i've done videos of myself playing all the instruments. whatever it takes. you can play out live with a laptop as a backing track. you can loop yourself. maybe you're just a bomb musician, so you can just play and that's compelling enough. i'm not that way but i know plenty who are. you can do it! just do it! in my experience, colleges and diy audiences are all really willing and invested fans. colleges will also pay you quite handsomely! also the current backdrop to our musical lives is one of global emergency and live shows aren't really happening right now. there are still shows happening, but it's a bit of a different scene. still, the above applies. find a venue with a built in audience, find some collaborators within your scene, and put something together! maybe you record it with your iphone. you can get a great sound with a phone these days, just spend time getting a good placement. you can do it! just do it! — **putting it all together** before our first release, i spent multiple hours doing this everyday. i would wake up, submit to blogs and playlisters on submithub every four hours, cold message spotify playlisters on my bus ride into work. i put together a show at one of the biggest, highest traffic venues in town with a couple bands from the area — friends i'd made by visiting their shows and being a part of the local scene. we collaborated with a local graphic designer to make these awesome posters.  i drove around an hung them at the local universities and all around town. i scheduled a mini-tour immediately to follow, hitting some of the major cities on the east coast. i invited everyone i knew in each city. i reached out personally! i asked them to bring friends! we filmed parts of our future ad material at these shows with the audience participating. after the show, we packed up quickly and spent time hanging out with friends and listeners, meeting the people with whom our music had resonated. i posted to reddit. some of those posts flopped — which embarrasses me and i'm telling you about it now because that's a reality of what we're doing and we need to accept that. it's slow. but this is a game of inches and you have to keep going, right? that's the only way forward. tiktok wasn't around yet but you can bet i'd have been posting on there everyday if it had been. i did as many podcasts and playlists as i could. i reached out to local newspapers and did interviews. my friends and i all streamed the new song non-stop on our phones. i asked everyone i knew to share the song if they liked it, telling them it was a small thing they could do for me that would mean a lot for our band. there's really no way around approaching this with humility. remember your commitment. excise your ego. this is music, it's a compassionate act to begin with. you have to reach out to others and connect, and it's in forming that community that you will go farther. by the time we released our second single, a month later, all that consistent effort and momentum paid off. release radar did a little better. we started seeing some consistent listenership. we were finding our fanbase. finally, by our third single, things started working for us. we got a huge bump off release radar followed by a *huge* bump off discover weekly. we have two songs now that routinely get peddled on discover weekly and that has driven us to so many new listeners and fans — all because of that hard work we put in. and i am still doing it everyday, in between producing our new record and my friends' new record and, of course, going to work. it is very possible that we will never have our tinderbox moment, the big break, and find tremendous success, but i am determined to find as many people to connect with as i can and i am going to keep working as hard as i can to make that a reality. you can do it! just do it! it is slow and hard work and frankly it is mostly discouraging work, too. but if you want it, i promise you can do it. this will work. it will *take* work, but if you show up and you keep at it you *will* see results. good luck!",16,3654

14n50oj,1688142321.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,theusualboysband,I'd like feeback on ways to improve my music release strategy,"My band recently released a song which was the first in a series of upcoming singles that will lead to the release of our first album. I was hoping I could share what we did hear, and get some feedback and tips for future releases. I feel like there have never been so many options for DIY music promotion, but equally there's never been so many middle men and scams. I was basically wondering if there was anything obvious that we missed. 

Paid promotion: We tried not to use this too much because the band is on a budget and we have also had pretty poor results in the past. We dedicated a small amount to playlist pitchers like Submit hub. We achieved a few successes but mostly rejections and a lot of vague often conflicting feedback. I\`ve herd really conflicting things about these services and am interested in hearing how they worked for others. 

Social Media: We produced a lot of tick tocks about the making of the track and how we layered/made each sound. We organsised a mini tour of 5 shows and posted lots of stories/pitcures of us on the road on Instagram. 

Gigs: Like I said we organised 5 dates around the UK, which was a lot of work for us because we are based in Berlin. That felt like a really worthwhile thing to do, we got generally good reactions from crowds (I\`ve also herd that having gigs listed on spotify helps a release, but have no idea if that's true).

Visuals/videos: I was really proud of the single cover, I think it fit our existing work well.(I can't attach a screenshot for some reason but if your interested the song was called 'French Cops' by 'The Usual Boys'). I felt like we would have benefited from a music video but it proved to be impossible on the budget we had. If anyone has any tips for good ideas for a replacement to a traditional music video i'd love to hear them. Even making that stuff on a phone (which we have done) still needs props, an editor, the band to give up at least a weekend, and when everyone is working etc it can be tricky. 

Blogs/Radio: We emailed hundreds of online blogs and radio stations both in germany (in german) and in the UK, America, Australia and odd ones in other countries. 

If you can think of anything we missed, or recomend any services that you have first hand experience with I'd love to hear about them.

","my band recently released a song which was the first in a series of upcoming singles that will lead to the release of our first album. i was hoping i could share what we did hear, and get some feedback and tips for future releases. i feel like there have never been so many options for diy music promotion, but equally there's never been so many middle men and scams. i was basically wondering if there was anything obvious that we missed.  paid promotion we tried not to use this too much because the band is on a budget and we have also had pretty poor results in the past. we dedicated a small amount to playlist pitchers like submit hub. we achieved a few successes but mostly rejections and a lot of vague often conflicting feedback. i\`ve herd really conflicting things about these services and am interested in hearing how they worked for others.  social media we produced a lot of tick tocks about the making of the track and how we layered/made each sound. we organsised a mini tour of 5 shows and posted lots of stories/pitcures of us on the road on instagram.  gigs like i said we organised 5 dates around the uk, which was a lot of work for us because we are based in berlin. that felt like a really worthwhile thing to do, we got generally good reactions from crowds (i\`ve also herd that having gigs listed on spotify helps a release, but have no idea if that's true). visuals/videos i was really proud of the single cover, i think it fit our existing work well.(i can't attach a screenshot for some reason but if your interested the song was called 'french cops' by 'the usual boys'). i felt like we would have benefited from a music video but it proved to be impossible on the budget we had. if anyone has any tips for good ideas for a replacement to a traditional music video i'd love to hear them. even making that stuff on a phone (which we have done) still needs props, an editor, the band to give up at least a weekend, and when everyone is working etc it can be tricky.  blogs/radio we emailed hundreds of online blogs and radio stations both in germany (in german) and in the uk, america, australia and odd ones in other countries.  if you can think of anything we missed, or recomend any services that you have first hand experience with i'd love to hear about them.  all the best and thanks for reading.

ih4p6s,1598467446.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,TheRealKaiLord,PSA: How to tell when Spotify playlists and plays are fake,"We all see shit like this:

""10-15k Guaranteed plays on 12 Playlists for $50 - get your music heard!""

If  you message these people they will send you a bunch of screen shots  from satisfied customers, some will be small time artists, some will be  huge with 200k + followers.

Some might be successful, but most will only have 'bot clout.'

It's really hard to tell when someone's Spotify is just bots if you don't know what to look for - here is what to look for.

Monthly  listeners to total plays - If they have 50k plays on their top song,  and 40k monthly listeners, they recently bought all of those plays.  Because if they really had that kind of listener base MONTHLY, their  total plays would be way higher.

Monthly  listeners to followers - If they have 40k monthly listeners and 300  followers, no one really fucks with them, they paid for the plays.

Where  people are listening - If you see cities like, Los Angeles, Dallas,  Phoenix, Kansas City, Buffalo, London GB, Frankfurt, etc.. these cities  are big data centers where botters can buy a whole bunch of IP addresses  to do fake shit. No one gets above 10% of their listeners from Dallas  unless they are a local act. So getting above 10% from multiple large  cities is simply impossible.

Before  you go checking every spotify playlist promotion to see which ones give  'real' results and which ones are fake... let me spoil it for you. They  are all fake.

Here are the things  that are difficult to do, expensive, still full of bullshit, but can  potentially work (that I'm aware of) submithub, playlistpush and good  old emailing/messaging individual playlist owners

Also,  if you're thinking, meh, I'll do it anyway for the clout, it'll make  other people listen and follow because I'll seem successful. Be the fuck  ware. Because Spotify has come down on bot plays and will again. You do  not want their visible or invisible ban hammer to come down upon you.

i7e20t,1597094856.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,MiffTuck,"Spotify Stream Fraud, and Some of its Implications","This is a bit of a rant about some stuff I've seen over the last couple of days that I think has further implications than what is necessarily evident on the surface.

A bit of background - I'm a guitarist in a UK-based Alt Rock band. We've been out of action for the most part for a good few years whilst writing an album, and having a load of issues along the way that are a whole other story. We're gearing up to release the album and, as such, I've been delving deep into the music marketing world.

One of the big areas I've been looking at has been Spotify playlists (as I'm sure many others are) and, thanks in no small part to this sub, I've found a wealth of information and really expanded my knowledge and understanding of how they work and what makes their algorithms tick.

Now, over the past couple of weeks, I've seen two of my band's contemporaries brag about hitting some big streaming stats (at least from where I'm sitting). The first one was celebrating close to 110k streams on an EP (we'll call this one Band A), and the other one was celebrating hitting 10k streams on a relatively new single (Band B).

To tackle Band A first, I used Spotify for Artists to compare our stats, and came across this absolutely absurd display:

&amp;#x200B;

[Band A Followers](https://preview.redd.it/jken3fenq8g51.png?width=2132&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd16de8c9e0b74bbcd80a6fbf1c6ebe3a77033dd)

In case it isn't blatantly obvious, that massive drop in followers is in April of 2020, where Spotify removed a load of fake users from their system.

Band B's situation was a little more insidious. There was nothing quite so obvious in the Spotify for Artists stats, so I used a free trial of Spot On Track and Chartmetric, and found the reasons for their streams. They were on 2 seemingly massive playlists, but when looking into them a little deeper, each of these playlists (run by the same person) had grown to over 33k followers in little over a month (so almost definitely more bots), and the profile had a link that eventually led to a website where you could buy package deals for ""Spotify Promotion"". On this website, you can choose how many playlists you want to be on, and how many tracks you want to put on them. It looks like they spent 85 Euros in total for their streams.

Now, the obvious thing would be to point out that they won't ultimately achieve anything from this. Sure, they may be able to fool some promoters into giving them better slots than they've necessarily earned, but they certainly won't recuperate the money spent, and their music is quite clearly not really reaching that many people. Their chances of fooling Spotify's algorithm are also probably quite low because, whilst they've got a lot of streams, their save rate is likely to be atrocious, so it's a house of cards. But on the other hand, and in my opinion much worse, it goes to show the lengths that musicians will go to in order to try to manipulate some sort of social proofing.

In both bands' case, they have quite clearly been willing to perpetuate the systematic abuse of the system and of themselves by allowing nefarious operations to profit from their desperation. That may sound hyperbolic, but that's ultimately what it boils down to. I've been, in my head, quite down on things like SubmitHub for allowing yet another part of the music industry that isn't musicians to get money out of us (particularly since I doubt the good faith of a lot of the bloggers on there), but this is on a completely different level.

I also wonder about the implications on musicians' mental health. It's rare a day goes by when you don't see something in the media bemoaning the unrealistic ideals imposed on people by influencers on Instagram, or via celebrities in the media, but I've not heard anything about the inferiority complex that must develop in people about the apparent failure of their music if they don't know that this kind of thing is happening.

Hi, i’m here to share my experience on SubmitHub, hoping to be usefull for someone.

I’ve  used this service for a couple of song, and since it’s a long post, i  want to start with the most faq i’ve read on reddit about this.

Yes  this website is legit, and it’s a great idea, should you use it? It’s  all about lucky, i probably won’t use it anymore, not because of the  service, that does what it should and the founder it’s always on the  chat to help and talk with people, but because curators, at least in my  experience, they are not open minded to listen something that try to  bring something different on the scene, there is a reason why we are  artists and not someone who clean a window, if i wanted to copy somone  else i whould chose another job.

With  the premium credits you will receive the feedback from curators, but  are not really helpfull, because someone could say your vocal is awesome  but the instrumental suck, and another one the opposite. My last song  was declined for sharing by all curators i’ve submitted, i want to copy  here all the feedback, because i think it worth reading to have an idea,  ofc i wont write who they are, but just the feedback.

**Feadback (all declined)**

Great  tune, loved the vocal as well as the bubbling house vibes on the  baseline. The drop is quite fresh and well produced and overall the  track sounds really fresh. Unfortunately, it's a bit too relaxing and  deep for us, sorry

""Fearless""  offers a very accessible and energetic Progressive House sound, the  melodic arrangements are impressive and super uplifting, the track has a  great deep invigorating energy and nice enigmatic ambiance, however,  although it is a quality production, it unfortunately wasn't quite  compelling enough for a blog feature, I'm sorry

Thanks  for submitting! I like the very nostalgic and sweet melodies of the  song but the drop is not as energetic as I expected, the kick is a  little too thin and flat and the bass not deep.

Hey  there, Cool instrumental and very vibey sound design &amp; chords !  We're not caught by the vocals on this one though. Thanks for sending

Good  production enjoyable beat and vocal arrangements unfortunately not  convinced on the melody so let's try your next thanks for submitting

Hey,  the intro and the vocals soudns really great of course but actually  dont really like the beat drop. Next time you should work a bit more on  it in my opinion.

Hey there, thanks for the submission. Instrumental is fine but vocal is not what we are looking for qualitywise. Sorry!

thanks  for submitting Fearless. Been so pumped with teh vocal, sadly the drop  turned out a bit too different than we expected. Hoped for a big  epxlisive one! :(

Hey, good track,  good production. I like the instrumental. Unfortunately I am not a fan  of the vocals. They sound too standard to me. Unfortunately they don't  kick me. Therefore, in this case I must decline. Nevertheless I wish you  a lot of success with this song! I'm sure it will find its fans. Thanks  for sending!

Nice instrumental. We don't feel the vocals enough. Thanks for submitting it to us

This  started of pretty good, really nice pads and great pluck. The vocal was  ok, it didnt sound great at times which didnt really let me enjoy the  song much. The production was quite clean but I didn't really enjoy the  drop much - it was missing alot of elements to keep it interesting.  Great concept though just needs a bit more work - Thanks for sending

the  song sounded quite good. This was definitely some high quality  production - The mix was dope and the elements used were good. The  melodies were catchy! Good job! Sadly here, i wasn't hooked by the vocal  topline (lyrics and melodies). Indeed, i felt like it was a bit  repetitive and linear for my personal tastes. I didn't feel like it was  professional enough.. :/ I know most people will love the song, but it  didn't convince me enough for me to support in my list this time. But  thank you for your submission. Have a good day and stay safe!

Even  though the song is not suitable for my playlist, cause I find it too  chill and not that commercial, I want to highlight the originality of  the instrumental

Hey, the mix and  master sounds really clean but actually dont really like the break  melody. Next time you should work more on it.

Hey  Frankie, thanks for reaching out. The idea is cool and it has  potential, but I'm afraid the mixing quality and the sound desing here  still sounds quite weak and messy, there's no contrast betweent the  different sections of the song.. not really meeting our quality  standards for a feature this time, I'm sorry. Wish you good luck with  your song release!

It's a  wonderful summer melody and music production is well done, but we  expected more developed progression..Anyway, keep creating

The  energy in the song is nice here. So not bad. But also a bit too beat  driven I would say as I was missing a more melodic production here to  make the song stand out enough for me. So not all the way this time.

I appreciate the songwriting, but I wasn't into the final mix of Fearless nor the vocal performance.

what we didn't enjoy here is unoriginal melodies, keep on, your voice is amazing

not a fan of the drop here but just my taste

Thanks  for submitting but I'm going to pass. The song has solid production  that sets a nice tone but vocally I feel the song could be stronger to  my personal ear. Best of luck to you

Congrats  on the single. Lovely dance. That ending wasn't what the beginning of  the song was teasing. Was hoping for a huge ending. But that's just us  FT. Nice house, indeed. Keep on kickin' as you do. Sorry couldn't pull  the trigger. Enjoy the accolades.

Cool  vibe on the soundscape and vocals. There's definitely some talent  there. For me, I would like to hear a more defining hook that we can  sink our teeth into overall though. This one felt a little too one note  for placement.

Super impressive  but sadly did get a bit repetitive for me. Surely might circle back  around to this one though after giving it some time and will reach  out..!

Production is really dope  here. Vocals need a little development, sonically fell a little short  for us. Keep it up though, production is dope

The intro got me hooked! The drop was however very underwhelming. I'd try adding a lead to it so it can shine!

Good  production. The track feels, however, a little on the familiar side and  might benefit from adding fresher sound elements, twists and turns to  really take off and stand out that much more in this genre.

Great  tune, loved the vocal as well as the bubbling house vibes on the  baseline. The drop is quite fresh and well produced and overall the  track sounds really fresh. Unfortunately, it's a bit too relaxing and  deep for us, sorry

The highs of  this song sound a little bit strange. Would work on that to get a proper  final track because the melody has a really good potential!

La chanson sonne très ordinaire, standard selon nous, peut être une autre

I  struggled a bit to stay dialed in on the vocals enough to connect  lyrically. The build and production are there, but I never found my one  moment to land with this one.

**My final thought**

As  you can see the most complain is the drop that isn’t huge, and surprise  surprise, this is what i wanted, i don’t wanna copy niky romero or  other artists, i wanna share my personal vibes, and when i listen a song  i’m looking for a contact with the artist, trying to feel what he felt,  i'm not trying to think about what he was supposed to do, the song is  his world and if he made a different choice there is a reason, and as  listener i try to understand it.

Music  is art, or it should be, i just immagine someone like Picasso in our  era where a curators will write “Sorry but i’m not  expected something  less messy, try to paint like Raffaello”

I can’t post links, but if someone is curious to listen the song send me a DM i will drop you the link

Even  though the song is not suitable for my playlist, cause I find it too  chill and not that commercial, I want to highlight the originality of  the instrumental Hey, the mix and  master sounds really clean but actually dont really like the break  melody. Next time you should work more on it. Hey  Frankie, thanks for reaching out. The idea is cool and it has  potential, but I'm afraid the mixing quality and the sound desing here  still sounds quite weak and messy, there's no contrast betweent the  different sections of the song.. not really meeting our quality  standards for a feature this time, I'm sorry. Wish you good luck with  your song release! It's a  wonderful summer melody and music production is well done, but we  expected more developed progression..Anyway, keep creating The  energy in the song is nice here. So not bad. But also a bit too beat  driven I would say as I was missing a more melodic production here to  make the song stand out enough for me. So not all the way this time. I appreciate the songwriting, but I wasn't into the final mix of Fearless nor the vocal performance. what we didn't enjoy here is unoriginal melodies, keep on, your voice is amazing not a fan of the drop here but just my taste Thanks  for submitting but I'm going to pass. The song has solid production  that sets a nice tone but vocally I feel the song could be stronger to  my personal ear. Best of luck to you Congrats  on the single. Lovely dance. That ending wasn't what the beginning of  the song was teasing. Was hoping for a huge ending. But that's just us  FT. Nice house, indeed. Keep on kickin' as you do. Sorry couldn't pull  the trigger. Enjoy the accolades. Cool  vibe on the soundscape and vocals. There's definitely some talent  there. For me, I would like to hear a more defining hook that we can  sink our teeth into overall though. This one felt a little too one note  for placement. Super impressive  but sadly did get a bit repetitive for me. Surely might circle back  around to this one though after giving it some time and will reach  out..! Production is really dope  here. Vocals need a little development, sonically fell a little short  for us. Keep it up though, production is dope The intro got me hooked! The drop was however very underwhelming. I'd try adding a lead to it so it can shine! Good  production. The track feels, however, a little on the familiar side and  might benefit from adding fresher sound elements, twists and turns to  really take off and stand out that much more in this genre. Great  tune, loved the vocal as well as the bubbling house vibes on the  baseline. The drop is quite fresh and well produced and overall the  track sounds really fresh. Unfortunately, it's a bit too relaxing and  deep for us, sorry The highs of  this song sound a little bit strange. Would work on that to get a proper  final track because the melody has a really good potential! La chanson sonne très ordinaire, standard selon nous, peut être une autre I  struggled a bit to stay dialed in on the vocals enough to connect  lyrically. The build and production are there, but I never found my one  moment to land with this one. **My final thought** As  you can see the most complain is the drop that isn’t huge, and surprise  surprise, this is what i wanted, i don’t wanna copy niky romero or  other artists, i wanna share my personal vibes, and when i listen a song  i’m looking for a contact with the artist, trying to feel what he felt,  i'm not trying to think about what he was supposed to do, the song is  his world and if he made a different choice there is a reason, and as  listener i try to understand it.

Great tune, loved the vocal as well as the bubbling house vibes on the baseline. The drop is quite fresh and well produced and overall the track sounds really fresh. Unfortunately, it's a bit too relaxing and deep for us, sorry  

""Fearless"" offers a very accessible and energetic Progressive House sound, the melodic arrangements are impressive and super uplifting, the track has a great deep invigorating energy and nice enigmatic ambiance, however, although it is a quality production, it unfortunately wasn't quite compelling enough for a blog feature, I'm sorry

Music is art, or it should be, i just immagine someone like Picasso in our era where a curators will write “Sorry but i’m not  expected something less messy, try to paint like Raffaello” I can’t post links, but if someone is curious to listen the song send me a DM i will drop you the link I’m also running a campaign on playlistpush, if this topic will reach some interest i will post my thought on that service too","hi, i’m here to share my experience on submithub, hoping to be usefull for someone. i’ve used this service for a couple of song, and since it’s a long post, i want to start with the most faq i’ve read on reddit about this.   yes this website is legit, and it’s a great idea, should you use it? it’s all about lucky, i probably won’t use it anymore, not because of the service, that does what it should and the founder it’s always on the chat to help and talk with people, but because curators, at least in my experience, they are not open minded to listen something that try to bring something different on the scene, there is a reason why we are artists and not someone who clean a window, if i wanted to copy somone else i whould chose another job. with the premium credits you will receive the feedback from curators, but are not really helpfull, because someone could say your vocal is awesome but the instrumental suck, and another one the opposite. my last song was declined for sharing by all curators i’ve submitted, i want to copy here all the feedback, because i think it worth reading to have an idea, ofc i wont write who they are, but just the feedback. **feadback (all declined)** great tune, loved the vocal as well as the bubbling house vibes on the baseline. the drop is quite fresh and well produced and overall the track sounds really fresh. unfortunately, it's a bit too relaxing and deep for us, sorry   ""fearless"" offers a very accessible and energetic progressive house sound, the melodic arrangements are impressive and super uplifting, the track has a great deep invigorating energy and nice enigmatic ambiance, however, although it is a quality production, it unfortunately wasn't quite compelling enough for a blog feature, i'm sorry   thanks for submitting! i like the very nostalgic and sweet melodies of the song but the drop is not as energetic as i expected, the kick is a little too thin and flat and the bass not deep.   hey there, cool instrumental and very vibey sound design & chords ! we're not caught by the vocals on this one though. thanks for sending   good production enjoyable beat and vocal arrangements unfortunately not convinced on the melody so let's try your next thanks for submitting   hey, the intro and the vocals soudns really great of course but actually dont really like the beat drop. next time you should work a bit more on it in my opinion.   hey there, thanks for the submission. instrumental is fine but vocal is not what we are looking for qualitywise. sorry!   thanks for submitting fearless. been so pumped with teh vocal, sadly the drop turned out a bit too different than we expected. hoped for a big epxlisive one! (   hey, good track, good production. i like the instrumental. unfortunately i am not a fan of the vocals. they sound too standard to me. unfortunately they don't kick me. therefore, in this case i must decline. nevertheless i wish you a lot of success with this song! i'm sure it will find its fans. thanks for sending!   nice instrumental. we don't feel the vocals enough. thanks for submitting it to us   this started of pretty good, really nice pads and great pluck. the vocal was ok, it didnt sound great at times which didnt really let me enjoy the song much. the production was quite clean but i didn't really enjoy the drop much - it was missing alot of elements to keep it interesting. great concept though just needs a bit more work - thanks for sending   the song sounded quite good. this was definitely some high quality production - the mix was dope and the elements used were good. the melodies were catchy! good job! sadly here, i wasn't hooked by the vocal topline (lyrics and melodies). indeed, i felt like it was a bit repetitive and linear for my personal tastes. i didn't feel like it was professional enough.. / i know most people will love the song, but it didn't convince me enough for me to support in my list this time. but thank you for your submission. have a good day and stay safe!   even though the song is not suitable for my playlist, cause i find it too chill and not that commercial, i want to highlight the originality of the instrumental   hey, the mix and master sounds really clean but actually dont really like the break melody. next time you should work more on it.   hey frankie, thanks for reaching out. the idea is cool and it has potential, but i'm afraid the mixing quality and the sound desing here still sounds quite weak and messy, there's no contrast betweent the different sections of the song.. not really meeting our quality standards for a feature this time, i'm sorry. wish you good luck with your song release!   it's a wonderful summer melody and music production is well done, but we expected more developed progression..anyway, keep creating   the energy in the song is nice here. so not bad. but also a bit too beat driven i would say as i was missing a more melodic production here to make the song stand out enough for me. so not all the way this time.   i appreciate the songwriting, but i wasn't into the final mix of fearless nor the vocal performance.   what we didn't enjoy here is unoriginal melodies, keep on, your voice is amazing   not a fan of the drop here but just my taste   thanks for submitting but i'm going to pass. the song has solid production that sets a nice tone but vocally i feel the song could be stronger to my personal ear. best of luck to you   congrats on the single. lovely dance. that ending wasn't what the beginning of the song was teasing. was hoping for a huge ending. but that's just us ft. nice house, indeed. keep on kickin' as you do. sorry couldn't pull the trigger. enjoy the accolades.   cool vibe on the soundscape and vocals. there's definitely some talent there. for me, i would like to hear a more defining hook that we can sink our teeth into overall though. this one felt a little too one note for placement.   super impressive but sadly did get a bit repetitive for me. surely might circle back around to this one though after giving it some time and will reach out..!   production is really dope here. vocals need a little development, sonically fell a little short for us. keep it up though, production is dope   the intro got me hooked! the drop was however very underwhelming. i'd try adding a lead to it so it can shine!   good production. the track feels, however, a little on the familiar side and might benefit from adding fresher sound elements, twists and turns to really take off and stand out that much more in this genre.   great tune, loved the vocal as well as the bubbling house vibes on the baseline. the drop is quite fresh and well produced and overall the track sounds really fresh. unfortunately, it's a bit too relaxing and deep for us, sorry   the highs of this song sound a little bit strange. would work on that to get a proper final track because the melody has a really good potential!

hfojvp,1593100558.0,TechnoProduction,-endjamin-,I've got a few more questions about releasing music,"I made a [thread about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/TechnoProduction/comments/gorucq/finished_up_an_epnow_what/) somewhat recently and got some good feedback, but I still have a few questions. Since that thread, I have sent my (self mastered) EP to a few labels. I haven't heard anything and it doesn't look like anyone even listened to it. I guess I should send it to more labels, which brings me to my first question: 

How do you create a list of labels to send things to? Of course, there are a few big labels everyone knows (Suara, Afterlife, Tresor, etc) but for a first release it's probably better to target smaller labels. But I don't know the names of these labels or what their deal is! Is there a list I can look at that has info on a bunch of labels such as what kind of music they release and their contact info? What about using a service like SubmitHub?

I am hoping that eventually someone will at least hear my work, but I don't want to let other people stop me from releasing my music. At what point should I just forget about labels and try self-releasing? If I go this route, is there anything important I should know (i.e. legal stuff like licensing)? Any other general tips or best practices for getting my stuff out there and onto the major streaming platforms?

Hello there.  
I've been thinking about my music and the way I share it and I now know that I do everything wrong.  
I've been uploading music in the internet since maybe 2010, and I had no illusions about gaining fame and money so basically I almost didn't do anything in terms of promoting my stuff. Lack of earnings does not scare me, but generally I just want people to hear my music.

Long story short, today I have 1 full-length album (experimental electronic + ambient, with a little bit of shoegaze), 2 EPs (one is techno, idm and the other is again quite experimental in terms of genre but I would say it is experimental electronic, sometimes triphop), couple of soundtracks I did for short movies and upcoming LP. All of this released only on my bandcamp and soundcloud accounts which has almost funny amount of followers.

What would you do with this?

hc3l8u,1592583457.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,Ghost_Town_,Alternative/Indie Musician Self-Release Checklist,"Hello fellow music makers!

I am preparing for a music release that is quite important to me, and would like to discuss self-release checklist. This would be helpful for other alternative/indie artists as well. 

This is my list. Your inputs are welcome!

* **1. Distribution company (Distrokid, CDbaby, etc.)**

This is pretty obvious. Probably don't need additional comments here.

&amp;#x200B;

* **2. Release on Bandcamp**

I love Bandcamp, it is a great platform for alternative/indie artists.

For me it has pretty much equal importance as No 1.

&amp;#x200B;

* **3. Music blogs**

I read a recent Reddit post in this group saying that the time of music blogs is over now.

But I think it will be a mistake to disregard this opportunity and totally skip music blogs.

I have few big ones on my list: Little Indie, A&amp;R Factory, This Song Is Sick.

Any other suggestions?

 

* **4. Submithub**

I heard good things about this resource. You pay some $$$ and they will submit your song for a review to different music blogs.

I don't want to invest much into this, but anyway would like to give it a shot.

&amp;#x200B;

* **5. Youtube channels/playlists**

I have few in mind. Will try to get there.

&amp;#x200B;

* **6. Facebook groups**

I am still discovering new useful Facebook groups. I think it can give some good exposure.

&amp;#x200B;

* **7. Instagram?**

I remember a recent post in this group a couple of weeks ago, and importance of Instagram was highlighted there.

Personally I did not have a good experience on Instagram few years ago as a photographer. 

Tons of likes/followers, but most of them seemed fake or bots to me. I quit Instagram a while ago. 

Will have to start from scratch for my music project. But this is what I have most doubts about: doesn't seem efficient enough to justify spending a lot of time/efforts.

&amp;#x200B;

Have you had any luck promoting your music on Instagram?

&amp;#x200B;

* **8. Reddit groups?** 

Reddit seems to be huge, but at the same time it is very subdivided.

Have you received any more or less substantial traffic from Reddit?

Any particular group you could recommend?

&amp;#x200B;

* **9. Radio stations**

This seems to be tough and almost impossible. But I'd like to give it a try anyway.

Has anyone had luck approaching radio stations without any connections?

&amp;#x200B;

* **10. Craigslist**

This seems to be a crappy option, but I still see a lot of bands promoting their music there. Why not?

&amp;#x200B;

Your suggestions are very welcome.

My method of promoting currently is: -creating the song and artwork

* writing a press release with a photo (shot on my phone but high enough def for websites) 
* pitching on Spotify for artists 
* emailing the press release with a SoundCloud link to probably around 40 websites I've sourced myself. Resulting in 1 write up. 
* hitting up submithub (taking a beating in the feedback but then having 1/2 postive responses after 20 submissions 
* finding playlists on Reddit and pitching the curators, resulting in 0 adds 
* sending the press release to local radio (I'm in Melbourne so pretty lucky to have two or three independent stations) Ending in some good feedback but no plays. 
* I tried a couple of Instagram ads with animations to go with the music which ended up in a slight boost in likes but no proof of conversion to Spotify / Bandcamp plays.

It all seems a lot of effort for 150 plays on Spotify and 300 from the Premiere on someone else's SoundCloud account. I'm trying to manage my expectations for this next release, as the feedback seems less positive than my previous release.

gvy3u1,1591204789.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,Agent-Double-Agent,"Would you rather spend money pushing your tracks to playlists using a service, or find the curators yourself and build a relationship with them?","I feel like playlisting is a really interesting topic to talk about because it’s becoming more relevant for indie musicians as a marketing tool for reaching a wider audience. The way I see it, there’s two ways you can do this:

The quick way is spending more money on getting your song pushed out to playlists (using a service like Submithub or Playlist Push)

This leaves you with more time to make the music as you’re basically outsourcing the media relations process to a third party. 

I want to say I trust those services, but I still have some reservations about the quality of their leads (sometimes their curators are really good and have good/active followings, but other times I’ve had songs pushed to dead playlists/blogs).

The other way is to just find the curators yourself and establish a real relationship with them. 

This can be a really time-consuming process because you need to scour your main streaming platform for playlists that are similar to your discography. 

Then, once you find a curator, it can take several days to build a meaningful relationship to where you both get value. 

But it’s free and also really good experience for networking online. 

So which way is best? I feel like it depends on financials: either you have the money to delegate the process, or you can spend the time &amp; mental energy to do it yourself for free while gaining good experience. 

What do you think? I wanna read your full take on the idea!

gtjtt7,1590865784.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,MBmusic3,I'm on an Editorial List....Help! Now what do I do?,"After 6 months of regular releases, slaving over a HUGE variety of music and putting up about 15 tracks and 4 collaborations... I was about to take a big step back, after watching my numbers plummet from respectable, 12k monthly listeners, down to 200 a day, down to 94 listeners last night.  After spending hours emailing, using social media, and doing everything I could behind the scenes to get my music out there, only to watch the numbers crater to less than 100 listeners.

&amp;#x200B;

And then... today I log into Spotify for Artisits....

&amp;#x200B;

**I've been added to an Editorial Playlist with over half a million listeners**

&amp;#x200B;

I took an hour to just lay down and quietly celebrate.  This was a solo guitar release I recorded in my bedroom, mixed/mastered myself during the lockdown.  But - **I realize I'm in a bit over my head and need guidance:**  I think now would be the time to really capitalize on the momentum with a paid Spotify official ad, and double down on my mailing list and social media to make the most of this playlist placement.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Does anyone have any success or experience using Spotify's ad platform?**

I use Distrokid to distribute - is there anything special I need to do to claim royalty money or copyright if the music is entirely my instrumental arrangements, and solely recorded and performed by me?

&amp;#x200B;

* I've had moderate to good success on Submithub
* I've had good success on DailyPlaylists this month
* I've tried doing a modest Fivr campaing - one was legit FB promotion for 7$
* the other paid playlist service was 20$ and the streams seemed to come out of nowhere, so I didn't mess with that for fear of it being bots or flagging my account a few months back

My genre is predominantly Spanish guitar, with classical, world, and acoustic music leanings.  I have a singer-songwriter track, and 3-4 tracks that are rap or electronic, that I played bass &amp; acoustic guitar on if anyone is curious about the genres. **What would you do if you were in my situation?**",1,0.67,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/gtjtt7/im_on_an_editorial_listhelp_now_what_do_i_do/,I'm on an Editorial List....Help!

gmvoxd,1589917359.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,[deleted],"My experiences with paid promotion so far (submithub, playlistpush, facebook)","**If you're lazy, just read the TL:DR section.** So I recently pushed a track hard for the first time, spending quite a bit of money on it. Thought I'd share my experience so far with these popular platforms. Please note these are my opinions and not facts; platforms are also changing over time, for example both submithub &amp; playlistpush has changed quite a bit since they started (both of them seem to be getting better). This is of May 2020.

.

**Facebook ads (with Spotify link):**

Very difficult to get any streams this way. Facebook is good if you want to reach out with information (ie, ""I'm playing live this summer!"") but not for getting streams. Also, you MUST be very specific about your target audience. The FB algorithms seemingly show your ad primarily to people who usually randomly like &amp; click stuff. This is probably not what you want... a 30 sec preview clip with Spotify API will also not count as a stream. I tried several campains over a few weeks to different countries &amp; target audiences, and my conclusion is that it's a tricky platform to use to get Spotify streams specifically.

.

**TL:DR: Facebook ads are good for specific things (reaching out with information), but very expensive if you count it per stream with a Spotify link. I've had better results with YouTube videos in the past though; unfortunately a shiny Spotify preview 30 sec clip will not count as a stream.**

.

**Submithub:**

While the authors claim to be taking playlist curators seriously and having quality control, this is simply not  true. I've seen banned Spotify playlists that, even a week later, still remained on Submithub &amp; people sending +20 daily premium submissions. (Ie, someone makes money to listen to music and their fake bot playlist doesn't even exist anymore...) If you look at these curators including ""really good bloggers"" as they call them, some have an FB account with +100k likes but almost no likes or interaction on posts. I'd say too many of curators on submithub are shady in the sense that it's not useful to you as an artist to get reposted to bot playlist &amp; some random ""big"" influencer that has a bunch of fake likes/streams or they brag with a +1 million subs youtube channel, but there's only famous artists on there (you won't get reposted there). Or a big Spotify playlist but you'll never end up on the good ones, just their ""dumpster"" playlist for reposts from Submithub so their stats will look good &amp; they can keep making money by ""listening"" to people's music.

.

**TL:DR:** **While the above sounded very negative, Submithub is decent if you do your research. Just be aware that it takes a LOT of time and effort to find out the good curators (don't be fooled by shiny stats; you have to dig deep). After you use the service, I recommend creating a list of curators were your sort out good ones and also a blacklist (yes, a blacklist). You do NOT want to end up on fake playlists; make sure to post to curators with a high premium following on Spotify.**

.

**Playlist Push:**

I was sceptical because of the combo of lack of settings when you submit a song &amp; the price you pay, everything is pretty much automated. What happens now? I like to have more control. Well, I was  pleased to find that all curators you get posted to write (often quite extensive) reviews of your song that clearly show they've listened to the song (regardless if they accept/reject). I also saw a curator that got banned during my campaign because he didn't live up to the quality standards, so that was a nice touch, they seemingly work actively to maintain serious curators. I got several reposts from here to big playlists with +100k followers and most of them seem to be the real deal (even though you'll likely end up far down in the playlists themselves, just the big artists at the top; altough I did end up on 9th place on a very big playlist among world-famous artists, woohoo!)

.

**TL:DR: Overall, I'm impressed with the Playlist Push experience and this will likely be my go-to promotion service for upcoming songs. Hopefully they will introduce more filters in the future, but you will get REAL curators and playlists to look at your song; they work activly to sort out the BS. (And no, I don't work for them).**

I would like to get in contact with them directly than go through the many charging services that are out there that promise to get your music on playlists.   


I used one recently called SpotiMatch which has had a name change to Matchify. I did a test using their service and my curated playlist on SpotiMatch. I sent myself a request from SpotiMAtch to be added to my playlist and I never received any notification from SpotiMatch to say that there was a request to have new music on my playlist.  


I tried SubmitHub and I have not been successful also.   


What I am looking for is to directly market my music to curators that I belive have awesome playlists. I don't want to use the mass marketing technique.

Reddit feedback seems like people copy and paste “wow! So cool!” just to get people to look at their stuff or get a score on some of the subs that require it.

Submithub so far has been so not genuine. I paid for premium credits and said feedback is important. How is “too repetitive” good feedback when they’ve only listened to 34 seconds?  Can I note that song only repeats the first chord progression once (one in beginning one in end)! All of the feedback there has been total garbage and uninformative, I don’t think I will try it again unless something valuable comes my way telling me how to make the track better.

Does anyone know where I can get real feedback from people who will actually listen to music? I want real feedback from real people who use real instruments.

My name is Rob, I run the blog Pastel Wasteland with a good friend of mine, and I recently joined Submithub around a month ago. From my perspective, it has been a godsend in terms of being able to get organised and finally offer an alternative to an inbox full of unpersonalized press releases.

On our blog, we like to promote music that is often a bit more left of field, unique or interesting in some way. We do cover pop, EDM etc, but I'm always holding out for something batshit crazy that demands my attention.

My question is this. What sort of feedback is the most helpful to you guys? I'm not someone who enjoys going on winding rants, using words that sound like they've come from a b-movie vhs blurb. I prefer to be technical where possible, explaining what didn't fit in with our tastes, and my feedback is also usually around 100 words compared to the 10 minimum. I think we are doing quite a good job with the feedback, our ratings definitely point in that direction, I'd just love to hear what sort of things would really help in terms of feedback.

Also just as a final note- keep up the hard work! I've worked in the industry on the bottom rungs of an indie label and more recently as a music video director, and I understand the crushing feeling of a rejection and the hopeless feeling when you can't pinpoint what didn't work.

The first time seemed okay. I got on three playlists all made by the user ""Uber Playlist"" which returned 3.3k stream from around 3k listeners. Not a great invest meant for $60-$90.

I'm currently doing the second campaign and was added again to 1 of the 3 playlists ""Popular Tik Tok Music"" which has 21k followers. This time around, the playlist has literally returned zero engagement and it's has been on the playlist for four days now. I don't know if it's because of COVID, but I doubt a Spotify playlist with 21k followers is gonna return 0 listeners and 0 streams in four days.

All in all, be wary when paying for playlist promotions. Nobody is really a gatekeeper to getting on really popular playlists. You have to build those connections by finding great curators and reaching out to them. The best way promotion I've used is Submithub, where I have a 14% acceptance rate. I've submitted to 114 playlist curators, blog and labels and have been approved 16 times. The results from Submithub are a little sketchy at times but its all really trial and error until you find outlets to submit to that match your music style.

g2uvkq,1587097358.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,pb4uplay,Why I Love Submithub,"Hey guys!

I see a lot of Submithub hate going on around here but I just wanted to share my experience because it has developed over the past year or two and I think that this service sometimes needs a second chance.

For a little background, I've run 3 song through SH, and each one to a growing amount of success. my acceptance rate has grown from about 5%-15% over these releases and I have been able to garner attention from larger and larger outlets.

Here are my key points and reasons why I think it really is worth it:

1) Submithub literally does the job of a promoter.  Although some people may not get any bites at all, at the end of the day all a promoter does is put your song in front of some ears, the rest is up to your sound.  For the money I think it's worth it.  I have seen my monthly Spotify numbers swell from 50-1000+ in the past year and the only promo I do is Submithub and some instagram targeted ads.

2) The feedback is legit helpful! My first two songs, I would always get the my hooks weren't satisfying enough, and I started to change my songwriting... My latest release has reflected this change and is a much bigger hit among tastemakers so far (two weeks away from release)

3) Some bloggers have declined my song yet still reached out to me and given me tips and advice which is helpful!

4) and last but not least... HOT OR NOT.  I love this feature and it has be SO helpful for me to gauge songs, but also is believe it or not a great way to meet people, and being on the charts there got me attention from blogs I DIDN'T SUBMIT TO (namely, Dummy Mag, a hype machine blog) put me on a playlist with 2k+ followers and plugged on all their social media with my handles!).  Not to mention you can earn free credits now!

So what do y'all think?

I don't know about you but I can't find a more legit or better way to promote and I am incredibly happy to spend 100$ here every release... I now have 1-4K listens on every song from people all over the world, when submithub was essentially my only promo.",19,,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/g2uvkq/why_i_love_submithub/,Why I Love Submithub,why i love submithub,"Hey guys!

g1qfku,1586951390.0,independentmusic,dilzx,Getting more streams,"I've been preparing for my first release for a few months and have been doing a lot of research on music promotion and thought I'd share my knowledge, im no expert but I'd like to think it would help at least someone. Feel free to reply with further tips.

- I am going to start off with one of the least talked about forms of music promotion which is sharing your music with fellow musicians. There is no community quite like our own. All musicians would want to help each other out as we understand the struggle and there is often a mutual benefit to sharing each others music. If I share your music to all my fans and you share my music, there is more to gain than to lose and there is no shame in doing this. If I presave your song and you presave mine we both win!

- Spotify playlist placement: Everyone looks at this and thinks this would be amazing if a spotify curator picks their song and puts it on a playlist. You'd garner a load of streams through this. How do we get on their radar? Firstly, to be eligible, you need submit your song through spotify for artists. To do this you need to claim your artist profile and submit on the site. Secondly, CUSTOMISE your artist profile. Add a profile and banner picture, write a bio, share your live show dates, share your playlist. Sharing pictures from your instagram gallery such as pictures of you performing really looks good to curators. This all shows spotify that you are actively trying to connect with your auedience and care about how you represent yourself. Thirdly, PRESAVES, having presaves and preorders really help sell your song. It shows spotify that there is an auedience anticipating your release and shows them you're worth giving a chance to. Finally be aware that ALBUM ART COUNTS TOO! If your artwork doesn't look professional they will not push your song! The artwork is key. On some devices such as on phones apple music/deezer/spotify apps show the artwork as the main part of your screen whilst you stream the song. If the artwork is a fuzzy photo of you from your webcam or phone it won't seem marketable to them regardless of how your song sounds.

- Play the algorithm correctly: Spotify have an automated algorithm which helps push your songs. You need to understand how this works in order to make use of it. There are automated playlists such as discover weekly and release radar which you have a better chance of getting on than a curated playlist. In order to get the algorithm to pick your song for a playlist you need to have good stats. Im not talkig about a high volume of streams but instead a good play to save ratio (I dont actually know what its called) but lets say 10% of your streamers save your song to their library. This would boost your chance in the algorithm pushing your song. Moreover, having your listeners adding your songs to their playlist also helps and the algorithm will recognise this too.

- Independent curators: Instead of expecting a spotify playlist placement you are probably better off submitting to user created playlists. This can not only help you increase your streams, this can also help get your track be pushed on algorithm created playlists. I've seen people try and track down users with spotify playlists as not all of them have their socials showcased. BUT I think it is a little weird searching for someones contact details when they havent shared it just to get on their playlist. Instead try and contact users who actually present themselves. A good site to use is submithub, its free and can land you on some decent playlists.

- Youtube: There are tonnes of youtube channels that allow you to submit music to them. Often, these channels are genre based so you can easily reach your target auedience. It's easier to go for smaller channels. Because the channels are genre based, you are likely to get listeners then search for your song and save them and/or add you to their playlists. Try and go for smaller channels for a better chance at being showcased. NOTE: They are going to want to monetise the video so I advise you to be aware of this and not complain when they dont send any money your way. AND watch out for if you use a service that automatically copyright strikes your music when used by others

- Try for music blogs: This seems a little unconventional in this day and age but they can definetely help. There are tonnes of music blogs with a great following which can definetely help you reach  a new auedience. 

- Submithub, there are plenty of similar sites that allow you to submit your songs to bloggers, influencers, playlist curators, radios, record labels etc.

- Don't be afraid to go for niche playlists: For example, there are playlists such as cultural based playlists specifically for certain cultures. You can get on these spotify playlists by just stating your cultural heritage such as being christian, south asian, african etc. There are also instrument based playlists, if someone wants to listen to a djembe and your song has the djembe in it you can try and get on this playlist. 

- Hashtags, will help your social media reach new people with similar interests. Easy to do too but wont increase streams by a lot if I am being honest, but if you can gain a few fans through this they can then share the song on their pages! 

- Soundcloud: There may be a sort of taboo associated with the term ""soundcloud rapper"" and therefore regardless of the genre of your song you may feel like you dont want to promote on soundcloud. But this is important as around 50% of soundcloud users are fellow musicians so it is a really great way to network and reach other people in the industry. The power of a repost can go a long eay.

Please note that the end of the day your song has to have a certain quality to be able to be marketed so please be aware of this. Recording a song off your phone mic or a vocal that hasnt been mixed well could already cap your streams even before your release. Make sure you pitch to the right people too!

- Warnings: Dont pay to be on a spotify playlist. Spotify dont allow for this and dont pay for streams too. 

Hope this helps

g0qk07,1586808441.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,tiddyboi96,musicmakers101 - a random website that made an account without my permission using my information. possible scam?,"not sure if this a proper place to post this but with a huge group of musicians here i decided to give it a shot.

So I got a weird email my email was used to create an account on Musicmakers101. A website I've never heard of before. I quickly gained access to the account to check it out. It was indeed my email, my artist name, My picture, my email, and apparently already had/attempted to add my paypal as payment information. The profile looked super generic with a "" Check out some of my music!"" as bio. I quickly tried to cancel the account, which took weirdly multiple tries but I got it down. Then i decided to investigate the website and i found a latest artists section, where i saw a new artist was added every minute for the last couple of hours, all with the same bio "" Check out some of my music! ""

I have no idea how this happened and who's doing this,but it seems like someones making fake accounts of real artists on this website. for what reason though? I also cannot figure out where they would find all these artist.

fw3buq,1586195339.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,ibekez,Do you guys know of any legit music promotion service? I used these platforms to get heard.,"Heyo. I'm currently looking for ways to promote my music, since I got sick of getting 1 play per week if I was lucky. :D  


I'll share with you what I've found.  


I've checked basically every service, from Fiverr gigs to SoundCloud repost networks (I wouldn't recommend the latter, based on my own experience). Platforms like:  
[SubmitHub](https://www.submithub.com/) (which sometimes does some good, but usually is a waste of Premium credits if you ever end up buying them. Best feedback rejection I got is ""needed an intro""). It also landed me my first label release so, all is...balanced...in the world.  
   
[Hypeddit](https://hypeddit.com/) \-- this is probably one the best ([see results](https://prnt.sc/ru7jyq)). Fans can download through a gate, and other users of the platform can repost your music to earn points and vice versa.  
[Repost Exchange](https://repostexchange.com/hi?r=EGPWX) \-- this is also great, though Campaigns can get buried. I'd suggest sending repost requests to users, especially ones with good response rates (in green). Reposts must last for 48 h or you'll get flagged for un-reposting.  
[SCPlanner](https://scplanner.net/) \-- this can be great too. You can trade reposts with larger channels and networks. Filter by 0 and you'll see large networks that'll pick up your song in return. Reposts usually last 24 h but can be customized.

[Thematic](http://hellothematic.com/artists/) gets you in touch with YouTubers who need music for their videos. I just signed up for it and my song is pending so I don't know too much about it. Maybe someone knows of a better alternative?  


Of course, I've also collected a small email list of about 400 blogs, YouTube channels, and other curators, and have sent to them. Be wary of doing large email blasts from your personal email account, as they will only land in the recipient's spam folder (learned from personal exp :D). I used Sendinblue for this but other musicians recommend MailChimp too. [Sendinblue vs. MailChimp](https://www.sendinblue.com/mailchimp/).  


That's about all I've done/learned in the past 2 weeks. I will update this if I find something new.  


Please feel free to share other useful resources for getting heard.

Hope everyone is safe and well!

I'm  currently in the process of starting a  collective/label/management/creative outlet company, or just a 'thing'  at the moment. I'm sure there are some other people in this subreddit  too in this position so I hope this post can be of some use...

So far the tracks released have had a really great response on  SoundCloud with people commenting, liking, following, recomending etc. I have started an Instagram account and in the process of creating a YouTube channel too.   


However, I've also been using SubmitHub in an attempt to get the songs out there  but unfortuantely nothing seems to be sticking. It seems trying to get the tracks on blogs etc is quite difficult process to get past the gatekeepers. With the way the market  it is going, it's a sad realtiy that the 'SoundCloud' glory days seem as most people now flock to Spotify and Apple Music to find new music (myself included) However, from a label/collective standpoint, it seems these platforms are a lot more political in terms of playlist sitting, recomendations and getting music on them unless I have misunderstood.

I think  what Bandcamp stands for is great. Again, and I guess this is what the  whole post is about, even on a platform like that - what's the best way  to get your music out there in a way that builds a following and some  traction? Not only that, how do you also go about finding new artists  and talent too? What are some good sites and ways of finding new  artists? I'm very much a 20 something yr old and a laptop atm and there's no scene whatsoever where I live...

I don’t know why I waste my time on this website. I guess it’s because I don’t know where else to go.

fgu2bx,1583916359.0,edmproduction,frankiesmusic,Back to the music but discouraged," 

Hello  everyone i've produced edm music from 2002 till 2014 than i had to  stop, and now i'm back craving to do good music, and after 6 years i  have a lot of ideas and that's a bless.

The  issue are the label, they do not even listen your demo, that's feels  absourd i mean i understand they will receive a lot of demo, and i  understand bigger label do not really care about demos because they  already have the material and artists they need, but it also appear that  medium label do not listen it, and release with small label is just  like to upload yourself on socials so imho is not worth it.

I've  readed a lot of ""how to send demo"" and things like that, even if i  never needed in the past i've already released a ton of music, but in 6  years the world is changed completly, seems socials numbers are more  important than music quality, i understand labels are business company  and it worth more to invest on well known man instead of someone who  have just few followers, and i don't wanna open a moral topic about  that, but this is kind of frustrating, i'm a music producer not a  ""socialmediaman"" i've made some profile but they are new, i'm not a  spammer and i don't wanna be, so numbers are ridicoulus.

Since  i believe my music worth it, and what i'm doing right now is even  better in what i've done in the past i'm considering to use a  distributor like distrokids (if you have other suggestions feel free to  share) and release it myself, but we are again, i'm no one so if i'll  release just now no one will notice my song, i've read about submithub  and i still did not understood if is a scam or legit, but after this i  don't really know how to promote myself, since as i understood the goal  is to have engaged followers on socials and spotify.

I'm  discouraged because what i really want is make music and let people to  listen it, if it was possible i whould do it for free i don't really  care about making money or became famous i'm not a dj and i have a job,  but as an artist i wanna share my feelings and my vibes with music to  most people possible, but right now seems impossible",8,,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/fgu2bx/back_to_the_music_but_discouraged/,Back to the music but discouraged,back to the music but discouraged,"  Hello  everyone i've produced edm music from 2002 till 2014 than i had to  stop, and now i'm back craving to do good music, and after 6 years i  have a lot of ideas and that's a bless.

My question is, how does this work in terms of allowing other blogs to review the song as well? I understand that the whole point of a premiere is for that one particular blog to be the go-to source for people to hear it for the first time, but how does this affect a musician's ability to keep promoting it to other blogs? I also heard back from a different blog who wants to share it (not premiere). And is it acceptable to specify to the blog doing the premiere that you would like them to use the Spotify link in the article instead of the secret Soundcloud link that you originally provided them with (since I'm trying to grow on Spotify and not focusing as much on Soundcloud)? I would also obviously be posting my Spotify/Bandcamp/Apple Music/whatever links on my social media on the day of release... Surely a blog wouldn't be offended by that or see it as stepping on their toes in terms of driving people to their page for the premiere?

2. They get too many horrible submissions, meaning hitting the decline button becomes a subconscious decision before they even get a chance to listen. 

3. You’re only using submit hub because you’re lazy. You can compile a much more effective list of Spotify playlist on your own.

4. My genre is Contemporary R&amp;B. When I search for playlist in contemporary R&amp;B, all I see is, “This curator has approved 12000 songs and 10 of them are R&amp;B”. If this is a not a big red flag then I don’t know what is.

I was recently invited by Home Of Sound to talk on their podcast about life as a playlist curator.

We spoke quite a bit about playlist organisation, using platforms such as SubmitHub for submissions, using platforms such as Reddit to share playlists and how people should approach one another on the web.

As some of you likely use playlist submissions as part of your marketing strategy for new music, I figured some of you may find this podcast of interest.

ewmkex,1580466729.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,Megalmodas,The do's and dont's of Submithub (according to me ;),"Hey guys,

just thought I share that with you as it might help you a bit with your submithub submissions.

I can give you two perspectives here as I'm a musician / artist (check out ""Megalmodas"" on the various platforms if your interested), and also have a small outlet on Submithub, Radio Dark Tunnel (Shellshocked Radio).

So I can look at the thing from two different sides, at least in my small, limited perspective.

As an artist, I basically see two ways you can use Submithub. If you do not want to spent any money, you can use the 2 free credits and basically throw your stuff on the wall and see what might stick.

I do this actually quite regulary, as these credits are free, and even had some mild success with it.

The biggest one so far has been being played in a radio station in Mexico and making it on a 7k Spotify playlist.

Also, if you have access to your Spotify Artist page, which you definetly should have, you see some streams from the outlets you have submitted your music to from all over the world (if you use the Spotify link on Submithub). So thats a few extra streams as well.

As for the paid (premium) credits, there has been a lengthly article written by another person here, which pointed out how much he researched all the outlets and such, I unfortunately forgot to save it, but basically he very detailed described the metrics and methods he used to research the outlets he wanted to target. Try to find it, it is very good written and helpful!

And I just can confirm that, as I, on the receiving end (Radio Dark Tunnel ) get quite annoyed by music which is completely wrong for my outlet. Your basically throwing away your money here, so please do not do that. I had 4 people blacklisted so far, which were pestering me with really bad (for my subjective taste of course) music. 

Here I can only talk for myself of course, but I wan't to find new music I enjoy listening to, so sending me crap over and over again, even though I have told you not to do that, I'm not gonna waste my time on you anymore.

Here I can also clear up some misconception. I'm not doing that for getting rich. I have a very narrow roster of genres (Gothic, Darkwave and Industrial) and earn about 20 dollars a month, with my outlet.

If you calculate the time I spent on this (listening, curating playlists, producing the radio show, archiving, communication with the artists) I think I make about 1 to 2 dollars per hour, and trust me, I have a family, hobbies and a full time job. This I do just for fun.

I personally also make no real difference between a premium submission or a free one, I will listen to both attentivly.

The greatest thing I get out of this is that it makes me able to connect with artists world wide, this is awesome! That's why I do it, and I truly love to discover new music.

As for premium credits, if you use them, I would advise you to take the ""90 seconds"" play option.

Most of the songs I receive are well done and crafted, and the artist put weeks or even month in its creation. So I'm unsure of what constructive feedback I should give to the artist after he / she laboured so long on it. I do not think someone would change a bassline, because I say that I do not like it.

So this a bit silly in my eyes. When I have to give feeback, I tell you what I like and what I don't, but what real worth does it bring to an artist to get feedback from a random stranger as me?

For a song which has been polished for months? Would you really change anything on it?

Especially with my channel, where I do clearly not care about what is en vogue at the moment. Either I like it or I don't ... ;)

What clearly improves your chances of getting picked by me or getting at least two listens is, if you show me in your statement, that you deliberately handpicked my channel and have familiarized yourself with the style and genres I'm looking for.

One band offered to wash my car (I do not own one ...) when I would approve their song. I found that very funny and approved their song. Don't get me wrong, I'm not telling you to bribe the outlets you try to get into, just telling you to be creative and funny if you can muster that.

Try to find a common ground / relationship with the outlet / person you sending your stuff to.

Most of the outlets receive tons of submissions, here you can stand out a bit.

Another thing, and this is once again just me of course, some nice Cover artwork will definetly catch my eye.

Sometimes I receive photoshopped cell phone pictures a seemingly 5 year old artist had thrown together ... unbelievable ... yes, creative freedom and all that, but just think about it if you would approach a major label with that cover, and then do a reality check, just trying to help here.

Okay, I wanted to say a few more things, but this post is already that long, and I don't really know if someone likes to read all of this, so I'm gonna stop now.

If you have any questions, just post them, I'll answer them as good as I can.

Hopefully some of you might find my rambelings useful.

All the best!","hey guys, just thought i share that with you as it might help you a bit with your submithub submissions. i can give you two perspectives here as i'm a musician / artist (check out ""megalmodas"" on the various platforms if your interested), and also have a small outlet on submithub, radio dark tunnel (shellshocked radio). so i can look at the thing from two different sides, at least in my small, limited perspective. as an artist, i basically see two ways you can use submithub. if you do not want to spent any money, you can use the 2 free credits and basically throw your stuff on the wall and see what might stick. i do this actually quite regulary, as these credits are free, and even had some mild success with it. the biggest one so far has been being played in a radio station in mexico and making it on a 7k spotify playlist. also, if you have access to your spotify artist page, which you definetly should have, you see some streams from the outlets you have submitted your music to from all over the world (if you use the spotify link on submithub). so thats a few extra streams as well. as for the paid (premium) credits, there has been a lengthly article written by another person here, which pointed out how much he researched all the outlets and such, i unfortunately forgot to save it, but basically he very detailed described the metrics and methods he used to research the outlets he wanted to target. try to find it, it is very good written and helpful! and i just can confirm that, as i, on the receiving end (radio dark tunnel ) get quite annoyed by music which is completely wrong for my outlet. your basically throwing away your money here, so please do not do that. i had 4 people blacklisted so far, which were pestering me with really bad (for my subjective taste of course) music.  here i can only talk for myself of course, but i wan't to find new music i enjoy listening to, so sending me crap over and over again, even though i have told you not to do that, i'm not gonna waste my time on you anymore. here i can also clear up some misconception. i'm not doing that for getting rich. i have a very narrow roster of genres (gothic, darkwave and industrial) and earn about 20 dollars a month, with my outlet. if you calculate the time i spent on this (listening, curating playlists, producing the radio show, archiving, communication with the artists) i think i make about 1 to 2 dollars per hour, and trust me, i have a family, hobbies and a full time job. this i do just for fun. i personally also make no real difference between a premium submission or a free one, i will listen to both attentivly. the greatest thing i get out of this is that it makes me able to connect with artists world wide, this is awesome! that's why i do it, and i truly love to discover new music. as for premium credits, if you use them, i would advise you to take the ""90 seconds"" play option. most of the songs i receive are well done and crafted, and the artist put weeks or even month in its creation. so i'm unsure of what constructive feedback i should give to the artist after he / she laboured so long on it. i do not think someone would change a bassline, because i say that i do not like it. so this a bit silly in my eyes. when i have to give feeback, i tell you what i like and what i don't, but what real worth does it bring to an artist to get feedback from a random stranger as me? for a song which has been polished for months? would you really change anything on it? especially with my channel, where i do clearly not care about what is en vogue at the moment. either i like it or i don't ... ;) what clearly improves your chances of getting picked by me or getting at least two listens is, if you show me in your statement, that you deliberately handpicked my channel and have familiarized yourself with the style and genres i'm looking for. one band offered to wash my car (i do not own one ...) when i would approve their song. i found that very funny and approved their song. don't get me wrong, i'm not telling you to bribe the outlets you try to get into, just telling you to be creative and funny if you can muster that. try to find a common ground / relationship with the outlet / person you sending your stuff to. most of the outlets receive tons of submissions, here you can stand out a bit. another thing, and this is once again just me of course, some nice cover artwork will definetly catch my eye. sometimes i receive photoshopped cell phone pictures a seemingly 5 year old artist had thrown together ... unbelievable ... yes, creative freedom and all that, but just think about it if you would approach a major label with that cover, and then do a reality check, just trying to help here. okay, i wanted to say a few more things, but this post is already that long, and i don't really know if someone likes to read all of this, so i'm gonna stop now. if you have any questions, just post them, i'll answer them as good as i can. hopefully some of you might find my rambelings useful. all the best!",10,959

Hello music makers, I'm in an indie rock band based in Melbourne, Australia. We make alternative rock music mostly with 90s vibe, and have a release coming up in a month which is a bit more commercial rock. Looking at places to get it out there, and have contacted a few PR places who came back with $3500 as a price to do the promo for us. Thats a bit of a stretch for us money wise, so trying to do it all ourselves.

We've done the submithub route, which we've gotten good coverage on, but it hasn't really translated to a fan base. A few playlists put us on Spotify, and its all well and good but its not really translating. We're gigging a fair bit, but again, its not really translating to fan base.

So I've just released a new track as part of my ambient project. I normally use Submithub and use the premium credits; I've had a good response rate (about 20 submissions and 6/7 accepted), managed to get on some biggish playlists, around 3k, or 4k followers.

But! They ask for a huge access into your spotify? This feels very uncomfortable to me. But its asking for:

* Create, edit, and follow playlists

I have finished a melodic trap beat that has some Lofi influences to it. I'm looking for a singer or rapper that can sing in a melodic autotuned rap style e.g. Juicewrld/Post Malone/Yung Lean/Lil Skies. The beat is totally finished but what its missing is a great vocal with some wavy lyrics.

Luckily, he was and after exchanging Instagram handles, we started to talk about the game we were on and we might be working together soon.

Another one was when I got too excited about making beat packs and ended up saying on the discord that I might get a placement with NBA YoungBoy (I was only making a pack).

Another producer got talking to me about producing and placements and he invited me to another Discord called Young Gods (a kit-selling website like WavSupply but more indie)

This was back in May and since then, I have joined their family of producers and have some sample kits being worked on.

Tips for Networking:

* Make sure to take every opportunity you can to know people, even if it's through gaming or here. I got one of my first rappers through the comments of a MHH thread.

* Don't just start off with ""Check out my post/song"". Let it be natural and start talking about something that both parties are interested in.

* Sometimes, you can use your heritage for networking as that is something that they could both relate to.

I actually met an indie artist (not hip-hop though) through SubmitHub's chat and successfully networked based on the fact that both of us were Scottish and he now wants me to remix one of his upcoming songs.

e10jum,1574612562.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,webren,Finally Got Accepted on SubmitHub - My Strategy,"Hi everyone, I see a lot of posts around SubmitHub and the frustration with trying to get an acceptance. After submitting a handful of times over the past few months, I finally got some acceptances. I wanted to share my strategy in case it can be helpful for you all.

**Previous Approach** I submitted previous singles on SubmitHub taking a bit of a shotgun approach, thinking it was a numbers game. ""If I submit this song to these 30 bloggers, one of them has to say yes"". That's unfortunately not true and it's the approach I took the first few submissions. What's needed is to take the time to curate a list of bloggers who 1) have accepted a lot songs of your genre and 2) have a decent acceptance rate.

**New Strategy** In support of my upcoming album release, I decided to try this strategy: 

* Filter out ""Really Good Bloggers"" from my search criteria. These bloggers are super picky because a lot of them write a review or detailed thoughts for every song post. So the acceptance rate is very low.
* Filter bloggers that accepted at least 100 songs in the genre of the song I was submitting (in this case, Synthwave). This metric was at the bottom of every blogger info summary. If a blogger accepted more than 100 Synthwave songs, that signaled to me that they were a fan of the genre and I'd have higher chances.
* Filter bloggers that have a reasonable acceptance rate. I chose above 20% as a starting benchmark.
* Once I found a blogger that I thought could be a good fit for the submission, I went and listened to the last 5 songs they posted to ensure that they've been recently approving similar songs to mine. This is key because bloggers will go through different musical moods and may be in the mood for something different. For ex, there was one blogger who normally posted Synthwave, but their last 5 posts were House and they explicitly wrote about how they've been on a House kick. For that blogger, it's best not to submit now given they're in a House mood as my music doesn't fit that genre.
* Use premium credits only - shows you're serious and bloggers will be more thoughtful.
* I recommend selecting the no feedback option and choose the 90 second listening option. You want the blogger to listen to as much of the song as possible, and by the time you're submitting, your song should be ready for commercial release anyway. 
* Write a blurb in the submission about how you'll market the song or release yourself. Bloggers want traffic, so take time to mention about how you'll be playing the song live, will post the blog post on your web presence, etc.

**Results** For this song submission, my song got picked up by 2 blogs and was added to 2 Spotify playlists, with a total of 4 acceptances out of 10 submissions. The acceptance rate range across the 4 was between 30-60%. So these guys don't accept just anyone, but they were flexible and open enough that I thought I had a shot. After the posts, I've received a significant increase in streams across many platforms, so the time spent plugging away was worth it.

e0z2s0,1574605313.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,VallasC,A Few Words On First Releases And Becoming An Artist,"Hey all,

At the end of 2017 I did my first musical project with an artist I had met at a local coffee shop. I was only 17 at the time, and he was mid 20s and had been doing music for his whole life. One session turned into 2, 3, and shortly by the next year, 100. I had never really known if music was something I wanted to do, I was definitely interested in it but never really thought it was something I could do. He did most of the chords, he sang the tracks, I really just did drum and bass (midi, I can't play any instruments), and I wrote the lyrics. 

After the first song was released, I grew hungrier and hungrier for more of that musical satisfaction. I wrote the song but I didn't sing it and it wasn't a genre I'd ever listen to, so I wanted more control. Six months later we've got a band, we're playing the biggest venues in town, and we're making music that I'm not only writing but actually like listening to.

All this came from him desperately asking me to have more involvement and stick to what I was doing. He's an awesome artist himself but he wanted to push me, as I'm just a kid with really no experience. As time went on though, I noticed that most of the band really didn't want it as much as I did. There was this weird casual-ness to everyones personality. They were all musicians playing since they were born, but they only wanted to gig once every two months (despite us being able to be booked weekly), and no-one was making anything anymore. We ended up playing the hottest spot in town, got a bunch of publicity, and they pretty much decided we'd disband. I was really heartbroken. I went from 0 - Hero in what felt like a year in a half. I didn't even want to do music before I met those guys, and I worked my way up from producer and songwriter to lead singer. Now it's all gone?

Last Friday I put out my very first solo release. The original idea came from a scratch I made around the time I met the guys, and I finally transformed it into something I thought was totally me, an R&amp;B Pop track. I used submithub and reddit mostly for marketing, and within 7 days I got around 2,000 plays on Spotify! This totally eclipsed anything I've done with my band, and seeing that I could do it all myself with the drive and passion I found just a few years ago really continues to inspire me everyday.

I'm not sure if this kind of post is okay here, I just wanted to share some words from a kid who just really started :) I'm inspired by you guys everyday and have been lurking here for years.

I had never really known if music was something I wanted to do, I was definitely interested in it but never really thought it was something I could do. He did most of the chords, he sang the tracks, I really just did drum and bass (midi, I can't play any instruments), and I wrote the lyrics.  After the first song was released, I grew hungrier and hungrier for more of that musical satisfaction. I wrote the song but I didn't sing it and it wasn't a genre I'd ever listen to, so I wanted more control. Six months later we've got a band, we're playing the biggest venues in town, and we're making music that I'm not only writing but actually like listening to. All this came from him desperately asking me to have more involvement and stick to what I was doing. He's an awesome artist himself but he wanted to push me, as I'm just a kid with really no experience. As time went on though, I noticed that most of the band really didn't want it as much as I did. There was this weird casual-ness to everyones personality. They were all musicians playing since they were born, but they only wanted to gig once every two months (despite us being able to be booked weekly), and no-one was making anything anymore. We ended up playing the hottest spot in town, got a bunch of publicity, and they pretty much decided we'd disband. I was really heartbroken. I went from 0 - Hero in what felt like a year in a half. I didn't even want to do music before I met those guys, and I worked my way up from producer and songwriter to lead singer. Now it's all gone? Last Friday I put out my very first solo release. The original idea came from a scratch I made around the time I met the guys, and I finally transformed it into something I thought was totally me, an R&B Pop track. I used submithub and reddit mostly for marketing, and within 7 days I got around 2,000 plays on Spotify! This totally eclipsed anything I've done with my band, and seeing that I could do it all myself with the drive and passion I found just a few years ago really continues to inspire me everyday. I'm not sure if this kind of post is okay here, I just wanted to share some words from a kid who just really started ) I'm inspired by you guys everyday and have been lurking here for years.

We are an independent band and have been contacting lots of bookers, blogs and PR within the industry, specific to the genres of Hip Hop or Alternative Rock. Using services like submithub, humanhuman &amp; also networking and grinding emails.

We pride ourselves on sitting somewhere between Hip Hop, Rock, Jazz &amp; Pop, also taking a punk/DIY approach to what we do, something we feel Hip Hop has always been anyway.

Do y'all have any tips for promoting yourself online?

I know using social media is a big factor. I often use Twitter and Instagram. But my dilema is that I don't post enough.

I don't go out much. SO there's not much to post on my IG. And I'm pretty sure people don't wanna see the same photos of my work station. I know that photos with people get a lot of interactions. But I want people to know me for my music, ya know. Not for my face or whatever.

As for Twitter, that's just another story. I've been told (and I've seen for myself) that Twitter only works if you're famous. There have been times when I tweeted all the time. And no one would pay attention to my stuff.

**Do you guys have any tips?** How to get interaction on social media platforms. Also, when promoting music, what are some good websites and stuff.

I would love some advice on our music and how to proceed with reaching out to people.

We are an independent band and have been contacting lots of bookers, blogs and PR within the industry, specific to the genres of Hip Hop or Alternative/Psych Rock. Using services like submithub, humanhuman &amp; also networking and grinding emails. Nearly everyone has responded by telling us we are ""too Hip Hop, try somewhere more suited for Hip Hop"" or we are ""too rock/alternative, try somewhere more suited for bands with guitars""

We pride ourselves on sitting somewhere between Hip Hop, Rock, Acid Jazz &amp; Pop, also taking a punk/DIY approach to what we do, something we feel geetar music has always been anyway.

My question is do you feel the same as the industry people we have reached out to so far? Do you know any similar artists to us? Do you feel there is space for us in the Psych Rock sonisphere?

a day ago I switched sites and are now as a Radio Show host on Submithub and I love it. 

There is so much great music out there, I feel overwhelmed by the sheer mass of submissions I get and I love most of it (half of it, if I read my statistics correctly ;)

I will need to pause the submissions a couple of times, as I really wanna listen to the songs, and best case scenario say something about them. 

But now I can understand that this is impossible, to treat all submissions equaly, as you get a ton in a sec.

So please do not feel discouraged when you submit something in Submithub, now I know as a fact that it happens that your not in the ""right mood"" or something like this, for a particular song and then just say ""no"" I try to save them for later, and listen to them again in a different state of mind ... but did I mentioned there is tons of music out there, so I do not really know when to do that ...

I try my best to be fair, but it will not always be so ... 

If you want to submit some music in as well, please send it via Submithub or send me a dm.

I will list all music I get and where I find a Spotify link in my Spotify Playlist: ""Shellshocked Radio - Discovery"", so if wanna help out with the reach there, please follow it and send it around in your social media. The list will grow a lot over the next few months, thats for sure.

And lastly I want to say thank you to Reddit. I've heard of Reddit years ago, but never joined ... until a month ago. 

In the one month I've learned more then in the last 5 years ... I've found submithub, I found a cool and oh so talented guitar player for my band here, and all of you and your insights, comments, help and tipps. I wished I would have joined much sooner.

So I'm about to release a new track in two weeks, and I'm wondering what are the best ways to promote the track? I've tried Facebook Ads and YouTube ads in the past and that gets a decent amount of views on YouTube, but it doesn't translate over to listeners or fans on digital streaming services.

Are there any methods you guys have tried to get more listeners on Spotify/Apple Music, etc, that have worked?  I considered trying Playlist Push, MusoSoup, and trying SubmitHub again (though it's never really worked for me in the past) but not sure if these were seen as 'scammy'. Context wise, my music would fall into pop/dance-pop category.

I'm about 2-3 months away from releasing my album, and I've been releasing singles on Spotify to help gather some buzz about the release. So far my fan base is friends and family, so my monthly listeners is minimal. I've been doing a lot of reading and trying to figure out how artists start and create fans and listens for their first release. Everything I read points to 1) keep submitting each single to Spotify playlist editors and cross your fingers 2) use a service like Playlist Push or Submithub to send your songs to playlist curators and bloggers and cross your fingers or 3) grind it out by personally emailing bloggers and playlist curators (if you can find them) to let them know about the release and see if they like what they hear.

1) is easy and I'm leaning toward 3) long-term given the things I've read regarding the very little ROI musicians get from the services like Playlist Push/Submithub. Is the best way really starting a marketing campaign 1-2 months before the release and start cold emailing and ramp up marketing through IG, Facebook, and beg friends to add me to their Spotify playlist (I read Spotify has algorithms that will add your song to their playlists if your song is popular across user playlists)?

What was your approach? Imagining releasing an album that I've worked hard on for 9 months to the Spotify ether with no listeners is quite sad, so I'd like to figure this out.

first of, I've learned a lot since I've joined here, and I'm grateful for all the advice.

I make music now for almost 30 years and slowly get the hang of it how to deal with Spotify and such ...

So I guess I'm not the first one to propose this, but having found all the services where you have to pay to get on playlists (submithub, bestsellermarket ...) I was wondering if we could not help each other joining our own playlists and slowly creating a following.

I'm not saying that we should blindly follow each other and put songs from each other in our respective playlists, but to hook up with artists and playlists you truly like and only follow them and / or put songs from them in your playlist.

No scamming and such.

So I would start by saying that I like (mostly) Industrial, Gothic, Darkwave and Electro and all around that.

So if you have something that fits in there, hit me up and I will check and see if it fits my playlist.

Likewise, if you have a playlist where some of my genres might fit, let me know and I will check it and follow it, and propose some songs of mine which might be ""missing"" in there.

I don't want to have this ""If I do that, you HAVE TO DO THAT FOR ME"" kind of thing. 

Only if you like something you should put it in your playlist and vice versa.

Does this make sense? Anyone would like to try that with me?

I also have some more Rock and Singer Songwriter Stuff btw. but Gothic / Industrial is my biggest interest.

tl;dr: do more.   
Music has always been my passion, but having gone to University to study engineering and taken a full time job after a Masters, it had always remained something I would do for fun on the side. I would occasionally toss up some of the songs I produced on soundcloud just to show some friends, but never anything more. It wasn’t until November of last year that I decided to try to take my music seriously and launch a brand new Project. On November 23rd 2018, I essentially Beyonced an EP with no audience. 

8 Months later, I have been placed on 5 spotify editorial playlists, have over 140k Spotify Streams, and just signed my next upcoming single with Proximity. 

I know many of us here in this subreddit are in the camp of wanting to pursue this whole music thing, but due to whatever reason, are stuck working full time. I think way too many people use that as an excuse. There is absolutely no reason you can’t be pursuing your music, even while working a full time job.   
Here are some tips that I feel have helped me stay on track:   
**1. Prioritize.** 

One of my favorite mental exercises is to change the thought “I don’t have time for X” to “X is not a priority”. Not having time is bullshit. It’s not that you don’t have time, it’s just that work/sleep/anything else is a priority. Now I’m not suggesting you chug 6 red bulls and quit your job. (after all this is supposed to be tips on how to work on music while working a full time job) But the point is that if you start to look at how you are prioritizing your time, I guarantee you will find more time to make music. It may mean taking a day off the gym, staying in one night instead of going out with friends, or having Stranger Things Season 3 spoiled for you since you haven’t watched it yet. But the number one thing you can do to pursue your music while working full time, is spend more time pursuing it. (wowzers) So prioritize and find the time.   


**2. Be consistent.** 

Between a full time job and all the other responsibilities that come with real life, there is admittedly not an exorbitant amount of hours left in a given day to workday on your music. But even if you can only find a minimal amount of time, use it. Consistency is key. Here is a general walk through of my M-F.   
8-830. Wake up and get ready for Work.   
830-9. Commute to Work. \*While on the Tram I am often using it to grow my social media\*

9 - 6. Work. \*On My Lunch I will often spend some time DMing playlisters or emailing Blogs etc.\*  
6-6:30. Commute. \*Maybe I’ll listen to some podcasts about music marketing\*

6:30 - 7:30. Make and eat Dinner.   
7:30-9:30. Gym. I \*prioritize\* staying active since I work at a desk all day. I could easily cut this and spend more time on music but I don’t.   
9:30 - 10. Post workout meal and relax.   
10 - sleep. MUSIC.   
So after a long day, I generally can only get to music around 10. And by then I might only get 2-3 hours before I pass out. But guess what? 2 hours a day over 8 months =  60 full 8 hour working days. That’s the equivalent of *3 months* working full time on music. Working a little bit everyday adds up! Consistency is key.   


**3. Work Smart.** 

So I know you may be thinking “I can’t do anything in 2 hours,what’s the point of even opening my daw?” or “I can’t force creativity how am I supposed to be consistent?”. I used to think those exact 2 things. But guess what? There is always something to be done.

Go through and start organizing a project file so that when you go to mix everything’s named and bused properly. Maybe go through and start mixing that track that’s coming together but is mad muddy. Maybe go watch some sound design tutorials. Maybe go on splice and start building up some sample libraries. Maybe set-up that custom template you’ve been meaning to set up for 7 years. 

There is so much more to the music making process than actually just writing a song. So if you’re not in the mood to do A, spend those two hours doing B. After a even just a week of this, you’ll be so much further ahead than if you just gave up with the “I can’t do anything in 2 hours”. 

**4. (Bonus) No one is going to build your audience for you.** 

I used to be the king of “fuck music marketing. I just want to make good music. If I make good music it will find and audience.” But that’s just not true. One of my favorite things that was said to make me realize this was: “Take a USB with the world's best music and throw it into the forest. No one is finding it.” The internet is that forest. If you want people to hear your music you need to make that happen. So spend your lunch / time on your commute/ those 2 hours a day you might have on a day where you don’t feel like doing actual music: DMing, emailing, using the 1.80 cent method on instagram, use free tools like submithub, Spotify for Artists or Youtube channel submission portals to pitch your music. “Everybody says they're trying to get their piece of the pie. They don't realize that the world is a kitchen – you can make your own pie.” Terry Crews. 

**Now a word of Caution:** 

Pursuing music while working a full time job is hard. It takes commitment and dedication. Personally I have prioritized music over sleep far too many times and definitely found myself burnt out and depressed at the thought of the efforts I was making and the utter emptiness of the return. Take care of yourselves. Take time off when needed. But keep at it. 10 monthly listeners will turn into 100. 100 into 1000. It takes time but eventually you will get your first break onto a playlist. And then one day you’ll wake up and the mysterious Spotify algorithm will be pushing your latest release to 3k release radars for no explicable reason.    
I Hope these tips are helpful to someone or that this post can serve as a motivation to get up and make some music.",547,,138,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/cf8onm/8_months_later_5_editorial_playlists_140k_spotify/,"8 Months later 5 Editorial Playlists, 140K Spotify Streams and an upcoming Release on Proximity - All while working full time. 3 Simple Tips to those pursuing music on the side","8 months later 5 editorial playlists, 140k spotify streams and an upcoming release on proximity - all while working full time. 3 simple tips to those pursuing music on the side","  tl;dr do more.

(bonus) no one is going to build your audience for you.**  i used to be the king of “fuck music marketing. i just want to make good music. if i make good music it will find and audience.” but that’s just not true. one of my favorite things that was said to make me realize this was “take a usb with the world's best music and throw it into the forest. no one is finding it.” the internet is that forest. if you want people to hear your music you need to make that happen. so spend your lunch / time on your commute/ those 2 hours a day you might have on a day where you don’t feel like doing actual music dming, emailing, using the 1.80 cent method on instagram, use free tools like submithub, spotify for artists or youtube channel submission portals to pitch your music. “everybody says they're trying to get their piece of the pie. they don't realize that the world is a kitchen – you can make your own pie.” terry crews.  **now a word of caution**  pursuing music while working a full time job is hard. it takes commitment and dedication. personally i have prioritized music over sleep far too many times and definitely found myself burnt out and depressed at the thought of the efforts i was making and the utter emptiness of the return. take care of yourselves. take time off when needed. but keep at it. 10 monthly listeners will turn into 100. 100 into 1000. it takes time but eventually you will get your first break onto a playlist. and then one day you’ll wake up and the mysterious spotify algorithm will be pushing your latest release to 3k release radars for no explicable reason.     i hope these tips are helpful to someone or that this post can serve as a motivation to get up and make some music.",31,1097

c88j3p,1562069832.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,MinuteLeopard,I've been a blog editor for 12 years - some personal notes on how to approach music bloggers,"Hiya

Thought I'd share some personal thoughts and guidance (some editors may disagree) on the pitches I receive for the site I run.

I've been running a rock and indie site for about 12 years now, around a day job, and get hundreds of emails a day. It's gotten a lot worse over the past few months, with lots of stuff we'd never feature (wrong genres), which of course creates noise for the more relevant artists and events. Especially if you've been emailing me trying to get featured! ;)

Hope this helps someone...happy to answer questions!

&amp;#x200B;

**Don't buy an email list**

Not only is it dodgy AF (and illegal because of the GDPR), it's poor practice to scattergun-email by using these lists, without knowing the sites and what they feature - especially genrewise and locale-wise. The people making these lists aren't doing legal things by collecting other people's information without asking, and selling it is even worse.

Even if the person's email address and name is on their website for public consumption, it doesn't give you a right to store their data, never mind sell it. Familiarise yourself with the [GDPR](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/) law from last year - and YES, it does apply if you are outside of Europe. YES, it applies if you're an artist. NO, marketing isn't a ""legitimate interest"". I'm currently battling to get myself off several of these lists, where people are making money from my email address and didn't ask if I minded....ask the hundreds of bands who can't get their music seen for all the rap and soul emails I keep getting...!

&amp;#x200B;

**Don't add people to your mailing list without their permission** 

Again, because of the GDPR. Email them, introduce yourself, and ask if they'd like to opt-in. Relationship building is a fab thing to do anyway, tbh. I always remember people and will open the mailing list stuff from people who have previously engaged with me. If you haven't, I'll ask YOU to remove me, because why should I take the extra step instead of moving to the next email. Yes, you're a musician and nobody is going to come after you...that is not the point. It really isn't. We're supposed to be working together...and enough spam email reports won't do your mailing list any favours!

&amp;#x200B;

**Don't send Wetransfer files over to randos**

Yes, we get this loads. Wetransfer scattergunning is a thing. Fair enough, there's nothing attached, but it's additional noise.

&amp;#x200B;

**Don't attach files**

Images, MP3s...they will be deleted.

&amp;#x200B;

**Avoid socials...**

Don't pitch people on their personal social media, unless their site/profile explicitly invites it (some people have seperate music industry profiles)

My Facebook is for photos of my cats and my complaining about the weather. It's not for work - the day job, or the evening one.

&amp;#x200B;

**So what should I do?**

ASK! Ask how people prefer to be pitched as it varies. Some of my peers like tweets and DMs, some of them have FB page autoresponders, some use submission sites like SubmitHub (I tried it, found a lot of irrelevant genres and scattergun stuff on there so gave up), some prefer actual email and some still are probably tetchy because physical promos aren't a thing anymore.

Have a press release that has links to online content - a press page perhaps. Have your social media profiles all ready so there's no need for someone to back and forth email you for more information. Take the time to email someone personally. Read their website, check out their social media, find bands who are where you aspire to be or your peers and find out where they're being featured. Don't aim too high to start. Meet people at events, invite them to your shows, get to know them, build relationships with people, thank them and share their sites when they feature you.

Hey friends!

The Ambient Soundscapes playlist's 23rd rotation is ready. Summer is definitely here, and during the past week I have enjoyed listening to your suggestions and submissions in my garden.  
 I have had a hard time narrowing down this week’s selection to just 10 tracks. I have had to save quite a great deal of music for the coming rotations.

This weeks recommended artist: Ishq

Matt Hillier is the figure behind the UK based act Ishq. Matt is no new name on the stage, having released more than 50 albums over the past 20+ years. Ishq combines classical ambient music with a more experimental sound resulting in a very unique style. I have followed Matt’s music for a long time and I still return to his music often. This week I feature his track Vhale which is from the new album Light and Space.  
 I can recommend the whole album from start to end. 

For more Ishq go visit his website at www.ishq.org

Freshly added tracks in this 23rd rotation by following artists:

Siddhartha Barnhoorn, Ishq, Brique A Braq, Haav, Alpha Mound, Ken Verheecke, Distant Fires Burning, Realizer, Antarctic Wastelands, Canadian Rifles, Hirola

This weeks recommended artist Ishq Matt Hillier is the figure behind the UK based act Ishq. Matt is no new name on the stage, having released more than 50 albums over the past 20 years. Ishq combines classical ambient music with a more experimental sound resulting in a very unique style. I have followed Matt’s music for a long time and I still return to his music often. This week I feature his track Vhale which is from the new album Light and Space.    I can recommend the whole album from start to end.  For more Ishq go visit his website at www.ishq.org Freshly added tracks in this 23rd rotation by following artists Siddhartha Barnhoorn, Ishq, Brique A Braq, Haav, Alpha Mound, Ken Verheecke, Distant Fires Burning, Realizer, Antarctic Wastelands, Canadian Rifles, Hirola    Playlist    Always looking for new tracks to feature and listen to.
