18wahhy,1704152714.0,musicmarketing,DaRealDorianGray,Promoting my music as a non-performing IDM musician,"I do not make a living as a musician but I would like to advertise my Spotify. I am not aiming to make huge numbers or earning a significant amount of royalties with it - if any. 

The two things I have to consider are:

* I am not performing live. I hope I will some day, but right now my only interest is to compose, produce and publish my music. So I do not have a mean to increase my fan base outside of the digital space
* I make electronic music, but not the ""mainstream"" genre. I mostly make what people would call IDM or experimental EDM - like Apex Twins, Jon Hopkins, Boards of Canada, Clark, and so on.

I thought about using these playlists promotion services but there's a lot of negative opinions on them online. Of course I want real listeners, so I would choose the only legit ones (Indie Music Academy and Playlist Push, for instance, seem okay according to the average online reviews). I have no idea if I stand any chance to have my music successfully pitched given the non radio friendly genre.

Do you have advices? If you want to have a better idea of what my music sounds like, feel free to ask - I can dm you one of my tracks (they are not published on Spotify, yet!)",1.0,1.0,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicmarketing/comments/18wahhy/promoting_my_music_as_a_nonperforming_idm_musician/,Promoting my music as a non-performing IDM musician,promoting my music as a non-performing idm musician,"I do not make a living as a musician but I would like to advertise my Spotify.
