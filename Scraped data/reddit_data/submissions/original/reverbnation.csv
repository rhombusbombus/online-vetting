,thefalloftheking,"It has been speculated in the old (and dead) subreddit that Sentinel, a Texan band from Austin, from 1986: [https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Sentinel/118709](https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Sentinel/118709), could have made our unknown song, The Fall of The King, but I'm not convinced, but if you are interested, here is their first demo album: [https://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Sentinel/Demo/186158](https://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Sentinel/Demo/186158) and the second album a compilation of live songs never released previously and the tracks from the 1986 Demo: [https://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Sentinel/Demo\_1986\_Plus\_Live/297918](https://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Sentinel/Demo_1986_Plus_Live/297918) You can listen to it on Youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5A9NMB996pjVzE\_s3MfonQINERjU3Q70](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5A9NMB996pjVzE_s3MfonQINERjU3Q70)

The singer is Kent Taylor/Kent Steele [https://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Kent\_Steele/91551](https://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Kent_Steele/91551) [https://www.discogs.com/it/artist/8959669-Kent-Taylor-2](https://www.discogs.com/it/artist/8959669-Kent-Taylor-2) and while Taylor has a similar voice to The Fall Of The King's singer, I am not completely convinced it's him, also he's the singer of two bands, the previously mentioned Sentinel and the 1985 band Baron Steele [https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Baron\_Steele/20335](https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Baron_Steele/20335)

Here is their 1987 Demo Album: [https://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Baron\_Steele/Demo\_1987/46932](https://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Baron_Steele/Demo_1987/46932) you can listen to it on Youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1gudzmuVLQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1gudzmuVLQ) and while searching for their second album: [https://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Baron\_Steele/Minotaur%27s\_Lair\_%28Demo\_1987\_-\_The\_Lost\_Recordings%29/519843Kent](https://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Baron_Steele/Minotaur%27s_Lair_%28Demo_1987_-_The_Lost_Recordings%29/519843Kent) I found on youtube some of the songs here: [https://www.youtube.com/@rush.paok4946/search?query=baron%20steele](https://www.youtube.com/@rush.paok4946/search?query=baron%20steele) and here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJkK1qBE548](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJkK1qBE548) and the second link is very intriguing, since it's from a channel that comprises Texan Underground Metal Music, it's called TXmetalunderground: [https://www.youtube.com/@TXmetalunderground/videos](https://www.youtube.com/@TXmetalunderground/videos) and I also found their website: [https://tmurecords.bandcamp.com/track/minotaurs-lair-demo-1987](https://tmurecords.bandcamp.com/track/minotaurs-lair-demo-1987) [https://tmurecords.bandcamp.com/](https://tmurecords.bandcamp.com/) They describe themselves as an ""archive of the classic Texas metal scene"".

Also, as said by another user in this post of the old subreddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFallOfTheKingSong/comments/n1ad1f/possible\_singer\_of\_thefalloftheking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFallOfTheKingSong/comments/n1ad1f/possible_singer_of_thefalloftheking/) the two bands are different in style, Sentinel is Speed Metal and Baron Steele is Power Metal. 

He also says that ""the description of Night Of The Wolves says something about some dissatisfaction of the band with the final studio mix"", but I couldn't verify this.

He adds ""Maybe The Fall Of The King was some demo of Baron Steele or Kent Taylor that was not good enough to be released and was just a demo sent to be transmitted by a local radio station (Z-Rock)"". But, there is a problem with this Sentinel/Baron Steele theory, since if The Fall of The King is their demo, why not releasing it after all these years? It makes no sense, considering it was broadcasted in a radio, so I don't think it's them, but I could be wrong. Also, we should keep an eye on TXmetalunderground since The Fall of The King was played on a Texan Radio (Z-Rock), so it's possible at least one of these band could be ours.

Also, there is a comment that mentions Buddy Forsythe, the guitarist of Sentinel: [https://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Don\_%22Buddy%22\_Forsythe/91578](https://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Don_%22Buddy%22_Forsythe/91578) that was also the frontman of Scythian Oath: [https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Scythian\_Oath/26821](https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Scythian_Oath/26821), he claims Buddy ""was probably a big guy in the TX metal scene back in the day and you can find a lot of him in social media these days"", but I couldn't find anything except for these three Linkedin accounts (which I am not sure if it's one fo them it's him): [https://www.linkedin.com/in/buddy-forsythe-a95778](https://www.linkedin.com/in/buddy-forsythe-a95778) [https://www.linkedin.com/in/buddy-forsythe-148b56306?trk=public\_profile\_samename-profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/buddy-forsythe-148b56306?trk=public_profile_samename-profile) [https://www.linkedin.com/in/buddy-forsythe-49b5575](https://www.linkedin.com/in/buddy-forsythe-49b5575) and his Discogs (this is his discography for sure): [https://www.discogs.com/artist/6588941-Buddy-Forsythe-2](https://www.discogs.com/artist/6588941-Buddy-Forsythe-2)

And the same comment goes further ""In this video of Hypnophobia from the Sentinel Demos on YouTube there's a comment that reads ""This is my last gig with Sentinel in 1986. Steve and David on guitar at the Ritz."". The profile has some Scythian Oath songs and a Reverbnation link, so that must be him. Maybe, he could help us finding some clues about this song. Still, I have been listening to many songs of these bands in the last hour and I'm not still completely sold on this Kent Taylor dude being the vocalist on the king song."" However, this is very weird since the comment is not there [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3bnd2HKmXQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3bnd2HKmXQ) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5r1euz0\_Us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5r1euz0_Us)

,lostmedia,"So, a couple of days ago, I made a post here about the partially lost, All Year Round discography. And I wanted to update some of the information provided in that first post, but I wasn’t really sure how to go about it, so I decided to do another post.

So in my original post, I mentioned that All Year Round’s third ep, In Perspective, had been found. And I had also found five songs on their Reverbnation account. (The fifth song was a cover song, and I didn’t feel it was important to mention it at first, but apparently, it is)
And the band had two other songs on their YouTube. 

Also mentioned in my original post was the fact that they don’t have a Discogs page, so information on the first two ep’s were pretty limited. So I wasn’t sure exactly how many songs were lost. That is until today.
I reached out to a fan of the band on Facebook, and they confirmed that all five of the songs on All Year Round’s Reverbnation, are all songs on their first ep, titled “Most of Now”
I had also found a post that All Year Round shared to their Facebook confirming the complete track listing of their self titled, second ep. 
The track listing is as follows.

Track 1: When the Lights hit your Eyes

Track 2: Way to Rain on My Parade 

Track 3: You Can Never Hurt a Mushroom

Track 4: 31th Day of February 

Tracks 1 and 3 are currently on their YouTube, while tracks 2 and 4 are currently the only songs that are still lost. So, huzzah, we now know that out of all three of these cd’s, only two songs are lost

So to recap once again.
Most of Now and In Perspective have been found.
And half of the Self titled Ep is still lost
The lost songs in question are once again

It is true that social platforms have shifted from being 𝑓𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟-𝑓𝑜𝑐𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑑 to 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛-𝑓𝑜𝑐𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑑.

Nowadays, 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝑎𝑙𝑔𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑚 continuously suggests a steady stream of curated content gathered from all creators on the platform. 

As a result, it has become increasingly challenging for creators to connect with their own audience.

Someone can said that 𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑠 would be the one way to actually reach people, but the opposite is true.

This is a topic that concerns many musicians, so I found the following interesting post in Reverbnation where you can find more details:

,lostmedia,"So recently I came across this awesome female led punk band from Adelaide, Australia called “All Year Round”
I recently got my hands on one of their CD’s, Titled “In Perspective” And it’s really good.

Unfortunately, the rest of the bands songs have proven to be a little bit more harder to find. After investigating their Facebook, it seems that they have made a total of three CD’s (In Perspective included) before changing their name to “Stansbury” 

These three CD’s for what ever reason are not available to purchase on places like iTunes or Bandcamp. The only song under the name “All Year Round” that is available to buy is a song called “Wildfire”
They have 4 other songs available to download from their Reverbnation account, and 2 other songs on their YouTube, but I doubt that is everything that is missing. They don’t seem to have a Discogs page, so I can’t confirm just how many songs are missing.

To recap, here’s what I’ve been able to find. 
In Perspective - Full CD

Four songs on their Reverbnation:
Sleeping in Sox
Hand in Hand 
Laps
and Holding on

And Two songs on their YouTube:
You can Never Hurt a Mushroom

,Megadeth,"Hey everybody! I have some inside knowledge about this question.

My name is Paul Moss, but I now go under the stage name El Pablo. I am a life-long drummer focused primarily on the rock/hard rock/classic rock genres. You can find my most recent project, a selection of energized Alice Cooper drum and lead vocal covers here:

[www.reverbnation.com/theonetheycallelpablo](http://www.reverbnation.com/theonetheycallelpablo) 

ANSWER TO THE QUESTION:

Yes. Fallen Angels was the name before it became Megadeth. Here's the story:

Dave was concerned he may not be able to handle the Lead Vocals for this initial band project that he was assembling to carry forward after he separated from Metallica in New York and took a bus back home to Los Angeles. The wild, insanely charismatic to women, front man/lead vocalist that Dave found was Lor Kane. At about 6'3"" Lor was a very stealthy looking front man with a genuine metal growl, long straight black hair and a strong metallic blue streak straight down one side. 

My small piece of inside info is based on this:

In 1985 I passed the audition for Lor's new band he was calling Babylon (not Babylon A.D., which emerged right about that same time in L.A.) After getting through the audition, I had been told by the bass player Zeyda's then girlfriend, who later ended up with me for several months, that Lor had come out of Megadeth and that he was the original lead vocalist for Megadeth. I actually did not try to verify that fact at the time. I just happened to look up the lineup of Megadeth yesterday, May 4, 2024, to see if my memory was accurate or if maybe I had just been told a story. If you google it, you can quickly verify my facts. I could see Lor was clearly from, and to some degree was still connected to, the tornadic winds of that overall historic Metallica/Megadeth international launch period of time when Metallica was on a major rise and Dave's new band, at the suggestion of Lor Kane, changed its name from Fallen Angels to Megadeth. Immediately before Megadeth actually did fully take off, Dave apparently developed an issue with Lor culminating in Lor Kane (real name Lawrence Henna from San Fransisco - I saw his driver's license once) ultimately separating from Megadeth to spend the next few years trying to assemble his own band named Babylon.

One night in March of 1986, we played the Troubadour on Sunset in Hollywood. I was a little bit upset with Lor when I arrived at the show to find our name ""Babylon"" was not on the marquis. I immediately found Lor and asked him what was up? He said he used another name that was on that marquis that night: ""Death Angel"". I was like.....WHAT???! He didn't explain why, and I didn't make an issue about it. Now, clear up here in 2024, I just happened to Google the issue and suddenly after some 38 years I find that Dave Mustane apparently tweeted out verification that Lor really was the original lead vocalist for Megadeth and officially gave Lor credit for the Megadeth band and brand name. I never knew about the name Fallen Angels until just yesterday. Now I get it. Lor was maintaining his association with Megadeth/Fallen Angels billing himself as ""Death Angel"". 

I gotta tell ya, having 38 years pass before verifying these facts about Lor is a strange feeling. Apparently, Dave posted the Tweet about this issue a year or so ago. I may be mind numbingly late to learn these facts, but I would like to thank Dave Mustane for officially clearing up this issue once and for all.

Finally, anyone seeking a genuine drummer from that era, late 70's through early 2000's, PLEASE contact me by leaving a message on that Reverbnation page I linked above or sending me an email. My email address is on that page as well. I am seriously seeking a new recording or live band gig. As long as that fire rages inside me I need to put it to good use. I have a full multi-track drum studio for session work. It's recording, broadcast or personal rehearsal ready to dive onto, into and all over your project. I am also available for country or blues projects as I have a fair amount of experience in those genres as well.

How can I help you with your project?

,PowerMetal,"I am looking for info on this band, and I am hoping someone can help. I saw Alchemy at a heavy metal festival in Tijuana, MX back in November of 2022. They reminded me of a Mexican Judas Priest/Primal Fear. Really good band, but had no merch at the fest to buy. I got to talk to their singer after the set, and he confirmed that they hadn't brought anything. 

I have since been searching for anything I could find, and being a collector, specifically physical products. I have been able to find some videos of live footage on YouTube, 4 songs on ReverbNation, and of course Facebook and X pages. I don't have any other social media besides here. There isn't even a Metal Archives page or Bandcamp for these guys.

Is anyone here familiar with Alchemy? Can anyone point me to where I can find merch for them? Please let me know. The pic I posted is from their performance at the fest.

,musicbusiness,"While I've been writing music over the last 40 years, I've never officially released anything. I've just completed recording, mixing, and mastering an album, and want to release it. The common logic today seems to be for new, independent artists to use a waterfall method, releasing singles, about 6 weeks apart. So, I need to sign up with a PRO (probably BMI),  SoundExchange (for Artist Royalty), and a DSP (leaning toward CDBaby). My question relates to timing.



I'd like to sign up with a PRO first, to get my IPI number, and then SoundExchange, and finally a DSP.

Meeting Allison inspired me to create this list. I put her latest singles at the top

The only rule besides it being a good-excellent song is that the person was a JW, is an ExJW. (I was slightly loose on baptism technicalities) 

I leaned into JW cultural influence. They were raised as a JW or raised in the JW culture. For the heavy hitters and well known artists like MJ, Megadeath (Dave Mustain), Ja Rule, Notorious B.I.G., Patti Smith etc. I limited the songs to just a couple and either their best couple of songs, or a song that's kind of on topic like Thriller. That was a hugely important song to MJ's story of disconnecting from this faith.

For less known or unknown artists I put their entire discography in to see if we can give them a lift/boost and help their new art make an impact.

I still haven't arranged the playlist for playability and mood transitions. It's more of a sandbox to collect everything as I find it. I'd love your ears and ideas to help me make it better.

I'd love your additions of artists and songs to check out. Please write them in the comments.

I also started an ExJW playlist in: **SoundCloud, Reverbnation**, and I would like to create one for **Bandcamp** as many excellent ExJW artists are only those platforms.

,u_wildoscah,"🔥BRAND NEW🔥music video🎬 Wild Oscah - ""The Dire Soul"" filmed in Halifax, Nova Scotia. A song about being cursed by addiction and ending up at rock bottom with it's many trap doors hanging onto your soul with a crippling grip. 


I hope this video brings a sense of humanity to those who complain about the homeless or anyone who's hit rock bottom knowing each and everyone of us is only inches away from a hellish existence given certain circumstances, mental health issues and or the substance use disorders that don't discriminate and can affect anyone of any class, religion, gender, color etc. And an added note that not all addicts are homeless and not all homeless are addicts.

Produced by Stream Currents Productions and the song is available on all major streaming platforms. I'll post the link below

,Bandlab,"The link to my purchased Crowd Review sent by email, sent from Reverbnation, was not working.

It was diverting to the default crowd review page at [https://www.reverbnation.com/band-promotion/crowd\_review](https://www.reverbnation.com/band-promotion/crowd_review) rather than linking to my report.

I had the same problem a few years ago, when I last used this service, and after a ton of investigative work and experimentation I managed to work out the cause (and a workaround), and I dutifully reported it to Reverbnation for their IT guys to investigate. 

It appears it wasn't resolved.

The issue occurs when you click on the email link to view your review and then use the Google automatic password autofill service (and possibly other password autofill services as well). It does log you in successfully but the deep URL link is invalid so it defaults to the page above.

The workaround therefore is to click the link and login manually.

I hope this helps others tearing their hair out on this issue, and now that Bandlab has apparently bought out Reverbnation, hopefully someone at Bandlab is reading this...?

The song tells the amazing story of George Mallory &amp; Sandy Irvine, very possibly the real conquerors of Mt. Everest in 1924.

It’s one thing to follow a how-to on YouTube, but another to get trusted ears on something and saying “hey the eq on the guitar can come down in the 1k range.” People also have different ways of listening to music and it can be helpful to know what it sounds like in someone’s truck, or on their no-name brand headphones. 

I know ReverbNation had(has?) a (scammy) version of this you pay for where absolute morons would give feedback on your song, which contained only vocals and piano, saying things like it “would be better if it had piano in it.” I’m wondering if there’s a group that can do this sort of thing for free/as a trade for helping with each other’s work.",t2_9yht29jk,False,,0,False,Mix Critiquing Groups?,[],r/WeAreTheMusicMakers,False,6.0,,0.0,,,True,t3_1ahdx9z,False,dark,1.0,,public,1.0,0.0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1706907134.0,text,6.0,,,text,self.WeAreTheMusicMakers,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everybody!

2. Scott Foster Harris: It's a joy every single time working with brother Eric! He's a rock star and a gentleman through and through. We hammered out another amazing song that I'm honored to be a part of. Truly a magnificent experience from start to finish with every single track. As always, highly, highly recommended!!!! 

3. Martin Motnik: Eric is great to work for! He's very professional, courteous, organized, and a great communicator! I enjoyed playing for him a lot and I'm looking forward to next time! Thank you again for entrusting me with your song! 

4. Jason Hartless: Easy to work with!

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sam Koop: Working with Eric again was a lot of fun. His passion for creating rock music is amazing to see and hear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott Foster Harris: It&amp;#39;s a joy every single time working with brother Eric! He&amp;#39;s a rock star and a gentleman through and through. We hammered out another amazing song that I&amp;#39;m honored to be a part of. Truly a magnificent experience from start to finish with every single track. As always, highly, highly recommended!!!! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin Motnik: Eric is great to work for! He&amp;#39;s very professional, courteous, organized, and a great communicator! I enjoyed playing for him a lot and I&amp;#39;m looking forward to next time! Thank you again for entrusting me with your song! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

*Hellcross, a metal band originating from Lima, Peru, is set to release their new single, ""Murder One,"" on the upcoming Friday, January 26th. The song will debut on streaming platforms accompanied by a lyric video, presented on the band's official YouTube account.*

**Lima, January 2024.** A knee strike, a merciless hook landed squarely on the jaw: this is the sound of the Peruvian Stoner Groove Metal band, Hellcross. Formed in 2014 in Lima, Peru, the rocking quartet consisting of Pedro Vásquez, ""El Barbas""; Jaime Iriarte, ""Mike Iné""; Alvaro Reynaga, ""The Beast""; and Willy Fernández, ""el Chanchoceronte"" has decided to celebrate their first decade with the YouTube release of the song ""Murder One,"" a single written in honor of the legendary Motörhead frontman, the immortal Lemmy Kilmister.

A tribute to Kilmister's rebelliousness and irreverence, ""Murder One"" is, from Hellcross's intimate perspective, a way to honor the frontman of one of the bands that most influenced them personally and musically.

*“He has the guts to never give-a-fuck*  
*And if you cross his way, you better play the game”*

As a sign of affection and respect for Lemmy Kilmister's memory, the lyrics of ""Murder One"" depict part of Lemmy's life philosophy, a rocker in the broadest sense of the word. ""He is someone we see as a benchmark in rock, hard rock, punk, metal... like a big foundation. That's why our intention is to contribute to further immortalizing what Motörhead and Lemmy mean for people who haven't had the chance to listen to them or are just starting to,"" says Pedro ""El Barbas,"" lead vocalist and guitarist of Hellcross.

Musically, ""Murder One"" can only be described as a wall of sound, a shot of Jack &amp; Coke straight to the vein. Willy ""el Chanchoceronte"" remarks about the track: ""it's a challenge for the band that mixes elements of southern metal with the speed metal that Motörhead did. It's a very interesting mix that we decided to undertake in tribute to Lemmy.""

The story of Hellcross is undeniably linked to Motörhead. Two of the founding members of the Peruvian metal band met right at the entrance of the Sheraton Hotel in April 2011, when the British band came to perform in Lima. ""I met Pedro right when Lemmy arrived at the hotel, and that's where we started our contact,"" shares Jaime Iriarte. ""Motörhead has a cool background because it was what landed us in Hellcross in some way.""

In addition to the lyric video to be released on YouTube, ""Murder One"" will be available on other Hellcross platforms: Spotify, Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram, and is included in the reissue of their first EP, ""Men of Mayhem,"" currently on sale through their website. Additionally, the band has announced the production of a special music video for the song, to be made with contributions from Lemmy and Motörhead fans worldwide. Those wishing to participate in the video's creation can contact the band through their official Facebook account

,DanceForHoursADay,"since the song is starting to take off a bit more and we’ve had a bunch of different debated leads, i wanted to share some of the methods i’ve been using. i’m not an expert by any means, but i thought this might help if anyone is looking for a place to start or in need of a detour. 

sites of interest: myspace, reverbnation, soundcloud, bandcamp, youtube, discogs

anything that centers around music/live performance sharing and existed in 2007-8 is game for searching. i think the best course of action right now is searching for fairly broad terms and then using filters to narrow it down. for example, when searching on discogs i always use the 2000s tag, and on youtube i usually search for “live” “performance” “band” or “song” with the keyword “before:2008”- this almost always brings up obscure live recordings of little known bands. they’re often in terrible quality, but a lead is a lead.

similar artists i’ve found (these are not viable as the performer, but they’re the closest i’ve gotten and it might be of help to somebody. if not you might at least like their music!):

-Fur Cups for Teeth
active in the 2000s in new york, with unique leading vocals and a slightly more experimental indie vibe (their song 99 reminded me a bit of the mystery song). all their work is on bandcamp, but that’s about it and they haven’t posted since 2014-15. they actually have a song called ddr which is how i found them, but it’s on one of their more electronic albums and obviously isn’t it (i do think it’s interesting to note that in general most songs i’ve found with this title never say ddr, but do reference a relationship/person via dancing in some way). i think this is the exact type of artist we’re looking for- someone who hasn’t been active in years, who only has a couple search results worth of music and otherwise doesn’t seem to exist in the mainstream.

-Kris Deelane
active in the 2000s in portland, was in a band called sweetjuice at this time but also has done solo work and seems to span a few genres in indie alt-pop/rock. i found her through an old recording of her performing a song called ‘corroded angels’ at a local event, and at first i thought that could be our band name and the song was buried somewhere in one of those videos. the portland angels lead seems less likely to me now, but i think checking social connections/ favorite artists listed by someone like this could give us something interesting.

anyway, i’m not sure how helpful this will actually be, but this is my first major lostwave search and i wanted to add something to the conversation. here’s hoping we get a solid real lead soon!",t2_1ejc86fv,False,,0,False,tips for searching &amp; similar artists i’ve found,[],r/DanceForHoursADay,False,,,0.0,,,True,t3_1868j25,False,dark,1.0,,public,1.0,0.0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1701209787.0,text,,,,text,self.DanceForHoursADay,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;since the song is starting to take off a bit more and we’ve had a bunch of different debated leads, i wanted to share some of the methods i’ve been using. i’m not an expert by any means, but i thought this might help if anyone is looking for a place to start or in need of a detour. &lt;/p&gt;

,lostmedia,"I present a surprisingly difficult (and surprisingly recent!) one to find: 

**WHAT IT IS:** The music album **Kingdom Come** by musician **Tom Maxwell**, (allegedly) released in 2011. 

**AVAILABLE INFO:** It has a [Discoggs page](https://www.discogs.com/release/6451418-Tom-Maxwell-Kingdom-Come), although it shows no statistics of ever being bought or sold. It is, or supposedly, it was at some point [available in spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/4eFvmduaOuuoi5bN2BkD05), but it cannot be streamed at the present time: scraping at the [spotify api](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-an-album) shows that it's not available in any country (has no country code under *available\_markets* attribute). There is no available picture of the physical release of the album, other than the discoggs album page and the spotify page. The album was allegedly sold (signed, no less!) on [Tom Maxwell's personal webpage](https://www.tommaxwell.com/), but the site has long since gone private and it's impossible to see it's contents. I assume the discoggs album art has been saved from the now inaccessible webpage or from spotify.

**WHAT I HAVE:** I've been able to find (and download) one of the tracks (hence the partially lost tag): Why I smoke. You are actually able to [listen to it from reverbnation](https://www.reverbnation.com/tommaxwell/songs). 

Although the album has songs whose titles are the [same as other of Tom's albums](https://tommaxwell1.bandcamp.com/album/tom-maxwell-the-minor-drag), the lengths are different, which suggest the tunes in Kingdom Come are different from his other albums' versions. This is a common practice for this particular artist.

TL;DR: As of now, 13 of the 14 tracks of the album are, as far as my research has shown, impossible to listen to. One of the tracks is available on reverbnation (see link above)

**Baton Rouge, LA —** [John Piper Matthews](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dastranger_sony-recording-artist-dopeboybluezbook-activity-7050199985409200128-KacM), New Sony recording Artist known by his stage name [DopeBoyBluez](https://www.instagram.com/dopeboybluez/), is revolutionizing the [Southern Soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_soul) music industry with his groundbreaking new Southern Soul genre, ""Nubluez."" Born on October 3, 1980, in Clinton, [Louisiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana), this American singer and songwriter is positioning himself as one of the greatest artists in the history of American blues-soul and a seminal figure in soul music and rhythm and blues.

Nicknamed ""pipe"" or ""pike,"" Matthews' singing style draws inspiration from the [Gospel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel) music that laid the foundation for the genre. His raw talent and innate skills have influenced a new wave of Southern soul and hip-hop artists, igniting a renaissance in these genres during the early and mid-2000s under the consultant of [darkangelproject/DopeBoyBluez LLC](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tVgUpgaiFcmqoEoCA)

Matthews' journey in music began in the small town of Clinton, Louisiana, where he grew up as one of four brothers in a single-parent household. Despite their meager resources, they faced life's challenges head-on. His mother, a strong churchgoer, sought solace in her faith to overcome life's hardships.

John, influenced by legends such as [Otis Redding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otis_Redding), [Jackie Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Wilson), [James Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Brown), and [Sam Cooke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Cooke), credited his mother as his primary source of inspiration. In modern time most people say he sounds like [Anthony Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Hamilton_(musician)), [Mystikal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystikal), and [Anderson Paak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_.Paak). His music career, he often expressed, was a tribute to her and her determination to provide a better life.

In 2000, John gained recognition with the release of the ""[Dastranger Compilation](https://archive.org/details/DastrangerCompilation),"" a self-titled project produced by his cousin [Playa Pizzle](https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/entertainment_life/music/report-2-chainz-gets-assist-from-baton-rouge-producer-southerns-human-jukebox-for-money-maker/article_f554cc88-d9d6-11ea-8439-3742ce0dd229.html) producer of ""[Money maker](https://youtu.be/vy5AVymx_eo?si=a43O-sNpS8ciS-_b)"" with [2 Chainz](https://g.co/kgs/SXHUF9) and [Lil Wayne](https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/2-chainz-lil-wayne-money-maker-2020-bet-hip-hop-awards-9474072/). 

The turning point arrived when John signed with Krucial Records in collaboration with the producer duo East &amp; West, financed by NBA legend [John ""Hot Rod"" Williams](https://g.co/kgs/fyF7ua). The album ""[So Krucial](https://amazon.com/music/player/albums/B08MXLR27H?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;musicTerritory=US&amp;ref=dm_sh_akwo4Ice5LQ1K6E2py16UvHgt)"" included “Hot Rod’s son Lil John which was a feature and marked the beginning of a new phase in John's career, featuring hit tracks such as ""Shake a Leg"" and ""C-Town.""

The journey took them to New York and [performed](https://flic.kr/p/2k5p4uX) at [Marcy Day Project](https://flic.kr/p/2k5os7G), with fellow artists and industry professionals [Jaz-O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaz-O). The relationships forged during this trip were crucial in advancing their music career. John then began meeting other made artist like [Lil Flip](https://flic.kr/p/2k5jC9k) and [Bun B](https://flic.kr/p/2k5oscb). 

However, fame had its drawbacks, including challenges with management and personal relationships. It was clear that John was evolving as an artist and as an individual, needed to adopt a more mature and responsible outlook on life.

John's meteoric rise was not without its challenges. John shifted his focus back to the studio, improving their recording skills and exploring new production techniques. This creative endeavor paved the way for their unique music style, later recognized in 2020 as ""[Nubluez](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dastranger/50681042507/in/dateposted-public/)."" That year as a new artist John attended the Award Show and encountered many [celebrities](https://flic.kr/p/2kduYUZ). “Nubluez” was also [solidified by](https://flic.kr/p/2kdvAeH) Wyld Kyle of [Jagged Edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagged_Edge_(American_group)) at the [Temple Theater](https://www.thetempletheatre.com/) in Meridian, MS for the [King Russell Underground Southern Soul](https://youtu.be/0GTEWLUw7_s?si=R7Gom6nrrCZIVXF8) [Awards](https://flic.kr/p/2kdrfcn). 

In 2014, John embarked on a remarkable journey by introducing ""DopeBoyBluez,"" his self-branded project that showcased his unique fusion of R&amp;B, blues, and rap. The hit debut single ""[Keep Dancing](https://music.apple.com/us/album/keep-dancing-feat-shawmichael-d-ray-single/905695481)“,""[Swing-out](https://open.spotify.com/album/0elQWuC2uEDaDRk4FP4SQr)"" and ""[Came 2 Party](https://open.spotify.com/album/6UYFeYeDcMQVMq5kPQcfFW)"" was just a glimpse of what was to come.

In 2022, John's career reached new heights as he joined KISS 94.1fm Meridian MS and WZKD: The Big KD 94.1fm, affiliated with [King Russell Entertainment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRROF_Lv4ms) (KRE), a Sony/Universal music label now with Empire Records alongside Death Rose Records. KRE's vision was to become the first Southern Soul label to secure Sony and Universal Distribution. John released ""[Sometimes she loves me](https://g.co/kgs/3Ti5o7)"" with King under Empire Distribution.

Despite several challenges in this partnership, John's unique sound gained attention from [Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_Distribution) and other associates like Slayer Promotions, and Army Veterans William Stokes and Mr. Clarence, [Gulf Coast Promotions](https://www.facebook.com/Billy.S228/) who are pivotal figures in their journey along the Gulf Coast Region.

In his pursuit of a major record deal, they crossed paths with Mr. Mike Boss of [Rich Nation Entertainment LLC /Universal Music Group/Virgin Music/Sony Music](https://richnationent.com/artists/), offering them a Sony/Rich Nation deal. This deal was a critical turning point, poised to elevate John's career to the next level.

John's upcoming album promises to be a masterpiece of music that will stand the test of time. However, with rising fame comes its share of challenges. Navigating the complexities of the music industry and maintaining personal integrity is an ongoing journey.

As DopeBoyBluez continues to break free from the confines of conventional music and explores his revolutionary Southern Soul ""Nubluez"" sound, the future holds the promise of a groundbreaking era in music. John's dedication, resilience, and unwavering passion for his craft define his extraordinary journey and legacy.

In 2023 ""[The Making of DopeBoyBluez](https://www.amazon.com/Making-DopeBoyBluez-Angela-Johnson/dp/B0C47WR4RR/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2Q8IVZP9118OY&amp;keywords=the+making+of+dopeboybluez&amp;qid=1698006267&amp;sprefix=the+making+of+dopeboybluez%2Caps%2C161&amp;sr=8-1)"" Biography was released to announce to the world Dopeboybluez have arrived.

&lt;p&gt;The turning point arrived when John signed with Krucial Records in collaboration with the producer duo East &amp;amp; West, financed by NBA legend &lt;a href=""https://g.co/kgs/fyF7ua""&gt;John &amp;quot;Hot Rod&amp;quot; Williams&lt;/a&gt;. The album &amp;quot;&lt;a href=""https://amazon.com/music/player/albums/B08MXLR27H?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;musicTerritory=US&amp;amp;ref=dm_sh_akwo4Ice5LQ1K6E2py16UvHgt""&gt;So Krucial&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; included “Hot Rod’s son Lil John which was a feature and marked the beginning of a new phase in John&amp;#39;s career, featuring hit tracks such as &amp;quot;Shake a Leg&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;C-Town.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The journey took them to New York and &lt;a href=""https://flic.kr/p/2k5p4uX""&gt;performed&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=""https://flic.kr/p/2k5os7G""&gt;Marcy Day Project&lt;/a&gt;, with fellow artists and industry professionals &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaz-O""&gt;Jaz-O&lt;/a&gt;. The relationships forged during this trip were crucial in advancing their music career. John then began meeting other made artist like &lt;a href=""https://flic.kr/p/2k5jC9k""&gt;Lil Flip&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://flic.kr/p/2k5oscb""&gt;Bun B&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, fame had its drawbacks, including challenges with management and personal relationships. It was clear that John was evolving as an artist and as an individual, needed to adopt a more mature and responsible outlook on life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John&amp;#39;s meteoric rise was not without its challenges. John shifted his focus back to the studio, improving their recording skills and exploring new production techniques. This creative endeavor paved the way for their unique music style, later recognized in 2020 as &amp;quot;&lt;a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/dastranger/50681042507/in/dateposted-public/""&gt;Nubluez&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot; That year as a new artist John attended the Award Show and encountered many &lt;a href=""https://flic.kr/p/2kduYUZ""&gt;celebrities&lt;/a&gt;. “Nubluez” was also &lt;a href=""https://flic.kr/p/2kdvAeH""&gt;solidified by&lt;/a&gt; Wyld Kyle of &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagged_Edge_(American_group""&gt;Jagged Edge&lt;/a&gt;) at the &lt;a href=""https://www.thetempletheatre.com/""&gt;Temple Theater&lt;/a&gt; in Meridian, MS for the &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/0GTEWLUw7_s?si=R7Gom6nrrCZIVXF8""&gt;King Russell Underground Southern Soul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""https://flic.kr/p/2kdrfcn""&gt;Awards&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, John embarked on a remarkable journey by introducing &amp;quot;DopeBoyBluez,&amp;quot; his self-branded project that showcased his unique fusion of R&amp;amp;B, blues, and rap. The hit debut single &amp;quot;&lt;a href=""https://music.apple.com/us/album/keep-dancing-feat-shawmichael-d-ray-single/905695481""&gt;Keep Dancing&lt;/a&gt;“,&amp;quot;&lt;a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/0elQWuC2uEDaDRk4FP4SQr""&gt;Swing-out&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;&lt;a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/6UYFeYeDcMQVMq5kPQcfFW""&gt;Came 2 Party&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; was just a glimpse of what was to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, John&amp;#39;s career reached new heights as he joined KISS 94.1fm Meridian MS and WZKD: The Big KD 94.1fm, affiliated with &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRROF_Lv4ms""&gt;King Russell Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; (KRE), a Sony/Universal music label now with Empire Records alongside Death Rose Records. KRE&amp;#39;s vision was to become the first Southern Soul label to secure Sony and Universal Distribution. John released &amp;quot;&lt;a href=""https://g.co/kgs/3Ti5o7""&gt;Sometimes she loves me&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; with King under Empire Distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite several challenges in this partnership, John&amp;#39;s unique sound gained attention from &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_Distribution""&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; and other associates like Slayer Promotions, and Army Veterans William Stokes and Mr. Clarence, &lt;a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Billy.S228/""&gt;Gulf Coast Promotions&lt;/a&gt; who are pivotal figures in their journey along the Gulf Coast Region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his pursuit of a major record deal, they crossed paths with Mr. Mike Boss of &lt;a href=""https://richnationent.com/artists/""&gt;Rich Nation Entertainment LLC /Universal Music Group/Virgin Music/Sony Music&lt;/a&gt;, offering them a Sony/Rich Nation deal. This deal was a critical turning point, poised to elevate John&amp;#39;s career to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John&amp;#39;s upcoming album promises to be a masterpiece of music that will stand the test of time. However, with rising fame comes its share of challenges. Navigating the complexities of the music industry and maintaining personal integrity is an ongoing journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As DopeBoyBluez continues to break free from the confines of conventional music and explores his revolutionary Southern Soul &amp;quot;Nubluez&amp;quot; sound, the future holds the promise of a groundbreaking era in music. John&amp;#39;s dedication, resilience, and unwavering passion for his craft define his extraordinary journey and legacy.&lt;/p&gt;

,Songwriters,I wrote this one back in 2018 or something like that. Its kinda emo in nature but im not a emo artist im a singer/song writer and story teller.

,thelumineers,"Hey there - I reached out to u/canopey a few weeks back looking for some advice and they recommended I just go ahead and ask the group. I just released a song and am now looking to spend advertising dollars to try and promote it. I ran a ""focus group"" test on the song through ReverbNation and the Lumineers was the band that got the most ""sounds like"" votes. But, as a fan of the Lumineers myself, I don't hear it. It could be that I'm just too close to it and perhaps the influence just comes through, but with my *very* limited budget, I'm trying to make smart moves. So, I wanted to ask impartial fans of the Lumineers what they thought. (Like...did Cleopatra seep too deep into my subconscious?)

Should I spend advertising dollars targeting Lumineers as a ""sounds like"" artist? If you're interested in sharing an opinion on something like that...this is the tune in question:

,WeAreTheMusicMakers,"I've spent most of my musical life performing in original rock bands. Because we're promoting original music, my projects are generally spread out across the web with a web site, Facebook, Instagram and maybe ReverbNation, along with an e-mailing list. Now I'm doing something new. I'm a guitarist / singer, and I've joined with a keyboardist / singer to form a duo performing mostly covers. You know those two over in the corner at the country club on a Friday night doing songs you know? That's what we're shooting for. I've performed in a few cover projects but never managed one, and what I'm trying to figure out is what kind of online presence we need.

I want an electronic press kit with song samples, a bio, and a list of upcoming shows. It seems like a full web site would be overkill in terms of expense and maintenance time. We're thinking of just pointing a domain to a ReverbNation account, and then maybe having a Facebook presence. Would that be enough? I fully admit I might not know what the latest tools are, but I'm looking for a fairly simple approach. This is a low-maintenance musical project, and I want to try to get the best bang for our time on this.

I think I already know the general consensus about the proposed topic, but figured I'd bring it up. I acquired a CD from a band that has virtually no online presence, aside from one song from this album on ReverbNation and a copy for sale on Ebay.

This copy I found has been sealed since it's release in 1996. So it proposes the question of keeping it sealed for potential collectability, or opening it to rip and upload, preserving the music (if it's not already lost quality due to age) since it's not online yet.

I have other rare CDs that are still sealed, but the music is already online so I don't need to open them.  This is the first time I've had to consider this.

,derby,"Hello, people of Derby!

About a year and a half ago I randomly stumbled upon [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QCufjsDWbI) beautiful and virtually unknown song. Really the first hidden gem I've ever found on my own. I shared it with some music subreddit and forgot about it, and now just rediscovered it. Listening through the album, Time and Tide, I'm really confused as to why there's virtually no existence of this band on the internet! Apparently this band first came about in the early eighties, then broke up and regrouped nearly two decades later around 2010, releasing Time and Tide. I guess the lead singer passed in the early 2010s, but I'm shocked that the most info I can find on this band comes from [this](https://www.forcedexposure.com/catalog/EM.1115LP.html) old, brief band description and [this](https://www.reverbnation.com/page_object/page_object_bio/artist_919285) random ReverbNation post.

I can't find any info on the label this album was released on, Tom Tom Music, nor any Wikipedia page- nothing substantial, really. I'm just so confused because the music is great and seemingly unknown, but if these posts are to be believed, then it must have been a pretty popular local Derby band.

&lt;p&gt;About a year and a half ago I randomly stumbled upon &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QCufjsDWbI""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; beautiful and virtually unknown song. Really the first hidden gem I&amp;#39;ve ever found on my own. I shared it with some music subreddit and forgot about it, and now just rediscovered it. Listening through the album, Time and Tide, I&amp;#39;m really confused as to why there&amp;#39;s virtually no existence of this band on the internet! Apparently this band first came about in the early eighties, then broke up and regrouped nearly two decades later around 2010, releasing Time and Tide. I guess the lead singer passed in the early 2010s, but I&amp;#39;m shocked that the most info I can find on this band comes from &lt;a href=""https://www.forcedexposure.com/catalog/EM.1115LP.html""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; old, brief band description and &lt;a href=""https://www.reverbnation.com/page_object/page_object_bio/artist_919285""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; random ReverbNation post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t find any info on the label this album was released on, Tom Tom Music, nor any Wikipedia page- nothing substantial, really. I&amp;#39;m just so confused because the music is great and seemingly unknown, but if these posts are to be believed, then it must have been a pretty popular local Derby band. I&amp;#39;m from across the water in New York, so I&amp;#39;d have no idea about their presence when they were around, but please tell me if you&amp;#39;ve heard of this band. I feel crazy being the only one who seems to have ever heard this great album.&lt;/p&gt;

In October 2013 - October 2014, the producer Lil Netzero (known as Yung Wulf until March 2014) would release music on SoundCloud pretty consistently. A good majority of his music has been found through re-uploads and other sites like VK, but some remain lost even though they had thousands of plays on SoundCloud.

02/03/2014 - ｉｎｆｒｉｎｇｅ (Feat. ≈goon≈)

03/11/2014 - \[+++\]

05/22/2014 - --&gt; ｄａ ｄｏｐｅ

06/02/2014 - 타키온 (Deathgrips remix)

07/20/2014 - ☁︎ 水少年タイプビート ☁︎ (Feat. jeffjupiter)

09/18/2014 - Floatz (Prod. By Mahxie x Lil Netzero)

\^ This is just a few lost tracks, some of which had up to 9,000+ plays. This is pretty niche so I doubt anyone here could help with this but anything would be appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

I've dug through a lot of sites already for re-uploads, such as:

SoundCloud, YouTube, VK, Internet Archive, mp3 . pm, ReverbNation, etc. These beats have been deleted off of his SoundCloud page since October 2014.

,BritneySpears,"EDIT: We FOUND IT!!!


I feel like i'm going crazy. In late 2020/early 2021, there was a leaked (?) Britney Spears song that popped up on youtube called F.I.R.E., with [this picture](https://www.deviantart.com/kallumlavigne/art/Britney-Spears-Glory-Vinyl-897995261) as a still the video. (So Glory Era maybe?) It was NOT from an official britney account, but I don't remember the name. The lyrics were ""F-I-R-E, Boy did you think that you could handle me? I'm burnin' up baby, turn down the heat."" The chorus was ""I'm on fire, every move that I make. I got the whole place heated when I wind my waist... DJ stop the record come on, give 'em a break."" It sounded like Britney. They lyrics are Britney's syntax, and it was a level of complexity and pop marketability only Britney could accomplish. And it's been completely scurbbed from the internet. I can't be losing my mind. Someone, somewhere has to have also seen that video or heard that song and knows what I'm talking about. I'd do anything to listen to that song again tbh.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Holy shit. I just found it.

Sort of.

The only record I can find of this song existing is this [""ReverbNation"" link,](https://www.reverbnation.com/cristalq/song/3339015-on-fire-prod-jr-rotem)and  [genius link,](https://genius.com/Ravaughn-im-on-fire-lyrics) which cites Makeba, RaVaughn and Sean Kingston as creators/contributes. I listened to the song; it's almost exactly what I heard. Almost. The production was slightly different. The singer was drastically different than the one I heard. Here's my theory: I think this is an ""On The Radio""/ ""S&amp;M"" situation. The song was shopped around to a couple different artists, Britney (or her team) liked it and recorded a single that she was unable to release due to the conservatorship/other circumstances. Either herself or an inside source leaked the song around the release of the documentary in 2021, and when it went fairly unnoticed/didn't get the attention it deserved, it was scrapped and the account/video went private.

If anyone has the Britney version though?

,DHExchange,"A friend of mine used to be in a band back in 2006-2009 or so. This band no longer exists, and was large enough to have played at a lot of venues, but didn't tour the country or anything.

Apparently, the studio recordings of most of the songs are hard to find, and I've only found 5 of them. I've filled the rest of the music they've made via live recordings, and tried to clean up the audio as best I can, but you can imagine vocals are always muddy, even if the music is clear there.

I imagine this is a long shot, but I was hoping someone had these archived. Seems most of the music was on Myspace, but given that they lost basically all music from 2008 or so to 2013, the tracks no longer exist, so playing them by clicking the controls doesn't do anything, because there's no file anymore.

I took what I found, and I made him a playlist, and he had tears in his eyes when he listened to it, so I would very much like to try and find the missing studio recordings.

My current archive of this is as follows:

,MusicPromotion,"I joined Reddit specifically to research music promotion and get community feedback with the hopes of learning and sharing along the way to help artists. This is a summary of my research so far.  Each one one of these points could be a separate discussion and maybe will. Right now, I’m interested in getting your feedback on tips and experiences for the overall strategy that could help the community:

First step is to prepare your music and marketing materials
-Make the best recording possible (duh! easier said than done. How did you do it?)
-identify your music and audience early (This will direct everything)
-Take artist photos and design graphics
-Write bios, music descriptions, what makes you unique? 
-Make Music videos (lots of questions for this)
-Create a press kit
-Pitch for Playlists

Prepare your marketing plan
-Identify platforms and prepare to submit (Spotify, Pandora, BandCamp, CD Baby, SoudCloud, ReverbNation, Apple Music, Deezer, Amazon Music,  Reddit)
-Create a Youtube Channel
-Design a website and email collection strategy (mailchimp for musicians vs Constant Contact?)
-Decide which songs to be released in what order
-Identify similar artists
-Identify playlists, blogs, radios, forums, etc.. that fit your profile

Budget your time and effort
- Create
-Contact, interact and build repour 
-Network with other artists
-Schedule your submissions 
-Reach to forums
-Reach out to Playlists
-interact with fans",t2_7stiove2,,,0,,What is your music promotion strategy?

,WeAreTheMusicMakers,"To give a little background, I’m an independent artist currently based in Los Angeles and I make a super blended brand of Alternative/Soul music. I’ve been operating as my own manager/rep for some years now and last year I released a string of singles, music videos, an EP, an album, won and International Songwriters Award, and completed a North American tour.

My goal for years has been to play more to an international audience and since I’ve finally got my passport (to do the Canadian dates on our tour last year), the borders of the world have finally opened up but I have no idea where to start to cross them.

I’m on a bunch of the sites (Gigmit, Reverbnation, SonicBids, IndieBible, etc) and I’ve become pretty proficient at Googling event contact info but I’m trying to find a way to get more solidified (preferably paid + lodging &amp; travel expenses) dates and the toughest thing for me so far has been getting solid dates without outside representation (even though a lot of my friends have had an insane amount of success in this arena).


TL;DR
I’m independent and self-managed with a steadily growing career but I want to do more paid shows outside of America.

Any advice? Is there anything in particular I should mention when I send out these emails?

,lostmedia,"I was just surfing on soundcloud a few years ago, and found 2 songs that stood out to me, on a page of a producer named Kyle Ritch (Ritch Records). They are from December 2013 and February 2014. They have the same artwork that says ""State Lines"" as the album's title and ""Trouble in Kansas"" as the band's name. One of the songs is named ""Cycles""but the other one does not have a name, only titled ""Trouble in Kansas - New Single (Unmastered)"". They both feature vocals from Jake Barnes. They are written by Danny Ravenhall. The metalcore band was from the UK. And nothing more is available about them. I tried contacting to all three parties about it, but I didn't get any responses on the topic.

&amp;#x200B;

Untitled new single has the lyrics on its description, but Cycles does not. I don't know if the album as a whole was ever released, cancelled or anything. There seems to be no information about it online. What do you think? What should I do to find what happened and/or other songs from the album?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, there is a facebok post from the singer's then-band The Final Chapter which previews the title ""We're not in Kansas Anymore"": [Link](https://www.facebook.com/thefinalchapterofficial/posts/643895778982061)

&amp;#x200B;

There is another even more mysterious song on the producer's page, and I'll post about it later. It's Contradictons by Beyond Vessels, but it's a different topic. Here are the links for Trouble in Kansas:

update: I've also found a [bandcamp page](https://troubleinkansas.bandcamp.com/music) with both songs (the untitled one is apparently titled We're not in Kansas Anymore), also with lyrics to both of them. they are higher quality and We're not in Kansas Anymore is now mastered. the page banner mentions a third song named ""Discourage"" that features Caleb Rodriguez. they have a [reverbnation page](https://www.reverbnation.com/troubleinkansas/videos) that has a now-unlisted preview for Discourage.",t2_164dty,,,0,,[partially lost] State Lines by Trouble in Kansas.,[],r/lostmedia,False,7.0,,,,,False,t3_10cnuny,False,dark,1.0,,public,,0.0,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},Music,False,1,,False,False,self,1673801690.0,,[],{},,True,,,text,7.0,,,text,self.lostmedia,False,,,,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,,,t5_38s0f,,,,#dadada,10cnuny,True,,denevue,,1,True,some_ads,False,,False,,/r/lostmedia/comments/10cnuny/partially_lost_state_lines_by_trouble_in_kansas/,some_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostmedia/comments/10cnuny/partially_lost_state_lines_by_trouble_in_kansas/,133759,1673799883.0,0,,False,,4136e81a-0db4-11ea-b2fd-0ee9113a70d3,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'Y-8xjZa10NDOum4EpOYisRWDNc3GfEnieDkTLG9lUFg', 'resolutions': [], 'source': {'height': 1, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/py9BdpPVXuz_9y2hpVru9I9x8g8RxFBDdHKnnf42ZdQ.jpg?auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8002d2c246d00a7c24e17a1ca8d239466f2f8dc3', 'width': 1}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,reverbnation,,,,,,1489304774.0,1676238634.0,,
,Lostwave,"I was just surfing on soundcloud a few years ago, and found 2 songs that stood out to me, on a page of a producer named Kyle Ritch (Ritch Records). They are from December 2013 and February 2014. They have the same artwork that says ""State Lines"" as the album's title and ""Trouble in Kansas"" as the band's name. One of the songs is named ""Cycles""but the other one does not have a name, only titled ""Trouble in Kansas - New Single (Unmastered)"". They both feature vocals from Jake Barnes. They are written by Danny Ravenhall. The metalcore band was from the UK. And nothing more is available about them. I tried contacting to all three parties about it, but I didn't get any responses on the topic.

&amp;#x200B;

Untitled new single has the lyrics on its description, but Cycles does not. I don't know if the album as a whole was ever released, cancelled or anything. There seems to be no information about it online. What do you think? What should I do to find what happened and/or other songs from the album?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, there is a facebok post from the singer's then-band The Final Chapter which previews the title ""We're not in Kansas Anymore"": [Link](https://www.facebook.com/thefinalchapterofficial/posts/643895778982061)

&amp;#x200B;

There is another even more mysterious song on the producer's page, and I'll post about it later. It's Contradictons by Beyond Vessels, but it's a different topic. Here are the links for Trouble in Kansas:

,makeaband,"Hello everyone. If you are into post-hardcore music, the sound of the 90s-early 2000s Emo Melodic Hardcore vibe, please get a hold of me and I will show you what we have worked on, and are heading towards. New album in the mix, fresh material for you to write originality for; all apart from one song which was written by me. I can't sing, so that would be the only one that's pretty much written from a personal experience. Of course, tweets and feedback is accepted, and you would always be able to shape it how you think could make it easier to sing or better, etc… We just lost our singer, and she moved on to another project. Not picky on age or gender, but there are a few requirements listed below.

Requirements: 

Dedication.. It is a must

Willing to travel eventually

Play live

We all live on the east coast; different states but within reach to one another. We use Discord to talk and do band get togethers. We make this work. We've been together a little over one year.

,Metalcore,"Not sure if this is the appropriate thread for this, but I stumbled across this band very recently during a Southerncore deep dive and would like to purchase their album. A Google search of this band only pulls up an old Facebook page with a few dead links and nothing else. I’ve check iTunes and ReverbNation, and neither have the track I’m looking for. I’m happy to pay for their EP/LP if it still exists. Any help would be appreciated. 

I’m including a link for the track that peaked my interest. It cuts out right when it’s about to get heavy. :(

Tuy nhiên không phải ai cũng biết về mask đất sét. Trong bài viết dưới đây giúp các chị em cách sử dụng mask đất sét đúng cách. Cùng theo dõi nhé!  


#### 1. Mặt nạ đất sét là gì?

Mặt nạ đất sét được làm từ các loại đất sét, có khả năng hấp thụ dầu và vi khuẩn, mang lại cho người dùng làn da sạch sẽ và thông thoáng hơn. Từ đó giúp da điều trị mụn trứng cá và mang lại cho bạn làn da căng mịn, trẻ trung hơn.

📷  


Đất sét được sử dụng trong mặt nạ đất sét thường có độ pH âm, trong khi da của chúng ta có độ pH dương, nên dầu và tạp chất sẽ bị hút vào đất sét, cũng như cuốn trôi khi bạn rửa sạch mặt.

#### 2. Thành phần của mặt nạ đất sét

Mặt nạ đất sét là 1 loại mặt nạ được làm từ thành phần đất sét có trong tự nhiên, gồm các khoáng chất như sắt, canxi, kẽm, magie...

**3. Hướng dẫn cách dùng mask đất sét**

Bước 1: Làm sạch da mặt bằng tẩy trang và sữa rửa mặt trước.

Bước 2: Dùng cọ quét đất sét và thoa đều hỗn hợp lên mặt.

Bước 3: Để đất sét trong khoảng 5 - 10 phút. Đối với các loại da nhạy cảm, thoa trong 3 - 5 phút.

Bước 4: Trước khi đất sét gần khô trên da, rửa sạch.

Bước 5: Tiếp tục dưỡng da các bước tiếp theo như thường ngày bạn vẫn làm.

,musicianfinder," My name is Suzanne Brooks, vocalist, bandleader and songwriter of The Jazz Generation band, based in Sacramento; originally from Philadelphia, PA. The Jazz Generation began in 2003. Still have the same great pianist. Musicians who can play one, two or all three of the key instruments are welcome, so are women musicians. 

Through the years, The Jazz Generations has had great musicians. Lately, the challenge is that we have a large repertoire, mostly in jazz, but also in other genres--blues, pop, gospel, Latin, soft rock, etc. We have begun a major advertising and publicity campaign but can't accept bookings until we have the right musicians to cover the gigs/concerts and other work as it becomes available. 

Interested in doing more than bar and restaurant gigs, though we do them if the pay is fair. Also do original musical stage shows which have a narrator/script, such as ""Great Women of Jazz, History of Music, 1890-1990"" which we performed for the 5th time for the Regional MENSA organization in November, 2021 at the San Jose Holiday Inn. We also do themed events such as Roaring Twenties or Harlem Renaissance or based on particular decades. I speak &amp; sing in Spanish and some other languages.

We are serious musicians, not a party band. Our idea of fun is rehearsals and excellent music. Would this be of interest to you? You can find us on many sites including https://www.thebash.com/jazz-band/suzanne-brooks-the-jazz-generation and youtube.com.

We are no longer on Reverbnation but ranked #1 locally &amp; regionally there for over 10 consecutive years in jazz. We have 12 CDs, have recorded 8 in my studio here which I am in the process of converting to a live/video streaming studio &amp; stage. Our musicians are easy going, no substance or social issues.

,WeAreTheMusicMakers,"I have sent one track of mine to review on Drooble and ReverbNation. I got mostly constructive reviews, I can see that something like 20% of them are probably bots but the rest looked like people who listened my entire track.

I got a decent score on both the platform and I was wondering if I should take them seriously. Any of you has experience or knows more about these services? on the website they say that their reviews are genuine and unbiased but of course that’s what they’ll say. 

Do you think a good score on these platform might predict a positive outcome to an eventual Spotify promotion like PlaylistPush, Groover, etc, for my song?

,WeAreTheMusicMakers,"After seeing the massive decline in Facebook and Instagram growth/market share/user engagement this year, as well as the never-ending dramas surrounding TikTok and Twitter, I'm wondering if these platforms are no longer required to be a successful musician (or if they ever were)?

Between 2016-2020, I was on all four apps, growing my following, but for the past year, I've stopped using all four platforms and now focus on YouTube/Bandcamp/Soundcloud/Spotify/Reddit/Reverbnation/Email to keep fans and listeners up to date with me and my music. 

I feel that the *content wars* have watered down a lot of independent music, and since refraining from posting to every social media platform multiple times a day/week/month, to now never, it makes my music and lyrics all the more personal and better, as I'm not putting my life on show constantly just because the internet and some hustler told me to, and instead am putting all of that time and energy directly into music and promotion.

I've seen more free engagement from my YouTube channel via Reverbnation in the past two years than any engagement elsewhere (50k views + 2.5k subscribers). Spotify is great with playlisting services that you can find online (both free and paid) as well. I don't encourage anyone who is succeeding to stop using mainstream social media - if a service works for you then great, however, I believe it's **vital** to understand where your audience is at, and where best to reach them.

I'd like to have a discussion about this, and whether I can be convinced to fire up ye old smart-phone once more, since several people have been saying that I won't have a career if I'm no longer on Facebook/Instagram/TikTok/Twitter.

Let's talk about it.

,vundabores,"Hey'all I thought I'd share this discovery of older music since Vundabois are turning 10 tomorrow, stumbled upon this about a year ago when browsing Brandon's SoundCloud, but forgot to ever share it here.

Brandon's Soundcloud holds a couple classic Vundabar demos but there's also a song under the band name ""No Nada"".

[https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/brandon-steven-hagen\/no-nada-juan-is-gone](https://preview.redd.it/tvz5siojn2o91.png?width=1227&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4aa96858fe5b216588add0f19393f563ebd03388)

This is from the EP ""Did They Mention The Praha?"" released in 2012 under the same name. The rest of the tracks aren't available publicly anymore but an archive of the original band camp page exists: [https://web.archive.org/web/20130706033926/http://nonada.bandcamp.com/](https://web.archive.org/web/20130706033926/http://nonada.bandcamp.com/)

From my understanding the band was active from 2007 until the subsequent creation of Vundabar in 2012 where member's came and left.

After some digging I managed to come across a page which host's three more songs from No Nada available to listen to: [https://www.reverbnation.com/nonada?popup\_bio=true](https://www.reverbnation.com/nonada?popup_bio=true) :)

Tracks include: The Fuzz, Rat Race, These Folks Must Be Goats and Lady.

Other bits of No Nada media I found:

This YouTuber and his videos are more than a little suspicious. 

First of all, how big of a narcissist do you have to be to name yourself after the founder of a major world religion in this manner? A founder who is held by his followers to be God Himself. Just think about that for a moment. And, should you be a Christian yourself, also think about how downright _blasphemous_ this is. 

This person's videos show little evidence of compassion or empathy for the victims or their families. Rather, they seem to revel in the violence and horror of the murders, making frequent use of deeply creepy imagery and juxtaposing it with religious iconography. It's like they're trying to create their own gory, horrific religious denomination based on the murders of two teenage girls.

This person was also writing songs about the murders as far back as 2017:

https://www.reverbnation.com/TrueCrimeJesus

The title ""Bridge Hunter"" suggests making prey of humans, and I'm surely not alone in finding some of the lyrical content in ""Libby's Song"" disturbing, in particular the reference to drowning.

_And remember this person was writing these songs back in 2017, practically the day after the murders._

Moreover, take a good look at this illustration, which is featured prominently on his ReverbNation page:

https://ibb.co/KLh7674

Why would _anyone_ want to associate the murders of Abby and Libby with the Pied Piper of Hamlin? The story of the Pied Piper is a tale of revenge, where a man who feels he is wronged by a town gets even with the townspeople by stealing away their children.

_WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?_

What kind of a twisted commentary is this person making on the murders of Abby and Libby by associating the crime with the Pied Piper?

Is he suggesting that the murders were an act of vengeance--perhaps (in his mind at least) a justified one, in line with that of the Pied Piper?

,Songwriting,"So, I play 2-4 gigs a month and get paid a few hundred bucks apiece for them, nothing near enough to become a professional, but I thought I'd take some of that money and reinvest it in my music and delve into the wide world of music marketing services. I'm posting my results here for others who are thinking of paying to promote their music. I also would love any advice from those who have done this sort of thing 

To begin, as noted in my title, Playlist Push is a complete scam. I repeat, DO NOY WASTE YOUR MONEY ON PLAYLIST PUSH. I paid them $300 to send a song to their list of ""curated playlists"" the song got put on zero playlists. That's right, 300 dollars for literally nothing. Worse, I got many responses from playlist owners that the song was really good but didn't fit the style of their playlist. So why did Playlist Push send to them? What a joke, so much for ""curated."" Even worse, I sent the exact same song to 15 playlist curators via Submithub and got 2 accepted. So I got about a 10% acceptance rate -- versus 0% -- doing it myself, and more importantly only cost about $20 worth of credits to do so on Submit Hub. If you take one thing away from this post PLEASE DON'T USE PLAYLIST PUSH!

Some other services I used to varying degrees of success:

OmariMC, which claims to get you guaranteed listens. I used their ""bronze""  tier which for $77 says they will get your song 500-5000 plays on spotify. Mine got 1200 as of now, so that's nice. I'm under no illusion that 1200 people actually listened to my song, I'm sure they use bots, but at least I got something to show for my money, unlike Playlist Push.

I decide to use twitter ads, boosting a tweet I sent that had a link to the song. I spent 100 bucks to boost for 5 days. While the tweet got over 100 likes it only got 1 rewteet, resulted in only 1 new follower and had only  13 clickthroughs on the link to the song. So, not great.

I also paid 25 bucks through Reverbnation to have a ""digital ad"" show up on Facebook and other social media platforms. Unfortunately these ads lead those who click on it to your reverbnation page and not spotify/youtube etc and i have no idea how to monetize reverbnation. I also don't trust their statistics; they claim I am the 33rd most popular artist in my region; Well I am in the NYC region and I seriously doubt with all the signed/professional musicians in the NYC area plus the thousands of unsigned acts that I am number 33. But the ad did get 40-50 people to listen to songs on my reverb nation page. For 25 bucks, probably the best value of all the things I did.

I wanted to post this to give real life examples to those who are considering paying for a music promotion service. I was able to reinvest my extra money from gigs into this, but I know many musicians do not have the extra 5-600 bucks to throw at promotion so wanted to help anyone thinking about it. Definitely avoid Playlist Push at all costs. I guess for value the reverbnation ad and submit hub got the best bang for my buck. Omari delivered on what they promised, but I suspect they use bots.

BandLab Acquires ReverbNation and Intergrates Tools Into their Platform

I first discovered BandLab when they announced the purchase of Sonar Platinum from Gibson after Gibson discontinued the popular DAW. Bandlab immediately released Sonar Platinum (Cakewalk by Bandlab) as a free download when you signup for a free Bandlab account. In addition to the Free DAW they also created a complete suite of online tools that assists songwriters and musicians in creating music and creating a collaborative environment. Since the purchase of Cakewalk  sonar  and it’s release Bandlab has continued to develop the DAW with continued Updates.

FAR-LEFT POLITICIANS LAWYERS TRINITY CLERGY JESUS ALLAH LOVERS LGBTQ JEALOUSY &amp; REBELLIOUSNESS WILL GET YOU THE DEATH PENALTY FOR TREASON

Luke 10:25
One day an expert (Rome's Praetorian Predatory Homosexual SCRIBE' in the law) stood up to test Him. (Christ Jesus) ... “Teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”

He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?

And he answering said

Thou shalt love The Lord God Almighty with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.

Leviticus 18:5
Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD GOD ALMIGHTY


None of you are to approach any close relative to have sexual relations. I am the LORD GOD ALMIGHTY

Romans 13:9

For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love
thy neighbour as thyself.

not bad

Well. Here's the bad news. Whether it's Evernote's fault, or Gmails or your forgotten one time sub to ReverbNation back in 2013, it doesn't matter. Your data is out there. 

Check your email security via [https://haveibeenpwned.com/](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) . That means, sinking ships like Evernote, where management walked out last year, and whoever and whatever is left it's at half mast or lower. 

I found out the very hard way. 

I had two crypto wallet passwords in EN. 

EN got hacked—it looks like a coordinated effort—and my life savings got nicked. 

According to EN it's not their fault as ""someone learned my email and password."" The email, maybe. Seems nearly everyone's fucking email is compromised. But the password, no. It was strong, and only ever kept in 1Password. If 1Password has been hacked then there is no hope. 

Anyway. The point is, Evernote used to be okay about 5 years ago. Then they clouded it up and the basic product became an absolute dog. On top of that **IT IS NOT SECURE.** Likely the email you use to login to EN is compromised. Whether they can scrape the password from EN servers, as they seem to have done last year, or whether they scrape it from somewhere else, EN seems to be a sitting duck on the hacker bucket list.

## 1. Bảng lương ADP là gì?

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/s1g8tsahswx71.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9af8ef6f303d727b101e53c4f96fe1691f61bedb)

**Bảng lương ADP** là thước đo dự báo tăng trưởng việc làm của tháng trước, không bao gồm lĩnh vực nông nghiệp của nền kinh tế Mỹ. Chỉ số ADP được thực hiện bởi một tổ chức tư nhân là Automatic Data Processing, thông qua việc phân tích 400.000 khách hàng mà họ đã cung cấp dịch vụ.

Chỉ số này có vai trò rất quan trọng, được phát hành hai ngày trước báo cáo tình hình việc làm của Cục thống kê Lao động, và sau khi nó được phát hành thì bản tin chính thức được công bố vào thứ sáu đầu tiên của mỗi tháng.

,Lostwave,"hi everyone. i was planning on posting this on r/FondMyMind but that subreddit is pretty quiet. anyways, here are my thoughts on the song, and if any of these have been taken into consideration already, please let me know.

• this song seems to have been pretty popular in brazil (who were really influenced by euro/italodance) especially in the night club scene, hence why a lot of brazilians recognise it. if this is the case, fond my mind would most likely be in a 90s eurodance compilation album.
• if the song was popular there, or wherever else it was played, that could possibly mean the song could be somewhere on youtube, similar to 3D a fish in sea, who were apparently popular in their hometown, as stated on their reverbnation account.
• i’m almost certain that this is italodance. i’m a huge baltimora fan, and when comparing the singers’ accents, they do sound the same, the only difference is that the singer on FMM sounds like they have a stronger italian accent, and jimmy (the frontman in baltimora) is irish. although, i’m not sure whether he’s the singer or if it’s mauricio (another member of the band).
• have any djs from transamerica been found? if so, has anyone been contacted? they could perhaps provide us with audits, or tell us anything they know.

if any (or all) of these points have been discussed already, and if this seems useless, i apologise in advance. i feel like this song is close to being identified, yet really far. i hope it’s identified though.",t2_4f4ce05c,,,0,,My thoughts on fond my mind,[],r/Lostwave,False,6.0,,,,,False,t3_qndl33,False,dark,1.0,,public,,0.0,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},,False,14,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,,text,6.0,,,text,self.Lostwave,False,,,,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,,,t5_2ybxi,,,,,qndl33,True,,BruhhTaylorr,,2,True,all_ads,False,,False,,/r/Lostwave/comments/qndl33/my_thoughts_on_fond_my_mind/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lostwave/comments/qndl33/my_thoughts_on_fond_my_mind/,10185,1636126143.0,0,,False,,,,,,,,,reverbnation,1656107908.0,,,,,1566406376.0,1656107908.0,,

,u_ParisDeloveMusic,"Paris Delove is an Australian Singer/Songwriter born in Melbourne Victoria. Paris began writing her own music at the young age of eleven. Delove admits to feeling like a misfit as a child and music was a creative outlet for her to cope with growing up. Paris writes all her music from personal experiences, most of her music comes from her own heartbreaks. Paris is a cathartic writer and has produced most of her music. She began uploading her songs onto Reverbnation and Soundcloud, as well as YouTube. Her early music was cheesy and at times comedic, her first single “Cheeseburger” is a song Paris wrote about societies standards. “I wasn’t very serious at first, I didn’t care too much about being taken seriously. I didn’t really know what I was doing at first but my music evolved into its own thing.” - Paris Says.  “Cheeseburger” was a top 40 single. 

Paris’s first album “Wild Hearted Crazy Bitch” was released in 2018, the same year Paris left high school. The album wasn’t a commercial success but did have a number one single “Once a Cheater, Always a Liar!” Her first album was released with many catchy pop songs such as “Sue Me” a top ten single Peaking a #4. And The final single “Rich Kids Go To Parties” was never a chart hit but was a well received single. Delove promoted “Wild Hearted Crazy Bitch” on her Instagram account and filmed three music videos that were posted on her YouTube channel. 

Paris is a child of four, and her parents divorced when she was nine. She was born on the 17th of September 2001 making her star sign Virgo. Paris has been known to be a rare individual. It’s very obvious listening to her music she’s a hopeless romantic, She’s released many songs about high school heartbreak including “Fairytale” a number one pop single from her second studio album “Even Rebel Hearts Break” “my whole life I’ve felt I was always in the wrong place, heartbreak followed me around a lot as a teenager with my parents divorced and boys breaking my heart” - Paris says. 

Paris is not just a comedic artist tho, Paris has released extremely vulnerable work. Her single “Kissing Strangers” is about the lonely feeling we all experience after a break up “the hoe faze” - Paris quoted. She also has a track “I Said No” from her second album that was written about a sexual assault she experienced in high school when she was 16. “People think I’m a funny person because my music represents that, but I’m actually a very hurt person, and I’m healing. I’ve laughed my way through a lot of my trauma so I don’t have to feel anything.” She admitted. 

Paris is also an Advocate for bullying. She was bullied her entire school life, she left school In 2018 after her peers signed a petition for her to end her life. It’s very obvious that Paris is a resilient character. She also admitted to growing up in a chaotic household. “My whole life I was told who I should be, my friends and family told me to change myself to make others comfortable, and that sometimes washes over me.” Paris opened up about. 

Paris continued releasing music until the age of twenty, she announced her retirement from social media and music on the 25th of August 2021 via Instagram. Paris is a spiritual woman and advocates “living in realness” she left music with four albums to her name and eleven number one singles.",t2_fbhi6l5q,,,0,,Paris Delove Biography,[],u/ParisDeloveMusic,False,,,,,,False,t3_q536h1,False,dark,1.0,,user,,0.0,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,,text,,,,text,self.ParisDeloveMusic,False,,,qa,,,True,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,,,t5_55oayx,,,,,q536h1,True,,ParisDeloveMusic,,0,True,,False,,False,,/r/u_ParisDeloveMusic/comments/q536h1/paris_delove_biography/,,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ParisDeloveMusic/comments/q536h1/paris_delove_biography/,0,1633850016.0,0,,False,,,,,,,,,reverbnation,1656130519.0,,,,,1633849795.0,1656130519.0,,

,singing," I was wondering if anyone has had experience working with ReverbNation Label department called Reverb Records. I recently applied for a ReverbNation add for a opportunity but found out that I was not chosen which is disappointing, however I had a email from ReverbNation label department which offers services to artist who want to advance their career.

Website is: [https://www.reverb-records.com/](https://www.reverb-records.com/) 

it looks great! they even have partnerships with several companies like Universal and have worked with several major artists, So I just wanted to know what people's experience was? from a independent artist perspective. 

Many Thanks

Now, to complicate things, on ABQ Craigslist, I see people using Reverbnation.  This mostly seems to be for Rock / Dadrock bands, but you never know.

It's my job to take the black and white keys and change them into a million colours. Fancy a piano, organ, singing or vocal coach course that isn't too heavy on 'reading the dots' but is holistic and teaches you all the skills in one go? Playing, making and singing from the beginning. Former no. 1 in UK Reverbnation Charts, no. 33 Globally/

Suitable for ages 5-99, from beginners through to diplomas (yes, I teach loads of adults so this is your de-stress time too!)!

According to his introduction of himself on reverbnation: ""I put my first hot songs out in 1986, 87 in California, all up and down the coast of Cali from San Diego to San Francisco, then in Memphis. In 1992 my cousins and I put out two hit cd's with 16 songs each on them and was suppose to have gotten a record deal around the same time as Three Six Mafia received its first deal. In 95 I did receive a record deal with Frankie Gaye / June Scott / Belgium Records... That album sold for six years ""Bloodline, Dream Screams and Nightmares. ""

,Wordpress,"So i'm in WordPress 5.7.2
I wanted to make a site to host some of my music (not professional, just like doing it for fun).

Downloaded one template to make a website for music, and it said to add an album of your music, to just use WordPress itself. Go to the Media tab and upload music files and make a playlist. Well Wordpress has gone away with that. So then someone else said the workaround is to use some code to display it using the ID numbers for the songs you have in the Media tab in WordPress. That doesn't work. 

Then i decided to look at the Blocks Wordpress has, and one of them is for ReverbNation. So i make an account on ReverbNation, upload song songs, make an album, and go to copy and paste the direct url link into the prompt WordPress asks me when adding a ReverbNation block, and it fails. Found out it works if i put the direct link to a single song, but it fails when i do the direct link for an album. 

so then reverb nation has an embed link for embedding the album. great. so i copy that and go into wordpress and make a block for HTML, copy and paste the code, and nothing. it just displays the code.

it literally seems like i've done everything i can to just embed or upload an album of songs to wordpress, and it seems like wordpress is doing everything in it's power to prevent me from doing this. 

how on earth am i doing any of this wrong? has anyone else been able to do it using WordPress 5.7.2? It should have worked before they updated and added these blocks but now i can't find any workarounds to get anything up and going.",t2_dtgwo,,,0,,How do I add a Music Playlist (my album) into wordpress 5.7.2?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'How to?'}]",,False,6.0,ho,,,,False,t3_nbk46x,False,dark,1.0,,public,,0.0,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},How to?,,2,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,,richtext,6.0,,,text,self.Wordpress,False,,,,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],,False,True,False,False,,[],,,,,t5_2qhjq,,,,,nbk46x,True,,bradhotdog,,7,True,all_ads,False,,False,,/r/Wordpress/comments/nbk46x/how_do_i_add_a_music_playlist_my_album_into/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/nbk46x/how_do_i_add_a_music_playlist_my_album_into/,140001,1620921879.0,0,,False,,e89c0954-54ce-11e4-9181-12313d1a260d,,,,,,,reverbnation,1623504685.0,,,,,1383860477.0,,,

,russian,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share how I learned Russian, the structure I used, resources, and tips and tricks for effective learning. I've been studying Russian for about 3 years now and am now learning Italian via Russian. I will probably add to this thread with more helpful stuff so stay tuned :)

# Step 1 - Learning the Alphabet

There is an app called '[Russian Cyrillic in 3 Hours](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/russian-cyrillic-in-3-hours/id762218971)' that was super effective for me. I spread the 3 hours over 30 minute increments throughout a week and was able to read and sound out Russian Cyrillic in no time. Highly recommend.

If 3 hours is too long you can try using this PDF (which is kinda comical) called [Learn to Read Russian in 15 Minutes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QWfQ46I8KERsxYbp1E-_r4WH8fLbniAi/view?usp=sharing) (links to the PDF on my Google Drive). I found it was better to use as a supplement after using the aforementioned app.

# Step 1A (Optional) - Learn Cursive

For those interested in learning to read and write in Russian Cyrillic Cursive, I am attaching a link of a worksheet to practice writing. It can be pretty tricky and the best way is to just practice at a regular, consistent basis

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wfGhL1hgpgCd1oPlW9wTYQtEWDORa7dH/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wfGhL1hgpgCd1oPlW9wTYQtEWDORa7dH/view?usp=sharing)

# Step 2 - Learn Vocabulary

Now that you can read, now you need the vocabulary to understand what the words you are reading mean! For this I recommend:

* [Memrise App (Paid)](https://www.memrise.com/)\- uses studied and proven neuroscience techniques for you to learn and acquire a new language.
* [Quizlet (Free)](https://quizlet.com/en-gb) \- great for creating flashcards. You can search for specific vocabulary lists or create your own!
* [DuoLingo (Free / Paid)](https://www.duolingo.com/) \- The Classic
* [Mondly (Paid)](https://www.mondly.com/) \- Similar to DuoLingo but with the added benefit of additional language support (This is what I'm using to study Italian using Russian)
* [LingQ](https://www.lingq.com/) \- Community created lessons. Good for supplementing another app
* [Babel](https://try.babbel.com/) \- Another flavour of DuoLingo / Mondly. (Sorry if I am oversimplified this)

# Step 3 - Learn the Grammar

Okay, so you should be aware of the Russian cases before you dive into the vocabulary to much just so you're aware of what you're looking at.

Please, please, please! Use the following case chart! It is amazing and I used it all the time when I first started learning!! Even if you don't know what it all means starting out, just pin it on your wall, set it as your background, tack it to your ceiling above your pillow at night, just have it somewhere and use it as a reference. You'll thank me later

[Russian Case Chart](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U3DEuUiYtdqng8uYeTBzfo_tuUL6LiYs/view?usp=sharing)

Okay now that you have the chart, you can go back and use one of the language learning apps and see how the language is applied. When you're ready for more, I recommend working through this series on YouTube ([https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcqadbwW8gPcUW3h2I1BGJg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcqadbwW8gPcUW3h2I1BGJg)). He is a great instructor and provides amazing explanations. Just be careful biting off more than you can chew! The best way is to study one case, even if it's just the singular aspect, and practice applying it until you have a firm understanding of how to use it. It takes time for Russian Grammar to digest and it's arguably the hardest part of Russian so don't beat yourself up if you don't get it all in one day/week/month/year. You can do it and persistence is key!

# Step 4 - Immersion!

It is almost (almost) impossible to learn a language when you are not receptive to learning it. It's going to take more than reading textbooks and doing active learning to truly absorb the language. You will need to find ways to incorporate your hobbies and interests. So figure out what those are and research how you can Russify them. Here are some resources you might find helpful:

New:

* [BBC Russian](https://www.bbc.com/russian)
* [EuroNews](https://www.euronews.com/) (Great because they have the audio transcript below the video so you can follow along)
* [DW](https://www.dw.com/ru/%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BC%D1%8B-%D0%B4%D0%BD%D1%8F/s-9119) (German news company)
* [1TV.ru](https://www.1tv.ru/) (Russian based news company)

Music:

* [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com/) (I enjoy finding a song I like and then creating a radio station from it)
* [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/)
* [ReverbNation](https://www.reverbnation.com/main/search) (for those who love unsigned bands)
* [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/)

Movies / TV Shows

* [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/) (Check out the [google chrome plugin for language learners!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/language-learning-with-ne/hoombieeljmmljlkjmnheibnpciblicm?hl=en) Provides both english and RU translations for shows to help facilitate language learning! Kudos to Netflix!!)
* [Hulu](https://www.hulu.com/)

# Step 5 - Write! And then Think! And Finally, Repeat!

This step will take some self initiative and can be kind of difficult. What I mean by 'Write!' is write out things that you routinely do during your day. Is your morning routine always the same? Write out what you do, look up those special words like brush your teeth or comb your hair. Find someone who can check your work to make sure you're on the right track. 'And then Think' in Russian! Start thinking about it while you're doing it... getting up and brushing your teeth. Start being more present in the moment and think of how you would say something in Russian. Describe a landscape to yourself in Russian, think what you need to do for the day in Russian. The more repetition you have, the more the stuff will stick.

Some helpful resources for looking up vocabulary

* [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) \- Good ole google
* [Yandex](https://translate.yandex.com/) \- Russian Google Flavor
* [Reverso Context](https://context.reverso.net/translation/english-russian/) \- Great for looking up expressions and seeing words in context

# Step 6 Challenge yourself and stay positive!

Everyday won't be rainbows and butterflies. You will hit that grammar wall where you just don't understand. But never, never, beat yourself up! Learning any language is a hell of an experience and will better prepare to be a life long learner and improve many other areas of your life! Continue to challenge yourself, approach your obstacles from different angles, and reach out when you need help. Positivity and rest do wonders for how much information you retain.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this thread helps at least one person. Please reach out to me if you need any help learning Russian. If I don't know the answer, we will find out together. Please post any additional resources that helped you, I love adding things to my list :)

Best of luck, you got this!

## How to Start a Career in Music Production

## Finance Options

The money comes first. And we must support our weight in this world. Because it cost us to produce all things in life, we use the stock market. We also use credit before spending the cash we save from the music industry jobs that we work. This cycle works for now in 2021. However, we intend to work until forces make us retire. And we plan to have money when we need it the most. Here are a few websites to check out so that you can get your money right.

## Production Gear

It helps to start small and work your way up. However, you can have all of the equipment at once and still learn how to use it. When you start small, the details are easier to get. And it helps you know at a faster pace. As you train your sound, the gear grows with you because you know how to use the stuff you buy. Or, you can also hire the pros. We are out here. These are some places that you can shop for production gear. All of these companies are in business as of 2021.

They host websites and give you themes to start using, so you may want to look at them. You can also find a ton of other ways to get WP when you look around the web.

## Social Networks

It helps to be the right person on purpose. Your site grows from the social networks you create. And your network grows as you deliver on the promises you make. If you do not make promises, then you are going to miss out more often than not. First, you can start by offering help, tips, and advice. Then use your website to stay connected with those who respond. Finally, deliver on what you blog on your site. From there, you can track your growth.

### Using Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for Marketing

I have learned that it is better to work smarter than before. If you leave notes on a blog, make pages to mark and collect. Search engines will find your site and share it with the world. You can find tons of search tools that deliver sites to users who look for them. And even more, companies provide the services. So, you do not have to blog if you can buy them. However, you can learn to write a blog yourself too. In Either case, you win because the guests come to your site from search engines.

### Selling Your Beats, Songs, and Merchandise for Profit

The most common question we hear is, ""How much should I charge for my beats?"" And the most common answer you can find is, ""Charge what you like."" That is not the correct reply to have for this question. It would be best if you charged what it takes to make your money back. And you need to know how much it cost you to make beats. Then divide that number between the ones you plan to serve. 

Please choose a real number of folks that you can reach in thirty days. It does not help you to leave this number open to whatever. You can change the price anytime you choose to do so. The products belong to you until you sell them out in total. Lease your beats based on the answer to the problem above.

## How to Start a Career in Music Production

I have learned a ton on Reddit. And faith is of high value that makes me that I am. So, I stay to find ways to give back. This post is to help the solemn. To start a music career means being ready to do it now. And it helps to allow your clients to pay the way they wish. As long as the cash spends in places that you shop, then you are good to take it for your products, is what I say. Having the guts to ask for a fair price is a skill that you learn. With practice, you become a master at it. And the strange feeling goes away when you find the right asking price. I hope to clear this up for some of you. 

Please make sure to ask your questions if you have them. As you may spawn a new post like this one, I will reply to each of you if the need is there. I do not claim to have all of the answers that you seek. And I do not work at home during the day. However, I do not mind doing the homework it takes to know things. I have also worked in music jobs for more than twenty years. After the first wave of sickness hit in 2020 America, much of my employment was no more. Going from 5 places to 1 place to work, now I have time to share some insight. Soon though, I will have to go back to work more often. And I may not post again for a while. 

### Start a Career in Music Production Today

If you are willing to wait now, then you may as well wait tomorrow too. Then you can sit around and let the time pass more days after that. Since you are at it, you may as well stop reading this post. Just do not buy a thing until you are ready to move, not even gear. This hobby is expensive. I recommend that you keep the setup small if you are starting to learn. It is more valuable to know how to make songs than to make money as a hobbyist. Move to a career position when you want to try out a place.

Because we do not want to waste your time, music should stay a hobby for you at first. Until you are to make moves now, this path is a mere plan. No one in business wants to wait when they are ready to go. Time is a force that moves on its own accord. So, it does not wait for us to catch up to it. We must take steps to move at the pace that time sets for us or faster. And it helps to make a plan to move on. However, if you take too long on this stage, then you are not trying. Instead, you are dreaming.

And as music pursuers, we collect and share the songs that we like. It is not a thing that we try; it is a goal that we reach. We want the pieces to use for projects that we make. Also, the web designs we build do not wait. Our clients want to grow a fanbase now. We spend big money to make it all work. And these are some of the items you can find that we ask that our clients have before they move past the hobby.

### In Conclusion

I wish there were the time for me to go into it all. But, I must get back to my daily earnings. If you want to know more, you can leave a post here. I do not mind returning to this topic to clear things up for you.

,DirtyHoney,"Hey everybody,

As we await the new album (rather impatiently), I just wanted to throw some resources out there if any of you want to listen to the band's progression over the years.

Quick backstory: Months ago when at a bar with some friends (one of which asked me to blast some Dirty Honey on TouchTunes), I noticed that there were a few songs from the Capital Records Studio Session appearing, the list of which can be found here at the following link:

[https://open.spotify.com/album/6VHWcednViuZmXk5OmUzE0?highlight=spotify:track:35Uu9kjF9TfMDRzcchTrEd](https://open.spotify.com/album/6VHWcednViuZmXk5OmUzE0?highlight=spotify:track:35Uu9kjF9TfMDRzcchTrEd)

Obviously, this was the session where ""Fire Away"" was recorded (and I think we all love that song). I was able to actually play another song from that session ""Falling for You"", and it was awesome. A while later when re-visiting the same bar and playing it again, I started down a rabbit hole to try and find any working link to listen to the rest. To this day, I still haven't been able to as they seem to have *completely* locked it down. While doing extensive digging to find these tracks though, I discovered that Dirty Honey as we know it previously existed in one form or another as a band called ""**Ground Zero**"" and for a brief time in more recent history, ""**The Shags**"". I discovered that they were The Shags through my search for the song ""Mercy"" (part of the above mentioned Capitol Records Session) and an old John Notto interview where he mentioned that part of their history. You can find Mercy performed at the following link:

[https://vimeo.com/172454611](https://vimeo.com/172454611)

Ground Zero, however, is as far back as I could easily trace any form of the band. The content is scattered, but you can find 4 of the songs (Where the Wind Blows, Blackcherry, Devil's Eyes, and Forever) at the following link:

[https://soundcloud.com/ground-zero-la/tracks](https://soundcloud.com/ground-zero-la/tracks)

There are more on ReverbNation but unfortunately most of the additional songs are just short snips. There are 2 full-length songs though, ""Let's Party"" and a cover of ""Come Together"" that completely rocks. Link below:

[https://www.reverbnation.com/groundzerola/song/14524843-lets-party-live](https://www.reverbnation.com/groundzerola/song/14524843-lets-party-live)

At the bottom is ""State of Mind"" which I would absolutely love to hear a full studio version of. There is a live video from 2012 on John Notto's YouTube channel of it being played at the following link:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl5FhHjdEig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl5FhHjdEig)

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone else have any history or additional tracks to share? At some point when I have some free time I may continue my search!

,musicproduction,"So a friend of mine suggested that I get an Electronic Press Kit together for marketing and promotion purposes. I'm a bit confused as to what that entails, whether I already have one, or what the best ones are, so I thought I'd reach out here.

For background purposes, I have an EP released via DistroKid. When I researched what the best EPKs are, the name that stood out above all the rest was ReverbNation. I got the free trial (which I may cancel later and just upload MP3s, depending on how it goes), and it looks like the services they offer (particularly distribution) are fairly similar to what I already get on DistroKid.

An alternative rock punk industrial project which has incubated over the last 20+ years. All of my influences, Radiohead, Nirvana, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, NIN, Sonic Youth, Marilyn Manson.  Most songs are incomplete, because I'm a bored fucking Sagittarian, but an EP and 4 albums are in the works.

**About US**

A probate attorney is a [lawyer](https://probatenewyorklawyer.com/) that is assigned to help an executor or administrator of a business or estate with the probate process. Most people might not be aware, but such attorneys are available for consultation, and they can even be hired by a business to help it put a business continuation plan in place.

Most business owners do not plan ahead and when they die, their business can also die. This results mostly from poor management and beneficiaries who have no experience in running it. The business can also get exposed to probate, which is expensive and takes a toll on normal business operations.

The main reason why one would need a probate attorney  is so that the probate process can be easy on the business owners and take the shortest time possible. Here are some of the ways a probate attorney can be helpful:

The main reason to have a probate attorney is to avoid the probate process. An [attorney](https://goo.gl/maps/1iTp3yyMy85yzSv39) will advise the business owners on the best way to pass on the business to their beneficiaries without having to go through probate. They are more knowledgeable and will advise on whether to get joint tenancy, living trusts, or transfer on death agreements. These are some ways to avoid probate, and one would not know unless they consult an expert.

Lyrics:

**Donnie Don’t Live in That Washington DC No More** *(Sung to the tune of “Daddy Don’t Live in That New York City No More”, by Steely Dan)*


Donnie don't live in that Washington DC no more

The voters really had enough and shoved his ass out the door

He’s gotta be the worst we’ve ever seen

Yeah he didn’t do a thing to stop Covid-19

Donnie don't live in that Washington DC no more

Donnie don't ride in that Air Force One no more

He don't travel ‘round the world and make a bunch of threats of war

Donnie still likes to yell and bleat

But nobody will know ‘cuz Donnie can’t tweet

Donnie don't ride in that Air Force One no more, no more

Screaming like a fool to incite a mob

Attacked the Capitol but they botched the job

And now he cries himself to sleep and says that he was robbed

No, no Donnie don't live in that Washington DC no more, no more

Yeah we ran him out of town with approval ratings on the floor

No, Donnie’s too stupid to realize

That we hate him even more cuz he’s always telling lies

Donnie don't live in that Washington DC no more, no more

So I love this song Sweeter than you (Revelations Remix), I first heard it in DJ EJ's EJucation Volume 5, but I have searched high and low for the Revelations Remix or even a full version of the non-remix, but have come a blank, I can't seem to find it anywhere!

,WeAreTheMusicMakers,"Hey all! Hope everyone has survived the holidays. Anyways, I thought this might help some people here who had been thinking about going for the ReverbNation Crowd Reviews - I did it on a whim ($12 US) and added the Songwriting addition ($3.95). Don't quote me on those exact prices, I might be off by a dollar or two. (Some preamble now - skip to the bottom for the full reports I received)

Anyways, I submitted my song ""Young &amp; Strange"" as I recently released a self-produced album. I usually make music in complete isolation - I don't really have much of a community around me or people who are into music in any big way. I have literally zero audience (ok, not literally, I have 5 followers on Spotify) and I am fully aware that this is an uphill battle. I make music because I have to - it's what I do. Good bad or indifferent.

That being said, I'm not even fully sure what genre I am. I flip between alt-rock, electronic pop, mild industrial, dream pop. I'm ok with not fitting well into a category, because I'm going to do what I'm going to do - adopting a specific style wouldn't make this fun, and if it's not fun and rewarding on some level, it's just going to be a terrible slog. I just figure I have to find the people who are willing to go on a bumpy ride, like me - one of my fave artists Devin Townsend manages to flip styles and make it cohesive so that's what I'm trying to shoot for, no matter how limiting it may be. It WOULD be nice to have more than 5 listeners or course, ha ha. 

Anyways, here is a link to the two documents you receive for your money (hope the link works):

[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/00f04j9mim0pehx/AABhRRI-AwH6ctg4cWhBjbXga?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/00f04j9mim0pehx/AABhRRI-AwH6ctg4cWhBjbXga?dl=0)


As for the feedback - well, it's all over the place. It's clear they go for a wide sampling of demographics (I see you 64 y/o Grandma who gave me a 1 out of 10! No cookies for you). The ""Who it sounds like"" is even crazier, but not entirely inaccurate - everything from Jamiroquai &amp; Prince to Marilyn Manson and Depeche Mode, and then some oddballs (Weird Al? I'LL SEE YOU OUTSIDE BRO! INXS? EMF?? Dude, that's unbelievable!) .

So, things I learned: I am not the only one who isn't sure what niche genre I make music in (although there was a lean towards Alt/Indie) Some people loved the vocals, some people did not. The Grandma thought they were too noisy.

At this point I guess I'm choosing to enjoy the feedback. Strangely it makes me LESS inclined to specify genre and get MUCH crazier and make stuff more divisive. Even though the reviews are, let's face it, kinda shit - at first I thought ""Maybe I should stop, perhaps I'm embarrassing myself"", then I remember some people really liked it - and someone who gave me a higher score, under ""who does it sound like"" said ""no one"", so screw it, that's a win.

Anyways, this post wasn't for self-promotion, I just wanted to share the emotional experience and material result of getting the crowd review for those thinking of getting it.

Lyrics:

Donnie ran for president a while ago

Doesn’t want the grifting to be over

Now we’re seeing that he lost the race to Joe

And he’s losing his composure

He didn’t want to lose the race that night

He is gonna choose disgrace tonight

It’s looking like his loss is still sinking in

From his office he’s been booted

If Billy would protect him he could only win

Then he won’t be prosecuted

He didn’t want to lose the race that night

He is gonna choose disgrace tonight

Try to stop his hands from shaking

But nothing in his mind is making sense

How’s he gonna ever pay down that loan?

Yeah, he can't hide the way he’s feeling

The time has finally come to face reality

What he thought is true just isn’t

There’s not a lot of time for him to remain free

Time for him to rot in prison

He didn’t want to lose the race that night

He is gonna choose disgrace tonight

He didn’t want to lose the race that night

He is gonna choose disgrace tonight

He should go, just go away

Go, just go away

He just lost it all on Election Day

Lost on Election Day

He should go, just go away

Go, just go away

He just lost it all on Election Day

He didn’t want to lose the race that night

He is gonna choose disgrace tonight

He didn’t want to lose the race that night

He is gonna choose disgrace tonight",t2_5s91d,,,0,,One more song parody for Donald Trump before he goes,[],,False,7.0,,,,,False,t3_jzwuem,False,dark,1.0,,public,,0.0,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},,,4,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,,text,7.0,,,text,self.TheNewGeezers,False,,,,,,True,False,True,False,False,[],,False,True,False,False,,[],,,,,t5_2ylca,,,,,jzwuem,True,,La_Rata,,10,True,some_ads,False,,False,,/r/TheNewGeezers/comments/jzwuem/one_more_song_parody_for_donald_trump_before_he/,some_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheNewGeezers/comments/jzwuem/one_more_song_parody_for_donald_trump_before_he/,62,1606187061.0,0,,False,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'axrnRUya_5pznE8BvR4uc0YYhXMNlvpWGXFfXiFtpJg', 'resolutions': [{'height': 71, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/WhwfzpVJ17xcwsPmuFrISxr3P_gkW21dojbMS-4Wz80.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98dd0ac7b76f6f3b9b63bf295147597775fc9425', 'width': 108}, {'height': 143, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/WhwfzpVJ17xcwsPmuFrISxr3P_gkW21dojbMS-4Wz80.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=780763505e29111fd36d312cff5d7db468adbca3', 'width': 216}, {'height': 213, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/WhwfzpVJ17xcwsPmuFrISxr3P_gkW21dojbMS-4Wz80.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d1ce993841344a03ce9639a458fbffd97c4417e', 'width': 320}, {'height': 426, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/WhwfzpVJ17xcwsPmuFrISxr3P_gkW21dojbMS-4Wz80.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c368a975f3ac18d1a8eb2f585c2e76567d9f40c8', 'width': 640}, {'height': 639, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/WhwfzpVJ17xcwsPmuFrISxr3P_gkW21dojbMS-4Wz80.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12729825967f27d26b471343c61727b8283787db', 'width': 960}, {'height': 719, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/WhwfzpVJ17xcwsPmuFrISxr3P_gkW21dojbMS-4Wz80.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=985ad9dcd1863aa48482d01eb992bfbe57df4cc5', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 2133, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/WhwfzpVJ17xcwsPmuFrISxr3P_gkW21dojbMS-4Wz80.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=32414cb191a67094750d8bf0f4553bab4f213375', 'width': 3200}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,reverbnation,1623084637.0,,,,,1315070441.0,,,

,edmproduction,"From what I remember he was really depressed before he left. :( 

The song is marked under a CC BY-SA. I still give credit by leaving his name in there just to show who the original artist was... even if he isn't there or can't be found anymore. He never really had that many followers (nor do I, but I just enjoy the hobby too much to give it up) so I think that, combined with what he was going through, was really hard on him.

,TheSzuters_MagnaFi,"We've seen in the past 12 months many Outta The Blue/The Szuters/Magna-Fi songs being uploaded on YouTube. Some of those were released on cassettes, some were released on EPs, some were just demos that have never seen the stores or the internet.

But by now what do we know about the lost songs? I guess the first thing that came in our minds is the first Outta The Blue self-titled album released in 1986, an extremely rare record. Sadly it's hard to think that anybody can spend nearly a thousand dollars to buy that vinyl.

After that album, Outta The Blue released three cassettes, three very rare albums that have 33 songs combined. A year ago we had only three of these songs uploaded on YouTube (Forever And A Day, Next To Your Heart and Crush-O-Rama) and some of the others were forgotten in Soundcloud and ReverbNation. Nowadays, we have 30 uploaded songs on YouTube, with just three considered ""lost"": Best Of Me (at least its studio version), More Then You'll Ever Know and Love Comes A Tumblin'.

Then we go for The Szuters' lost songs. By October 2019 we had three that we could consider lost (Hey Loser, Luna and Wayne). Since then we got these three uploaded together with many others like Shining Moments, 1994 and New Regrets. Sadly we still have missing content: TV Killed Me has a 3rd version, released on the self-titled demo back in 1999. Beautiful, Ex Ok and Luna have demo versions recorded in The Szuters' era and we have two more hidden gems: Dim The Lights and High School Varsity Superstar, as mentioned [here](https://www.rocknworld.com/specials/szuters/index.shtml).

As far as I can remember, the Magna-Fi era don't have any lost song. In the past 12 months we've seen four ""new"" songs being uploaded: American Airtime, Pretty F\*\*\*ing Ironic, Saved The Best For Last and Squint. But I guess everybody here agrees that with these new uploads probably we still have a lot of hidden content.

What do you guys think? Do we still have more songs to hear or we're finished?",t2_8c3y8ihp,,,0,,Lost songs,[],,False,,,,,,False,t3_j7p8zu,False,dark,1.0,,public,,0.0,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},,,4,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,,text,,,,text,self.TheSzuters_MagnaFi,False,,,,,,True,False,True,False,False,[],,False,True,False,False,,[],,,,,t5_2yt4xn,,,,,j7p8zu,True,,clubedoremo,,2,False,,False,,False,,/r/TheSzuters_MagnaFi/comments/j7p8zu/lost_songs/,,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSzuters_MagnaFi/comments/j7p8zu/lost_songs/,33,1602204132.0,0,,False,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'z0AuWxvqiAy-DgSWbuNpRGJ4x-xWf7eSfH3C_c6wSic', 'resolutions': [{'height': 73, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/YDxmCg89sA9kMiA3NqtvSuTC0wTO5RkstEhz-hedW04.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25e505048cbcd40765bb4861f41e7e9bafcc4f0d', 'width': 108}, {'height': 146, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/YDxmCg89sA9kMiA3NqtvSuTC0wTO5RkstEhz-hedW04.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e644f2ee9494c3cf43c8f6c900c8f4ce702bded1', 'width': 216}], 'source': {'height': 200, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/YDxmCg89sA9kMiA3NqtvSuTC0wTO5RkstEhz-hedW04.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=af73beaf38532f69e1eeb1763fd3fe421c5dc696', 'width': 295}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,reverbnation,1623019729.0,,,,,1601773451.0,,,

[https://www.makingascene.org/independent-blues-award-nominations-open-for-2021/](https://www.makingascene.org/independent-blues-award-nominations-open-for-2021/)

&amp;#x200B;

The independent Blues Awards celebrate the diversity and power of the music that is created by those artists that acknowledge their inspiration and roots are in the blues. These awards will represent not only those “touring” artists who work within the established blues community, but embrace working artists who work in other markets but still acknowledge and honor their roots in the blues.

&amp;#x200B;

Nomination process

&amp;#x200B;

The nominations are an open process! Artists, Fans, Record Companies, etc all can submit an artist or band for nomination consideration. You may nominate any artist or CD in multiple categories, but you must submit a separate entry for each category.

&amp;#x200B;

There is NO COST involved to the artist. In this digital age there is no reason to request massive amounts of CD’s from an artist’s inventory. We can use dropbox, WeTransfer, Spotify, Pandora, Reverbnation or any freely available streaming service so our nominators can listen and evaluate the nominated artists and their work.

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: It is essential that a nominated artist’s is available on a streaming service or makes their work available as a dropbox link download or both. If you send a dropbox link you will also be considered for inclusion to “LIVE from the Midnight Circus” radio show and a possible featured interview.

&amp;#x200B;

Once the open nominations are closed the artists who are qualified will be passed onto our Nomination Committee which will consist of music industry professionals, radio programmers and DJ’s who will represent a wide variety of genres. They will evaluate the entries and choose artists that best represents each category for them. They will submit their picks to Making a Scene where committee nominations will be compiled and the final list of nominated artists will be created for each category.

The Nominations will run from September 29, 2020 to January 1, 2021. The nomination committee will evaluate the entries and return the results to Making A Scene by April 15 2021. Public voting will begin on May 15 2021 and close on August 1 2021. The results will be published on August 15, 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

 The final nominated artists will be presented as an open vote on “[www.makingascene.org](https://www.makingascene.org)” and all winners will be determined by that final vote. The voting page will links and relevant streaming media for each nominee so each person who wants to cast a vote will have the opportunity to explore each nominated artists and their work.

&amp;#x200B;

All decisions by “Making a Scene” will be Final.

Qualifications:

&amp;#x200B;

In order to be fair to all submitting artist we have established a base set of qualifications that will be used to determine which artists will move forward to the nomination committee. Please read these carefully. All decisions by Making a Scene are final.

&amp;#x200B;

The nominated artists/bands must show they are “Working and Touring” artists by establishing they have no less than 4 gigs outside a 200 Mile radius of their home town within the last 12 months. (NOTE for 2021 we will wave this qualification)

&amp;#x200B;

The Nominated artists/bands must represent on their website/social media that they acknowledge the blues as their foundation in the creation of their music. This does not mean that they have to adhere to any artificial definition of what is blues, as we acknowledge the true power of the genre is in it’s diversity. It does not matter what Genre you market yourself under, as long as you acknowledge your music or you as a musician is rooted in or takes your inspiration from the blues.

&amp;#x200B;

,BandCamp,"Apologies if I'm posting this to the wrong group - I'm new to reddit - but this seemed like a good place to start...

I recently created an artist profile on bandcamp, and managed to figure out how to post songs, and do some basic things, but the platform seems incredibly non-intuitive to me. Given how long it's been around and the large number of users, I can only assume that I am missing the concept of how it is designed to be used. Am I just particularly clueless, or is it really as feature-limited and confusing as I have so far found it to be?

I really dislike ReverbNation for a number of reasons, but at least it seems relatively straightforward to use. And as a brand-spanking-new reddit user, I am finding this platform to be relatively intuitive as well. But me and bandcamp simply do not click - it's like a foreign language to me.

,Internet," The internet of the 90's was mostly a time that was best for computer geeks, perhaps. Webcams of coffee pots, chat sites, Yahoo search engine, e-mailing memes to a select group of people, and those web designs that are amusing by today's standards. That said, it also took like, 5 minutes to connect and 2 minutes to load a page, and you better hope that nobody makes a phone call when you're loading that 30 second low resolution video of some chick being banged.  


The 2000's is when we saw true creativity blossom. While Newgrounds started in the 90's, it really started taking off in the early 2000's, allowing for a lot of creativity with amateur animators. I'm currently looking into vlare.tv since it has an early YouTube vibe, as early YouTube was better than what it has become now. Back then, it was more than just a video hosting site. It was a social media site. You could add friends, send personal messages, even customize your page with background images and custom colors. In fact, the profiles back then were very similar to MySpace back in those old days. Remember MySpace? Where you could customize your page with custom backgrounds, music, embedded YouTube videos, etc.?  


Speaking of YouTube, beyond the point of it being a social media site, it was actually YOU tube. It was a bunch of unpolished videos of people just uploading themselves talking in front of a camera, or random fail videos, or people being creative with stop motion animation using themselves as puppets, or Mario in the real world (anyone remember that one?) and on and on it goes. Now it's Stephen Colbert complaining about Trump. I mean ok, I don't like Trump either, and Colbert is funny enough, but I can just watch that on TV. This is not what YouTube is about, or at least, it's not what it used to be about. It used to be original content. Some of it was kind of semi-polished, much of it wasn't, and that was great. Since YouTube allowed for monetization, people moved for the more polished look with clickbait titles and videos that could make even someone with ADHD like myself pay attention. It went from people just talking about or expressing themselves in interesting ways to people just making videos that could get them money, which forever changed the face of YouTube.  


Then there's Ultimate-Guitar. Now just a site to get guitar tabs, it too was once a social media site. You couldn't have custom backgrounds, but you could upload your own MP3 files for either music or a demonstration of your skillz, and allow others to rate them, send messages, add friends, have groups, upload images of yourself and your guitar gear, and plus there were forums where people could discuss things too. If you liked someone's music, you could favorite it, and there was even the 5 or so top songs of the week that ended up on there. I was and still am friends with many of the bigger names on that site from back in those days, in fact. Just chatting with them often about music and nonsense. Some of those people had a falling out with the site, and it seems like they actually killed the site in doing so. Then a few years later, all MP3 files were deleted and the ability to upload your own music was taken away. Furthermore, they completely wrecked the format of the profiles on UG somewhat recently. The most you can do there now is put a comment on someone's page and that's it. You can at least upload 1 minute of a 300 MB video to your profile now, though, but that's seriously just not the same. The forums are still going, but the people in the forums are often toxic and I try to avoid them. Hell, UG even used to have its own instant chat for friends to talk to one another on, but they nixed that years ago. The closest you might get to a site dedicated to music like that now is something like Reverbnation or Soundcloud, but it's just not the same.  


Facebook in the old days wasn't all that bad. People just posted pictures of food and talked about where they were hanging out at or just whatever. Personally, I used to use it as a replacement for Ultimate-Guitar when all familiar named moved off that site, as they went to Facebook with a group for guitarists. Now though, Facebook is an endless barrage of people posting from CNN or Fox or whatever, and it no longer feels like people are being connected, but rather that people are just yelling at and hating one another for posting news articles or something. I'm trying to spend less time on those bigger sites and more time on the smaller ones where all the toxic nonsense and drama is gone. If I'm going to be addicted to the web, I might as well find some better sites to feed that addiction.  


We had more choice and freedom back then. Things were a lot less about corporations trying to make a buck off you and other people selling out to join them, and a lot more about individuals just being themselves. Yes, there were politics injected into things every now and then back in those days, but now it's everywhere. Politics have their place and are important, but I don't always want to think about them. I actually avoided them for a while and was even unaware of the recent riots and what led up to them for about a week, and you know what? It felt good. I wasn't as stressed out.  


Not to mention, your information is no longer private and is being sold to ad companies. Plus freedom of speech is so heavily regulated on the more popular sites now. I'm still on a 30 day ban on Facebook because I said ""She thinks that trans people are evil"" because someone commented that the person thinks evil things are trans. We were just discussing a screenshot of someone saying some stupid things about trans people and flat earth or something. Because you know, context isn't important, right?  


I hate what the big sites have become, honestly. They were cool back in the day, but now they're not even worth it. It's either disconnect from the web entirely, or stay connected on smaller sites. The smaller sites don't connect you to as many people though, but maybe that's a good thing. Maybe the normies and corporations can keep the big sites to themselves, while the people tired of that crap find refuge in the smaller and less controlled sites.",t2_z5rpt,,,0,,Mid-late 2000's internet was the best time for the web.,[],,False,6.0,discussion,,,,False,t3_gzqss1,False,dark,0.95,,public,,0.0,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},Discussion,,16,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,,text,6.0,,,text,self.Internet,False,,,,,,True,False,True,False,False,[],,False,True,False,False,,[],,,,,t5_2qh8w,,,,,gzqss1,True,,Mechaghostman2,,4,True,all_ads,False,,False,,/r/Internet/comments/gzqss1/midlate_2000s_internet_was_the_best_time_for_the/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Internet/comments/gzqss1/midlate_2000s_internet_was_the_best_time_for_the/,7348,1591721032.0,3,,False,,0ca1ee8e-d9f4-11e6-9455-0eb4525b7678,,,,,,,reverbnation,1622858041.0,,,,,1467362077.0,,,

Unfortunately, AudioKite was sold to Reverbnation, and when I just recently did a RVN Crowd Review, it really was not like what I remembered from AudioKite. Worse, I was immediately signed up by RVN for a free account, which hurt the existing account I already had there, and of course I was spammed to buy this, that and the other thing. But the real issue is that my tune got a 4.8 rating. A few people liked it, but a lot of people did not. So I cancelled my release.

,NewSkaters,"Deri Lorus, an Indian Music Artist, and a Gospel Music Composer. He was born and brought up in Chennai, Tamil Nadu.

**About**

[Dent Benefits](http://www.dentbenefitsbrooklyn.com/) offers exams, x-rays, cleanings, fillings, root canals, dentures, porcelain crowns and bridges for a flat monthly fee.

A beautiful smile isn’t just a confidence boost; it’s indicative of your overall well-being. The health of your mouth mirrors that of your body and regular dentist visits even can identify if you’re at risk for chronic disease.

General dentistry services are covered. Ninety-five percent of dentistry is general dentistry, according to Dr. Entin. Think cleanings, root canals, porcelain crowns, dentures, bridges, extractions and cosmetic fillings. All these services are covered under Dental Benefits’ monthly plan.

Build a relationship with your [dentist](https://g.page/in-house-dental-membership-plans?share). When you have traditional dental insurance, your coverage will depend on your insurance administrator, who acts as a third party between you and your dentist. With copays, deductibles and pre-authorization requirements, getting the right care isn’t always easy. Dent Benefits has offices in Brooklyn and allows patients to establish a direct relationship with their doctor, without a third party standing between you and your dentist.

“It’s the best and most cost effective option for someone who needs dental work,” Dr. Entin said. “There are people who literally cannot afford dentistry.

,americanidol,"**The following statement was sent to me yesterday by someone who identified themselves as Isaiah Grass’s Booking Agent. The statement appears below as it was sent and has not been edited by me:**

“Chicago-based singer/songwriter Isaiah Grass was featured on the nationally syndicated television show American Idol which was aired on Sunday, March 1, 2020.

Isaiah Grass' audition has been seen by millions of viewers singing in front of the celebrity judges Katy Perry, Lionel Richie, and Luke Bryant. Since Isaiah's audition his social media following has grown tremendously. New and old followers from across the country have shown outstanding support to him, and for this Isaiah Grass is incredibly grateful and humbled.

Isaiah's audition and interview weren't shown in an entirety that truly showcased his persona as an individual. American Idol didn't mention Isaiah's collaborations with The Salvation Army, and children's hospitals, his experiences of being bullied as a child, and his desire to make music that can helps others. Instead they focused more on him being a model and a social media influencer to boost their ratings.

The contestants were asked to be prepared to sing 3 songs. One of the songs Isaiah prepared was 'Take On Me' which he dedicated to his vocal teacher who recently passed away. The reason Isaiah selected this song was because it showcased everything his voice teacher trained him to do. After hearing this song, the producers insisted Isaiah sing it for his audition on American Idol.

Before every performance Isaiah says a prayer asking God to give him the ability and strength to deliver a great show for the audience. The day of the audition the producers put mics on Isaiah and filmed him throughout the day asking him to say and do certain things. They asked him to talk about himself instead Isaiah chose to do what he does before a performance, he prayed. This is what he said, which was not aired: "" Thank you God for this opportunity, please give me the strength and courage for me to do a great audition. If American Idol is going to do more harm then good please close this door. You know my heart and I trust you will let me know if this is not the path you want me to travel and you want me to go down another road instead. Amen.""

For those of you who have not seen the video, please see the attached link to Isaiah's audition, but note American Idol edited the song and audio. Additionally, please see attached the same song in a raw format that Isaiah sang at the studio to hear it in its entirety.”

**About US**

[Dental implants ](https://smilebydesigndental.com/implant-dentistry/)are designed to provide a foundation for replacement teeth that look, feel and function like natural teeth. The person who has lost teeth regains the ability to eat in comfort, smile with confidence and speak clearly. Their teeth appear natural and the facial contours are preserved. While high-tech in nature, dental implants are actually more tooth-saving than traditional bridgework, since implants do not rely on neighboring teeth for support.

Dental implants are artificial tooth root replacements that have been around since the 1950s. Today, implant techniques provide a range of replacement solutions for patients missing one, multiple or all teeth. Dental implants are an ideal option for people in good general health who have lost a tooth or teeth due to periodontal disease, an injury, or some other reason.

The [implants are essentially](https://goo.gl/maps/HyCXfAXcvn4165QN8) titanium fictures that are placed into the jawbone where teeth are missing. The bone bonds or osseointegrates with the titanium, creating a strong foundation. Additional benefits of implants are that they can help preserve facial structure, preventing the bone deterioration that occurs when teeth are missing.

Implant-supported teeth are permanently cemented and most patients comment on their natural feel. Implants can be used by a denture wearer as it will stabilize their removable prosthesis by securing a series of implants under the denture.

Dental implants can truly change a patient's quality of life. With implants, you are able to engage with your daily life in a normal fashion and rediscover the comfort and confidence to eat and laugh!

first let me say , i dont consider my self a musician , i dont even have the slightest knowledge of music theory , some of these tracks are just bad , i know , but i promise there are good ones you can use too either on a sequence/boss battle in your game or on main menu 

years ago when i was bored of making hiphop beats i started making Soundtrack type of music for a while &amp; these were the result

Uploaded some on youtube &amp; reverbnation back in the day, i had great positive feedback on some of them   but never really had any use for them until i heard about Dreams &amp; how you can use your own music for the games

so i thought i share them with you , if you do use them in your games please let me know i would love to see what you made , also if you think the music helped your game credit me in description :)

**About US**

1stNationalLending.com was created to help consumers access money without hassle and wasted time. 

We understand emergencies exist that [may require access to cash](https://www.nationallendingbureau.com/?ref=L024). That’s why we simplified the process of finding a lender to get the money you need. You no longer have to visit dozens of websites, fill out numerous requests or stand in line at a local store. We are not a lender, but submitting your information through our secure online form will help us connect you to one of the participating lenders in our network. The lenders we work with are willing to help you get the cash you need. Each lender in our network has made the approval process quick and easy, usually with no paperwork or forms to copy and fax, and a [loan agreement](https://g.page/bad-credit-loans-chicago?share) that you can review and sign online.

We look forward to helping you with your personal lending needs.

**About US**

This website is not an offer to lend. 1stNationalLending.com is not a lender or lending partner and does not make loan or [credit decisions](https://www.nationallendingbureau.com/?ref=L023). 1stNationalLending.com connects interested persons with a lender or lending partner from its network of approved lenders and lending partners. 1stNationalLending.com does not control and is not responsible for the actions or inactions of any lender or lending partner, is not an agent, representative or broker of any lender or lending partner, and does not endorse any lender or lending partner. 1stNationalLending.com receives compensation from its lenders and lending partners, often based on a ping-tree model similar to Google AdWords where the highest available bidder is connected to the consumer. 

Regardless, 1stNationalLending.com’s service is always free to you. In some cases, you may be given the option of obtaining a loan from a tribal lender. Tribal lenders are subject to tribal and certain federal laws while being immune from state law [including usury caps](https://g.page/Unsecured-Personal-Cash-Loan-LA?share). If you are connected to a tribal lender, please understand that the tribal lender’s rates and fees may be higher than state-licensed lenders. Additionally, tribal lenders may require you to agree to resolve any disputes in a tribal jurisdiction. You are urged to read and understand the terms of any loan offered by any lender, whether tribal or state-licensed, and to reject any particular loan offer that you cannot afford to repay or that includes terms that are not acceptable to you.

,shareyourmusic,"Hi All

In addition to making music, I've started getting into coding. I've recently made two different bots that do all of the twitter marketing for the two different groups I am in. As it stands they post either my music, music of artists I listen to,  various artists I have worked with in the past, or memes.

You can check em out here! Almost all the tweets on these two accounts were generated via Python.

[https://twitter.com/arcopemusic](https://twitter.com/arcopemusic)

If you would like my bots to occasionally (it's randomly chosen) share and promote your tracks let me know aka send me your artist pages. If they vibe with either of the pages I'll get them integrated.  I can post from spotify, soundcloud, and  reverbnation. I haven't linked in Bandcamp yet but it's on my to-do's as is youtube. 

All I ask is you follow them and share the love and like and retweet/like even when its not your track.

I'm also planning on developing scripts for other outlets such as instagram and I am always refining my current set up as the need for new features pop up. Have a great weekend y'all.

,singing,"Background: I'm a singer/producer and I make synthpop music. After getting feedback from various places (mostly Reverbnation Crowd Review) I decided to take vocal lessons and really work on my singing. My vocal coach, wife, friends, and family all say I'm improving but I know they're biased so I continue to use Crowd Review. However, after a couple months of lessons and practice I submitted a song to Crowd Review and it got the lowest score I've ever gotten by far (out of 4 total songs). Most comments were about how my singing was bad.

I wonder if this is because I'm more closely emulating pop singing than before taking lessons and because of that I'm more easily compared to A-list artists rather than indie/singer-songwriter artists. For those unfamiliar with the [uncanny valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley), it's what makes us like action figures and fellow humans but scared of corpses or lifelike robots. Has anyone experienced an uncanny valley with their singing? Like how we think kids singing off key is cute but not tone-deaf people trying out for the Voice?

TL:DR; I've been working hard on my singing with a vocal coach but my latest song had the most criticism of my singing. Why is this?",t2_1fm90rj8,,,0,,Uncanny valley?

It appears that Reverbnation do have a widget that does exactly this, but, it looks pretty awful, I would prefer to use some service that has a suitable API.

In addition, I wondered if anyone knew if there was a service where you could post show data somewhere once &amp; it would update it across multiple sources.

,bandmembers,"Apologies if this has been asked a million times, I couldn't think of another way to search for it other than typing in band members and that just brought up a whole bunch of other stuff. 

I've been out of the scene for a while. I am on bandmix, but they want 12 bucks a month to be able to contact anyone, not that that's a deal-breaker but I feel like there must be some free platforms out there that people use. 

Back in the day was Craigslist is that still it? There are all these apps like band friend, but there aren't very many bands on it that I can see. There's ReverbNation but that seems like it's more for established bands  instead of bands looking for members. What are people using these days?

,u_GnosticMindTrain,"Mental health triggers me as I don't relate to any mental disorder or well, I relate to mostly just anxiety and ADHD and OCD but not really anything else.

I personally don't see schizotypal as a problem for me.

It's just a weird belief system and behavior and thinking I have, that's it.

I mostly had bad mental health doctors and it's the reason I made my anti  psychiatry album ""Dysfunctional"" on ReverbNation and extra songs on SoundCloud. I'm pissed.

I believe mental health problems exist, I just don't have them, I don't suffer  from delusions, I'm just better than professionals. I'm Godlike, but not God.

If you're easily offended, don't listen to my album, however, it will let you into my mind of Hell and passing around and abuse and misdiagnosing and pushing pills on me. Telling me I should be happier with them even though I was already happy.

I only got triggered when I  saw a video saying that self diagnosis is bad. Well dude, either I self diagnosis or I reject my problems, I choose the latter, because doctors  can only solve some of my issues, but can't solve others like my  argumentative issues I have with people.",t2_2cms01k5,,,0,,The mental health field makes me mad.,[],u/GnosticMindTrain,False,,,,,,,,False,dark,,,user,,0.0,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},,False,1,,,False,self,1577010432,,[],{},,True,,,text,,,,text,self.GnosticMindTrain,False,,,qa,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,,,t5_z2ae9,,,,,ee3gpv,True,,GnosticMindTrain,,25,True,,False,,False,,/r/u_GnosticMindTrain/comments/ee3gpv/the_mental_health_field_makes_me_mad/,,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_GnosticMindTrain/comments/ee3gpv/the_mental_health_field_makes_me_mad/,0,1577010092.0,0,,False,,,,,,,,,reverbnation,,,,,,1554088571.0,1586867953.0,,
,u_quitegreatmusicpr,"Quite Great communication is a [music marketing and promotions agency](https://www.quitegreat.co.uk/) which also has a  distribution arm and a label, in business and the music business being no exception, distribution is a fundamental part of sales but in music, it is necessary to understand what stage you find yourself as a band or an artist as phase one of distribution is being able to get your material across to a relevant market hence the first base of any band is learn where the market lies. This can be done very simply by getting out on the streets with your music and some cds….yes old school indeed …..and then selling them to the general public. This is level one of distribution but gives you a real idea as to what you are really entering into. There is nothing quite as satisfying as selling direct and seeing that your music translates live and then feeling , seeing or hearing the cash . From this stage you can then if you feel ready take on board a distributor as there are a huge number of them all ready to work with you , from the easy access styles of  CD Baby and AWAL to the longstanding ones who cater for physical and digital distribution like Nova Distribution.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/40bzpgdk0s541.jpg?width=1672&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f4da6023bbe9989699b26e043525c14d040837a

Other forms of effective distribution come from one stop style platforms such as Reverbnation and Bandcamp but most artists consider digital distribution to be the online sales platforms and streaming sites such as Itunes and Spotify, yet don’t forget everything comes at a price and all distributors vary in the %s they charge on sales and that is outside of the % the likes of Itunes take, hence check the margins as they can really make a difference. Some outlets may seem rather pricey whilst others are a bargain but make sure you know what you are getting and how easy it is to get out of the deal for example if that major label comes calling. 

Now a few lines ago I mentioned the starting point and that is do it yourself , creating your own cds and getting out there, and with this in mind do not forget vinyl as although potentially pricey to manufacture a solid , well designed and relevant piece of vinyl can really tickle the fancy of consumers as there is nothing quite as fab as feeling, touching and even smelling the beauty of vinyl , not to mention that zip in your heart when the stylus hits the disc and the music is only moments away….am I getting carried away??!! 

Anyway, and here is the selling bit , do not forget that without promotions teams like [www.quitegreat.co.uk](https://www.quitegreat.co.uk) or a very active and precise digital campaign , which we also do…..but hey you guessed that didn’t you! your distribution channel will pretty much do nothing hence why you see a lot of distributors seemingling offering promotional services hence why I mentioned at the start we offer distribution but that is with promotion at the forefront hence make sure whoever offers you distribution and promotion they are not just adding on some one click hit out but adding a big fee to gain extra bucks to their bang …..if you get what we mean!!! 

Anyway, as with most things in life, check the detail, check your stomach and see if both gut instinct and the small print fit together. I really like dealing with distributors as they are generally pretty world weary when it comes to being able to clearly state how tough it is out there and how impossible it is without real promotional back up , I love them most of all as good ones when dealing with a promotional team will be a cross between Godzilla and The Wizard of Oz as they can be tyrannical in outlining the promo needed and sometimes in a world of their own when understanding how tough it is to break a new act or to actually create a promotional campaign that drives sales and not just media awareness.

Under this domain, Koshir's Garbage was sold, but the bandzoogle account expired. I once asked a rapper who was one of the features, to which he said he didn't have it. I believe that some possible names for questioning could be Conceit, Blaq Santa, And Frodie Wapikiya.

,WeAreTheMusicMakers,"Hey everyone, I hope you are all having a great day/night. **I am giving out one free track artwork.** The way it works is simple...

1. Head on over to the [Alt Esc Redditor page](https://altesc.space/reddit)
2. Submit the form
3. I will choose one submission on December 19th, 2019 and contact the email provided within 2 business days

**Rules**

* Multiple submissions from the same person/group/collective will result in disqualification for this giveaway
* Please only submit Soundcloud links in the giveaway form
* Submit ONLY your own music, no friends or other artists
* Winner will receive 1 free revision to their artwork
* If the winner does not reply back by December 22nd, 2019 then a second winner will be chosen
* No bootlegs or copyright infringing tracks will be selected [*(Reverbnation has some decent information about this if you are curious)*](https://blog.reverbnation.com/category/music-law/)

**For those who need album artwork now or soon...**

If you are in need of artwork for your track, but don't want to solely bank on the giveaway hat, then please feel free to [submit a project form on the main site.](https://altesc.space/)

**Why am I doing this?**

I recently started a company, [Alt Esc LLC](https://altesc.space/), that is aiming to provide album artwork, promotional graphics, GIFs and Snapchat Lenses, specifically to artists, startups and public areas like parks. That is the business answer.

The other answer is because I've spent several years making music and sometimes resources are hard to come by while on the career path of being a producer and performer, so I hope this opportunity helps an artist who is making some awesome tracks and could use some awesome artwork to go with it.

If this post does not comply with this subreddit's rules then please let me know and I will be happy to move this to the weekly promotion thread if I can.

Cartilage lyrics:

Smoke into the black hole.

You saw me.

Yeah!

Dancing in the dark.

Raining in the dark.

Dancing in the rain in the dark.

The joints are broken.

Your glass is broken.

Cracked.

There was something cracked, in the cartilage, of my life. (x2)

And my body.

Hospital stay, never meant anything to me.

Because I always fell back down.

Back down.

Where is my broken crown?

Breathing. (x7)

Trying to.

Wake up.

To gain a new life.

My new skin. (x2)

Rebirth.

Reborn.

Cartilage.

Broken glass.

Like windows.

What will REALLY bother me is if the show ends with a message of ""Don't be a pornstar/sexual deviant and swear."" Which I know is stupid to a lot of people to complain about and shouldn't take a show seriously, but I'm sick and tired of people thinking sexual deviance is bad.

Unless it's illegal or hurts people, then it's bad, but this idea that being a pornstar and having sex is ""bad"" needs to fucking stop in the media. It's why I made my EP album ""Lucifer Our Lord"" on ReverbNation, I'M AT WAR WITH THE OLD RULES!

If I made a show, I'd promote legal and safe sexuality, swearing, and weed. (Legalize it all 50 states.)

But people tell me I'm going to Hell.

I'm stuck in the Matrix trying to wake people up that if it's not hurting anybody and it's not illegal, it's fine.",t2_2cms01k5,,,0,,Hazbin Hotel's final message may concern me.,[],u/GnosticMindTrain,False,,,,,,,,False,dark,,,user,,0.0,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},,False,0,,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,,text,,,,text,self.GnosticMindTrain,False,,,qa,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,,,t5_z2ae9,,,,,dx05sb,True,,GnosticMindTrain,,0,True,,False,,False,,/r/u_GnosticMindTrain/comments/dx05sb/hazbin_hotels_final_message_may_concern_me/,,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_GnosticMindTrain/comments/dx05sb/hazbin_hotels_final_message_may_concern_me/,0,1573867281.0,0,,False,,,,,,,,,reverbnation,,,,,,1554088571.0,1586576049.0,,

,WeAreTheMusicMakers,"earlier in may this year, distrokid suddenly emailed me telling me one of my albums (that had been up since 2014) were to be taken down from google play store, spotify etc. because of suspected ""streaming fraud"".

i tried to talk to distrokid (even google) telling them i've never, nor would i ever pay for streams, followers or anything like that. i always found that behavior really stupid and dishonest.

in the end, for whatever reason, my album was never taken down. even though both distrokid and google told me repeatedly there was nothing they could do.

anyway, fast forward to 6 months later, and i'm getting ANOTHER ""fraudulent activity"" notice from reverbnation via my old label. it's the exact same thing again. distributor accusing me of buying fake streams. this time however, they actually took down 2 albums of mine from all stores. they've been online since 2012 without any issues, and now suddenly i'm apparently buying streams?

this is making me increasingly paranoid, as this is my livelihood being tampered with.

so i guess what i'd like to know, is if it's possible to ""target"" someone's music like this and have it taken down from streaming services? i feel like nothing can be done to prevent this from happening again. distrokid literally would (could?) not lift a finger to help me, and reverbnation just instantly terminated the associated account, saying there's nothing that can or will be done.

,WeAreTheMusicMakers,"I received an email offering a slot on an beta emerging pop artist playlist on reverbnations for which I would have to pay $15 to be featured. 

So far I’ve read negative things about the services offered by reverbnation and their Instagram and Facebook seem to have low interaction despite decent followings. I was sent an initial email two weeks ago with a deadline that ended around that time only to receive an email 2 days ago regarding it still being open and now ending in 3 days. Idk if I’m over reading it cause I tend to be cautious with things in music since their are some predatory services preying in the naive and hopeful imo. 

So short story short do I trust reverbnation and pay the $15 for whatever promotion I get or is it not worth it? 

It also asks for a direct upload of the song but that shouldn’t be a big deal yeah?",t2_8212tnh,,,0,,Opinions on reverbnation?,[],r/WeAreTheMusicMakers,False,6.0,,,,,,,False,dark,,,public,,0.0,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},,False,1,,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,,text,6.0,,,text,self.WeAreTheMusicMakers,False,,,,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,,,t5_2qmah,,,,,dqwvcc,True,,_mDubz,,14,True,all_ads,False,,False,,/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/dqwvcc/opinions_on_reverbnation/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/dqwvcc/opinions_on_reverbnation/,1065392,1572762966.0,0,,False,,,,,,,,,reverbnation,,,,,,1502125094.0,1586472421.0,,

,u_sivleization,"Greetings from Brantford Ontario Canada --- the birthplace of the telephone, superstar hockey player Wayne Gretzky and one hellua lot of ROCKtastic music from many bands and solo artists. 

We'd like to introduce ourselves to everyone.

  
We are SIVLE (that's Elvis spelled backwards and pronounced ""civil"")  We are a versatile Classic Rock and Vintage Pop band from Brantford Ontario Canada.  We are a family oriented band consisting of myself -- Joan Minnery on lead vocals, my son Bill Minnery on lead guitar, my brother Bob on rhythm acoustic and Dan Taylor on bass and drums.  Our original drummer Brad Bridges is currently on hiatus as his wedding approaches.   

While we are predominantly a cover band; we went into the recording studio this summer and have released two singles.  Our explosive rock anthem ""Whatever It Takes"" and our Dixie-Prog tune entitled ""What Would Walter Do"" --- which is a salute to Walter Gretzky.  Both songs were written by myself, Bill, Bob and my sister Anne.  Both singles have garnered air play on Indie Stations in California, Australia, Germany, Canada and the UK.  They are distributed through CD baby and available on many platforms.  

  
Our feature release is **Whatever It Takes.**   This came about totally by cosmic fate and totally unexpected events.  We found out that we garnered one of 5 spots in the Ontario Canada Rock Fest --- WTFest 2019  (That's What The Fest).  We actually secured the spot out of 450 applicants, only thing was we needed MORE original tunes as that was the criteria for the festival.  
So in May of 2019, myself, my son Bill, my brother Bob and my sister Anne, all sat down in her living room and hammered out some thoughts on paper, on verse and chorus structure and then the two lads started strumming.  It didn't take long but eventually over a few days, Whatever It Takes was launched.

  
Bill KNEW the title was going to be Whatever It Takes --- as him and I had had a Mom/Son movie date a week earlier and had watched the Avengers ""Endgame"" and that was the key phrase all through the film.  We looked at eachother and said ""THAT IS IT"" --- that's the title and the whole concept grew from the title. 

  
It is a complete family written song with Anne penning the majority of the lyrics; Bob and I adding and tweaking and Bill doing all of the music -- with me writing the musical chorus. Our drummer Brad Bridges came in eventually and added the percussion.  

  
It was recorded at Rye Field Studios in Brantford Ontario Canada in July 2019, which is owned by Shane Briand --- a brand new studio and we are his FIRST clients.  

  
I am 53, Anne is 69, Bob is 58, Bill is 27 and Brad is 28.   Totally --- TWO Generations --- One Foundation.  YES Mom performs with her son in the band.  And it was HIS idea!!!

Sending out our ROCKtastic HELLO!!!

  
Musically Yours,  
Joan Minnery &amp; SIVLE

,makinghiphop,"I make instrumentals, write lyrics, record, mix and master. I have been producing from home for about 9 years now and been working professionally out of a studio here in Austin since 2016.
When I have a project, everything goes smoothly and we make killer music. The issue I'm having currently is that I am not getting as many projects  as I would like. I would like to be getting projects more consistently. 
Currently I will reach out to artists I find on reverbnation or bandcamp(and recently Instagram as well) listen to their music and shoot them a message going into detail about what I found interesting in their songs.
After trying to get to know the band or artist a little better I will introduce myself as a producer and express my interest in working with them on a project. Then send them some samples of my work if they are interested. If they are, we try to schedule a phone call or meeting where we will go over our recording process from pre pro to mastering, learn about their goals and go over some of the ways we can meet those goals.
It's not for everyone, not every artist I message will result in a reply and not every band I hold a meeting with is going to book an EP. Even still, I make sure to offer myself as a resource and wish them the best moving forward in their careers.

Ultimately it comes down to work but it can sometimes be hard to find a direction or new ways to find people in need of your services.
Something I really enjoy as a producer is building those relationships and seeing artists grow and develop. 
What are some ways I can reach out to new artists? Do you have any tips on staying motivated and managing your time? 
I'd love to know what you guys think.

If you're an artist, what kind of things are you looking for in a producer? Where do you look for a producer to work with? How often does a producer reach out to you? Are you a producer yourself? Do you find beats to lease or work with someone from scratch on a track?
Feel free to share your music as well, if you're going to let me pick your brain the least I can do is check out your stuff.

Producers, what helps you balance projects and manage your time?
Are you currently working a part time job or do something like uber eats between projects? If so, do you enjoy it?
Did you go to school? DAW of choice? Home studio or other? 
Do you also make YouTube videos? Seo tips? What are some of the best methods to get traffic or artists coming to you? 
Do you work at an hourly rate, day rate, song rate?  How many fingers am I holding up? How many questions am I going to ask? Are you constantly using social media? When you are networking through social media how do you stay focused? Isnt editing tedious? Crazy stories at the studio? Bassists, right? Do you play any instruments? How long have you been producing? 

To you producers as well, if you have any projects of your own or want to share some of your own work I'll be happy to check it out! I can also take care of those tedious editing tasks at a great rate.


Anyways, thanks for skimming through that, someone just did a skrrrt outside my apartment and now I'm upset I didnt have the chance to sample it.

,WeAreTheMusicMakers,"What cd-baby did was disgusting. They were just collecting free accounts over the years and letting people sell music for free, which was really useful for musicians like me that don't really sell any music, but still want the opportunity to sell it if something good happens for me one day.

And now they will just force all these users that spent years building their music albums list to pay or leave and have their music deleted.

Very predatory from their part and horrible practices to make money from those that don't make money and are just looking for a break, instead of focusing on the bigger musicians that make crazy amounts of money, to make their services better so that they sell more and they make more as an extend.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway sorry for the rumbling I was just a user there for years and was enjoying my free service, even if I never sold an album, just a song to one cool guy, since its my side thing so I don't really care that much.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone knows an awesome website to sell my music for free and aren't greedy scumbags? I will be releasing my 4th album soon and I will have to transfer all my music to that new site so it will be a big hustle to set up everything again, but I am definitely not supporting such manipulative practices even if I had the money for it. I saw that Reverbnation also is a website that you can sell your music albums for free, but I saw some posts saying that even though they are free, they are predatory too and the service is useless. What is up with that?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: All I want is to sell my music albums online for free on a website and I am looking for an alternative to cd-baby.

,u_eunicestevens,"Heidi-Marie Ferren, a now Los Angeles based actress, writer, and singer/songwriter, also happens to be the last and longest reigning Miss USO. A woman worth catching up with this Memorial Day as Veterans, colleagues, and friends alike praise her continued efforts beyond the crown, ""She continues to serve and support our troops and veterans every chance she gets."" Her latest single, ""EYES OF A SOLDIER,"" is a perfect example of exactly that, with the proceeds from any purchase going back to Veteran Support Groups near to her heart.   With a beat and melody that would make anyone tap his, or her foot, one would not expect the poignant and sometimes painful message found in the lyrics.  Each service member highlighted in the song is based on real people from the singer's work with and on behalf of our brave men and women in uniform. The beat is sure to keep spirits high in celebratory gratitude this Monday, never mind the tear or two a few of the true-account lyrics promise to shed. ""It's all about honor and service,"" says Heidi, ""Honoring those who serve, who have served and those who have paid the ultimate price... Truly honoring their memory, their legacy and their sacrifice.  Our freedoms exist on the scarred backs of these men and women.""  Heidi has a mental archive of stories that span every conflict, collected from her time spent in song and service to these heroes.  It is truly remarkable to have someone so young, so dedicated to the preservation of our past and the possibility of our future.  ""It's convenient to forget the bloodshed and pain of wars past and present, but we forget ourselves when we forget the people who gave us the freedom to forget.""  She stops to show me a picture, tears in her eyes, pointing out a Veteran highlighted in her song, ""The truth is, these stories and these people, are unforgettable to me.  This song is a small thank you to the men and women I will never be able to thank enough.""   **""EYES OF A SOLDIER"" is available now on:**

,Kerala,"Agam, for those of who don't know, is a Carnatic progressive rock band. Here's an example of their work.

https://youtu.be/zkvNnRjIhPE

I would like to download mp3 of some of their songs. Here are some options I could find 
1. Something called a wynk app, which I think needs their app installed to play the downloaded song. Nope. 
2. Reverbnation and other such websites, but either they don't carry some of the tracks I want, or only lets me stream the songs (no download option). Nope.


I want to pay for the music to support the band and its work. But if there is no clean and easy way to do it, I am open to other options. Cough * torrents * cough. (by the way, I could not find any torrents. Guess they're not *that* popular) 

Can someone help me with the situation? May I also add that I am not looking for poor quality audio (like rip from YouTube etc).

,u_SeanEnnis," 1) Upload Videos To Facebook  Facebook is pushing their video hard. They now have 4 billion video views A DAY. Even though, they calculate a video view when only 3 seconds is watched, it's still a great engagement tool for your fans. Facebook will prioritize a Facebook-uploaded video over a YouTube embedded video (not to mention that Facebook videos automatically play in the newsfeed). I've run my own tests on this and a new song that I posted to Facebook and YouTube on the same day got 6x more views on Facebook than YouTube in the first week.    
   And now that Facebook is starting to roll out Video monetization at the same payment rate YouTube offers (55%), so now you can start making some moola on your viral videos.  2) Post Photos of YOU Often  The reason Instagram has exploded is not because of their video feature. It's because of the high quality photo offerings. It's a community in it of itself. Feel free to link your Instagram to your Facebook Page. Because Facebook owns Instagram they make this sharing seamless. (Do NOT, however, link your Twitter to Facebook or visa versa) However, if you use Instagram jargon in the description (@someonesname) make sure you go into your Facebook Page account and edit that to Facebook appropriate tagging. You don't need to only post professional promo photos, but all of your photos you post should be high quality. Definitely post photos showing your fans 'behind the scenes' of you hanging out doing every day things, but make sure YOU are in the photo. People don't want to see your food photos or things you think look cool. They want to see YOU doing cool things and in your element like performing, in studio, rehearsing, backstage, etc.    
   3) Feature A Video  One of the most under utilized features is the Featured Video on Pages. Once you have videos uploaded you can select one to feature. It will then show up on your profile on the left hand side directly below About. It will be the first thing people see when visiting your Page and most people will click this first - so feature a music video, live performance video or your EPK, not just you messing around at the pool (unless you have a hot bod... people love hot bods). Watching a high quality video is the easiest way for someone to be introduced to your music. But, of course, make sure you have high quality videos made!    
   4) Make a Music tab  BandPage is still the industry standard for the easiest way to stream music on your Facebook page. ReverbNation, CD Baby and BandCamp also have nice players, but the reason I like BandPage's the best is because it's super clean and isn't cluttered with tons of other bells and whistles. You can title the tab ""Music"" or ""Music and Videos."" BandPage will allow you to sync your SoundCloud and YouTube accounts for songs and videos to stream. People aren't going to Like your Page if they can't listen to your music. Stream full songs! The days of the 90 second preview are long behind us.  5) Add a Tour Tab  Fans will visit your Facebook Page to find lots of info about your project. Don't make it difficult for them to listen to your music, watch videos OR find out when and where you're touring. BandsInTown is the industry standard Facebook tour tab app. However, SongKick and ReverbNation have decent Facebook tour apps as well. Facebook Events comes default with every Facebook Page, but when you go on a 60 date tour, you're not going to create 60 Facebook Events, along with posting your shows to BandsInTown (a must) and SongKick (a must). BIT and SongKick each have unique relationships with major players in the industry to display tour dates. They both, however, pull from most major ticketing sites, so if your tour has advance tickets by a major ticket vendor, the shows will automatically be aggregated by BIT and SongKick.  6) Fill Out All The Info  When someone first lands on your Facebook Page is when they will spend the most time browsing around and figuring out if they want to give you a Like or not. In addition, I often turn to Artists' Facebook Pages to find contact info, label/management info and bios. Fill out every form in the About section.  7) Personalize Your Posts  No one likes to see generic posts ""from management."" Those are boring, cold and detached. They want to see posts from the artist whether it's photos, videos, commentary or links. So personalize it!  8) Stick To Your Brand  If you're a politically focused act and constantly write conscious songs and your fanbase falls pretty close to your political leanings, then by all means write political commentary and post links to political articles you find relevant. However, if your music isn't political and you're not an activist, don't confuse (or alienate) your audience by shoving your political beliefs down their throats. That's not why they are on your Facebook Page. Leave the ranting for your personal Facebook profile. This doesn't mean don't showcase your personality. By all means do! But keep it relevant to who you, as an artist, are.  9) Invite Your Friends  Seems like a no brainer, but once your Facebook Page is up to snuff (i.e. has the above content) invite all your friends. It's a good idea to do this once a year. Don't over do it. You can easily do this (today) by clicking the three dots next to Share of a Page you manage.    
   10) Embed A Like Button On Your Website    


11) Post During Business Hours  A new study by Lithium Technologies and Klout revealed the best times to post to Facebook based on your location. I'll sum up the study: post when people are at work. Kinda seems like a no brainer. But now you know. There is more engagement during business hours. The weekend has a MUCH lower engagement rate. As does the middle of the night, when people are sleeping... duh.  12) Advertise  And if you have a bit of a budget, advertise the posts you want more people to see like video/album releases and tour announcements. As much as we'd like to fight against it, Facebook advertising works. You can target very niche groups like males between the ages of 18-25, within 20 miles of St. Louis, who are fans of Alabama Shakes, who have made purchases online within the past month. Yeah, Facebook gets creepily focused.",t2_5mynyvn,,,0,,12 WAYS TO GET MORE FACEBOOK LIKES (AND ENGAGEMENT) FOR YOUR MUSICIAN PAGE,[],u/SeanEnnis,False,,,,,,,,False,dark,,,user,,0.0,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},,False,1,,,,self,False,,[],{},,True,,,text,,,,text,self.SeanEnnis,,,,qa,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],,False,True,False,False,,,,,,,t5_yor25,,,,,blzx6e,True,,SeanEnnis,,0,True,,False,,False,,/r/u_SeanEnnis/comments/blzx6e/12_ways_to_get_more_facebook_likes_and_engagement/,,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SeanEnnis/comments/blzx6e/12_ways_to_get_more_facebook_likes_and_engagement/,0,1557283309.0,0,,False,,,,,,,,,reverbnation,,,,,,,1560669615.0,,

,WeAreTheMusicMakers,"I have been producing records for a few years now and my biggest issue is consistency.
Everything from pre pro and the recording process to the mixing and mastering goes perfectly smooth when I do have a project. However the projects arent coming in as often as I'd like yet. My process when looking for artists to work with currently goes something along the lines of finding their music via reverbnation or bandcamp. I listen to their songs and shoot them a message telling them the things I liked and thought were interesting; Then ask if they have any new music in the works and see if they have a producer lined up.
I follow up by letting them know I am a producer and am interested in working with them and send some samples of my work if they are interested.
Not looking to ball or anything, just trying to pay rent and get some food in my stomach.
I love making music and I love working with people making there music sound great and I'd like to do it more.
What are some of the things you do to find work? Where do you like to look for work? 
I'd love to hear about your experiences in the industry and pick your brain a bit if you have time. Feel free to ask me anything as well! I have almost 10 years experience in recording and mixing music but I'm fairly new to the business and networking side of things.

,edmproduction,"Hello Fellow Redditors,   
I am a musician of 17 years now, however I have very rarely touched any kind of production software. I travel alot and rarely stay in a country longer than 6 months now which makes it difficult for me to buy gear to play with other musicians, let alone the language barrier. So I have decided to start making EDM. 3 years without playing much music is a killer on my soul, and I listen to more EDM now than I do metal anymore.   


Ive watched a few videos on what to invest in, but I don't want to jump all in just yet. I know I should start with a DAW, then an interface, then a synth, and due to my mobility needs, thats probably all I will get. Which DAW should I start with? I have used a little bit of Reaper, FL11, and cakewalk, but nowhere to being proficient with either. Should I get a beginner DAW and then move on to a more advanced DAW? I know Bitwig is both Windows/Linux friendly which I use both of those. I'm pretty sure I could settle on an interface and smaller synth pretty quickly once I get the hang of things.   


Whose videos would you recommend I watch as tutorials?  


Which sites are popular for EDM artists? I know back when I was playing music in bands Reverbnation was the main site for bands, but it seems dead AF now. I know soundcloud is pretty popular too.    


I know this might be a heated question, but whats the point of playing concerts if you just write a song and its sole way of being reproduced is through a recording and not through an instrument/vocals?

&amp;#x200B;

Every so often we hear about massive data breaches that result in compromised email addresses, but how can you check if you’re affected?

In 2013, 153 million email addresses were compromised by Adobe. In 2014, Black Hat World had three quarters of a million accounts breached from their system. Later that same year, Reverbnation had over 7 million accounts breached. Every so often, these massive user databases become victims of “hacking” which result in the collection of personal information by unauthorized parties. Most of us have several email addresses and use them in various parts of the internet, so how can you check if you've been affected by these breaches?

With the personal information that is gathered from these breaches, unauthorized parties can at best sell your email address to 3rd parties and at worst find ways to access your sensitive information like bank accounts, addresses (physical), phone numbers, and more. While the internet can certainly be a dangerous place, there are also many companies focused on developing more rigorous levels of security and are coming up with new ways to stay protected, such as [this app](https://millennialmoderator.com/an-app-to-protect-your-online-payments) that secures online payments.

So, how can you check if your email address has been compromised in any of the dozens of data breaches?

## Haveibeenpwned.com

[Haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) is a cleverly named website that looks through all the data breach records and lets you know if your email showed up on any of them. The website was made by Troy Hunt, who is a regional director at Microsoft and spends most of his life teaching cyber security. To use the [website](https://haveibeenpwned.com/), just enter your email address and it will tell you if it has been involved in any of the data breaches.

Now unfortunately, this website only tracks data breaches that have been publicly disclosed. Many data breaches however, go completely undetected, so it’s still important to exercise internet safety practices such as using more complex passwords and not entering personal information on fishy websites. I personally had a run in with a cyber security issue when my website was the victim of a spam bot attack back in 2018- you can read about what happened [here](https://millennialmoderator.com/identifying-invalid-website-traffic).

[Haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) is a great resource for identifying if your email address was used in any of the larger data breaches that have occured over the years. The website also allows you to sign up to be alerted if your email gets compromised in future data breaches- probably one of the more useful [newsletter](https://millennialmoderator.com/how-to-unsubscribe-from-any-newsletter) signups I've seen!

,premed,"Hey Guys,

So I submitted my application kind of late. August and got all my supplements in by end of October. I applied to about 9 different DO programs;

UNE COM
NYIT COM
WVSOM
Rowan SOM
LeCOM
PCOM
CCOM
Nova
ACOM

So far, I've only been invited to interview at ACOM and was wait listed. Nova, CCOM, UNE COM, have sent me rejections and I've yet to hear anything from anyone else.  At this point in the cycle I kind of feel like today's UNE COM rejection was the nail in the coffin for me and I'm now I feel pretty lost with what to do. 

My stats were:

500 mcat
3.7 science GPA
2000 hours hospital shadowing experience
10,000+ hours of volunteer experience (been working with the art of living foundation since I was about 8 and haven't stopped).
5 poster publications and 1 referred publication 
6 years of research experience. 
Solid letters of recommendation from my Dept head, my PI, a humanities course professor and multiple physicians I shadowed under. 
Undergrad TA for a 300 level course for 5 semesters.

Non-medical stuff:
Musician that's so far released 3 albums that charted decently (top 10 new artists Amazon MP3) etc etc. Over 1.5M music video views via reverbnation, about 83k views on YouTube. 

Photographer that's also been featured by Hoya Filters and done pretty well with you guys on r/earthporn. 

Undergrad in Neuroscience
Now doing a masters in Molecular and Cellular Biology. 


I thought I was okay with these stats but clearly not. I think I definitely have to retake the mcat, but I don't want to rush into it right now and try to reapply before the end of the summer again. As a result whatever I do now, I'd need to find something to fill 2 years (one for taking the MCAT another for the application process). But I'm pretty lost with what I can do now. 

Hopefully you guys will be able to guide me somewhere. 

To all of you that did gain admission! Congratulations you guys! To those in the same boat as me. We'll make it through it. It sucks but we will.

,musicians,"I'm in an Old Man Band playing some classic stuff (Steely Dan, Ray Charles, Elvis, Bruce) and some originals that the singer keyboardist has written.  

He's who I'm having the trouble with.  It's nothing I wanna throw my Bass across the room about, but I'm seeing a trend. 

Anyway. We recorded a demo with 7 songs (4 covers and 3 originals).  I also recorded videos of the recording session on my iPhone just to have something YouTube'able. 

When we got the Rough Cuts back from the sound engineer the singer was adamant that we not share them at all.  No Social media. nothing.  After a day of Back and Forth and some Texts and e-mails and and and I finally got him to agree that 3 of them were of good quality and should be shared.  So I did and he was all freaked out when they showed up on Facebook and people were commenting and stuff.  It was my Aunt and she was SUPER complimentary...  

I want to post even our Raw Demo/Rehearsal stuff so we can get a bit of a presence, but he only wants perfect polished stuff to see the light of day.  

So, Who's right.  Am I off base and since he's the defacto leader of the band he calls the shots...  Or do I push him into the Social Media Age?

If it helps...

&amp;#x200B;

so, has anyone dealt with this? ive always assumed nothing on reverb nation is free. so im guessing since i didn't enter my card (i hit cancel at that part) i dont have the ad. what a bummer.

,MusicInTheMaking," Hi, my name is Nick. I've been doing music for about 7 years (22 years old). Recently broke the chains of going through horrible spells of major depressive disorder and wanting to form a serious legit band. Pop Punk with elements of hardcore, old pop punk and stuff like that! I live in Virginia, but if there are any others wanting to work together and make something happen, i'd be down 100%.

Prefer people around my age, but As long as you have gear and passion, we can make something work.

Some Influences to consider: A Day To Remember, Blink 182, Death Cab For Cutie, AFI, Green Day, Sum 41, MxPx, Misfits. etc.

,gameDevClassifieds,"Hello all!

I am currently on the lookout for a film or game project in need of soundtrack work. While I have written for low budget horror film projects, I really want to get into to the video game music field as that is where my passion lies. The most recent game project I have worked on is Skjaldmaer. I am willing to provide music for free as I am primarily looking for experience and fun.  


Any of the tracks on my reverbnation or soundcloud pages are readily available for use in any projects (if you like them) Additionally, I am willing to make originals for free as well.

,u_Ylamaki,"*Jari  was born 1970 in Finland. He has been involved in composing music since  early 90’s. His first exposure to composing music came with  experimenting with the Kawai WK50 which was developed in late 90’s.*

      *PC-based music started to be developed also at the same time (around  96/97) and it's still strongly present in the music world. One software;  FastTracker 2.09 used by Jari to compose his music. Image-Lines Fruity  Loops was also used at that time and it's still one of the main  software’s (now known as FL-Studio).*

,musicbusiness,"Hello,

I was wondering if some people had the same thoughts as I do.
I'm the drummer in a band and a tech geek/programmer too. 

I feel very annoyed by the place facebook/instagram have taken in music promotion. I mean it seems (maybe wrongly) impossible today to have a band and not be present on social media platforms, and especially FB/Insta ... My band uses this to promote our tours mostly, and this is for 2 reasons :
1. The event system beats the crap out of any other system (bandsintown &amp; songkick both fail to differentiate bands using same names,therefore advertising gigs on the other side of the globe for my band)
2. A lot of our fans use those social media and expect us to communicate through that channel.

We were on tour recently and a guy came up to us, said he listened to us 15years ago and thought the band has split because he did not hear about us on mainstream radio/press. I'm afraid if we'd shut down our facebook page and instagram most people would just think the band is dead.

I'm very concerned that we are ourselves feeding the beast, pushing our fans to use social media, which I fiercly hate, but I see no options there.
Maybe some of you have ideas/thoughts about this.

Of course we could use emails but our mailing list has hardly 200 people in it. And I could programm some kind of social site owned and operated by us. With no commercials etc, but come on, at best that would end up being of those myspace lookalikes (reverbnation kinda stuff) where no one ever goes...

I'd really enjoy discussing thoughts around this.

,WeAreTheMusicMakers,"Greetings! I am getting ready to start releasing my music online. I'm 35, studied music in college, have been making music all my life, just never got around to releasing material publicly. I produce singer/songwriter, rock, reggae, pop, instrumental, soundtrack, funk, etc. types of tunes so I have plenty of material to release and communities of fans/friends to potentially sell to through iTunes etc.  


Goals: get music in distribution cheaply while putting music on a platform that amplifies success/has most pros  


Anyway, I'm on a budget so here are my initial thoughts;  


Reverbnation: you can release a single for $1 on 6 major platforms. This seems like a pretty cheap way to release a single. Apparently it takes 60-90 days after a sale to collect income from reverbnation?  


DistroKid: $20 is pretty cheap for unlimited releases, I could definitely release more than 20 songs in a year. Is it safe though? There seem to be copyright complaint issues people have put reviews in regarding?  


ONErpm: free apparently, collects a high %, perhaps best at helping market and promote artists? Maybe best option as long as I can switch distribution in the future using same songs (anyone know?)  


Tunecore: has movie sync  


CDbaby: physical distribution  


  
I wouldn't mind making less of a % if a company like ONErpm does a significant amount of promoting. Basically any thoughts on how much SUPPORT these companies offer and in relation to their cost pros and cons. Thank you for any input!

,Assistance,"hey guys Im working for a music video! I have one but its really bad quality recorded by myself! I posted the video unlisted but you can see it for yourself! Its on my gofundme page you can donate if you want too help but that it NOT THE MAIN GOAL  im asking. Im looking for promotion such as retweets, soundcloud listeners, fans, you name it and you can help! if you would like to read more of the backstory and how you can help check the gofundme page. I have been writing and recording for the last 15 years and its hard to get exposure and taken seriously as an artist if you don't have a high quality music video. I have over 50 sounds on my soundcloud just to show you my commitment to my music. I have a daughter so any money I get automatically goes to her so this is my way of reaching my goal without taking away from her! Any money gained will be strictly used for music video production and  come see for yourself when the videos get posted! And if anybody does share or donate send me a tweet @fatmeezy203 so i can personally thank you guys!  


Ps. Over the last week because of reddit, I have watched my views skyrocket to almost 500 views on soundcloud! Thank you all for the support!

but everytime i get it it seems like if you pay a little money they will boost your views/fans/audience

I've created an application which allow you to compose music visualization videos for sharing or demonstrating your compositions.  I've seen many posts here which link to a youtube video with static images.  I am a composer, Jazz pianist as well as a computer programmer.  I would be very interested to see what you think of this app for your own promotional purposes.
