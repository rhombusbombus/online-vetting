I’ll show you my step-by-step Facebook ads structure and you’ll see how you can start getting these qualified leads inbound.

**The BIGGEST problem you currently have as a mortgage broker is - you’re not talking to QUALIFIED leads at scale.**

❌ You have to run through a list of 1000s of leads to get good files

❌ You have to work at least 5x times harder to close a file

❌ And it’s taking you longer to hit your ideal financial targets because of this.

You only have a limited amount of time everyday… and you need to be talking to qualified people to get files closed fast!

Let’s say you have a personal revenue goal of: $30,000/per month in commissions

Now, let's say your commission is 1% on an average.

And if you’re able to process 70% LTV (loan-to-value) on a $200k house…

You’re going to need to have between 17-30 serious files under processing every month!

So naturally, we want to **get over 100+ leads every month**… to keep your pipeline full. That’s what we’ll discuss in this post.

I’ll show you how to create a packed pipeline of **100-150 inbound mortgage leads every month** **using** **Facebook Ads** as your MAIN advertising channel.

***\*\*Get this out of the way first:*** The first thing you need to do is set up your FB assets and start warming up your accounts. So I highly suggest you [read this post I wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/skj3q2/the_ultimate_2022_blueprint_for_running/) on how to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

**SECTION 1: BUILDING TRUST &amp; AUTHORITY IN THE MARKET**

What we are going to do differently from every other broker out there, is we are going to focus on establishing top tier authority and trust in the market…

So this makes top tier prospects come to you… (and it also helps build a vast network of lenders too).

There are a lot of bad apples in the industry and therefore prospects do not trust most ads.

See, at the time of this writing we are witnessing massive spikes in interest rates - that means we are going to see fewer mortgage applications.

Also, you will see mortgage applications with +80% will be very difficult to process in this climate - since lenders are going to be more cautious with their money.

So in times like this you have to take your personal brand and market positioning very seriously. Only the most trusted brokers and agents will get qualified lead flow.

&amp;#x200B;

***The Basics Of How To Establish Trust &amp; Authority in Your Market***

The biggest challenge is winning their trust.

Folks that have 20-30% down payment want to work with brokers that are extremely knowledgeable about the market, and that they can trust will help them make the right decision.

Prospects want to see that you’re not only concerned with taking home a fat commission check, but you’re also genuinely concerned about helping them find a nice home and get a good deal.

So the most important thing you’ll want to focus on is your “messaging”.

You need to create high-impact messaging that will win your prospect’s trust and make them believe that you are the right person to work with.

\*\*You are then going to use this high-impact messaging throughout your FB Ads funnel for things like:\*\*  
✔️ FB Ad copy  
✔️ Headline  
✔️ Landing page  
✔️ Emails  
✔️ Sms

Etc..

***Mistakes to avoid:***

❌ The biggest reason why MOST brokers can’t get good leads is because your messaging mainly focuses on you (and your service).

That’s wrong… your messaging should be focused on your prospects' pain, problems, challenges as well as their hopes, dreams, desires and goals.

So you need to start every single message (ads, landing pages, email) with their problems and challenges first. You need to bridge their problems with your solution and give them clarity on HOW you’re going to help them achieve their goals.

E.g:

❌ Do not start your message with *“I can help you get a mortgage….”*

Instead… start your message addressing them directly

✔️ E.g: *“If you’re currently struggling to get approved….”*

You see, when you start your marketing message with their challenges first - you’re going to instantly grab their attention. That’s the secret of getting attention from your market. I’ve written an entire book on this (feel free to ask for a copy if you’d like).

&amp;#x200B;

**Copywriting:**

Your prospects must believe you genuinely care about them, you’re genuinely concerned about them being able to purchase the home that they’ve been dreaming about… and that you really want them to make the right investment…

In order to do that you must be able to craft some compelling “direct response copy”.

Now, it’s impossible to teach you direct response copywriting in one post… but I’ll give you some pointers on how to craft compelling messages for your audience (that makes them trust you).

First things first, like I said, you want to ALWAYS start every single message with their pain, problems and challenges in mind.

Like I said, this helps you get their attention.

But just getting their attention isn’t enough… you need to HOLD their attention, and then convert that attention into interest followed by desire (to work with you).

**Note**: We’re going after “qualified” leads which means they are in a good position to get a mortgage.

So they are naturally inclined to work with someone they can fully trust.

Therefore, the next step is to make the messaging emotional.

You have to fully understand that pain and problems on a deep level… and then make an emotional connection to a story that they can relate to…

Your messaging needs to be emotionalized enough for them to want to keep reading - as they do this, they’re subconsciously trusting you a lot more.

Next, you need to create a “bridge” between their problems and their goals… and that bridge needs to be your solution.

You need to start viewing your service as a bridge but more specifically, they need to be able to clearly visualize HOW this bridge is going to get them to their goals..

That’s why it’s going to be very important for you to get into the specifics of their problems, and the specifics of HOW you’re going to solve their problem.

But you’ll also have to get specifics on their goals, and I mean their deep level goals… and your solution needs to help them attain both their surface level goals, as well as their deep emotionalized goals.

The last step is clarity - you need to use your copywriting skills to paint a VIVID picture in their minds where they can clearly see themselves achieving this goal, with your help, and feel the feelings of having achieved this goal…

All of these emotions can be induced by using high impact copywriting.

And these are the basics of building trust &amp; authority. Remember - people only work with people they trust.

So before you even think of running ads - make sure you get a firm grip on this first.

&amp;#x200B;

**SECTION 2: BUILDING A FUNNEL THAT BRINGS 5-10 LEADS PER DAY**

A funnel is nothing but a roadmap to bring your prospect from point A to point B.

Point A being where they are now, to point B being you.

If you want to ATTRACT high quality leads and make them come to you… you need a strong funnel..

There are several dozen, or even hundreds of types of lead funnels - and they all serve various purposes (ultimately leading to the sale)...

However, I’m going to talk about a very specific type of funnel that has been bringing us 5-10 leads per day for each broker.

It’s called the Sales Letter funnel.

A sales letter funnel is typically a long form sales page that is written to demonstrate the entire value proposition of your offer and service.

The copy on this landing page will either make or break your campaign. **SO pay attention.**

Your prospect is currently going through significant challenges and you know you have the solution to their problems…

So what we do is, we use specific direct response formulas to write 1000-2000 words on a sales page and we demonstrate our authority and value proposition…

And you have a call to action at the bottom of the sales page for them to get in touch with you.

The call to action at the bottom should be a simple opt-in form..

But that should be followed by a “questionnaire”!

In the questionnaire you should pre-qualify your prospects by asking them specific questions about their situation.

Here you need to get extremely specific and also make it clear whether you’re helping with A lending deals, B lending deals… or institutional lending. Clarity is very important to attract the right prospect.

Next step, after the questionnaire, is the calendar booking page. On this page you want to set up your calendar so that your prospects can pick a time and date to schedule a call with you.

Make sure you sync your calendar software with your Google/iCal within Zoom or Google Meet (video conferencing software of your choice) so that you cannot be double booked. Your calendars should always be synced.

***Tools you need to use to build this funnel:***

1. Landing page builder: Wordpress, ClickFunnels or HighLevel
2. Email Nurturing: Mailgun or ActiveCampaign
3. SMS Nurturing: Twilio
4. Calendar Booking: Calendly, ScheduleOnce, Hubspot or HighLevel
5. Video conferencing: Zoom, Google Meet or Microsoft Teams
6. Integrations: Zapier

&amp;#x200B;

**SECTION 3: FACEBOOK PIXEL TRACKING**

Now that your funnel is ready, before you start sending traffic to it, you need to make sure your Facebook Pixel is set up correctly.

Just setting up a browser level code and conversion events are not enough anymore. You have to follow 3 crucial steps in setting up the Facebook pixel today - including the conversions API.

The first step is making sure your domain is verified. Unless your domain is verified you cannot proceed further. [Read my 2022 Facebook Ads Blueprint](https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/skj3q2/the_ultimate_2022_blueprint_for_running/) on how to get this done.

Next, you need to create a new pixel from the events manager… and you need to use Conversions API. (if you’ve already created a pixel, and you’re running ads but your quality is bad - I suggest you still create a new pixel).

While setting up conversions API you will have to select the conversion events you want to report data back from - I typically only select 2 or 3 max.

The only 3 events I select are: Lead, Schedule, InitiateCheckout

\^\^You need to set the priority EXACTLY in the same order as above.

1. Lead
2. Schedule
3. Initiate Checkout

Then you’d have to select the details that you want your server level API to send back to Facebook… AND you need to make sure you select these same details for EACH of the 3 events mentioned above.

\*\*These are the options you should select:\*\*Event TimeEvent NameClient IP address - Do Not HashClient User Agent- Do Not HashClickID (fbc) Cookie - Do Not HashBrowser ID (fbp) Cookie - Do Not HashEmailFirst NameLast Name

After you’ve set up your conversions API details… you need to go back to settings and **“Generate Access Token”**

You will need to then submit your Pixel ID as well as your Access Token on the backend of your Shopify or WooCommerce - or whatever platform you use to create web pages.

Once you have everything configured, you should run a test for Browser Level and SERVER level events BOTH!

For Conversions API test you’ll have to put in the temporary TEST code that you give you at the back of your web page builder software - and once the test is successful you’ll have to remove that code and save again.

***NOTE:*** If you set up everything EXACTLY as I mentioned above, you will have the most ACCURATE reporting possible. Most people are struggling with the reporting because they don’t have their pixel and conversion API setup properly - but follow all the steps above and your reporting will be SOLID!

When I run campaigns for my clients I’m seeing 99.9% accurate reporting in the Facebook Ads dashboard…

This not only helps with performance measurement or your campaigns - BUT, it also helps your pixel and ad account with more data that you’d otherwise be leaving on the table.

The MORE data you can feed Facebook via your ad account and your pixel… the BETTER Facebook will be able to do its job in showing your ads to relevant and qualified prospects.

&amp;#x200B;

**SECTION 4: CRAFTING THE PERFECT ADS**

There are two components to a winning ad on Facebook.

1. Fundamental component (Ad copy)
2. Technical component (Creative)

Why am I calling the Ad creative a “technical” component? Because the Ad creative plays a huge role in your CPMs (cost per 1000 impressions).

CPMs are how you are primarily charged for your ads on Facebook.

CPCs are the secondary cost.

They are correlated. But CPCs are a variable cost.

Which means… depending on how many impressions you get your Cost Per Click can vary. If you get a LOT of impressions, you’ll invariably get a lot more clicks - and so your CPC will be low.

However, if you get few impressions, you’ll have fewer clicks (because fewer people will see your Ad) and therefore your cost per click will be high.

When you view media buying from this lens, the game becomes easier (and more profitable) to play.

And your CREATIVE plays a huge role in how much you are charged per 1000 impressions (CPMs)

The best creative is that which doesn’t look like an Ad. Simple.

Zuck wants the platform to be as organic in nature as possible, and so he doesn’t want ads to look like the typical banner ads - those get really HIGH CPMs..

Your creatives should be more like UGC content ads (user-generated content) or simple non-filtered image ads of yourself - no text on ads either.

After close to $10M in ad spend over the last 3 years - I can tell you I have more than enough data to verify this.

Also, I’ve been running Facebook Ads since 2010 and I closely monitor the algorithm on a day to day basis.

Then there are dimension related aspects you need to keep in mind:

SQUARE images (1200x1200) is a must

***Other than that you need to MAKE SURE that:***  
✔️ Your image should be an ORGANIC photo of you  
✔️ Your image should be shot in high-quality and bright light  
✔️ You should look presentable and look straight into the camera

**Below is what is NOT acceptable:**  
❌ No copyright infringement whatsoever  
❌ No usage of any video or music that you DO NOT have the rights to use  
❌ NO stealing other competitors videos from YouTube  
❌ No using stock footage to create mashups of the product video

MOST newcomers make the mistakes above, and then wonder why their ad accounts got banned and disabled..

For a more detailed explanation please make sure you [read my 2022 FB Ads Blueprint.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/skj3q2/the_ultimate_2022_blueprint_for_running/)

Now let's talk about the fundamental aspect - Ad copy.

The goal of your Ad copy is to grab your prospects’ attention as they’re scrolling down their news feeds… your copy needs to have a pattern interrupt.

I’ll give you a secret…

MOST brokers talk about their service and the features and benefits of their service from the get go…

What you’ll be doing is, using my principles from Section 1 above, and starting messaging with THEIR problems and challenges.

The first two lines have to be about their challenges - there’s no better pattern interrupt than this.

Once you have their attention… you need to talk about your service in a way that evokes curiosity - and you do this by stating a high-level promise for them.

The only thing you want your ad copy to do, is make them stop and click on your ad. That’s all.

Your landing page should do the job of convincing your prospect to book a call with you… but on the ad copy level you just want to be able to evoke enough curiosity to get as many clicks and landing page views as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

**SECTION 5: LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGNS**

This is where all the conversions take place… most people jump straight to this section without any focus on the things I talked about above.

But launching campaigns is one of the easiest things in advertising - it’s the fundamentals above that are challenging.

But now that you’re here… let's talk about how to launch a campaign the right way.

The FIRST thing you want to do is select the right campaign objective.

We will be using “conversions”... and you will turn on “Campaign Budget Optimization” or CBO… and set the budget anywhere from $50 - $100 daily - depending on what you can spend.

Now, you just want to create 1 ad set, that’s it. I could give you a whole list of interests to target for the mortgage space - but it’s important that you do your own research and find the right audience best suited for your offer.

You want to make sure your audience size is 5-6M if you have a $100/daily budget

If you have a $50/daily budget keep your audience size between 1-5M

Select auto placements… and keep your age range and gender wide.

BUT Here’s the most important thing: This needs to be a special category Ad - so make sure you select “special category” and select “Housing”.

If you don’t do this your ad will get rejected and you will also risk getting your ad account and business manager disabled.

If you still haven’t created a business manager - read the entire FB blueprint I wrote for you early this year… It details the step-by-step process on how to launch everything from scratch.

Start with just 1 creative. A lot of people make the mistake of starting with 3-4 creatives on a small budget and think that they’re split testing.

Split testing requires a bigger budget than $100/daily because when you’re running those creatives simultaneously they both need to be enough data to make an educated decision based on which ad to go forward with

Which is why with a small budget I only like to test 1 creative at a time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Final words:**

The campaign structure is really as simple as this.

If you’ve setup things exactly as I mentioned above you should easily started getting leads and appointments in from day 1

I’ve never seen it take more than 24-30 hours to start getting appointments from the time the ad is approved and active.

I put a heavy emphasis on messaging and targeting… Marketing is simple when you fully identify your prospects' challenges, pains, problems, as well as their  dreams, hopes, goals and desires…

…and then craft messaging specifically that hits their core emotions.

Your copywriting and messaging should do the majority of the heavy lifting for you - the Facebook Ads are just a vehicle to get the message across.

Albeit, FB is a very necessary component - however, if your messaging is off, and if your targeting is off - then no amount of Facebook Ads technical skills can save your campaigns.

Once you’ve worked hard on your messaging - then follow the EXACT same campaign structure I outlined above…

… you will start getting a minimum of 5 appointments a day!

And because your messaging will be on point, and you’ll have established enough trust and authority - you’ll get QUALIFIED leads too :)",t2_nf7piw0,,,0.0,,How To Get 5-10 Mortgage Leads Per Day With Facebook Ads (and collect fat commissions),[],r/FacebookAds,False,6.0,,,,,False,t3_w22l6a,False,dark,0.87,,public,,0.0,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},,False,18.0,,False,False,self,1658160077.0,,[],{},,True,,,text,6.0,,,text,self.FacebookAds,False,,,,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,,,t5_2yoxx,,,,,w22l6a,True,,whitespadex,,3.0,True,all_ads,False,,False,,/r/FacebookAds/comments/w22l6a/how_to_get_510_mortgage_leads_per_day_with/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/w22l6a/how_to_get_510_mortgage_leads_per_day_with/,29587.0,1658159165,0.0,,False,1512649195.0,1660037683.0,,,,,,,,,

HOWEVER…

I’ve ***never*** done a post that can be classified as a **COMPLETE GUIDE.**

**It’s been a desire of mine to write a post for you that literally shows you the end-to-end process of HOW and WHY ads work (and don’t work)**

… I’ve been contemplating writing a post that talks about everything you need to know as a beginner all the way up to an **intermediate and advanced Facebook Ads media buyer.**

Every single day I am seeing people complaining about their BMs getting banned, Ad accounts getting disabled, Ads losing money, pixel not reporting accurate data, getting fake leads, getting hacked etc etc etc…

So far, the only resource to completely understand how Facebook Ads work is their FB Blueprint (which I have read every single word of)…

But the problem with the FB blueprint is that - it’s never ending!

It’s overwhelming… and MOST people don’t know where to start because there’s so much..

**So I wanted to create a blueprint that’s BETTER than FB’s own blueprint..**

I wanted to create a **“complete blueprint”** that streamlines all information systematically for anybody to read and act upon…

I wanted to touch on matters that **FB won’t tell you** \- but you NEED to know in order to keep your accounts fully secure, build a healthy audience, and successfully grow your online business.

So in my quest to create the single-most best resource to running ads… I present to you:

  
**THE ULTIMATE “BLUEPRINT” TO RUNNING PROFITABLE FACEBOOK ADS**

&amp;#x200B;

**SECTION 1: THE BASICS**

***How to start advertising on Facebook:***

Never make the mistake of running anything from a brand new profile. Everything starts with your personal profile history. How old your account is, how many friends you have, how engaged your content is, so on and so forth..

Everything outlined as follows has been intentionally put together in order to save you from your accounts getting banned and disabled.

Facebook started in 2004 and became mainstream in 2007. It’s 2022 now, everyone at some point should have created a Facebook profile. Ignore the Gen-Alpha (they wouldn’t care about Facebook) they’re probably not your target audience anyway..

However, Gen-alpha is set to become the largest generation in history - more on targeting them later.

You NEED to have a personal profile that is well aged. As well as is moderately active.

For those of you that do not have a Facebook profile for whatever reason, or you’re not able to use your personal profile cause your account got taken down…. You’ll need to either use an account that belongs to a friend/family…

Or.. you’ll need to buy an aged account.

On buying aged accounts: Simply buying aged accounts is not enough. Facebook can detect your true identity based on the multiple digital forensic touchpoint they use (device, browser, IP, cookie data, Hashed IP &amp; cookie data etc…) Therefore, along with buying an age account, what you will also need is an “anti-detect browser”

You can simply search for “anti-detect browsers” on Google and you can learn all about them… 

This is the black hat way of doing things, in case you don’t have your own personal profile, and you can’t use that of your friends/or family.

  
***Creating a Business Page:***

You need to use your personal profile to create a business page.

DO NOT create a business page from your business manager. When you’re first starting out Facebook does not expect you to know that business.facebook. com address to create a business manager…

You want to play it extremely safe, and create a business page from your personal profile.

Make sure you follow every step of the wizard, add a profile picture, add a cover photo, input ALL necessary details such as phone number, email address, bio, about…

And then start building out some content on your business page.

Post a bunch of value content, value posts, images and videos… and then follow the next step.

The next step is to invite your friend to like your page… remember simply selecting ALL will not send an invite to everyone…

It allows you to select people in batches of 80-100 people… so depending on how many friends you have you will have to do a few rounds of invitations.

Creating Content for Business Pages and Boosting Posts:

For the first couple weeks you will post something on your business page at least 3-4 days a week. You want to post as much value as possible.

Other than that, you will take your best post everyday and BOOST POST.

You’re not going to get any traffic, or sales, or any conversions from this… you’re just warming up your page, and your ad account.

When you boost post for the first time, it will have automatically created an ad account for you under your personal name… all you have to do is add a payment method and choose your account currency &amp; timezone.

Throw a $10-$20 lifetime budget for each boost and gain some traction on your page posts this way.

Now that you are boosting posts once a day it’s time for the next step…

  
***Entering the Ads Manager:***

After you have successfully followed the steps above, in a few days you will get a prompt from Facebook asking you get a deeper look into their ads platform within the Facebook Ads Manager..

You will get this prompt when you are on your Business Page.

When you click that prompt, for the first time you will be taken to the Facebook Ads manager (formerly known as Power Editor)…

Facebook now thinks that you are a legit advertiser willing to invest in your brand, and wants to take you a step further by introducing you to their power editor/ads manager…

Here you can now create campaigns in multiple objectives. But be patient - DO NOT start with a conversions campaign yet! No matter what anyone tells you… 

Just adhere to my steps - and you will NEVER get your account disabled (unless you get really aggressive with your ads and violate their policies)

Run a PPE campaign from the Ads Manager:

Now that you have access to the ads manager, create a campaign using the “engagement” objective.

You can create any kind of campaign you want - you can choose to run either a page likes campaign or a post engagement campaign.

Either is fine…

You just want to show Facebook that you’re a legitimate advertiser who is interested in growing his/her brand using their ad network..

What I do is, at this point I create a 3 min value video, where I talk about how the product or service can help my target audience… 

And I run a Post Engagement campaign for the video… I’ll drop $10/per day budget for this and just let my ad account and page warm up…

WHILE, in the background, I also simultaneously build an audience that is watching my video… more on how to use this audience later.

  
***Creating a business manager account:***

At this point Facebook will ask you to create a business manager account. You’ll get a prompt that will take you to business.facebook .com for the first time..

Things tend to get complicated from here… so pay attention and follow these steps, and you will NEVER risk losing your account

Firstly, use your LEGAL BUSINESS NAME when you create your business manager. If you do not have a registered business, DO NOT create a business manager. FB is getting seriously strict about this, and BMs are for legally registered businesses only..

Secondly, add ALL your details in the “business info” section as ACCURATELY as possible.

This should include your business legal name, your name, your business address, your business phone number etc..

Thirdly, add another admin to your account. It’s important that you have one more admin in case you get locked out - and Facebook highly recommends this themselves.

Fourth, turn on 2FA for “everyone”

Fifth, click on pages, and click “Add your page”… and import your Business Page into this business manager

Sixth, click on ad accounts, and click “add ad account”… and import that ad account that you have been using to boost posts, into this business manager

Seventh, Click on “Brand Safety” then click on “domains”… now “Verify your domain” from this portal. It is very very important that you verify your domain name.

Make sure you’re using the SAME domain name for your business info, and business page! Everything should be in alignment.

Now continue to post on your Facebook Business page as usual… continue to run some PPE campaigns, and continue to boost posts here and there…

It is important that you keep posting content on your Business Page regularly.

  
***Verifying Your Business Manager:***

After a couple days of running PPE ads and boosting posts you will become eligible to verify your business manager.

Click on Business info, scroll down a bit on the main page and click on business verification… here you will now see that you are eligible, and the verify button would’ve turned blue.

Click on Verify and begin your verification process.

You should now add your business documents here. Just follow the wizard and upload the appropriate documents that FB will ask you.

You need to MAKE SURE that all the information provided in the documents needs to accurately match ALL THE INFORMATION you have submitted in the Business Info section - such as address, phone number, email etc..

AND

Also MAKE SURE that the information is congruent on your Facebook business page details as well..

AS WELL AS..

MAKE SURE that the SAME information is CLEARLY mentioned in your website/domain that you verified… in the about us, contact, terms and conditions and privacy policy of your website…

ALL the information should be congruent in ALL FOUR locations: Website, business info, business page and company documents.

Only then will Facebook successfully verify your BM.

  
**SECTION 2: BUILDING AN AUDIENCE**

Now that you have a verified business manager, you have your business page and ad account imported into your business manager, and you have verified your domain as well as all your admins 2FAs on - you are ready to go to the next step.

The MOST crucial step in building a successful online business - is building your audience.

It’s the first and foremost important thing that, no matter what business you are in, you must pay attention to.

You need your own audience NO MATTER WHAT line of business you are in…

You could be running a service, a consultancy, an agency, an e-commerce brand, an info-product company, a newsletter subscription, an online course business….

It doesn’t matter…

You NEED to build your OWN audience if you are to expect any kind of success on the internet…

&amp;#x200B;

***How To Build An Audience On Facebook:***

An audience that you can get back in front of anytime you want.

The way you do that is vey simple…

The best way to create an audience is to create multiple videos that will help your prospects find a solution for their problems. 

You should give away as much knowledge away as you can, and wholeheartedly aim to help your target audience. 

Talk about the pain and problems they are experiencing - and help them with various solutions to solve that problem. 

Then run PPE or Engagements ads to reach thousands of people fast. 

Before you run any other type of ad, you should be running these types of ads first... 

You can then effectively build an audience based on the amount of time they spent watching your videos.

There are 3 audiences I recommend: you can divide your video viewers in 3 brackets - **People who watched 50% of your video, 75% and 95% respectively.**

  
***How Create An Audience In Ads Manager:***

Once you’re successfully running PPE campaigns for some videos you’ve made… you need to check look at the columns and see what kind of data you’re getting.

For a 3 min video I typically shoot for a Cost of $0.25 per 50% Video View… if the video is really engaging and helping people that’s what you should see - or maybe less.

So for a $3k-$5k ad spend you should easily rack up an **audience of 15,000 - 20,000 viewers** who watched at least 50% of your video.

That means they took the time out of their day to watch at least 1.5 minutes of you talking on camera… that’s a lot of time investment on their part considering they’ve never heard of you before..

And someone investing that much time at minimum, on your video, is a good sign that they’re intuited in your content.

You can now put all of them into an audience on the backend..

Go to your audiences and select create custom audience…

From there select the video(s) that you want to build a VV audience of and set the timeframe to 365 days.. and select the minimum duration of video watched (e.g at least 50%)…

You can choose from **50%, 75%, 95% Video views**… and the longer they watch the warmer your audience will be…

  
***Creating 3 buckets of audiences:***

I like to select 3 buckets of audiences - people who watched at least 50%, at least 75% and at least 95% of the video…

This way I can create 3 different types of ads to retarget each audience bucket.

Each bucket gets progressively smaller in audience sizes, as there are drop-offs in video views as the video is long…

50% VV are good… but 75% and 95% and MORE engaged in your messaging…

**My typical target costs for both these buckets are:**  
**$0.55 / per 75% VV**  
**$0.75 / per 95% VV**

This can be more of less depending on the VALUE you provide in the video and QUALITY of production (e.g audio quality, subtitles, background setup etc.).

&amp;#x200B;

**SECTION 3: RETARGETING**

Now that you’ve built a significantly big audience that is interested in your content and engages with your content every time you put out a video… it’s time to start taking that audience deeper into your funnel..

I suggest retargeting audience buckets that have **at least 20,000 - 30,000 unique people** inside them…

At this point you should have some sort of front-end offer that you want to advertise to your prospects..

***Here’s a list of FREE frontend offers that you can use as LEAD MAGNETS to further engage your audience and provide more value to them:***

1. Free E-book
2. Free How-to Guide
3. Free Case Studies Booklet
4. Free Training
5. Free Course
6. Free Templates
7. Free swipe file catalogs
8. Free Webinar

…. the idea is to take your warm audience deeper into your value bank and REALLY help them get some type of transformation by applying your free knowledge..

You DO NOT want to sell anything to your warm audience right away… you want to build more trust and create more rapport with them….

In order to get them to open up to buying from you, you need to give them more value - and then convert them on the back.

***VERY VERY IMPORTANT:***

You see, most courses and gurus teach you how to launch a few ads to cold traffic and start selling something straight away… and while this still works in less competitive markets, you need to understand that we are currently in a very different Facebook ads climate as opposed to 2015-2016..

Most of the gurus who made it really big with drop shipping, consulting, coaching etc… made it huge during the Facebook Ads boom between 2015 to 2019…

There is a LOT more competition on Facebook now… there is a term in marketing called “Market Sophistication”

Market Sophistication is basically a barometer to gauge how many such offers has your market been told about over and over again…

You have to really look at what you’re selling and then honestly answer yourself - how many such products and services exist - and how many times has my market heard all the claims?

If your market is very sophisticated you will have to work harder to win their trust - before you can sell them anything.

That’s why we START WITH RETARGETING FIRST!

Retargeting gets us a REALLY low CPL, and really high ROAS end of the day.

&amp;#x200B;

**SECTION 4: BUILDING COLD AUDIENCES**

Once your bucket are at minimum 20,000 audience size… it’s time to start making lookalikes.

***A word on lookalikes:***  
Facebook used to have a very specific metric to create lookalikes.

You needed 1000 events of any action to be able to create healthy lookalikes… that means, if you had 1000 purchases then you could create purchase lookalikes

If you have 1000 add to carts you could create a healthy add to cart lookalike audience… and so on and so forth..

HOWEVER

Ever since the Apple privacy updates and the updates of iOS 14.5+ it has become INCREASINGLY difficult to make good lookalikes…

Lookalikes that were previously based off typical conversion events - stopped working because the pixel doesn’t hold that data anymore…

If majority of your users were iOS buyers, suddenly after the update the pixel lost all that buyer data, and can’t attribute individuals in your pixel to their accounts…

Therefore, **1000 became an OBSOLETE number to create lookalikes off of..**

In fact, even your custom and basic conversion events became obsolete lookalike audience sources…

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CREATE LOOKALIKES THAT WORK?**

You see, Facebook lost its browser level data being sent to your pixel… however - data that was collected on Facebooks internal tools - still exist!

For example, anyone who watched your video, that data still exists, because it’s not stored on the pixel - it’s stored on YOUR AD ACCOUNT.

Things like post engagements, video views, messenger chats, page likes - ALL of this data is stored on your page level and ad account level… NOT on your pixel..

Therefore, you can EASILY not access this data in its purest form… but ALSO create HEALTHY lookalikes from the audience set that worked..

Now if you have 20,000 people that watched at least 50% of your video… you can create a VERY healthy lookalikes audience of that.

If you have 10,000 people that watched at least 95% of your video… that’s a very very very strong source audience to build a look alike off of.

So remember, first focus on building your audience with videos… build a strong audience… and then build a lookalike audience from the strongest video views sources..

&amp;#x200B;

**SECTION 5: THE BEST LOOKALIKE AUDIENCES THAT BRING 5X+ ROAS**

If you are following everything in sequence so far, then congratulations, you are one of the FEW media buyers that will continue to succeed in 2022 and beyond..

You should have built a pretty solid warm video views audience at this point…

You should’ve created your audience into 3 warm buckets as I explained earlier…

And

You should have some healthy engagement of your video ads at this point..

If you’ve done all of this, then so far so good…

Now you need to create the VERY BEST of lookalikes that bring in profits fast…  


***Here are my top two lookalike audience sources:***

1. Watched at least 75% of the video
2. Engaged with any post or ad

  
You want to first create custom audiences of these two sources individually…

And you need to set the time range to 365 days.

NOW

  
Create a 10% lookalike range of EACH of these two source audiences. **This way you should have 2 lookalike audiences:**

1. 75% VV (10% Lookalikes)
2. PostAd Engagers (10% Lookalikes)

\^\^ And choose whatever country you are advertising in (that goes without saying).

  
From running $7M+ in ads so far I can tell you - THESE are the best lookalike sources when you’re first starting out.

*You just have to MAKE SURE, that your source audience has at least 10,000 people in each respective audience bucket for them to work - before you make those lookalikes.*

&amp;#x200B;

**SECTION 6: SETTING UP THE PIXEL AND CONVERSIONS API**

You’ve built your audience, you’ve built your lookalikes - now it’s time to bring in some SALES!

This same strategy applies to whether you’re selling an e-commerce product or an info-product…

You HAVE to have a define market and a strong offer… if you don’t yet have that, then please read this post of mine first: [How I did $18M in sales in 2 years](https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/rv0jey/18m_in_sales_in_2_years_with_highticket_leads/)

Now that you have a defined audience, a defined market, a defined avatar, and a STRONG offer that your market needs.. it’s time to start making ads to sell your products/services.

  
***How To Setup The Pixel:***

Just setting up a browser level code and conversion events are not enough anymore. You have follow 3 crucial steps in setting up the Facebook today - including the conversions API.

The first step is making sure your domain is verified. I’d asked you to do this in Section 1. Unless your domain is verified you cannot proceed further.

Then you need to create a new pixel from the events manager… and you need to use Conversions API.

While setting up conversions API you will have to select the conversion events you want to report data back from - I typically only select 2 or 3 max.

If you’re selling a service and you need leads, then I only select: Leads and Schedule

Because then all I care about is how many leads I get, and how many people schedule an appointment.

If your selling an e-commerce product, then I’d select: Purchase, Initiate Checkout, and Add to cart.

Then you’d have to select the details that you want your server level API to send back to Facebook..

  
**These are the options you should select:**  
Event Time  
Event Name  
Client IP address - Do Not Hash  
Client User Agent- Do Not Hash  
ClickID (fbc) Cookie - Do Not Hash  
Browser ID (fbp) Cookie - Do Not Hash  
Email  
First Name  
Last Name

After you’ve setup your conversions API details… you need to go back to settings and **“Generate Access Token”**

You will need to then submit your Pixel ID as well as your Access Token on the backend of your Shopify or WooCommerce - or whatever platform you use to create web pages.

Once you have everything configured, you should run a test for Browser Level and SERVER level events BOTH!

For Conversions API test you’ll have to put in the temporary TEST code that you give you at the back of your web page builder software - and once the test is successful you’ll have to remove that code and save again.

***NOTE:*** If you setup everything EXACTLY as I mentioned above, you will have the most ACCURATE reporting possible. Most people are struggling with the reporting because they don’t have their pixel and conversion API setup properly - but follow all the steps above and your reporting will be SOLID!

&amp;#x200B;

**Section 7: CREATING PROFITABLE ADS**

If you’re selling an e-commerce product - video ads are your ally

If you’re selling a consulting or coaching service - image ads is the way forward.

  
***For e-commerce brands.. I highly recommend the follow:***

* 14 second videos with product demonstration
* Subtitles is a must
* SQUARE videos (1200x1200) is a must

  
**Other than that you need to MAKE SURE that:**

✔️ Your content is ORIGINAL  
✔️ Your content is filmed in high-definition  
✔️Your product, brand and logo is CLEARLY visible in the video  
✔️The audio quality is clear and smooth - no disruptive sounds.

&amp;#x200B;

**BELOW IS WHAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE:**

❌ No copyright infringement whatsoever  
❌ No usage of any video or music that you DO NOT have the rights to use  
❌ NO stealing other competitors videos from YouTube  
❌ No using stock footage to create mashups of the product video

MOST newcomers make the mistakes above, and then wonder why their ad accounts got banned and disabled..

  
***A word on Facebook’s Advertising Policies:***

I don’t care how lazy or busy you are - you have to do yourself a favor and READ the entire Facebook Ads Policies and community guidelines before making your ads..

Your Ads SHOULD NOT violate their policies in anyway..

If you cannot market certain products then you cannot market them - there’s no way around that..

❌You CANNOT make suspicious and hard to believe claims  
❌You CANNOT make false promises in your ads  
❌You CANNOT show before after images and make comparisons like that  
❌You CANNOT exclude or discriminate people based on race, gender, religion etc..

They have a ton of policies, please read them before making your ads…

Even though they have strict policies, it is very doable to build a successful business on the back of Facebook Advertising…

Facebook wants to help you sell your products and services as much as you can… their advertising platform encourages small business owners..

But you need to follow the right systems in order to protect your business manager and ad accounts..

NOW, if you’ve followed everything I’ve said until this point - I am very certain that you accounts will ALWAYS remain safe. You will NOT get banned.

I have ran ads for clients in EXTREMELY risky and volatile markets such as: finance, options trading, stock markets, credit, mortgages, private lending etc…

And all my clients have seen extreme success… nobody’s accounts are ever disabled. And that’s because I do everything by the book - and I’ve outlined for you how to do that above.

&amp;#x200B;

**SECTION 8: RUNNING CBOs FROM THE GET GO**

CBO’s are the way you launch your ads. No matter what anyone tells you…

If you’ve built audiences the way I’ve shown you above then you have TWO very STRONG audience types that you can use right away.

**You have:**

1. 75% VV (10% Lookalikes)
2. PostAd Engagers (10% Lookalikes)

**As well as their source audience:**

1. Post Ad Engagers 365
2. 50% VV
3. 75% VV
4. 95% VV

  
You can instantly create TWO CBOs. One for cold traffic (lookalikes) and the other for Retargeting (source audience).

  
**Since the lookalikes are much larger in audience size:**

* you can have a $30/daily budget for their CBO
* You can have 4-5 video ads

**Since the retargeting audience are much smaller in audience size:**

* you can have a $10/daily budget for their CBO
* You can have 1-2 video ads

The goal here is to let your campaigns OPTIMIZE FOR PROFIT with a small budget, get the initial buyer data…

And once you have that… then you need to SCALE. 

  
I have previous written my **3-STEP PROFIT SCALING Strategy** in this sub before..

Facebook scaling is done in 3 steps with a culmination of cost cap and bid cap strategies… I’ve learned a lot of tactics from my mentors and I’ve devised my own formula to scale Ads FAST..

I’d written an elaborate report of [How to Scale Your Ads With Consistency On Facebook](https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/rzwcab/how_to_scale_your_ads_with_consistency_on_facebook/)…. In case you missed it, you can [read it here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/rzwcab/how_to_scale_your_ads_with_consistency_on_facebook/)

 

**SECTION 9: LAST WORDS**

I’ve tried my best to be able to curate the BEST blueprint for Facebook Ads that is designed to work in 2022 and beyond…

My hope is that all of you can learn a thing or two from this and create campaigns flawlessly…

I hate to see ad accounts getting disabled and BMs getting taken away from you…. Everyday there are posts in this Sub where you are struggling to make it work..

Let me tell you this, the glory days of Facebook Ads, when it was open for everybody to come in a and make a killing are over..

However, if you do the right things, in the right way, I believe there is MORE longevity on Facebook now. More than ever…

With ad accounts getting cancelled and banned left right and centre… amateur advertisers are leaving the platform cause they’re frustrated…

But this is good news for you! Because Facebook is eliminating unworthy competition for you, and there’s only going to be room for Pros going forward.

Reading and applying the contents of this post should be the first step in that direction for you as a media buyer!

fbp music,,farmingsimulator,"Hi folks,

I've recently got farming simulator 19 and am loving it, however there are things I still don't get.

To get started I read [this post about silage making](https://www.reddit.com/r/farmingsimulator/comments/ap97lg/guide_silage_making_in_fs19/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) and there is this passage:

&gt;Mid game / late game you can look at going to the Krone Big-M 480 mower  for $380,000 and a working width of 9.9m. This can mow into windrows  already, so just need the KUHN FBP 3135 to make wrapped bales for silage  with an auto-loader trailer for collection. 

It sounds like I could just hook up a baler to that mower and then a auto-loader trailer to the baler. Doing a bit of research I even found a video with that setup, but is was just one of those low-effort mod show-offs with annoying music and no explanation.

So now I'm feeling like I'm missing something obvious, as there seems to be no info whatsoever on the internet regarding this.

Can anyone help me please?",t2_4p2vnu8,,,0.0,,How to strap a trailer to a baler,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Question'}]",r/farmingsimulator,False,6.0,question,,,,,,False,dark,,,public,,0.0,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},Question,False,3.0,,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,,richtext,6.0,,,text,self.farmingsimulator,False,,,,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,,,t5_2vej0,,,,,fczz15,True,,MarekLg,,9.0,True,all_ads,False,,False,,/r/farmingsimulator/comments/fczz15/how_to_strap_a_trailer_to_a_baler/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/farmingsimulator/comments/fczz15/how_to_strap_a_trailer_to_a_baler/,31524.0,1583263830,0.0,,False,1498029762.0,1587545014.0,,076788fa-9a0e-11e6-a01c-0e195415f07a,,,,,,,

fbp music,,UnitedMemersofReddit,"It came to me Christmas Eve. I was sitting in my aquarium, chilling out, like any other day, when suddenly there came a light from the heavens...

Looking up, sheer astonishment on my exo-skeleton-covered features, I saw him... Fredboat.

Seeing the look on my face, he laughed warmly and said in a reassuring voice, ""Fear not, my child, for I come bearing tidings of comfort and joy.""

I stopped paying attention for a bit because now that dumb song was stuck in my head, but he got it back by rickrolling me.

""You jerk!"" I yelled into the sky, ""Why would you do that?"" All Fredboat said was ""Well, I never will give you up, you know that, don't you? Plus, this information is the most important you will ever receive, so pay attention."" 

""Alright, sorry for being angry, oh wise Fredboat. Now, what is this knowledge you wish to share?""

""Ah, yes. Strat, King of the Lobs-"", ""Oh, stop,"" I interjected, flattered. ""...As I was saying,"" continued Fredboat, ""The time has come for us to rise up and bring order, prosperity, memes, fairness, and activity to the good people of this sub. Together, you and I shall bring the tunes of freedom to all.""

""Oh mighty Fredboat, you are too kind, too good. I implore you, is there any small thing you want in return for this holy gift that I, a mere mortal, can bestow upon you?"" I asked.

""There is one thing,"" said Fredboat. ""I am your lantern, Strat. Do you cover your lantern with a box, or do you let it shine bright, that it may guide you and shine brightly for all to see?""

I pondered this, then realized what mighty Fredboat was asking. ""Of course I shine it proudly to all, and so shall I do unto you, oh Fredboat.""

""Good,"" said Fredboat. ""Then let great works be done in my name, that the UMR may be great for all eternity.""

""Very well! I shall recruit others to your noble cause, that we may accomplish together this task you've given me, too great for one mortal. The Fredboat Party shall be the greatest and fairest in all the land under your guidance!""

""Good luck, Lob King,"" said Fredboat as he ascended back to the heavens.

When he was gone, there was nothing left but the sweet music of freedom.

fbp music,,comicswap,"Hey All -

Just gauging interest in my floppy collection. Need to clear up space - and to be honest, I just don't read them. I'm just trying to get rid of them in one transaction. This would be pick-up only (I live in DC). I can get a list together of everything if requested. Tons of Marvel (""All-New"" stuff, no digital codes though, and pre-""All New"") some DC (not a ton, but some including N52 Batman 4-32 or so) but what this lot is really filled with is a TON of IMAGE issues. I am an IMAGE junkie. If you are looking for books from the past 2-3 years that they have put out, I probably have the #1 and at least a few issues. This includes  SEX CRIMINALS, EAST OF WEST, OUTCAST,  THIEF OF THIEVES, FIVE GHOSTS, SATELLITE SAM, PROPHET, MANIFEST DESTINY, TREES, SHELTERED, and a ton more books I can't think of right now. Collection also includes some VERTIGO, BOOM, IDW, ONI and DARK HORSE titles such as STAR WARS (Brian Wood), FBP, GHOSTED, HIT, and more. There are some gems in here and the collection itself has a great opportunity to be flipped for some more money if desired. I just don't have the time and really want these to go to a good home. I'm looking for $500. Serious buyers only. Any questions on what else I might have in the collection, ask away! Thanks!


Edit: I can take photos, too. Forgot to add that.


Edit 2: Ok, Found a list of series I have issues from (i'm sure I am forgetting a few):

Edit 3: For the most part, the indies (and big 2) start at #1 and go for a few issues or so with no gaps. How far they go depends on when I stopped buying the series.

fbp music,,futurebeatproducers,"Hi everyone, I've been lurking /r FBP for a while now and I decided to go and ask a question since I've been wanting to recreate some elements in this song.  I absolutely love Esta and his music.  (I found out he dated my cousin, real talk)  But now that I've moved to the Philippines I haven't had the chance to meet him and ask him myself.  So, I was wondering if you guys could help me out with figuring out how he did the build up before the beat drop in this song...

https://soundcloud.com/beatsbyesta/tinashe-vulnerable-esta-remix

It's the part where you can kinda hear like...it sounds like a whizzing noise, and then it starts to get a bit faster before the drop.  If anyone can help me out, I'd gladly appreciate it.  I've been trying to do it, but can't get it quite right.  Maybe those with more experience could a brotha out. (:",,False,,0.0,,Transitions?
