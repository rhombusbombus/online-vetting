,totalwar,"Hi, the rework mechanic of herdstones making nearby lands uninhabitable makes me not to want play beastmen. They were bad before the rework, but better than this. It would be better if they stayed as were, but were given more upkeep reduction, like WoC were in Warh 2. Currently I raze a town, move to a next and the razed one is still qucickly repopulated by another faction. So I stay for a long time in the same area, running from one previously razed town to another. I liked roaming all over the map, from before the rework, it was unique and good horde campaign. The rework was to stop AI from quickly repopulating. The rework did not work. The same problem was with WoC and Norsca.

CA was near to good idea, but decided to move around and came back. They should have simply given to beastmen the little outposts which wood elfs have everywhere except of magical forests. Every outpost with garrison strong enough to repel small armies. Also one building there built form start, gving chaos in the province, replenishment and gold, and could be god dedicated variants with diffrent special buffs, like Norsca have.

Perhaps beastmen should have big settlements in magical forests, like wood elfs have. Beasts should have been main enemy for wood elfs from start, like vamprs to empire, greens to dwarfs and so on. Maybe there should be more magical forests. For example 1 more in Bretonnia and a few in the Empire, belonging from start to beastmen. Wood elfs and beastmen should be enemies from start and on the spot, fighting for those and chasing each other in the world. Roads to magical forests should be made long and hard for those factions with no special movemnets, like welfs and beastmen have. Roads to Nagashizzar and Skavenblight are like that.

WoC rework in Warh 2 was good, and I hoped they would do at least exactly the same for beasts. Perhaps now WoC is even better, but still they made mistake with WoC and Norsca.

Norsca was not done as dlc for WoC dlc, because people here raged due to previous dlc being poorly done, with units obviously left for another dlc. If I remember correctly it was because the first beastmen dlc. So CA said ""fine, not dlc for dlc"". It is one of CA's mistakes in history of this game. For example another is Sigvald for start in WoC, with Archaon in Kholek. Wulfrik would have been much better choice, instead of the Slaanesh dedicated lord. It would have been the best if chaos was left for the third game, but how to make it better now?

Merge Norsca with WoC. The new WoC should have fortresses in Chaos wasteland areas, Norsca and important places in which have now, for example capitals of conquered factions. In other settlements they should have what I wrote about beastmen. Small outposts with garrison ro repel small armies, giving gold and replenishment and chaos corruption, also dedicated to a god for a buff.

When it comes to law problems CA could give WoC dlc to every owner of Norsca and vice versa. They already gave few dlcs via amazon. This would be even good promotion.

Then Sigvald could be moved to Slaanesh and Wulfrik and Throgg to undivided.

The same mechanic could be implemented to Nakai. Either beastmen version with no main settlements, like magical forests for beastmen, just small outposts everywhere and horde, or beastmen version with main settlements in magical forests and outposts elsewhere, so like WoC version.

,Vermintide,"So I was like just talking to myself about possibilities for a vermintide 3 and then after seeing a post about a oger character and cereer  ideas and that got me thinking but i would love more characters for vermintide weather its a whole new cast or the same cast i would love new characters because while i don't believe we are done with the 5 or 4 a lot of them are neir the end of their stories with their fourth cereers being who they are ment to be for the most part so i would imagine that if we did get a vermintide 3 most of the characters will start in there 4th cereers so getting brand new characters to either join or a whole new cast i think it would be interesting and for sure we should have less nurgel too tbh

Some character ideas (i am prioritizing fun and interesting over lore to he a hundred percent fair but also during the end times certain groups are more likely to work together so for at least one of these characters i don't want components).

To start of we will need a new average human i know kruber isn't normal persay but we need our straight man (with straight being relative for warhammer).
My starting idea is to not have someone from the empire i say depending on the exact area of the wh fantasy world we are fighting in should be either from kislev or my preference a cathayan. This is mostly to offer different perspective in the warhammer world someone who has seen and traveled to different parts of the warhammer world while also offering new looks and new weapons that aren't your standard fantasy and warhammer weapons

Second characters idea a elf mage in particular (i know going from one side of the world to another) i don't have as much reasoning but i would just love to see more magic and you can have this character use many different types of magic and while this would definitely be more neich but having different staffs that use different magics would be awesome some fire over here, some heavens, some life we have a lot more to work with atleast with a elf mage 

Third my thirs choice is the most out there and i know it is but since this game will probably take place a even closer to the end times i believe its possible to get a vampire character will it happen probably not but would it offer new and very cool ways of fighting yes this is the one i thought of and worked on the most because yes i love the vampre counts they are amazing and i think it would be fun i will also talk more about this later in another post probably 

Fourth would probably be an oger be i think big oger mercenary would be fun maybe him and the cathayan character have a past where he hires him for protection and find themselves fighting a lot of rats hey at least it keeps him well fed

Fifth i don't actually have much to talk about when it comes to a fifth character i think most likely another human or dwarf which im fine with as long as they are different from what we have and there are plenty of stuff they can still do with both humans and dwarfs not as much with dwarves but still probably something fun

Lastly before i end this post please don't judge me too hard this is all in good fun and just something i think would be fun also in terms of enemies for the next game more beastman and deamons would be fun maybe add in the beast of nurgel from dark tide and another wild idea a dragon oger as a monster to come and fight i could do another post on more enemies to fight later as well anyways hope you enjoy this post",t2_7otvt0jn,False,,0,False,What could happen in a vermintide 3?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Discussion'}]",r/Vermintide,False,6.0,discussion,0.0,,,True,t3_1ckc85a,False,dark,1.0,,public,1.0,0.0,{},,45a9e83a-68fd-11e5-9f6a-0e355ac73a6f,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion,False,1,,False,False,self,False,steam,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '💀🖤necromamcer🖤💀'}]",{},,True,,1714861491.0,richtext,6.0,,,richtext,self.Vermintide,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I was like just talking to myself about possibilities for a vermintide 3 and then after seeing a post about a oger character and cereer  ideas and that got me thinking but i would love more characters for vermintide weather its a whole new cast or the same cast i would love new characters because while i don&amp;#39;t believe we are done with the 5 or 4 a lot of them are neir the end of their stories with their fourth cereers being who they are ment to be for the most part so i would imagine that if we did get a vermintide 3 most of the characters will start in there 4th cereers so getting brand new characters to either join or a whole new cast i think it would be interesting and for sure we should have less nurgel too tbh&lt;/p&gt;

I left my band recently and now I'm a bit at a loss at where to find new people for a new band / or an existing one.

Ther are certain songs that make me think a great RP  could be made  using either all, or certain lines from them as inspiration.  I have highlighted the lines that get that shudder from me when I hear them .   
  
Unfortunately I have some half ideas, but have never quite had that breakthrough moment.   
  
So if you read the lyrics below and you get an idea I loved to hear it.   
  
  
Sweet but a Pyxcho is fairly obvious but my perfect women are in no paticularlar order.  ( I have a type and it would probably get me killed.)  
  
Harley Quinn  
  
Villanelle from Killling Eve  
  
Lila West from Dexter  
  
Katherine Pierce/ Katerina Petrova from the Vampre Diaries

Any other hot female vampire.

  
What would they be if they finally found that dark love they deserve?   
  
My Kink list is below but I generally like fall down the rabbit hole of depravity  and keep going until we hit bottom.

Anyway, forgive my ramblings and on to the songs.  
  
Charlotte Sometimes  
  
  
All the faces, all the voices blur  
Change to one face, change to one voice  
Prepare yourself for bed  
The light seems bright and glares on white walls  
All the sounds of Charlotte Sometimes  
Into the night with Charlotte Sometimes  
  
Night after night, she lay alone in bed  
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)  
Her eyes so open to the dark, the streets all looked so strange  
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)  
They seemed so far away, but Charlotte did not cry  
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)  
  
The people seemed so close to playing expressionless games  
The people seemed so close, so many other names  
  
Sometimes I'm dreaming, where all the other people dance  
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)  
Sometimes I'm dreaming, Charlotte Sometimes  
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)  
Sometimes I'm dreaming  
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)  
Expressionless the trance, sometimes I'm dreaming  
  
So many different names  
Sometimes I'm dreaming, the sounds all stay the same  
Sometimes I'm dreaming  
She hopes to open shadowed eyes on a different world  
Come to me scared princess, Charlotte sometimes  
  
On that bleak track, see the sun has gone again  
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)  
The tears were pouring down her face  
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)  
She was crying and crying for a girl  
Who died so many years before  
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)  
  
Sometimes I dream where all the other people dance  
Sometimes I dream  
Charlotte sometimes  
Sometimes I dream, the sounds all stay the same  
Sometimes I'm dreaming  
There are so many different names  
Sometimes I dream, sometimes I dream  
  
Charlotte Sometimes, crying for herself (Charlotte Sometimes)  
(Charlotte Sometimes)  
Charlotte Sometimes dreams a wall around herself  
(Charlotte Sometimes, Charlotte Sometimes)  
But it's always with love, with so much love (Charlotte Sometimes)  
It looks like everything else (Charlotte Sometimes)  
Of Charlotte Sometimes, so far away (Charlotte Sometimes)  
Glass sealed and pretty, Charlotte Sometimes

Echo Beach  
  
  
I know it's out of fashion, and a trifle uncool  
But I can't help it, I'm a romantic fool  
It's a habit of mine, to watch the sun go down  
On Echo Beach, I watch the sun go down  
From nine to five, I have to spend my time at work  
My job is very boring, I'm an office clerk  
The only thing that helps me pass the time away  
Is knowing I'll be back at Echo Beach someday  
On a silent summer evening, the sky's alive with lights  
A building in the distance, surrealistic sight  
On Echo Beach, waves make the only sound  
On Echo Beach, there's not a soul around  
From nine to five, I have to spend my time at work  
My job is very boring, I'm an office clerk  
The only thing that helps me pass the time away  
Is knowing I'll be back at Echo Beach someday  
Echo Beach, far away in time

At night, she's screamin'  
""I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind""  
""Grab a cop gun"" kinda crazy  
She's poison but tasty  
Yeah, people say, ""Run, don't walk away""  
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho  
A little bit psycho  
At night, she's screamin'  
""I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind""  
You're just like me, you're out your mind  
I know it's strange, we're both the crazy kind  
You're tellin' me that I'm insane  
Boy, don't pretend that you don't love the pain  
  
  
  
Only Love Can Hurt Like This.   
  
I tell myself you don't mean a thing  
And what we got, got no hold on me  
But when you're not there, I just crumble  
I tell myself I don't care that much  
But I feel like I die 'til I feel your touch  
Only love, only love can hurt like this  
Only love can hurt like this  
Must've been a deadly kiss  
Only love can hurt like this  
Say I wouldn't care if you walked away  
But every time you're there, I'm beggin' you to stay  
And when you come close (when you come close), I just tremble  
And every time, every time you go  
It's like a knife that cuts right to my soul  
Only love, only love can hurt like this  
Only love can hurt like this  
Must've been a deadly kiss  
Only love can hurt like this  
Only love can hurt like this  
Your kisses burn into my skin  
Only love can hurt like this  
But it's the sweetest pain  
Burnin' hot through my veins  
Love is torture, makes me more sure  
Only love can hurt like this  
Only love can hurt like this  
Only love can hurt like this  
Must've been a deadly kiss  
Only love can hurt like this  
Only love can hurt like this  
Your kisses burn into my skin  
Only love can hurt like this  
(Only love can hurt like this)  
Only love can hurt like this  
(Only love can hurt) save me, save me  
Only love, only love  
'Cause only love can hurt like this  
And it must've been a deadly kiss  
  
  
Wasteland  
  
I still believe in God and God no longer believes in me  
There's a crystal view from my window  
And I can see the years to come  
I live for the burn and the sting of pleasure  
I live for the sword, the steel, and the gun  
I can tear down the walls, storm the barricades  
Run to the place where the frightened crawl  
Desire lurks beyond good and evil  
So I dance on the graves where the hallowed fall  
Over this land  
All over this wasteland  
Over this land  
All over this wasteland  
You can touch, but please keep your distance  
You're innocent and pure and with no shame  
The spirit is willing, and the flesh is craved  
You tease and you taunt with the pleasure of pain  
Over this land  
All over this wasteland  
Over this land  
All over this wasteland  
Heaven and Hell, I know them well  
But I haven't yet made my choice  
I'm feeling scared 'cause I'm shouting loud  
And no one can hear my voice  
I'm walking the tightwire, can't look down  
Strung out high, above you all  
Fateful wind blows through this land  
Howls my name, heralds my fall  
Over this land  
All over this wasteland  
Over this land  
All over this wasteland  
Over this land  
All over this wasteland  
Over this land  
All over this wasteland

&lt;p&gt;Ther are certain songs that make me think a great RP  could be made  using either all, or certain lines from them as inspiration.  I have highlighted the lines that get that shudder from me when I hear them . &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I have some half ideas, but have never quite had that breakthrough moment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you read the lyrics below and you get an idea I loved to hear it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sweet but a Pyxcho is fairly obvious but my perfect women are in no paticularlar order.  ( I have a type and it would probably get me killed.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harley Quinn&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Villanelle from Killling Eve&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lila West from Dexter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Katherine Pierce/ Katerina Petrova from the Vampre Diaries&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any other hot female vampire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would they be if they finally found that dark love they deserve? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Kink list is below but I generally like fall down the rabbit hole of depravity  and keep going until we hit bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/vt9SEQl""&gt;https://imgur.com/vt9SEQl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, forgive my ramblings and on to the songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charlotte Sometimes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the faces, all the voices blur&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change to one face, change to one voice&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prepare yourself for bed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The light seems bright and glares on white walls&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the sounds of Charlotte Sometimes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Into the night with Charlotte Sometimes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Night after night, she lay alone in bed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Something&amp;#39;s strange with Charlotte Sometimes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her eyes so open to the dark, the streets all looked so strange&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Something&amp;#39;s strange with Charlotte Sometimes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They seemed so far away, but Charlotte did not cry&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Something&amp;#39;s strange with Charlotte Sometimes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people seemed so close to playing expressionless games&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people seemed so close, so many other names&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I&amp;#39;m dreaming, where all the other people dance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Something&amp;#39;s strange with Charlotte Sometimes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I&amp;#39;m dreaming, Charlotte Sometimes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Something&amp;#39;s strange with Charlotte Sometimes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I&amp;#39;m dreaming&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Something&amp;#39;s strange with Charlotte Sometimes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expressionless the trance, sometimes I&amp;#39;m dreaming&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many different names&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I&amp;#39;m dreaming, the sounds all stay the same&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I&amp;#39;m dreaming&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She hopes to open shadowed eyes on a different world&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come to me scared princess, Charlotte sometimes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On that bleak track, see the sun has gone again&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Something&amp;#39;s strange with Charlotte Sometimes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tears were pouring down her face&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Something&amp;#39;s strange with Charlotte Sometimes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was crying and crying for a girl&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who died so many years before&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Something&amp;#39;s strange with Charlotte Sometimes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I dream where all the other people dance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I dream&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charlotte sometimes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I dream, the sounds all stay the same&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I&amp;#39;m dreaming&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many different names&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I dream, sometimes I dream&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charlotte Sometimes, crying for herself (Charlotte Sometimes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Charlotte Sometimes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charlotte Sometimes dreams a wall around herself&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Charlotte Sometimes, Charlotte Sometimes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s always with love, with so much love (Charlotte Sometimes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like everything else (Charlotte Sometimes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of Charlotte Sometimes, so far away (Charlotte Sometimes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glass sealed and pretty, Charlotte Sometimes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Charlotte Sometimes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Echo Beach&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;#39;s out of fashion, and a trifle uncool&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I can&amp;#39;t help it, I&amp;#39;m a romantic fool&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a habit of mine, to watch the sun go down&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Echo Beach, I watch the sun go down&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From nine to five, I have to spend my time at work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My job is very boring, I&amp;#39;m an office clerk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing that helps me pass the time away&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is knowing I&amp;#39;ll be back at Echo Beach someday&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a silent summer evening, the sky&amp;#39;s alive with lights&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A building in the distance, surrealistic sight&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Echo Beach, waves make the only sound&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Echo Beach, there&amp;#39;s not a soul around&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From nine to five, I have to spend my time at work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My job is very boring, I&amp;#39;m an office clerk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing that helps me pass the time away&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is knowing I&amp;#39;ll be back at Echo Beach someday&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Echo Beach, far away in time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sweet But A Psycho&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, she&amp;#39;s sweet but a psycho&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little bit psycho&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At night, she&amp;#39;s screamin&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;ll rip your shirt within a second&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll be coming back, back for seconds&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With your plate, you just can&amp;#39;t help it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, no, you&amp;#39;ll play along&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let her lead you on&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll be saying, &amp;quot;No, no&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s poison but tasty&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m-ma-ma-ma out my mind&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, someone said, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t drink her potions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;ll kiss your neck with no emotion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she&amp;#39;s mean, you know you love it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Cause she tastes so sweet, don&amp;#39;t sugarcoat it&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

I’m honestly getting sick of being underestimated and reject from people when I know I am more qualified than whoever they end up hiring. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do I need to do to make people think I have all the experience I need to get better gigs.&lt;/p&gt;

**Attributes:**

* **Physical:** Strength 2, Dexterity 2, Stamina 2
* **Social:** Charisma 4, Manipulation 3, Appearance 2
* **Mental:** Perception 3, Intelligence 3, Wits 4

* **Herd 2:** People are drawn to the Count's charismatic presence, providing him with a group of loyal followers.

**Merits:**

**Humanity/Path:** Humanity 6 - The Count still holds onto aspects of his humanity, especially in his interactions with others.

**Background Story:** Once a noble mathematician in a distant land, Count von Sesam was embraced into the Ventrue clan for his leadership qualities and strategic mind. Now, he uses his vampiric powers and charm to navigate the complex world of Kindred politics. Despite his undead state, the Count maintains a fascination with numbers, counting everything from the stars in the sky to the drops of blood in his nightly meals.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resources 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Count von Sesam maintains a lavish lifestyle with access to wealth accumulated over the years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Herd 2:&lt;/strong&gt; People are drawn to the Count&amp;#39;s charismatic presence, providing him with a group of loyal followers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Merits:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multilingual (2):&lt;/strong&gt; Fluent in various languages to indulge in his love for counting in different cultures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Natural Leader (1):&lt;/strong&gt; The Count&amp;#39;s regal presence makes him a natural leader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flaws:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obsession (Counting) (2):&lt;/strong&gt; The Count is compelled to count things, and this obsession may distract him in crucial situations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soft-hearted (1):&lt;/strong&gt; Despite his vampiric nature, Count von Sesam has a soft spot for the innocent and can be merciful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humanity/Path:&lt;/strong&gt; Humanity 6 - The Count still holds onto aspects of his humanity, especially in his interactions with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background Story:&lt;/strong&gt; Once a noble mathematician in a distant land, Count von Sesam was embraced into the Ventrue clan for his leadership qualities and strategic mind. Now, he uses his vampiric powers and charm to navigate the complex world of Kindred politics. Despite his undead state, the Count maintains a fascination with numbers, counting everything from the stars in the sky to the drops of blood in his nightly meals. He takes pleasure in the elegance of mathematics and seeks to use his skills in both mortal and immortal endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

And legitimately I've exhausted all other options. I've attempted going through apps like BandMix and Vampr and I've contacted drummers through email, text messages and even through Instagram which actually Instagram has worked for the other members.

WORLD SINCE LEGACIES: So before the events of my fanfic a bunch of stuff take place. With malivore gone and the gods defeated millions of supernatural forces and beings reappeared into the world specifically demons. Different and diverse Demons long trapped tried to make contact with the human world using humans.A mass event took place shortly after the end of legacies. This event was too huge to contain and videos and photos as well as live news coverage spotted Hope and some members of the super squad fighting a catastrophic demon.Due to social media The supernatural world is exposed. The world went into chaos. Humans with no magic terrified of the supernatural sought it out. Performing rituals and making contracts with demons. They were dangerous and either led to death, insanity or power to people that had the wrong intentions. These humans came to be known as occultists. And they caused as much or worse  damage then the demons they brought forth. This caused outrage in the human and supernatural world. marcel, hope, Bonnie, Alaric along with other big players in the supernatural world participated in a summit to learn to cohabitate with humans and protect a semblance of peace. Demons became a threat to them all and to fight this common enemy things had to be set aside. This summit while chaotic led to the Salvatore school opening locations worldwide to teach supernatural newbies restraint and control. Bonnie using Jeremy’s blood crafted a new hunters spell. Granting select humans with heightened strength, hearing and speed. A safeguard was put in place with the tattoo. Their missions had to be approved and a monthly session with a witch had to be attended. These appointed witched would seer into their memories and vérifié that each killing would be on mission. No meeting and the tattoo along with the spell would fade immediately. Only teens and young adults were selected as they were more open minded. They were put into a hunter division at the Salvatore school along with the supernatural to be trained (training division and instructors  was crafted and selected by Jeremy Gilbert. His last bloodline is the only one that has the original hunters magic) they were also put in the Salvatore school to understand the supernatural’s humanity. Each unit (school) were granted 10 Eldich blades. wooden swords consecrated in Bonnie’s secret elixir which negated magic. This caused some struggle with the vamps. Marcel and Rebekah became leaders of western vampires and set off with a large vampire population to the north where the numbers of hunters was not as intense. Creating a new vampire city. Updated Moonlight rings were given to the wolves to contain the turning. Rare humans learned to use magical objects to help witches and Protect themselves without magic. They became known as alchemists. A council was formed. Bonnie representing witches, Ansel the werewolves, marcel the vamps and hope in the center for the new supernaturals. Matt Donovan stepped up to mediate between humans and Supes. This period was followed by a time of fragile peace. Stephanie and her brother alex enrolled and graduated in the hunter division along with their (3 at the time) Gilbert cousins Felix, Augustus and Cassius. Matt had 3 kids victor, Tyler and Diana. Bonnie (who at the time believed to have lost her first child with Jeremy) married a powerful west African witch Jabari and had 2 children Fikile and Lorenzo. Freya had 2 sons nik(wolf) and Henry(witch). Then people noticed something strange. Davina and kol had a child, Joshua(human witch). The outer rings heard the rumours of kol now being not a vamp  but a human alchemist. A new and influential hunter Will enters the inner circle by dating Stephanie and discovered the truth. The anti magic elixir and the cure were one and the same, it was stephanie and Alex’s blood. This caused a shift. The hunters now led by will gained more influence as reports of more anti magic weapons being made and used illegally and Supes being persecuted. Hope now being seen as the de facto leader of the Supes created the mikaelson strongholds. A refuge for her fam and all Supes. She fell in love with another phoenix and gave birth to twins alister and adeline (fireformed wolves/witches) 3 years later she had Elijah (tribrid). During this time tension rose between the hunters and the Supes, Stephanie who was now barely seen was believed to have sided with will. Rebekah, unaware of the hunters turmoil finally felt comfortable and safe enough to take the cure and get pregnant. During this hope was also pregnant. The night she was giving birth hunters set off a bomb at her home seemingly killing the child. In a rage hope goes to the hunters hq destroyed it and killed Stephanie. She walked out to cameras live recording the event and “went crazy”. After the carnage she planned for a coronation of herself as queen of the supernatural. There she was assassinated. The public deemed her and the entire mikaelson  family as terrorists to be hunted. Hopes children were separated the twins were meant to go to Paris to kol, davina and their sons josh and Cyrus but they had to go into hiding. Elijah was meant to go to marcel and Rebekah but the hunters were in to them. Marcel stayed to fight with his people and Rebekah escaped carrying  precious cargo their newborn daughter Camille(first fully awakened vampre baby).

TEN YEARS LATER:the supernatural world has changed. All Supes must now register to be treated as lowly members of society and they are separated from most daily activities. Vamps are hunted more then ever. Elijah a foster child is found by a strange set of twins claiming to be  his siblings and that their mother is the famous terrorist . They found him and ask him to chase a lead, rumours of a 10 year old phoenix child. They go on a journey to place the pieces of the past, clear their name and reunite their family always and forever. What really ended the era of peace, who is responsible for what happened at the coronation and is hope still alive?

Now this is a very abridged version. I left out a lot of details like family info/tree, the ages and the timeline. I just wanted to ask if the basics of the story Makes sense or at the very least seems interesting.😅

P.S: the big time difference is to try and incorporate flashbacks and reveal secrets ne lies in the publicized versions of these events. For example maybe reading snippets of hopes diary At the time revealing the true motive behind her actions.",t2_73t6c4y8,False,,0,False,Legacies next generation fan fic,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'FanFic '}, {'a': ':fanfics:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/ayb6rueumim51_t5_j4gi1/fanfics'}]",r/LegaciesCW,False,6.0,,0.0,,,True,t3_164mnjr,False,dark,1.0,transparent,public,1.0,0.0,{},,b7f93cd8-b471-11e9-b30f-0e11aec34112,False,[],,False,False,,{},FanFic :fanfics:,False,1,,False,False,self,False,,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Phoenix '}, {'a': ':phoenix:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/6797z2iawud31_t5_j4gi1/phoenix'}]",{},,True,,1693325471.0,richtext,6.0,,,richtext,self.LegaciesCW,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m gonna preface this by saying that I know that legacies is already a “next generation” type show but due to my meh feeling about the ending ( I still enjoyed the show or else I wouldn’t bother at all lol) and just having the time I hyper fixated into a next gen for the tvdu.

Vamps are hunted more then ever. Elijah a foster child is found by a strange set of twins claiming to be  his siblings and that their mother is the famous terrorist . They found him and ask him to chase a lead, rumours of a 10 year old phoenix child. They go on a journey to place the pieces of the past, clear their name and reunite their family always and forever. What really ended the era of peace, who is responsible for what happened at the coronation and is hope still alive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this is a very abridged version. I left out a lot of details like family info/tree, the ages and the timeline. I just wanted to ask if the basics of the story Makes sense or at the very least seems interesting.😅&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S: the big time difference is to try and incorporate flashbacks and reveal secrets ne lies in the publicized versions of these events. For example maybe reading snippets of hopes diary At the time revealing the true motive behind her actions.&lt;/p&gt;

,WeAreTheMusicMakers,"Hello all

I have been playing guitar as a bedroom warrior for about 15 years now. I always loved jamming with others when I got the chance, and I always enjoyed writing songs but never really performed or joined a band. 

I'm at a point now where I really would like to play with others. I'm in a covers band with some colleagues (though our singer is inconsistent with turning up to rehearsal). We're yet to play a gig.

Covers are fun, but I'd like a more creative project as well where I can get together with some people, write and perform. The only issue is, I really don't want this to be a full time career. I love my day job, and frankly I don't want to be poor forever. 

A lot of the time when I reach out to people on Vampr etc, people have the aim of making music their livelihood. My question is, are my goals realistic? Is the commitment to writing/rehersing/gigging etc so much that you basically have to do it full time to do it at all? In my ideal project, we'd write and rehearse once a week, maybe play a gig a month, and if we generate a small local/ online following that would be all I'd really want.

Would appreciate any advice

,metalmusicians,"I'm 20(f) I play guitar and sing, and songwrite. Not the best but not the worst. Im definitely improving and passionate about the craft.

How do I meet people in my area and start a band. I've tried vampr, shows, fb, craigslist, asking my sorta friends if theyre interested. I dont have any metalhead friends besides my bf whos in his own band. But thats a whole different story lol. 

I haven't had much luck, it seems like the only other people who are interested are creepy old dudes in their 40s and 50s. I once met up with what I thought was a less creepy dude in his 30s, and long story short he just wanted to fuck and not write music. Which is both annoying and frustrating!

Any advice or tips?

,mixingmastering,"Hello, let me add some pretext here

Had someone hit me up on Vampr offering mastering service. Dude from another country that says he is an experienced engineer. Offered service at bottom dollar price so I had to try it out. 

I send him my song and his turn around time was about 40 mins. This really surprised me because I was thinking it would take longer.

The track does sound pretty good and a little better than the master I made myself in ozone (I don’t know exactly what I’m doing in ozone but have learned a little)

Did this dude just take my track and have some AI service master it? Any way I could tell? Or does that sound about right? 40 mins?

You come to the castle, and the first thing you see is people chained to the table, being eaten alive. You go downstairs, there are cattle farms, with people still kinda aware of the surroundings, but being worse than dead.

Those creatures will probably kill you. They definitely will eat you. They can and probably will raise your corpse as to slave in their mines or do manual labour, and your soul is very unlikely to go in a good place. Most likely it will end up trapped in a soul gem, sent to souls cairn or sacrificed to demon lord of slavery and violation.

And even during the most wholesome scenes with lovable nerdy Serana as a vampire we are still the primary worshiper of the said demon lord, with human farms below, just in a fancier chair.

,musicians,"**I have received a message on Vampr from someone representing Empire Music. They said they love my work and that I can send demos to the following email address:**  [**Empire.co.music@gmail.com**](mailto:Empire.co.music@gmail.com)  


**After sending 2 demos to this address I got this reply:**  


Thank  you for your application. We have reviewed your works, and proud to  offer you a 1-year trial contract subject to the following terms and  conditions. 

TERM OF CONTRACT 

By signing this contract you agree that: 

1. All creative works sent to Empire Music are all ORIGINAL works of yours and not dubbed from other existing works.

2.  You are willing to travel on all-expense paid trips to any part of the  United States, United Kingdom as well as other countries when required  during the duration of your contract.

3. That in the period of this contract you CAN NOT work with other music recording and promotion companies.

4.  That your contents become intellectual properties of Empire Music and  can’t be published independently by you or anyone else without  permission from Empire Music.

5.  That you can not sell your works either in art forms or in ideas to  other companies or individuals during the contract duration.

6.  You acknowledge that Royalties from your work are 30% for you and 70%  for Empire music and are only subject to renegotiation after the 1-year  trial contract duration.

7.  You acknowledge that you are 18 years or above, and have a full  understanding of the term of the contract and agree to all legal  implications if or when breached. 

8.  Upon physically signing our contract you will be paid $70,000 by Empire  Music and you acknowledge that this fund would be used efficiently for  self-development and ensure even more productivity.

9.  Royalties as well as other monetary transactions would be done in their  exact equivalent value in BTC(Bitcoin). This payment policy is the  company’s early attempt to be adaptive to the fast-evolving world of  digital currencies.

Also, you would be required to either write or help finished up song ideas of some artists in Empire Music. 

We need you to be available in San Francisco before October 12, 2022. As we will be set to start working with you by then. 

As  a usual company policy, we will book you a flight and also get you  hotel reservations for the first month. Empire Music will support you  with 50% of the total cost of logistics. 

This  would be for the first week and after record deals have been officially  signed, then we take full responsibility for your artistic journey in  Empire music. 

The 50% equivalence from the total expense on travel you will transfer as BTC to the company’s wallet. 

You  will be required to remain in San Francisco for at least one month and  also submit at least 5 originally written songs after the record deal  has been physically signed. Also, your creative contents upon agreement  to these terms from hence should not be publicly posted as they become  the intellectual property of Empire Music. A breach of this policy would  further lead to the termination of the contract with Empire music. 

Indicate  if you agree to these terms and we will get back to you. Also, indicate  where you are travelling from and the closest airport to you.

Congratulations once again and we hope to have a productive work year with you should you agree to be part of Empire music.

,Pathfinder2e,"Hi, GM fairly new to pf2e here. So far we've played about 13 sessions, and the 3 times I've used monsters 2 levels higher than the party, we've had to retcon or otherwise work around a TPK. There are 5 PCs.

The first time was at level 2 against a Shadow (level 4) which did huge damage and was very hard to hit. I had it run away after downing 1-2 PCs to avoid killing them all. 

Second time was level 3 against a Bearded Devil (level 5). It wiped the floor with all 5 of them. We even retried the fight with the Weak template.

Third time was last night when the level 4 party fought a Vampre Spawn Rogue (level 4) and Vampire Count (level 6). They have access to magical silvered weapons, but not yet striking runes. This time it felt more like they stood a chance, though, and could just be attributed to bad rolls.

I've heard the Bearded Devil is stronger than most level 5 monsters, but the Shadow was just as bad. The rulebooks give the impression that Level+2 monsters are supposed to be difficult in the mini-boss sense, rather than campaign ending threats. Is this a common experience in the community, do these particular monsters just punch above their weight, or do you thnk there is something else at play?",t2_ecea0,,,0,,Are Party Level +2 monsters supposed to cause TPKs?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Discussion'}]",r/Pathfinder2e,False,6.0,,,,,False,t3_wuzqdt,False,light,0.85,#6d0e0c,public,,0.0,{},,6e1280da-c1db-11e9-9d05-0e04d90209b6,False,,,False,False,,{},Discussion,False,33,,False,False,self,False,,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Game Master'}]",{},,True,,,richtext,6.0,,,richtext,self.Pathfinder2e,False,,,,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,e8041f82-5b23-11ec-9db6-8a2d7df5a9e5,True,False,False,Game Master,[],,,,,t5_gkc60,,,,#1e2a3e,wuzqdt,True,,shet98,,64,True,all_ads,False,,False,light,/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/wuzqdt/are_party_level_2_monsters_supposed_to_cause_tpks/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/wuzqdt/are_party_level_2_monsters_supposed_to_cause_tpks/,49017.0,1661189355.0,0.0,,False,,,,,,,,,,,1386972413.0,1662801913.0,vampr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,CurseofStrahd,"I have 6 players currently level 6. We've just run the feast of st andral and vallaki is burning and full of vampire spawn. The i had them fight 3 v spawn which the party wiped out with no major consequences.

The good thing is that when strahd appeared i had him arrive with 12 wolves and the party were so scared they just ran. Im glad theyre still scared of him but once they have the symbol of ravenkind and the sunsword it will be even more of a breeze.

How can i make the final battle with strahd feel more  monumentous and climactic?

,Music,"Story time: I (M), a bass player, and a friend (M) who's a drummer, decided to start our first band. Our genre is rather loose, but it's mostly ""proggish"" metal/rock with whatever influences come for any other genre.

For the lineup, we wanted bass, drums, two guitars, and keyboard. And of course, vocals. We decided to do something like Mastodon does, where the band has 3 vocalists, all of which do rounds in doing both lead and backing vocals, alongside playing their instruments. Friend and I would both sing, and we thought it would be nice and original to add a female voice to the mix as well.

Because we wanted to avoid going over 5 members in our band (each playing their own instrument), we thought about trying to find a female instrumentalist who would also sing, whether a guitar or keyboard player. She wouldn't even necessarily have to know how to scream, growl, or any other type of harsh vocals.

We posted ads around the internet and tried to find people in apps like Vampr, but it seems like finding a female instrumentalist, let alone one who also sings, is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. Basically, from my experience, it seems like 99% of female musicians are solely vocalists, occasionally playing piano or acoustic guitar as well. Moreover, they usually stick to soft genres, and in terms of rock they mostly play stuff like pop-rock or indie. I swear I haven't found a single female musician wanting to play harsher genres.

In the end, we caved in and simply recruited two male guitar players. We still have to find a keyboard player, which in itself is rather difficult, but we're not counting on finding a female player.

I knew beforehand they were rare, but that female musicians in harsher genres exist nonetheless. Still, I have so many questions. Where are they? How do you find one? Why do female musicians seem to stick to vocals? And why do they seem to run away from harsher genres?",t2_incaz,,,0,,"Where are all the female instrumentalists, specially in harsher genres, and why do women stick to vocals?","[{'e': 'text', 't': 'discussion'}]",r/Music,False,6.0,discussion,,,,False,t3_uyiwe3,False,dark,0.7,,public,,0.0,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},discussion,False,4,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,,richtext,6.0,,,text,self.Music,False,,,,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,b339bb90-f5e0-11e4-9601-0ebfc876d6c1,True,False,False,,[],,,,,t5_2qh1u,,,,,uyiwe3,True,,harowkun,,6,True,all_ads,False,,False,,/r/Music/comments/uyiwe3/where_are_all_the_female_instrumentalists/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/uyiwe3/where_are_all_the_female_instrumentalists/,29750165.0,1653603017.0,0.0,,False,,,,,,,1653920117.0,,,,1412122418.0,1653920117.0,vampr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,relationship_advice,I really can’t tell if I’m over reacting and overthinking but I really could use any direction right now. My (25M) wife (26F) have been married for about a year and a half and together for almost 7. My wife writes music and is amazing at it while I have absolutely 0 ability. My wife joined this app Vampr to meet other musicians which I was all for. That was until she met Devon. Devon complimented my wife immediately and was very flirty towards her. My wife made it clear she has a husband but has continued working and making music with him. Last night she talked for like 15-20 straight minutes of how much she liked him and everything. This was after I made 4 drives of over 90 minutes taking her to her sister and back so she could spend a day with our nephew (she doesn’t drive highways). I got like a “oh I almost forgot thank you” for that.

,mechmarket,"Hello friends. Welcome to dalifu.caps' raffle sale.

This is the tenth and last official colorway of Frank before I retire the sculpt. It's been a great pleasure and honor fiddling with this amazing sculpt by AWC. 

This last colorway will be slightly more pricey than previous colorways due to how complex the casting is (I've been messing up for 3 months and have about 30-40 odd trash caps).

A mishmash of fantasies - Frankenstein &amp; Count von Count (vampre Muppet from Sesame Street) -

Presenting:

**34,969, Frank (DLF x AWC)**

'They call me the Count because I love to count things.’

[Album](https://imgur.com/a/69Lgemg)

34,969 Franks are fully resin-casted and not hand-painted. Tinkered on the original that was sculpted obsessively by [AWC](https://www.instagram.com/kitctrlaltdelyou/) \- [https://imgur.com/a/YTqpVoq](https://imgur.com/a/YTqpVoq)

Casted lovingly by [DLF](https://www.instagram.com/dalifu.caps/)

vampre: ""oh no, dead.. no i don't think your lying i just umm..""

vampre: ""well, i have to tell you the truth and be brutally honest, i think your hunter friends left you for dead. cause i even heard them laughing earlier when they sent you here that they thought you were so useless and weak they would use you as a distraction to catch a vampire.""

vampre: ""i'm- i'm sorry for making you so sad. i just had to be honest with you, but hey, i can make you a deal that'll help you get back at those supposed.. friends of yours that left you for dead.""

vampre: ""wow, you're eager, you must really want to get them back i suppose. but i'm thinking you won't be so eager once i tell you what my idea was, i can turn you into a vampire so you'll have the abilities i do to take down those betrayers.""

vampre: ""you're really not scared dear? do you even know how we turn people to vampires? we suck their blood until they're almost dead but then we have them drink some of our blood and let them sleep, then when they wake up the transformation starts.""

vampre: ""there you go... *sigh* you don't have to make the deal you know? you also, don't have to cry over this.. it's your choice completely.""

,Superstonk,"…for a company that’s not Gamestop though…
I believe this is the first instance of a company tying shares to NFTs, and they’ve beaten GameStop to the punch. A few differences: Vampr isn’t publicly traded (yet?) and the NFTs are being given out to investors in a fundraising round. The company’s owner is a good friend of mine. I thought it’d be interesting to this community to see a real world example (the first ever) of a company in the wild linking NFTs to shares.

http://www.wefunder.com/vampr

,Roleplay,"Hello all, today I'd like to share with you my latest idea for a role play plot, in which will play as a proper vampire noble in a world where vampires and their traditions are dying out. To him, nothing is more important than the rich, traditional history of the vampres, so he comes up with a plan, a plan that involves turning a human undead and teaching them the way of the night, and he knows just the one. He has his sights set on the most capable human he knows, his former nemesis, your character, the vampire hunter. If all goes according to plan, he could start a new line of vampires. It will not be easy, teaching her and convincing her to follow the rules, but it would be well worth the investment... 

So that's the basic premise. My character is a cynical one, believing that everyone is either a vampire or an uncouth savage. He values form over function and honor over cunning. He is a strict rule follower and holds others to the same standard, this might be interesting when he pairs up with your character who doesn't know or want to follow the rules. One of my favorite parts of role playing is world building, and having someone who, in character, doesn't know everything about the world would be a great pretense for me explaining the world in without having to break the flow of the rp. The plot of the role play will revolve around my character trying to keep yours in line, teaching her, and strictly watching her. Now I don't want this character to be cruel, just strict, being mean isn't my MO. 

Anyway, if you're interested I role play on discod. Hope to hear from you soon!",t2_7mnkohuh,,,0,,[M4F] Edicate of the Night.

In addition in a post  published at the Buffy the Vampre Slayer subreddit over hal a year ago, people were mentioning once popular Buffy related forums back in the late 90s and early 2000s that have now ceased to exist.

I started posting on filmboards.com Audrey Hepburn subforum too.

So it makes me wonder what are some of the most active Audrey Hepburn communities aside from reddit and outside Facebook and Tumblr on the interwebz? As well as popular forums and message boards from years ago that now shut down?

,audioengineering,"I recently discovered this app called Vampr, it’s actually pretty cool and it seems like a good way to connect. However I think this is an old app that most of its users have abandoned, I rarely get messages back. I did get 1 client from this though and yestrday I got paid for the first time to mix and master, he said he was coming back too :) I also did some free work for this French artist and he said he’d be willing to pay for the next song I do for him. But I’m just looking for more ways to meet more artists willing to pay. 99% of the people that I talk to want free services because they’re teenage SoundCloud rappers. I’ve been thinking about making a website and adding some tracks from artists I’ve worked with, but I first need artists that I’m proud of. When people ask for samples of my work I’ll send them a couple Cambridge mixes I did that I’m very proud of, since I’m very small I assume this is okay but I doubt I’d be allowed to put these on a website. 

I don’t really write my own tracks, I do instrumental covers of my favorite songs but they are all unfinished because I’m waiting on some parts for my drum kit. I just don’t enjoy recording myself, and due to covid I don’t  have anyone come into my studio and record as my moms immune system isn’t very strong. So for now, mixing and mastering seems to be my only options of income. I also offer services to record piano tracks over someone’s song, but I’ve only had 1 person to take me up on that and of course they wanted it for free. I charge 50-mix, 30-master, 70- both. So what are some more ways I can connect with more artists? Should I just go through posts on social media offering my services in a short message? It’s just hard to find people willing to pay for something from a nobody engineer.  I don’t have a degree to back me up (yet), and I don’t have a studio I work under. It’s just me and my basement. My goal is to have a handful of artists that always come back when they record songs. So I at least have some consistency in my work. Right now it’s based on luck if I get someone willing to pay. I’ve had amazing feedback from every artist I’ve worked with so far, so I know people would be willing to come back to me. It’s just finding those people to take the chance with an engineer they don’t know that’s the problem",t2_4newse9h,,,0,,"For my bedroom engineers, how did y’all get your first set of paying clients?",[],,False,6.0,,,,,False,t3_mxnuu7,False,dark,0.91,,public,,0.0,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},,,26,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,,text,6.0,,,text,self.audioengineering,False,,,,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],,False,,True,False,False,,[],,,,,t5_2qkby,,,,,mxnuu7,True,,Jon_Seiler,,20,True,all_ads,False,,False,,/r/audioengineering/comments/mxnuu7/for_my_bedroom_engineers_how_did_yall_get_your/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/mxnuu7/for_my_bedroom_engineers_how_did_yall_get_your/,226791.0,1619283129.0,0.0,,False,,,,,,,1623478376.0,,,,1569249106.0,,vampr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'd like to welcome you for feedback, critique and ideas.

Since it is hard for musicians around the globe to find their tribe, connect and build a meaningful relationship - i asked myself why it's that way and how to solve this problem for me personally.  
I then came across many platforms, apps, threads, clubhouse rooms, discord channels and facebook groups. No solution was efficient when it comes to time consumption, fun and/or building a truly worthwhile relationship. (Vampr, Facebook Groups, SoundBetter, Soundcloud, Reddit, Discord, Splice)

That's what got me thinking that there should be an app addressing this problem. What do you guys think? Does online collaboration work out in first place?

I'd like to invite you to complete a quick n easy survey so i have some reliable data on this topic:

,fantasyfootball,"I'm looking for new ideas for leagues. I have a group of friends and we do a lot of leagues with different settings and we want to try new ones.

So far we have:

**All Super-Flex:** Your team consists of 10 Superflex spots, you get 10 bench. We also made it TE premium.

**Vampire League:** 10 teams, one vampire at random, vampire does not draft, just picks up waivers. vampire is the only one who can pickup payers from FA, vampire chooses opponent weekly, cant face someone twice in a row, cant face someone more than 2 times. If vampire wins a match he trades any player from his starting lineup with a player in the same position of the opponent's starting lineup.

**2 Vampire League:** 12 teams and 2 vampires, non vampires draft alone for first 7 rounds, vampires start drafting on round 8. Vampires can trade with eachother, vampres alternate order of opponen selection each week, vampires cant face eachother, if a vampire defeats a team that team gets inmunity the next week from both vampires. Vampires use FAAB for waivers. 

**Guillotine League:** Each week the team with the lowest score is eliminated an the players go back to FA.

**Random Team League:** You do a regular draft and then players get a second ""drating spot"" where they select any full team, so you basically draft for someone else.

**NFC Themed League:** 16 player league. Random order on the draft, then we assign a NFC team to each owner depending on conference position and drafting spot. 1st drafting spot gets the wors NFC team, 2nd drafting spot gets second worst and so on untill the 16th drafting spots that gets the conference champion. Each owner gets the team D, the kicker, and 8 players from his team and then we draft for AFC players. The rookies that your team gets on the NFL draft are automatically assigned to your team so the rookie draft is just for AFC players. If any player you own gets traded to a NFC team you have to give it to the owner of that team. EX. if you have the seahawks and they trade Russel Wilson to let's say, the Bears, you have to give Wilson to the owner of the Bears.

**AFC Themed League:** Same as the previous one but with AFC teams

**WWE Themed League:** The highest scoring team of week one gets a ""virtual belt"" the player who face him on week 2 has the chance to get the belt if he wins the match, if he is defeated the highest scoring team retains the belt. End of the season the owner who had the belt for more weeks gets 2nd place money. League winner takes 1st.

**Lots of Points:** Pretty self explanatory. 2 points per carry. 5 PPC, TE premium with +2, a lot of bonuses for # of catches on a game, or rush attempts, bonuses on high yard games, 1 point per pass for QBs and -0.5 for incompletion.

**Ground Game:** No PPR except for RBs (0.5), 0.5 points per carry, 6 points rushing TD, 4 points passing and receiving TD, bonuses just for running feats, 100+ yds game, 200+ yds game, 20+ carries. Superflex 

**Air Raid:** 1 PPR for WR, 1.5 PPR for TE, 0.5 PPR for RB. No points per carry, 4 points passing and running TD, 6 points receiving TD, bonuses just for receiving feats, 100+ yds game, 200+ yds game, 20+ catches. Superflex

**High Defense:** 1 QB, 1 RB, 1 WR, 1 TE, 1 Flex, 1 SuperFlex, 3 DL, 3 LB, 3 DB. No PPR, no points per carry, all offensive TDs worth 4 pts. 1 point per assist tackle, 2 points solo, 3 points pass defense, 3 points forced fumble, 3 points fumble recovery, 6 points sack, 4 points QB hit, 7 points defensive TDs, 6 points INT, 6 points pick six.

,RoyaleHigh_Roblox,"Ok guys! I have a theory that might get me downvoted, so plz no hate. But it is about my personal favorite butler, Ashe! Now, here it is....I think Ashe was made to be a vampire! Yes, ik it sounds stupid, but here me out! I have these reasons to believe that Ashe is not like the other butlers!

&amp;#x200B;

[1.](https://1.How) [How](https://1.How) often he is seen in game

   Now, we all know that vampires can only go out at night. And at the new school, the balls happen at night. So Ashe is able to attend as a butler. Now, let’s take the Valentines update into consideration. The butlers where there as sellers, all of them BUT Ashe! And it’s in a sunset when we play it. So the sun is still out, and Ashe can’t come. This may not make sense right now, because he could have CHOSEN not to come. But let’s look at these other reasons.

 2. His physical appearance 

We all know that Ashe looks a little diffrent from all of the other butlers. I thought that Ashe was probably just a goth or Emo. But i noticed there was more to it then his eccentric fashion style. He has skin paler than pale! Same as a vampire! He has red eyes! Also like a vampire! And is that makeup, or eye bags for all the time he is up at night! And he has black hair that is also very vampire like! Now, here is my last reason why he may be a vampire!

 3. His personality

Ashe is pretty quiet and mysterious in my opinion, and vampres that we have heard about are like that because they have to keep there vampire ident a secret to others. Now, if Ashe is very quite and closed, don’t you think there something behind it? He could be trying to keep a secret, because ho knows what might happen of others find out he is a vampire!   


   I know I might sound pretty stupid right now, but I thik I have somethin going on right now! If you agree or have any theories of your own, tell us in the comments! Anyway, this all I can think of currently. So think about this, and you may start to believe to!",t2_a6flj9d7,,,0,,Theory time!,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Theory'}]",,False,6.0,,,,,False,t3_mmxb6p,False,light,0.81,,public,,0.0,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},Theory,,6,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,,richtext,6.0,,,text,self.RoyaleHigh_Roblox,False,,,,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],,False,0a5bcc18-0ce9-11eb-b4a0-0e9cc0e5e69b,True,False,False,,[],,,,,t5_27aiig,,,,#b4ffad,mmxb6p,True,,RoyalePunk,,7,True,all_ads,False,,False,,/r/RoyaleHigh_Roblox/comments/mmxb6p/theory_time/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoyaleHigh_Roblox/comments/mmxb6p/theory_time/,21160.0,1617904206.0,0.0,,False,,,,,,,1623457962.0,,,,1612488333.0,,vampr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,futuregarage,"Hey crew,

I'm a Future Garage Producer (as of 2007!) I was heavily involved in the development of the genre and signed to L2S Recordings with an old alias, so FG is home for me and you guys are my family.

I've worked in the music industry as an exec since 2008 and I am currently Head of A&amp;R at Vampr (the leading social media app for discovering and connecting with new people in the music industry - check it out!)

I've got a sync brief through for something very fitting for the more atmospheric side of FG and am excited to finally come home to FG and give some opportunity to the scene. 

Looking to reconnect with those in the scene and find some fitting music for this brief and beyond if anything like this comes up again.

Please post the following as a reply:  


1. Artist name and location
2. Short bio - 2 short paragraphs max
3. Link to 2 songs to listen to

If you fit the brief, I'll pop you a DM to further open convo by email.

,dirtypenpals,"Female adventurer and a bit too much curiosity. 
When exploring ancient ruins you come upon weird artefact. Of course you are going to touch it, after all it's shiny and beautiful. Suddenly black and greenish mist starts to spread  out. It covers your body and boom, now you are on a beach. Sand is black, water isn't really water and is more slimeish. You see man/horse, man/wolf, woman/snake hybrids walking around, looking at you curiously, some of them even lustfully. And then you hear deep, sexy, male voice, that kinda makes you horny, and you feel your pussy getting wet
""Who wakes up the mighty king?!"" 
He says, and then you suddenly see him in front of you. He has long white hair, and his skin is pale, like he is a vampre. You can see his ABS, because, he wears only bottom half of armour, with very big bulge on crotch. No way it's so big, you think to yourself. But let's find out. That's your second thought. Now you remember about Camaveia, ancient kingdom that fell hundred years ago. You heard the legends about last king, and that he died in battle, thinking about his Mistress. Maybe you can help him relive all the good memories of her?

,buffy,"Ok, so I just re-watched Firefly for the 20th time and I  am kinda obsessed with that show, I'm always so impressed with the with dialogue, the excellent character development and the amazing world building. I was looking for something similar and I decided to watch Buffy for the first time, seeing as it was produced by  Joss Whedon.
I just ran into a little problem. 
I'm at episode 7 (Angel) and while I like the characters, the world etc. I'm kinda iffy on the fight scenes. Like, I really really hope they get better, because at the moment they just manage to always startle me out of my immersion. Like, the choreography is kinda whack, the editing makes it seem like character disappear and reappear two feet from their starting position and they really just lack any kind of tension for me. The last bit is what annoys me the most. I've never *ever* been even a little bit worried about Buffy or the others, there is never a sense of urgency for me, because it looks like every monster they fight is a badly programmed enemy in a videogame that cannot cross certain lines. Like, Buffy and co are running from a vampire and try to barricade a door and, if the door is slow to close, the vampires slow down as to not reach it before it's basically closed. If a character is surprised/jumpscared by a monster, the monster is always polite enough to give them the time to scream/scramble back/run away/be saved by the reinforcement before it even twitches in the character's direction, and when it does not it's because the poor victim (who is scripted to die) never even tries to escape or fight, it just stands there waiting for death. 
It's like the characters are in a haunted house in an amusement park, where the monster can scare you but aren't allowed to touch you.
And in some fight scenes you can clearly see that Buffy has an enormous amount of occasions to strike an enemy that is basically leaving themselves open to attack every which way and never takes it! It drives me mad. Like in the last episode I saw (s1e1 Angel) when Willow distracts  Darla when she shouts  that Angel didn't attack Buffy's mom, Darla turns around completely and spends 5 to 10 seconds looking around and Buffy doesn't make a single move. 
And Buffy's one liners before she stakes the vampre-of-the-week are funny and witty but they require the monster to look at the slayer, standing there with a stake in her hands pointed at their heart, and wait idly for her to finish the quip and stab them in the heart. Like, girl, at least have them subdued and unable to attack/run away before you try your comedy routine. In the pilot, when Buffy confronts Darla and the other one is a good example of how quipping during a fight should be done: she stakes one, kicks Darla around until she has her backed in a corner in a defensless position and then quips. Of course she's then surprised by the third one that appears out of nowhere but that has a reasonable in-universe explanation i.e. she was taken by surprise by an enemy she didn't know was there. 
It bothers me that it seems like in a fight scene the quips are  prioritised over the tension, choreography or even common sense.

Sorry for the rant, I've just been trawling around the internet to see if anyone else feels the same and I haven't found a single post about this. There seems to be a common understanding of the fact that the first season is a bit meh, due to cheesiness / bad CGI / whacky plots which I really really don't mind! I am a huge fan of Doctor Who, have been since 2005 so for me all of that doesn't get in the way of enjoying a show, I also kinda love it!  But every time a fight scene starts my brain disengages, it keeps flashing me signs that say 'ACTING - ACTING IN PROGRESS' which is never good for immersion. It's a bit like having microphones, cameras and cameramen front and center in every shot.

So, TL;DR I really like the show in every other aspect but the fight scenes make me want to scream in desperation. Please someone tell me they get better in season two onwards. I'm going to continue watching anyways, and just power through that because the world is interesting, the characters are worth it and from what I've read the character arcs are going to be amazing, but it would be really awesome if someone could ease my worries!",t2_6l2jsthx,,,0,,First season bad fight scenes,[],,False,6.0,userspoiler,,,,False,t3_l1dkaj,False,light,0.86,,public,,0.0,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},NEW VIEWER - No spoilers please!,,5,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,,text,6.0,,,text,self.buffy,True,,,,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],,False,a15e59fc-319d-11e8-a3b6-0ea30e8169ee,True,False,False,,[],,,,,t5_2sd68,,,,#007373,l1dkaj,True,,aeglst,,12,True,all_ads,False,,False,,/r/buffy/comments/l1dkaj/first_season_bad_fight_scenes/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/buffy/comments/l1dkaj/first_season_bad_fight_scenes/,75079.0,1611162974.0,0.0,,False,,,,,,,1623354059.0,,,,1590513531.0,,vampr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,riotgrrrl,"Okay, a long shot, but here goes! Looking for bandmates in the North West of England for some kind of punkier/grungier riot grrrl band - think Pretty on the Inside era Hole, The Gits, The Distillers... basically anything with a bit of grit as opposed to more twinkly, twee, indie vibes. 

About me: I’m mid 20s, F, play guitar, bass and do vocals. Can’t play drums for shit, but I have a load of gear including drums I can lend you if you fancy learning or don’t have a kit of your own. I’m fairly experienced in bands and have been a promoter in my time, so I know a fair few people around the UK and abroad in bands, venues and media. I also drive and am willing to travel for the right project (I’ve just moved to Liverpool and don’t know anyone musical here yet). Pretty much ready to go, but too scared to start a solo project.......

Looking for: Will pretty much play with anyone of any skill level if you’re interested in the same kind of sound and are around the same age as me. As I’m hoping to do vocals for this, I’m not looking for a ‘vocalist’, but if you play an instrument (or want to learn one!) and fancy splitting vocals equally, I’m down for that!

Obviously I know there’s a global pandemic going on right now, but it’d be great to meet people in the meantime to get some ideas going! Seems to be hard to find people who are into riot grrrl who aren’t already in established bands these days (I’ve tried joinmyband, bandmix, vampr, gumtree etc...)

MUSTAFANIN TUHAF MACERALARI

Yıl 1950   
 

bir Salı sabahı saat 11 civarları bir bakkalın önünde bir kişi bir şey satın alırken arkasından siyahi bir kürt cüzdanı çalıp kaçmaya başladı sonra bunu gören polisler onu kovalamaya başladı onu küçük bir sokakta sıkıştırdılar ve dövmeye başladı sonra arkalarından cüzdanı çarptığı adam geldi  
 

çocuk benim bir arkadaşım cüzdanımı almasında izin var  
 

polisler ona bakıp adamla dalga geçmeye başladılar bu kürt mü arkadaşın diyi dalga geçmeye başladılar   
   
 

Bir polis parmağını burnuna okup çıkan sümüğü adamın üstüne sürmeyi denerken adam parmağını tutup parmağını kırdı diğer polis silah çekip  
 

hareket etme vururum dedikten sonra   
 

adam aldığı kolaya tuhaf bir enerji vererek kapağı adamın parmağına attı bunun sonucunda adamın parmağı kırıldı ve adam kolasından içmeye başladı   
 

kürt e baktı ve dediki benim adım mustafa senin adın ne   
 

kürt ona bakıp benim adım Yusuf dedi mustafa ona bakıp benimle gez dedi buralarda ırkçılık fazla dedi ve bu ikisi yürümeye başladılar konuşmaya başladılar zaman geçti saat 22 oldu teyzesi onu bir restoranda bekliyordu mustafa Yusuf la beraber gittiler teyzesiyle görüşmelei güzeldi restoran sahibi Yusuf u görünce çıkmalarını istedi mustafa karşı koyunca kavga çıktı adam mustafa o muşta işine yaramaz dedi ondan sonra adam cebine uzatırken mustafa bir sonraki sözün muştalar biliyosun oldu adam muştaları nasıl biliyosun dedi ondan sonra adam şaşkınlığından olduğu yerde kaldı bunu açık olarak gören mustafa adama insna üstü dewrecede bir güçle yumruk attı ordan çıktıktan sonra başka bir restorana karar verme kararı aldılar fakat arkadan mustafanın tanıdıüı bir adam geldi Mehmet o küçükken ona yardım eden biriydi mustafanın en korktuğu şey olmuş olabilirmiydi mustafanın ailesinin vampirlerle ilgili uzun bir geçmişi vardı Mehmet e baktı ve konuşmaya başladı hiçbir şey olmamış gibi taki mehmte kemal in nerde olduğunu sorana kadar kemal mustafanın ailesine vampir zamanlarında maddi yardım eden biriydi bu sorunun üstüne Mehmet bilmediğini söyledi ve bundan emin olan mustafa cebinden bir makinalı tüfek çıkardı ve mehmete sıkmaya başladı fakat Mehmet   
 BİR VAMPİRDİ mustafaya baktı ve dediki   
 

SENİN GÜÇLERİN BÜYÜMEDEN SENİ ÖLDÜRÜRSEM VAMPİR LORDU OLABİLİRİM   
 

mustafa ona bakıp yaklamşmaya başladı ve bir bomba attı ardından ceketini de ardından attı   
 

Mehmet ilk bombayı arkasına attı fakat bir seslker duydu sonra fakettiki ceketin üstünde birçok bomba var ve ilk bombaya balı ipler ilk cekettiki bombaların pinini çekmiştive ceket üstüne dolanmıştı   
 bombalar patladı ve Mehmetin parçalrı restoranın dört bir yanına gitmişti fakat sonra parçaları tekrar birleşmeye başladı mustarfa bir bardak aldı ve Yusuf a bakıp 2 cümle kurdu  
 

bu adamı yenmenin tek bir yolu var TABANLARI YAĞLA   
 

ve mustafa ve Yusuf kaçmaya başladı Yusuf   
 

neden kaçıyoruz diye bağırdı ve mustafa dediki   
 

güneş gelene kadar hayatta kalmalıyız fakat önlerindeki köpriye bakınca ggözlerine inanamadı   
 

MEHMET ELLERİNDE BİR KIZLA mustafayı bekliyordu mustafanın nefes seslerini duydu ve mustafa dediki   
 

ya burda kaçarsın yada bu kızın hayatını kurtarırsın kaçarsan sende zaten günateşi mantrası yok demektir  
 

bunu duyan mustafa sinirlenip bir hayvan gibi yeri yumruklamaya başladı ve Mehmet e hücum etti Mehmet elindeki kadını yere attı ondan sonra ona tam hücum eden mehmete gözlerinden basıçlı kan fışkırttı Joseph bunun vampirlerin kulabileceği bir hareket olduğunu bildiğinden dolayı bardağa günateşi mantrası yoğunlaştırıp kanı deflekte etti ve diğerini koluna geldi mehmetin kafası delinmişti Mehmet ona baktı ve son kozum diye bağırdı günateşi mantrası kulanmaya başladı fakat günateşi mantrası onu yakmaya başladı vücudu erimeye başladı o sürede mustafaaya bakıp tek bir şöyledi amcan ermeniler tarafından kaçırıldı bunu duyan mustafa NE NASIL diye bağırırken mehmetin son sözleri ermeni sığnağının yeriydi   
 

günlerden Cuma mustafa Ermenistan topraklarında sığınağa doğru yol alıyor aklından tek geçen şey ermeniler neden amcasını kaçırırdıki buna anlam veremeyen mustafa 100 metre kara gözlemleme yapmaya başladı 2 tane koruma vardı yakın bir aklına bir plan geldi yerde gördüğü iki tane taşı göğüs kısmına koyup kendisini kadın gibi gösterdi şaşıran askerler ne oluyor diye yaklaştığı anda 2 askeri güneş mantrası kulanarak bayılttı. Sonra içeriye girmeye başladı içeriye girdiğinde amcası ve bir tuhaf görünen asker çok tuhaf bir adama bakıyorlardı. Adamı gören Mustafa amcasına baktı onun güvende olduğunu anladı ve tuhaf duran adama bakıp yakınına yürüdü . Yüzüne yaklaştı . Elini kaldırdı . Parmağı ile yüzüne dokundu ve ondan sonra adamla dalga geçmeye başladı . diğerlerinden tuhaf görünen ermeni askerine baktı ve adını sordu adam söyleyecekken tuhaf varlık konuşmaya başladı.   
 Adım Santana dedi ve yürümeye başladı önünde duran bir askerin içinden geçti ve yürümeye devam etti .Bunun güçlü bir vampir olabileceğini düşünen Mustafa santanayı durdurmalıydı . güneş ateşi mantrasını bacağına yoğunlaştırdı ve tekme attı .santana olduğu yerde Mustafaya baktı eliinin tersiyle Mustafaya vurdu . Mustafa kapıya doğru uçtu .Santana ermeni komutanına baktı .ona yürüdü ve ermeni komutanının içine girdi. Komutan kendisini kontrol edemiyordu komutan kapıya doğru yürütüyordu komutan ne kadar direnmeye çalışsada işe yaramıyordu oda son çaresini kullandı 

Cebindeki bombaya tüm gücüyle uzandı ve bombayı alamasada fitili çekmeyi başarmıştı patlamadan dolayı aşırı yaralanmıştı fakat Santana zor olsada hala vücudundaydı fakat artık görünebiliyordu . Mustafa tüm gücüyle hücum etti ve Santanayı kapıdan dışarı çıkardı fakat farketmediği şey Santana ona bağlanmıştı güneş ten etkilenmiyordu ama Mustafayı yiyip biteremiyorduda Mustafa mantrasını o kadar süre tutamazdı oda koşmaya başladı. Santana Mustafayı bir şekilde durdurmalıydı çünkü eğer güneşte o çok kalırsa o da yanardı . mustafa koşarken üstü kapalı bir kuyuya yaklaştı . Bunu fırsat gören Santana Mustafaya vurdu ikiside kuyuya düşmeye başladı. Santana bağırmaya başlayacakken Mustafa dediki 

\-BİR SONRAKİ SÖZÜN SENİ SÖMÜRECEM

\-SENİ SÖMÜRECEM 

Saşıran Santana bir anlık duraksamasından sonra Mustafanın arkasındaki şeyi gördü ışık güneş ışığı ve o an fark etti Santana Mustafaya vururken Mustafa kuyunun üstünü kırmıştı yukardan gelen ışık suya yansıyordu hem yukardan hem de aşağıdan ışıkla yüz yüze gelen Santana yanmaya başlamıştı Mustafa yanmadan önce suya düştü 

Kendisine geldiği gibi kuyudan tırmanarak çıktı ve amcasına baktı amcası iyidi . nazi askeri de ölmemişti fakat aşırı yaralıydı . amcasına baktı ve nasıl buraya kaçırıldığını sordu . amcası ona bulduğu şeyleri anlatmaya başladı 

Geçmiş zamandan kalma 3 tane vampir ötesi varlık güçleri normal vampiri geçen nerdeyse ölümsüz hayvanlar bunu duyan Mustafa onları yenebileceğini düşünüyordu bunun üzerine nerde olduklarını sordu amcası bunu Mustafa söylerken bir şeyi daha söyledi orda ermeni askerleride orda birde aile arkadaşımız Kandemirlerin son çoçuğuda orda olacak

Mustafa oraya vardığında bütün askerler öldürülmüştü ve 3 vampir orda havalı bir şekilde duruyordu.

Kandemirlerin son çocuğu orda dizlerinin üstünde yaralı bir şekilde bekliyordu Mustafa yaklaşmaya başladı . İçlerinden bir vampir aralarından çıktı ve Mustafaya karşı yaklaştı Mustafa cebinden 2 çelik top çıkardı ikisi tek bir ipe bağlı Günateşimantrası yoğunlaştırıp vampir e doğru attı vampir bakıp dediki 

\- O kadar güçsüz bir atışı bana tuturman zor 

Derken Mustafanın attığı toplar geri gelip vampir i vurdu.Vampir Mustafaya baktı 

\- Fazla güçsüzsün çalışıp tekrar gel ve bu işi bitirelim

Mustafaya yaklaşıp onun kalbine bir yüzük koydu ve antidotunu mustafaya gösterdi arkadaki bir vampir bende dövüşmek istiyorum dedi ve kendi yüzüğünüde koydu .İlk koyan vampir 

\-Bu yüzükler önümüzdeki 2 ay içerisinde toksinlerini yayacak ya yeteri kadar güçlenirsin ya da ölürsün.

Vampirler gitmeye başladı 

Mustafa artık bu durumun ciddiyetini kapsamaya başlamıştı etrafına bakında Kandemirlerin çocuğunun kollarında yaşlı bir adamı tuttuğunu fark etti . ağlamaklı yüzüyle bakıyordu .Mustafaya baktı ve dediki 

\-Benimle geliyorsun bu hayvan bozması varlıkları yenmek için seni çalıştıracak kişiyi biliyorum 

Mustafa ne olduğunu anlamasada kabul eder

Günlerden Pazar 

Yer karadağa

Mustafa Kandemirlerin çocuğunun ismini sonunda öğrenmişti ismi Ömerdi. Ömer başına buyruk biri olsada iyi biriydi ömer in önderliğinde karadağa gitmişlerdi çünkü ustası karadağdaydı ustası 

Ömer ile birlikte şuanlık bir kafede oturuyorlardı bir zaman sonra ustaları geldi aşırı genç görünüyordu uzun siyah saçlı 1.80 boyunda biriydi.Ömer onu tanıyormuş gibi görünüyordu .Mustafa direk konuya girdi benim güneşateşi mantramı geliştirmem gerekiyor . Kadın ona baktı ve dedi ki 

Geliştirmek o kadar kolay bir şey deil ölme ihtimalin bile var 

\- Zaten hayata kalmam gelişimime bağlı dedi

\- Kadında peki ama uyarmadım deme dedi

Ömer ve Mustafayı yanına alıp bir dağın uç yamaçlarına götürdü dağın içeresine geçtikten sonra bazı şeyleri anlatmaya başladı

\- Güneşateşi mantrası nefes almaya bağlıdır ne kadar uzun süre tutarsanız o kadar güçlü olur 

Diyip 2 maske verdi

\- Bu maskeler nefes almanızı zorlaştıracak orda dev bir sütun var normal yollarla tırmanılması haftalar alıyor siz mantranızı kulanıp düz bir şekilde tırmanıcaksınız 

Kadın Bir anda hızlı bir şekilde koşmaya başlayıp en tepeye çıktı  . 

\- Ha bide aşağası zehirli yani maskeleri çıkarmayın 

Mustafa maskeyi takıp düz duvara tırmanmaya başladı ömer de ardından başladı .dakikalar saatlere ,saatler günlere ,günler haftala dönüştü . 

Mustafa son nefesiyle yukarı çıkmayı becerdi Ömer de arkasından geldi kadın ikisine baktı ve iyi becerdiniz dedi. Mustafa artık her aldığı nefesi hissediyordu .

Kadın ikisinede bakıp dediki

\- Bu daha başlangıç romaya gidiyoruz 

Mustafa kabul etti ve romaya gittiler romada 2 tane mantra kullanıcısı ile dövüşmeleri gerekiyordu Mustafa kendisinin dövüşeceği yere gitti 

Gittiği yer büyük bir şatoydu şatoya girdiğinde hiç kimse olmadığını fark etti sonra sesler durmaya başladı bu sesler bir insandan geliyor olamazdı sesin geldiği tarafa gittiğinde insan ölüleriyle karşılaştı .Sonra bir ses geldi

\- Uzun zaman oldu görüşmeyeli 

Bir anda arkasından yüzüğü koyan vampirlerden biri belirdi .Mustafa tepki veremeden saldırdı ve mustafanın kolunu çizdi ve bir anda kayboldu Mustafa ne olduğunu anlayamadan vampiri bulmaya çalıştı . vampirin gittiği yöndeki bir odaya girdi . odada 20 tane ayna vardı . sonra vampir konuşmaya başladı 

\- Ölmeden önce bir açıklama al . ben yansımalar arasında atlıyabiliyorum 

\- Bir sonraki sözün neden bana bunları anlatıyorsun 

\- NEDEN BANA BUNLARI ANLATIYORSUN . NE 

\- Ne kadar da komik 

Vampir aynalardan geçerek Mustafaya saldırmaya başlar 

Mustafa ne yapması gerektiğini düşünürken bir şey fark eder vampir ışığın geldiği yöne tam gidebiliyordu yani kendi yönüne karar veremiyordu 

Mustafa mantrasını kullanıp bir ışık kaynağı oluşturur vampir gülerek 

\- Cidden bunu yapabileceğini düşünmediğimi mi sandın 

Vampir in geçişleri aynaların yönünü deiştirerek ışığa göre şekil verir Mustafa son bir şey fark eder 

\- Bir sonraki sözün ÖL ARTIK 

\- ÖL ARTIK 

Mustafa bu aralıktan yararlanıp bir bakır para çıkarır ve vampir in geldiği yöne doğrultur vampir bakırdan gelen yansımayla havaya uçar Mustafa mantrasını kulanarak parayı atar vampir in canı yanmaya başlar ve yere düşer mustafa öldüğünü zanndik gitmeye başlarken vampir ayağala kalkar ve aynaya ışınlanır . Mustafa gülerek

\- Bunun sana yetmeyeceğini biliyordum sen düşerken aynalara mantra yoğunlaştırdım . Yanarak ölebilirsin 

Vampir acı içinde debelenerek ölür . Mustafa vampirin arta kalanlarından antidotu alır ve içer 

Ustasının yanına döndükten sonra artık geri kalan vampirleri avlamaya hazır olduğunu söyler romanın Arenalarına giderler Mustafa tek başına bir bar a gider Orda başka bir vampir gelir Vampir bağırarak 

\- Sen mi dabuu yu öldürdün 

Mustafa aynalardan geçen vampir mi diye düşünmeye başlar . sonra sadece rahatsız etmek için evet der 

\- Acı çekeceksin 

Mustafa dövüşe hazırlanırken arkadan bir figür belirir ermeni subayı geri gelmişti ermeni subayı bağırarak 

\- SENİ HAYVAN BOZMASI VARLIK 

Vampir onun kim olduğunu bilmediği için sakince 

\- Ölmenden önce git burdan 

Ermeni subayı vampir e saldırmaya başlar . Vampir basit bir şekilde yumruk atar fakat ermeni subayı tutmayı becerir 

\- Sen insan olamazsın diyip

Tekme atar ve ermeniyi ekndisinden uzaklaştırır . ermeni yüzünde deli bir bakışla bağırır 

\- ERMENİ TEKNLOJİSİ DÜNYANIN EN İYİSİDİR 

Vücudunun robot parçalarını göstermeye başlar 

\- EN SON SİZİN GİBİ MAHLUKATLARLA KARŞILAŞTIĞIMDA NERDEYSE CANIMDAN OLUYORDUM .BU SEFER SİZİN CANINIZ TEHLİKEDE 

Karın bölgesinde olan makinalı tüfekle ateş etmeye başlar . vampir sakinleğini koruyarak kolunun yan kısmından bir bıçak çıkarır ve gelen bitip kurşunları keser . gözle algılanamayacak bir hızda ermeninin arkasına geçer . Ermeni parçalara ayrılırken konuşmaya başlar 

\- Senin dövüştüğün vampir bir dhampir di . Bir melez benim gücümle yarışamaz bile .

Ermeneyi öldğrmeden önce Mustafa bir bira şişesi atar . vampir hızıyla şişeyi ikiye ayırır . Mustafa budan istifade ile çakmak atar barhane yanmaya başlar .Bir anda ateş söner vampir gülmeye başlar 

\- SEN BENİ İNSANLARLA MI KARŞILAŞTIRIYON . (gülmeye başlar) DABOO HARİÇ SENİN ŞUANA KADAR DÖVÜŞTÜKLERİN YAPILMA VAMPİR HEPSİ BENİM KANIMIN 1 DAMLASIYLA YAPILDI 

\- YALAN SÖYLÜYORSUN O KADAR GÜÇLÜ OLAMAZSIN VE SEN BİR MAĞARADA TAŞLAŞMIŞTIN 

\-  (vampir kolunu keser ve kolunun içinden bir şey çıkarır ) SANA BİRAZCIK TARİH DERSİ VERİYİM ESKİDEN 2 İNSANIMSI TÜR VARDI .NEANTERDELLER VE HOMOSAPİENSLER .NEANTERDELLER EVRİMDE DAHA FARKLI YOLA GİTTİLER FİZİKSEL OLARAK GÜÇLENDİLER FAKAT APTALDILAR FAKAT BEN ARAŞTIRMA YAPTIM VE KANIMIZIN GÜCÜNÜ ÇÖZDÜM (kolundan maske çıkar ) BU GÖRDÜĞÜN MASKE BENİM 1 DAMLA KANIMDAN OLUŞUYOR .

\- TANRIMI GÜNEŞE ÇIKAMIYORSUN 

\- (VAMPİR SİNİRLENİR ) GÜNEŞ BENİM LANETİM ANLAMADAĞIM BİR ŞEKİLDE GÜNEŞ BENİ YAKIYOR AMA ONUDA GEÇİCEM BANA TEK GEREKEN ŞEY SAF TAŞ KANI 

Güneşin çıkmaya başladığını anlayan vampir 

\- Bu gün deilmiş 

Bir anda kaybolur 

Mustafa kafasındaki bin bir soruyla ermeniye bakar ermeni kaybından perişan bir halde sayıklıyor .iyi ölmemiş diyip ustasının yanına döner orda Ömer i de görür ustası Mustafaya ne olduğunu sorar Mustafa ustası bir şey söyleyemeden vampirlere le ilgili araştırma yapmak istediğini söyler ustası bir yer olduğunu söyler yanına Ömer de alıp mezarlığa giderler 

Mezarlıkta kend büyük babasının mezarını kazan Mustafa bir kitap bulur kitabı açınca vampirler le alakalı olduğunu anlar giderken başka bir vampir gelir 

\- O kitabı almanıza izin veremem 

Mustafa onun kim olduğunu anlar ilk zehri koyan vampir di o Mustafa dövüşmeye hazırlanırken Ömer bir adım ileri atar 

\- Sen benim babamı öldürdün acısını çekeceksin 

\- Tanrı dövüşümü kutsasın 

Mustafa vampir ile ömer in dövüşünü ne kadar görmek istesede güvenli bir yere geçip bu kitaba bakması gerekiyordu kitabı okumaya başladıkça soular ıyanıt buldu 

Vampirler bütün homsapiensler hariç bütün yaşıyan varlıklarının birleşimiydi o maske kulananı bu varlıkların bir kan damlası kadar gücünü veriyordu ve bunların hepsi yüce lord tepeshden geliyordu 

Vampirler güneşe çıkamıyordu çünkü homosapiens kanı olmadan güneş sadece onları yakıyordu bir ten bunun için insan kanı onlara daha tatlı geliyordu 

Artık ömerin nasıl gittiğine bakması gerekiyordu Ömer e bakmaya gittiğinde tek görtdüğü şey parçalanmış bir insan vücudu ve bir antidot antidotu kullandıktan sonra ağlamaya başladı gözünden yaşlarını sildikten sonra Ustasının yanına gitti bu haberi duyan ustası sinirlendi ve dediki 

\- Bu işi bitirmeye gidiyoruz 

Vampirlerin nerde olabileceğini bilen ustası onu aroma arenalarına götürür orda iki vampirle karşılaşır 

Vampirlerin onurlusu konuşmaya başlar 

\- Burda bizden başka vampirlerde var onurlu bir şekilde gelin ve duellolala çözelim 

Mustafa ve ustası kabul eder Mustafa Ömer i öldürenle dövüşecekken Ustası tepeshle dövüşecekti 

Mustafa dövüşler başlamadan önce birkaç şey aldı Mustafaya bir at verildi pekde bir şey anlamasada bindi sonra arenayı gördüğünde olanları anladı bir kolezyumdaydı ve t arabasına karşıydı ortada bir crossbow vardı yarışmaya başladılar Mustafa crossbow u aldı ve ateş etti ok çok kötü bir şekilde ıskaladı ve vampğr mustafaya yetişti Mustafa ne atından dev vampir in atlı arabasına atladı. Vampir kendi saldırısını yapmaya başladı bir anda aşırı güçlü hortumlar vampirin kollarından çıkmaya başladı fakat mustafa her türlü duruma hazırlıklı gelmişti bir ip attı vampirin kollarına ve sıkmaya başladı mantrası kolarını yaktığı gibi vampiri güçsüzleştiriyordu . Mustafa kendi atına atladı ilk tur geçmişti bile . vampir kendi gözlerini söktü ve sadece hava hareketlerinden görmeye başladı ve kafasından hava üflemeye başladı Mustafa nın atı yere devrildi ve Mustafa yere düştü .Vampir işi bitirmek için yaklaştı tam üfleyecekken arkasından ok girip geçti Vampr sonradan fark etti bunlar zaten planlıydı vampir atından alarken Mustafa mantrasıyla vampiri nbacaklarını kopardı artık Vampir hareket edemiyordu .Vampir kopmak üzere olan kolarını Mustafaya attı Mustafa nefes alamıyordu bu yüzden mantra kulanamıyordu Vampir iyi bir dövüştü derken Mustafa bir şişe ve bir bandana attı . Vampir o kadar güçlü hava çekiyorduki ne olduğunu anlayamadı o sırada Mustafa konuşmaya başladı 

\- Ömer in ölüsünden gücünün havayla ilgili bir şey olduğunu anlamıştım . bundan dolayı saf alkol ve bir çeşit kıyafet getirdim .PATLAMAYA HAZIR OL 

Vampir havayla saf alkolün etkileşiminden patlar 

\- Onurlu bir dövüştü . mekanın cennet olsun vampir orda ölür 

Ustasının dövüşüne bakmaya giderken önünü vampirler keser Mustafa önündeki vampirleri öldürerek ustasının dövüş yerine ulaşır ustası yenilmişti Tepesh ustasından bir kristal alır 

Maskesini çıkarır ve kristali maskeye takar yüzüne takar fakat hiçbir şey olmaz 

Mustafa Tepesh e saldırır tepesh ile dövüşleri sırasında tepesh konuşur 

\- Beni öldürsen bile alttaki vampirler seni öldürür 

\- EN AZINDAN SEN OLMAYACAKSIN 

İkisi nerdeyse bütün akşam boyunca dövüşürler Mustafa bitkin ir şekilde tepesh e bakar Tepesh üstünlüğü ele geçirecekken tepesh i yakan bir ışık gelir 

ERMENİ KOMUTANI BÜTÜN ORDUSUYLA ORDAYDI 

Tepesh kristalin ışığa tepki verdiğini anladı Mustafa askerlerin yanına atladı artık tepeshin ölüceğeni düşünürken bide güneş ufukta görününce kazandığını düşünmeye başladı taaki tepesh maskeyi takana kadar . maskeyi takan tepesh parıldamaya başladı vücudu sürekli deişmeye başladı en sonunda işe güneşin önüne çıkmayı becerdi .Mustafa gözlerine inanamıyordu ve kaçmaya başladı 

Tepesh arkasındna kanatlar çıkarıp Mustafayı kovalamaya başladı Mustafa Ermenilerin geldiği uçağa bindi ve kaçmayabaşladı Tepesh onu kovalıyordu Tepesh kanatlarındaki tüyleri taşlaştırıp attı taşlaşan tüyler uçağın içinde piranaya döndüler . Tepesh uçağı durdurabileceğini düşündüğü için uçağın önüne geçti .Mustafa hiç durmayıp Tepesh e çarptı ve düşmeye başladılar Mustafa bölgede bir volkan olduğunu biliyordu bundan dolayı uçağı volkana çarptırdı ve batmadan önce uçaktan atladı . öldüğünü düşünerek giderken Tepesh volkanın altından çıkarak Mustafanın koluu keser acıdan kıvranarak koluna bakan mustafa Tepesh e bakar Tepesh hiç olmadığı kadar güçlüydü hayvanların gücünden daha öte bir şeye sahipti hayvanlara dönüşebilme vampir ağzını açtı ve konuşmaya başladı 

\- Bağırışların kulağıma şarkı gibi geliyor . Acaba ne kadar bağırtabilirim seni

Mustafa Tepesh e tekme atmayı dener Fakat kendi bacağı yanmaya başlar 

\- Ben de artık nefes alabiliyorum .GÜNEŞ BENİMDE ENERJİ KAYNAĞIM 

Vampir işi bitirmek için saldırıken Mustafa cebinden kan kristailini çıkarır .aklında her hangi bir plan yoktu sadece elinde tek olan şeydi . vuruşun etkisiyle kan kristali sıcaklaşmaya başladı ve bir çeşit enerji yolladı bütün volkanı çizdi Tepesh ikinci kez vuramadan dağ üstündeki kara parçasını havaya fırlattı .Bulutları geçmişlerdi bile Tepesh insan üstünü kulanıp ayağa kalktı ve taştan uçarak inmeyi pilanlarken Mustafanın kolan kopu Tepeshin boynuna girdi Tepesh Mustafaya bakarak 

\- HEPSİ PLANINDI DEİLMİ 

\- EVET SENİ İNSAN BOZMASI VARLIK HEPSİ EN BAŞINDAN BERİ BENİM PLANIMDI 

Mustafanın bunu söylemesindeki tek sebeb Tepesh i rahatsız etmek ti 

Sonradan çıkan buhar ve kayaların etkisiyle Tepesh statosfer den çıkıp uzaya vardı uzayda hayatta kablabilse bile donmaya başladı hareket edemez oldu ve düşünmeyi bıraktı

Mustafa ise bütün vücudunu taş a verdi ve içinden geçirmeye başladı karşılaştığı kişiler yaşayacaktı 

3 ay geçti Mustafanın cenazesi yapılmaya başlandı herkez ordaydı siyahi kürt . ustası. Ermeni komutan . Ömerin çalışma arkadaşı . teyzesi

Sonra arkadan bir figür berildi 

\- Mustafa 1932- 1950 BEN ÖLDÜM MÜ

Herkez arkasına baktı ve Mustafayı gördüler 

Sonra mustafa olanları anlatmaya başladı düştüğü kayada bir balıkçı grubu tarafından kurtarılmıştı . eşim telgraf atması gerekiyor 

Herkes EŞİNMİ VAR diye çıkıştılar 

Hastanede tanışmışlardı .Mustafa eşine baktı ve telgraf atman gerekiyordu iye bağırdı .

Eşi unuttum dedi Mustafa yeni mekanik kolunu oynatarak Eşini kovalamya başladı eşini yakalayınca burnuna dokundu

,rpg,"As the title says, i wanted to reflect on this game a bit. It seems to be done, there were some words by the author about a second edition but ill believe it when i see it.

I never played this, so your mileage may vary. I found the game to be very intersting in the concept but not in the execution. I dont even like fate, but im not sure the fault lies in the system, more in the concept. Why should the player concentrate on dramas? Apparently its supposed to be the anti dnd. Why not its own thing? An ancient world that has been almost completly forgotten could have focus on a completly diffrent thing, namely on the mystery. Instead of tragic figures to play, the PCs would be figures whose actions are interpreted completly the wrong way in the ancient texts. This would be reflected in the game, an outside narrative versus players choice, meaning they would fight fate, so to speak.

The sorceror kings created the ven. Did they stop there? What if they only spent some time on them but also walked in other worlds. What if they will not return to shanri because they are done with it, they havent been defeated, this is just a convinient lie. After all, this is very not in the blooded narrative, to be discarded. Seems like its worth a campaign or at least a one shot. I wonder if any players took HOTB and just dismantled the whole setting taking parts to do their own version of the game.

There are other tabletop games with lots of drama that could be used as inspiration or resources for HOTB, in this case i mean Vampre the Masquarade. Npcs from there could make interesting apperances in John Wicks game.  

Does anybody have anything they would like to share about HOTB? The official site seems to be dead so i found this to be the place to talk about it. There is not subreddit dedicated to the game, so its dead jim, time for a postmortum.",t2_2d64j15h,,,0,,"Houses of the Blooded, a couple of thoughts",[],,False,6.0,,,,,False,t3_jwrugm,False,dark,1.0,,public,,0.0,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},,,2,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,,text,6.0,,,text,self.rpg,False,,,,,,True,False,True,False,False,[],,False,,True,False,False,,[],,,,,t5_2qh2s,,,,,jwrugm,True,,Warder55,,9,True,all_ads,False,,False,,/r/rpg/comments/jwrugm/houses_of_the_blooded_a_couple_of_thoughts/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/jwrugm/houses_of_the_blooded_a_couple_of_thoughts/,1362402.0,1605744583.0,0.0,,False,,,,,,,1623077240.0,,,,1567456190.0,,vampr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,TheVampireDiaries,"Throughout the subreddit there is a cosnsistency of posts showing hatred towards elena. So id like to make a few points on where things don’t seem right. •	Many here claim to love this show but one thing doesn’t make sense. The main characters are Stefan, elena, damon so if you show hellbent hatred towards elena than do you truly love the show? The show’s greatest seasons are the first three seasons. Stefan is the good brother while damon is the bad brother. Elena is the heart and soul that keeps the two brothers from falling apart even further. So how can you hate elena when she’s the one keeping the other two characters on screen at the same time. The big debate is some like Stefan and others like damon. If it wasn’t for elena than the show would have had one brother kill the other before season 1 ended. •	Caroline is praised on this subreddit for sleeping with every guy on the show. But elena is hated for being the love interest of both brothers. Elena did not make them love her. Later on the sire bond and Julie plec made her do a sire bond with damon and so on which wasn’t her fault. The two brothers due whatever it takes to protect her because people protect loved ones. Elena didn’t make them being focused on always trying to protect her so hating her for something she cant control isnt right.•	The confusion between who elena is and isnt. There appears to be little to one stating which elena they don’t like. human elena is when elena actually gets a chance to be herself. You mainly see this when she’s being adorable and amazing during a stelena scene. Then theirs plot armor elena which is when the writers use her for plot related dialogue. A post in the past stated how the writers gave other characters many non-plot dialogue while elena had 98% of her dialogue related to plot. Is it ok to hate her when the writers didn’t give her character actually room to be herself? The answer is no. did you read that post I mentioned and then forget about it or just ignored it? the next elena is sire bond elena. This one is when she became sired to damon. That entire season or most of it she wasn’t in control of her actions. So hating her for sleeping with damon wasn’t her actual doing. So is it ok to hate her for something she cant control? The answer is no. the final elena is the Julie plec elena which is when Julie plec became hellbent on making elena damon’s sex object and vampre diaries became the damon diaries. Is it ok to hate elena when her entire character is treated as a damon object? The answer is no. so if you cant resist the urge to make a hellbent hatred towards elena post then please state which elena you have a problem with and end the post with which elena you do like. I assume the human elena is actually one you do like.•	I hope that you can now see elena for the amazing character she actually is and as a subreddit we can move past the hellbent hatred towards elena. And if you feel that you are absolutely right for being hellbent on hating elena and will continue to hate her with all your mind, body and soul then please just tell this truth down in comments below.",t2_5e8khco9,,,0,,why is everyone so hell bent on hating elena?,[],,False,6.0,,,,,False,t3_jqv0ql,False,dark,0.78,,public,,0.0,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},,,10,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,,text,6.0,,,text,self.TheVampireDiaries,False,,,,,,True,False,True,False,False,[],,False,,True,False,False,,[],,,,,t5_2sctw,,,,,jqv0ql,True,,nazzaaaaa,,6,True,all_ads,False,,False,,/r/TheVampireDiaries/comments/jqv0ql/why_is_everyone_so_hell_bent_on_hating_elena/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVampireDiaries/comments/jqv0ql/why_is_everyone_so_hell_bent_on_hating_elena/,41351.0,1604916380.0,0.0,,False,,,,,,,1623063275.0,,,,1578439520.0,,vampr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was thinking of meeting people in a app that would search for people nearby trying to create the same type of music as you. The commitment and energy would be totally different.

I tried vampr and others but they dont really have much people to offer (my scope of RnB and Soul is also not much represented)

Is there any good app for this or do you take other ways to meet musicians and producers personally?

I'm probably still gonna check the HK store every once in a while, so if I the offers start popping up again, I'll make a new post, though I kinda doubt that they will, at least in the near future.

,linux_gaming,"Hi,

 I just inherited my wife's former laptop and wanted to play around with ""Vampre: Bloodlines"" (2004). The laptop comes with a SandyBridge processor and an AMD Radeon H6630M (WhistlerLP). Windows AMD drivers are stuck at 2014 and while it's possible to push them to 2015 it's not worth the hassle.

I installed ""Vampre: Bloodlines"" (2004) on Windows allright and the game with the latest unofficial patch runs very good and smoothly.

I tried to install it manually in wine and I get 1fps (!) in the menus.

I tried to use the lutris script to install it and I get 1fps (!) in the menus.

At this point my question is the following: does it even make sense to play older games on wine if DXVK/Proton is unavailable?

Am I wrong to think about the updated (linux) radeon driver as in better shape than the stale drivers on Windows?",t2_3egnkg,,,0,,Does wine gaming make sense outside of dxvk/proton ?,[],,False,6.0,wine,,,,False,t3_imedqr,False,dark,0.63,,public,,0.0,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},WINE,,5,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,,text,6.0,,,text,self.linux_gaming,False,,,,,,True,False,True,False,False,[],,False,,True,False,False,,[],,,,,t5_2r2u0,,,,,imedqr,True,,sweetsuicides,,17,True,all_ads,False,,False,,/r/linux_gaming/comments/imedqr/does_wine_gaming_make_sense_outside_of_dxvkproton/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/imedqr/does_wine_gaming_make_sense_outside_of_dxvkproton/,184181.0,1599219666.0,0.0,,False,,,,,,,1622968467.0,,,,1508758100.0,,vampr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,WeAreTheMusicMakers,"Have you ever felt burnt out in **both** your ""day job"" and trying to pursue music?

Because I am going through that now. I've even been avoiding the guitar because - for a number of reasons - I'm so uninterested in playing. And honestly, I think I'm still in the middle of a depressive episode.

I feel like I don't have the time to polish short music clips i want to make since i'm still learning all the techniques to realize what's in my head. And I can't spend the time to work on music during the day since work. And the nights and weekends are gone just trying to recover from work.

I really love music, I love the process of making music. There's all these short production pieces  I wanna create that I know are inside me. 

Ive also lost a lot of the will to write songs since I feel like i've been working on this single for forever (don't have a band so i'm writing the guitars, bass, piano, vocals on my own) and I also have no idea when I'll be able to record with this damn virus and I haven't been able to network as I normally would. And vampr sucks.

Also, since I don't have a band and i'm not a natural pianist but want to play reddit live-streams, I've had to learn the piano and guitar parts (I play instrumental rock). I didn't even make it through learning 1 song before the burn out hit.

Idk, I'm just so drained. Ive tried talking with other people but idk, I feel like the people in my life don't understand because a) they like their job b) aren't pursuing a side project when their day is done c) the ones who are pursuing something artistic actually went to school for it

,EDH,"So with everything going on, I fully expect the next time we'll be able to all play with each other will be in October at this rate.

I made four decks for us to pilot (GW Humans aren't there because they're neither fun nor spooky), and for added fun, each deck has a specific wincon. Each wincon is asymmetrical which pits each deck against one other one-- the likes of which has a wincon related to another deck ( Spirits&gt;Zombies, Zombies&gt;Vampires, Vampires&gt;Werewolves, Werewolves&gt;Spirits) .  Of course, if no wincon is achieved the decks can win regularly through conventional means!

The players won't know the opposing decks' wincons so as to add suspense and to remove the possibility of players intentionally withholding a card/ action that enables another player's wincon.

Each deck is mirrored in the following way:

* Each are comprised of cards from Innisrad sets or cards from other sets which feature artwork related to Innistrad or otherwise make enough sense flavorwise.
* Each deck has a full art creature
* Each deck has one Miracle
* Each deck has at least one alt art foil from a Shadows Over Innistrad/ Eldrich Moon intro pack
* Each deck has at least one *From the Vault* card.
* Each deck has one Command Tower, their accompanying reveal land + Innistrad landmark, and Ghost Quarter. Each deck also contains either Haunted Fengraf or Geir Reach Sanatorium.

Before we all sit down to play, I will share the deck list + extended strategies and combos with the other 3 players t so they can decide which they want to use and understand how each function.

From what I gather, Innistrad-only decks like this are pretty common, so I figure some users here might be able to provide some pointers!

\------------------------------------

# Spirits:

[https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/trafts-lost-army/?cb=1589608681](https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/trafts-lost-army/?cb=1589608681)

Typical Aura-Hexproof with Traft with minor taxing elements and Investigation. Generates a lot of chump blockers and small fliers, and removal by way of bouncing. Has a lot of mana fixing + draw potential and sets up its board very quick. My concern is it taking off too quickly and becoming too untouchable with \[\[Sphere of Safety\]\] while Traft deals toothpick commander damage til the game ends.

**Wincon:**

*""Long ago, the wicked Demonlord Withengar slew the living Saint Traft in unholy combat before succumbing to angelic fury. portents of his return spread in hushed whispers amongst necromancers and cultists alike. He must not be allowed to return, or failing that, be cast back from whence he came.* ***You win when you remove “Withengar Unbound” or a creature equipped with “Elberus, the Binding Blade” from the field, or eliminate those cards’ controller from the game. ""***

\------------------------------------

# Zombies:

[https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/gisa-and-geralfs-graveyard-smash/?cb=1589608964](https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/gisa-and-geralfs-graveyard-smash/?cb=1589608964)

Self-mill reanimator. Gisa + Geralf's ability gives the deck flexibility and make it highly adaptable for combating different boardstates. My concern that is can be a little too volatile and will either not take off at all or explode TOO much with cards like \[\[Living Death\]\] and \[\[Rooftop Storm\]\].

**Wincon:**

*Gisa and Geralf have their differences— one raises the dead directly from earthen slumber and the other grants unlife through electricity and scientific experimentation. But they find their commonality in their mutual love of making a game of zombie warfare. Their latest challenge is making the head of a Vampre bloodline dead and buried.* ***You win by dealing fatal combat damage to either “Olivia Voldaren”, “Olivia, Mobilized for War”, or “Anje Falkenrath” while you contain ten or more Zombies.***

\------------------------------------

# Vampires:

[https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/olivias-sanguine-soiree/?cb=1589609339](https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/olivias-sanguine-soiree/?cb=1589609339)

Vampires with a madness/ discard theme to activate strong effects and play strong creatures ahead of their curve, and the ability to gain control of creatures. Would probably be better with Anje or Olivia Mobilized for War at the helm, but OG Olivia is an old favorite.  My concern with this deck is bricking.

**Wincon:**

*All vampires are connoisseurs of decadence and finery—Olivia Voldaren however is in an unrivaled epicure. Olivia deigns to redecorate her palatial mountainside estate. The missing piece? A werewolf-skin rug for her grand foyer made from the pelt of the apex hunter and packmaster of the Krallenhorde — that should impress her guests and strike fear into those mangy, uncultured wolves in the woods!* ***You win when you control “Ulrich, Uncontested Alpha” during your upkeep.***

\------------------------------------

# Werewolves:

[https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/ulrichs-full-moon-slaughter/?cb=1589609143](https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/ulrichs-full-moon-slaughter/?cb=1589609143)

A deck that relies on the transformation mechanic and a sub-focus on tribal wolves. Has cards like \[\[Lurking Predators\]\] and several curses to discourage players casting spells and divert focus to other players. I've heard horror stories about werewolf decks and I've never built anything like them before so I'm not sure how this one will work out. My concern is that it's going to steamroll the other decks without anything actually transforming, thus defeating the deck's purpose.

**Wincon:**

*If there’s anything a werewolf hates, it’s a collar—especially Avacyn’s Collar, the symbol of her church. Werewolves were once slew in a massive inquisition driven by the church, which still employs religious wards to suppress their canid urges. All werewolves have a deep-seated hatred for the church and all who represent it.*  ***You win by dealing fatal combat damage to either “Exalted Angel” or two or more Angel tokens with one or more Non-Human Werewolves.***

\------------------------------------

So there you have it!

I am hoping to get the following feedback:

* Are my above concerns for each deck valid?
* Are these decks missing any crucial components? I'm not concerned as much about budget since all recommendations are going to be tied to the Innistrad sets and not expensive EDH Staples.
* Are all decks on enough of an even keel? Or will one dominate every game? Similarly, does any one deck not stand a chance against the other three?
* How are the wincons? Too much trouble to introduce? Are any too hard/ too easy? Got any better suggestions?

,tipofmyjoystick,"- The game was probably made at least 15 years ago.
- gameplay is like house of the dead
- weapon is a wooden stake and holy cross
- vampre bats should be killed using stake
- dracula should be killed using cross
- background: graveyard (if I recall correctly)
- 2D game
- played it in pc (not sure if emulated or converted to pc)
- the intro music is more like a class thing
- dracula pops up from the coffin every once in a while. (The time when cross is used)
- left click for stake, right click for cross (I think)

I Hope someone can remember the game title.

Let's talk about archery improvement. (what else ? Muahahahah)

# Undead resistance to archery

Facts

* Undead are pretty resistant to archery by design because they don't have vitals.
* Expertise value of Silver arrows is very bad (6) because it's steel based.
* Marksman  scalling against undead is very poor because the last 2 perks of right  branch will (mainly) give a 100% boost in expertise for ammunition. But  silver expertise is low --&gt; weak expertise x 100% = still weak expertise. --&gt;  low expertise = low AP.
* Blackreach, Labyrinthian, Soul Cairn, and  Skuldafn are endgame places. The last 3 are filled with undead. It's even worst for SC beacause it's skeleton undead... even more resistant to ranged damage.
* Daedric bow have a 30% AP. (which is too much in my opinion. That's another subject.)

[**u/Akatama**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Akatama/)  made this comparaison, don't know if there is some hidden stuff to  take in account that will mitigate his conclusion. If not that will  explain more clearly the consequences.

&gt;Let's  look at 3.4 marksman expertise: tree provides about 65 flat expertise  and a 100% expertise bonus from ammo. Silver  arrows have 6 base expertise, so they would have 12 with all perks,  leading to 77 expertise with a full marksman tree perked which equals  19.25% armor penetration. A little over a third of what you used to have  in 1.9.4 !

**Consequences :** the 2 ""ammunition"" perks (45 and 80) are very weak against most of the opponents you will encounter in endgame places.

**Conclusion :**

* Marksman have been nerfed alot in v3.X against undead.
* Ammunition perks will not help you.
   * at low level to improve your expertise against draugr
   * at high level to improve your expertise against Ebony vampre / Dragonpriest.
* Daedric can opener will adress endgame issue... but that mean daedric weapon, all build are not meant to use such weapon because of RP.

# Options

Objective is to give tools for archer in order to tacle undead content before level 20 and tools that will mitigate the race for power. So these tools need to come early and have the capability to scale with marksman. But these tools need to let undead be a threat to archer, the objective is not to erase this weakness, but to offer some scaling for archer build against undead.

Proposal :

* Marksman Perk. Level 30 - left branch, optional. Undead hunter. upgrade silver arrows to tier2 against undead.
* ""Undead  shredder"" silver arrow. Smithing 25 ""scaled armor"". This perk isn't really useful for an archer but it can be taken very early. With this perk you can smith Undead shredder silver arrows, which have the same recipe than silver arrows, same damage but have a T2 expertise against undead.

These options make silver arrows more effectives but still less than sunhallowed elven arrows. Auriel's bow will still have an edge. Undead will be more easy to handle but still far more difficult than any other threat. You will benefit for a first boost at level 25/30 of 24 expertise, then 2 other small boost at 45 and 80 in marksman.

These options will ot adress skeleton issue and soulcairn skeleton dudes.... well. Soulcairn is not supposed to be a cake walk, so I think it's not an issue.

|Why such low level ? Because it's when you really need it. At higher level you really start to be more confortable, no more stamina issue, good damage even with a light bow, etc...|
|:-|


Option to avoid at all cost :

* silver based arrow for all type of arrow.
   * It looks fancy, but dragonbone silver arrow will be too powerful. We already have a good idea of silver ebony arrows with bound arrows. It's very powerful, but it's on a bow you can't temper nor enchant.
   * It's not bad to have undead more resistant to ranged damage. The idea is not to erase the weakness but to mitigate a bit the race for power. So I think a less OP option need to be implemented.
* alchemy or enchanting based options. Archer, unlike melee warriors, need smithing. Any solution based on another crafting skill will be tedious.",t2_1675a7g6,,,0,,3Tweaks - Brainstorm : Archery improvement,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Mod'}]",r/skyrimrequiem,False,6.0,green,,,,,,False,light,,#edeff1,public,,0.0,{},,60b07358-ebe1-11e5-966e-0e9455ced03f,False,,,False,False,,{},Mod,False,2,,,False,self,1585850671,archer,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Grumpy wolf'}]",{},,True,,,richtext,6.0,,,richtext,self.skyrimrequiem,False,,,,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,528e8460-eb3a-11e5-a39a-0e117c60e3b7,True,False,False,Grumpy wolf,[],,,,,t5_2znbs,,,,#388e3c,ftobcw,True,,I_nbk_I,,16,True,all_ads,False,,False,dark,/r/skyrimrequiem/comments/ftobcw/3tweaks_brainstorm_archery_improvement/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimrequiem/comments/ftobcw/3tweaks_brainstorm_archery_improvement/,19131.0,1585841376.0,0.0,,False,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'thrvAnuM5lEI9wb9nUtcWAYQfsrLPix2HqmjT1KFDpk', 'resolutions': [{'height': 60, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Lfd4maLaAKT3Dd-k8qkIQeFWjOgcPStqjGnL6LieX-U.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=073bae37a817e29b2b4d6ddddef113ba8421b1bc', 'width': 108}, {'height': 121, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Lfd4maLaAKT3Dd-k8qkIQeFWjOgcPStqjGnL6LieX-U.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b8666e4ddf9771de1451b76b10a3a493945fce9', 'width': 216}, {'height': 179, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Lfd4maLaAKT3Dd-k8qkIQeFWjOgcPStqjGnL6LieX-U.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1676f48420cdefc05b86d30329506642a7575259', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 216, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Lfd4maLaAKT3Dd-k8qkIQeFWjOgcPStqjGnL6LieX-U.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=20b0f8314a68e2bc4a4b9d3162a254e7b3ccb357', 'width': 385}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,1565302318.0,1587836070.0,vampr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1. There are 3 girls in it: a short haired blonde ""vampre"", a longish haired brunette vampire, and a longish haired brunette human. They might have been in an alley after a party. They go into this small place, probably a house. The blonde ""vampire"" has sex with the human. At the end the blonde ""vampire"" probably slits the human's throat with a knife and then sucks the blood. The whole time the brunette vampire watched and I think she had fangs at the end. That is all I can really remember and all I can really describe. Can anyone please try to help me find this?

2.The setting is some type of building. In the beginning there is a female vampire and an Asian girl sitting on a bed/mattress. The vampire takes the girl's shirt off and starts rubbing her boobs. At the same time she bites the girl's neck and sucks the blood. Later in the video there is a black male vampire and a girl. They might be upstairs in the same building. They do the same thing as what the others did in the beginning of the video. At the end the 2 vampires fight or something like that downstairs. The 2nd girl escapes and tries to help the female vampire. I don't know if I described it good or described everything. That is all I can really remember.

First watched both between 2013-2015 but they are most likely older than that

Both are real

,residentevil,"This is not my first Resident Evil game, I have gotten and played 5 for the PS3, I am to the Jill and Wesker tag team fight, Dual shock Directors Cut, in which I have made it back to the mansion as Chris, beaten it as Jill, and have played to the mansion as Jill in arrange mode, RE2 PS1 original version, in which I have beaten Leon A/ Claire B on easy, Beaten Claire A/ Leon B on normal with a infinite ammo weapons unlocked, as well as hunk which I have yet to beat, Outbreak file one, which I got to the apartment in and died, I plan to try to get friends in the future who like older games and I can do LAN with, or I may order a PS2 internet disk, and finally I have 6 for the PS3 as well but have yet to play it. So I have experience in these games.

In my first play-through I decided on normal mode with Jill so I can see Barry. Our story begins with the A team of STARS going to the woods north of their city to find bravo team who have gotten lost , likely Rebecca lost the map again, but things go wrong when they discover the body of Kevin in the crashed helicopter, likely due to him skipping the tutorial, and no sign of BRAVO. very quickly after this Jill shows herself to be so absolutely useless when scared as she can't shoot the Cerberus (which plays into no part of the game-play) so useless that not even a Victorian vampire can't even come close to describing how useless she is, she can't even say the name of her compatriot, nor even give him a quick death, she attracts the attention of one of these BOWs and has to literally be saved by the less useful playable character Chris, who is well before his boulder punching days, but easily convinces me with those rippling 480i biceps. and is dragged through the woods by him only to again be saved by a man who is just as likely to shoot them as he is those dogs due to wearing sunglasses at NIGHT. and while running with him both simultaneously ends up making it to the mansion with him and losing him, making this game have more plot holes than Mexican ghost street fighter wrestling league. Where we meet up with the man know formally sunglassesatnightman who is now sunglassesatnightinadarkspookymansionman, also known as Wesker, and a man called Barry Burton but looks nothing like him and is nowhere near as high of perfection as the ps1 graphics made him nor as funny with his comedy gold, so seeing as he is not Barry but an impostor I shall call him Fakey Fakerton. Our buffoon Jill asks where Chris the man she ran here with, Wesker explains to her that he has fallen into an alternate dimension where Fakey doesn't exist and there is a new girl for him to rescue, and since he is wearing sunglasses he is either a really swell guy or he is a vampire, and vampires are like zombies or not real so she believes him, they then hear a shot from the west side of the mansion and go to see if Chris is back in their reality, through a set of double doors they find a dining room and a lit fireplace, someone has been here and recently, and by the fireplace? A pool of blood on the floor further confirms Jill's belief that there are no vampires, because why would they waste perfectly good blood, Barry decides to continue investigating the blood (despite having no tools to determine even the blood type), as Jill goes into the next room.

At this point I learn I will have trouble with this one, I prefer to use the D-Pad when doing the fixed camera resident evil games, but the gamecube controller is not built with that style of play in mind, so I eventually settle on type C and move on, in the next room I discover ZomA eating Kennith from BRAVO, as he menacingly turns around I am quick to turn around and book it to Fakey who speaks softly and carries a big gun, and takes it out as it comes into the room, he decides we should go back to Wesker and the game agrees, Jill wonders if vampres are real since a zombie is, going ito the hall there is no Wesker, but there are 5 locked doors, the 3 unlocked doors lead to more locked doors so no where he could have gone, so he must be a vampire, but the cameras don't show the ceiling so we can't know for sure. Fakey decides to go look at the blood some more, and gives Jill a lock-pick, and doesn't dub her the master of unlocking, because she can't even open sword key doors. I then use my personal tactic from the first game be going back to the west side and getting bullets, except I only get a camera recording, and I discover a new area not present in the original game, going  up the stairs I find some zombies, discover how easy it is to dodge now, an arrow that sadly isn't made from a meteor, and a trap that likely needs a fake key, I also use all my bullets, and kill 2 zombies, but get 3 herbs and a kiss on the neck, I now have two herbs. I go back to the staircase and see the door on it, taking the arrow I get a second kiss and use the arrow to open a grave, inside there are no bodies to be found but there is an ominous coffin, some weird statues, one of which can smell half the title, and a book with a key in its clip, I leave the grave, avoid my two lovers, and make it back inside, in there I go to the east door and get the map, I also use the new key to open the door to the dog hall, where I am got by a fake-out jump-scare, and find more bullets as well as a dagger, good, more semi useless stuff. I purposely trigger the Temple of Doom trap, and get rescued by Fakey, who isn't in the west side of the mansion like he said, and hes no dill pickle sandwiches, which is disappointing, he walks off the map and I move onto the stairs, I go into the save-room to find no bullets, but get some kerosene in a flask and go upstairs, I dodge pass the zombie at the top and into the next hall where I go right to check the room, I find a lighter, and a dog whistle and go out the other door of that room to burn zombies, but do to being slow and the amount of kisses I got I was at low health, I accidently burn myself to death with no saves.

This was a unique and fun way to play the mansion that got me hooked on this series 3 months ago, and I hop you enjoyed my commentary on this game and will read my next one, or you can just skip this and move on.",t2_25ru207k,,,0,,REmake GameCube first playthrough blog.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': ""Blog/Let's Play/Stream""}]",r/residentevil,False,6.0,LP,,,,,,False,dark,,,public,,0.0,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},Blog/Let's Play/Stream,False,6,,,False,self,1573876735,,[],{},,True,,,richtext,6.0,,,text,self.residentevil,False,,,,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,8739dc58-0eb7-11e8-bb41-0e63a8cb1ce8,True,False,False,,[],,,,,t5_2s0lb,,,,#7dcea0,dx1mhy,True,,F3arm3,,0,True,all_ads,False,,False,,/r/residentevil/comments/dx1mhy/remake_gamecube_first_playthrough_blog/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/dx1mhy/remake_gamecube_first_playthrough_blog/,135180.0,1573875209.0,0.0,,False,,,,,,,,,,,1541011617.0,1586576737.0,vampr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,EnaiRim,"So I just got back into Skyrim and finished installing a lot of Enais mods as well as a few QoL mods. I really wanted to play a Vampire, so I had a specific interest in Sacrosanct. 

After making a new character and selecting Harkons guild with Alternate Start, I found that I couldn't use any normal spells that I should be able to use as a Vampire Lord. I had the Bats power as well as the Revert Form power, but nothing else in my favorites or in my spellbook. On top of this it takes like 7-10 seconds for the animation that transforms me into a Vampire Lord to finish because it freezes. 

After noticing this I did some research and found that selecting the Vampre start with Alternate Start messes up Sacrosanct. Ok, no biggie. I reloaded to before I picked a Start with Alternate Start and pick the Campfire one just to ignore the long starting cutscene. I give myself a Potion of Embracing and Vampire Lord spell with Console commands and attempt to transform into a Vampire Lord again. Still no luck, the exact same issues occur.

As a last resort I deleted my character (he was only a few minutes old, so it's no problem) and disabled Alternate Start, slogging through the normal cutscene just to see if disabling Alternate Start fixed my problem. It did not.

At this point I'm at a loss. I don't know what else I could do to fix these problems. So I came here to ask for help. Here are my [mods and load order](https://imgur.com/a/k7MrkHZ) as determined by Vortex. If you guys need any more information please let me know.

,marketing,"Hello! 
I'm a mixing and mastering audio engineer. 
Ive been using ig and vampr ( an app for networking with musicians) to try and get more work but it's been hard. I've tried DMing people saying what I do and offering my services but it feels like spam and I'm.not getting much results. 

I advertised on Craigslist and have gotten better results from that. I'm still messing with the copy. 

I was wondering if anyone here has any tips or pointers on how to market myself to get more work. 

Thanks a bunch.

Edit: I feel like I should add I've had some success. I've worked with Capitol records, Universal, 300ent, Defjam. 
And artists such as, fetti wap, stunna 4 Vegas, tee grizzly, 808 mafia, and Romeo Santos to name a few but still I'm having trouble.

2. The setting is some type of building. In the beginning there is a female vampire and an Asian girl sitting on a bed/mattress. The vampire takes the girl's shirt off and starts rubbing her boobs.

2. The setting is some type of building. In the beginning there is a female vampire and an Asian girl sitting on a bed/mattress. The vampire takes the girl's shirt off and starts rubbing her boobs. At the same time she bites the girl's neck and sucks the blood. Later in the video there is a black male vampire and a girl. They might be upstairs in the same building. They do the same thing as what the others did in the beginning of the video. At the end the 2 vampires fight or something like that downstairs. The 2nd girl escapes and tries to help the female vampire. I don't know if I described it good or described everything. That is all I can really remember.

First watched both between 2013-2015 but they are most likely older than that

Both are real

Not really sure about the length but most likely over 10 minutes for both

I think Pornhub or Heavy-R.com

,ESOGuilds,"I've recently come back to the game after a long time, i originally played to max level and never really touched champion points, but i returned about a month ago and am now around cp 250.

Info about me.

System: Ps4.

Username: eridian.

Discord:EridianX #8552

Main: DK Tank.

Region: North america

Experience: Minimal, done most non-dlc 4 mans and have tanked world bosses every so often for people.

Activity: I get on every day for log in and play a couple hours, some days i'll play all day.

What I'm looking for.

I would like to find a guild that is casual but still does end game stuff. I've not had a chance to do any trials or veteran dungeons as of yet, and it would be nice to have a group show me the ropes. Would also like it if i could get tips on playing, like rather than complaining about my tanking give me pointers to be better for instance ""i personally think i do a good job lol"".

What I do NOT want. A trading guild that is gonna charge me gold each week or any guild looking for me to invest resources just to stay in.

A pvp guild, i have zero interest in pvp right now.

Hardcore end game guild. I don't want a guild where all we do is run dungeons over and over again. I'd like to just chill out for an easy dungeon, or world boss, maybe explore and hunt stuff like shards/books or something together.

A vampre/werewolf only guild. I don't have much interest in these, though i myself am a vampre i don't really care to be in a vampire only guild or anything like that.

&amp;#x200B;

This is all the info i can think of at the moment. If any guilds out there are on ps4 and have room for me then hit me up on psn or send a message on discord and we can hang out and see how it goes. I'm primarily looking for a group to actually play with here, so if you want me to just help fill out numbers or something then please don't bother.",t2_12htid,,,0,,Returning player looking for guilds.,[],r/ESOGuilds,False,,,,,,,,False,dark,,,public,,0.0,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},,False,2,,,,self,1557706760,,[],{},,True,,,text,,,,text,self.ESOGuilds,,,,,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],,False,,True,False,False,,,,,,,t5_2w4tj,,,,,bnw3za,True,,Eridain,,0,True,,False,,False,,/r/ESOGuilds/comments/bnw3za/returning_player_looking_for_guilds/,,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/ESOGuilds/comments/bnw3za/returning_player_looking_for_guilds/,12354.0,1557706184.0,0.0,,False,,,,,,,,,,,1477898380.0,1560703256.0,vampr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Fantasy,"Hey everyone! So excited and happy to be featured here today! My name is Christian J. Gilliland, I'm a father of 3 little girls and my sci fi/fantasy trilogy just released last month through Dakota Krout's Mountaindale Press!

My first trilogy tells of tiger events that spark the fires of the Second Duraani World War. It is set in a world that was once a utopia filled with amazing technology that the Elves, Vampre, Faire, and Lycaani received from Humaans who came from the stars. The peace was short lived, however, lasting only a millennium before the Church of Dura'ana declared war against the Alliance of Corporations. The planet was bombarded with WMDs and the Humaans fled, leaving the citizens of the planet alone to resolve their own conflict. 

In my trilogy we fast forward 1000 years after the last bombs fell. The Church has organized itself into the ruthless Govian Empire and controls every facet of its citizens lives. Resistance groups have sprung up, Black Knight being the strongest of them. We follow the story of a young Black Knight soldier who awakens in the ruins of an ancient metropolis. A gnarled forest has grown up through the ruins and Crinnan Jamiso must journey through them... not only to to reunite with his squad, bit also to unlock the mysteries of the Ancients.

My story is written in POV format and we follow multiple characters including:

A Bishop of the Govian Empire
A Vice President of the Agra Triangle Corporation
An Ancient King reborn with a vengeance
A young father and citizen of the Govian Empire
A Vampress who has escaped captivity
A Black Knight searching desperately for his lost friend

Awakening - https://amzn.to/2VQn0Xd
Inception - https://amzn.to/2PNW58Z
Resurgence - https://amzn.to/2Yebant

Fans of fantasy and sci fi will enjoy my novels because they bring to the table the mystery of the ancient technology that the modern people only know as magic, sword and pistol combat, familiar fantasy races with an interesting twist, unforgettable characters, political, romantic and dark sub plots, and much more. 

I invite you all to check out my series. Book 1 is currently on sale for 99 cents so there's no better time to dive in! I'll be available all day to answer any questions you may have! 

I look forward to meeting you all!",t2_137xul,,,0,,r/fantasy Writer of The Day: Christian J.

,GossipGirl,"Wasn't a reboot in the talks, confirmed by CW's director?

Why didn't they bother informing us whether it'll happen or not?

At this point a GG reboot is the only thing that could save CW (not viewers-wise but series' quality-wise).. literally the only thing they have with a lot of viewers and proper promotion right now is the god-awful Riverdale.

The other show airing right now that used to be good and had potential to uplift CW's reputation is Dynasty (made by the GG creators) but it gets NO promo. Zero. Nada.. the first season was AMAZING but everything went alarmingly downhill during S2. It somehow got renewed for S3 although it has absolutely no viewers, especially from the US. During S2 three main actors got fired without explanation, the plot became unbearably boring to watch and the only good thing about it so far is Kelly Rutherford's appearance and a couple of GG references in the show like Fallon Carrington (the main female lead) calling a girl ""a Serena van der Woodsen wannabe"". The show had an incredible potential but there were no proper promotions for S1 either.. i actually accidentally discovered it.

It's sad to know that the actors of The Vampre Diaries and Gossip Girl worked their asses off a couple of years straight on their shows (note that they didn't paid anywhere as well as today's CW/other Netflix shows actors) to make CW the channel that it right now is so that they can produce shit like Riverdale and spit over all of their other shows. Couldn't they at least attempt to keep the quality average?

If they're planning on doing anything i truly hope they'll recast everyone and invent new characters. I don't wanna see a Serena, Blair and Nate number 2 (at this point i don't even count abusive, rapist Chuck or sociopath Dan as characters but i hope we don't see anything like that either..) because i don't think that any young actor right now could perfect these roles like the OG actors did. I've seen complaints in here about Chace and Blake not portraying their characters as well and although to an extent it might be right - they really did suit their roles perfectly. I cannot imagine someone else playing Serena or Nate.",t2_36hb6pio,,,0,,What happened with the reboot?,[],r/GossipGirl,False,,,,,,,,False,dark,,,public,,0.0,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},,False,10,,,,self,False,,[],{},,True,,,text,,,,text,self.GossipGirl,,,,,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],,False,,True,False,False,,,,,,,t5_2rn7c,,,,,bai7iz,True,,xpurplelightx,,14,True,,False,,False,,/r/GossipGirl/comments/bai7iz/what_happened_with_the_reboot/,,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/GossipGirl/comments/bai7iz/what_happened_with_the_reboot/,7667.0,1554655497.0,0.0,,False,,,,,,,,,,,1549616494.0,1560464389.0,vampr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,dndnext,"First off, yes i know, vampires are monsters and blah blah blah, and that the planeshift articles have had attempts at making vampires, but theyve all felt underwhelming and kinda lame to me. Theyre a little different in my setting, kinda inspired by the vampires on Zendikar in mtg. Without further ado:

VAMPIRE
---

Vampires are not truly undead, though its quite easy to understand the misconception. Incredible lifespan, deathly pallor, unearthly features, sensitivity to sunlight, and a thirst for blood define the vampires of Szitensa. 

In their homelands, they operate with a hierarchical aristocracy, and cultivate a somewhat cult-like society within the populace of the ""lesser"" races of their lands. While the populace lives in fear of their wrath, it is considered a great honor to be chosen for your blood and welcomed into their luxurious court, and even greater still to be ""sired"". The vampires, for their part, adhere to a (somewhat twisted) code of actually maintain a fairly peaceful and secure rule, disliking outside disruptions to their ""cattle"", and rarely killing a good source of blood when they feed- at least not right away. 

Vampires divide into two major groups: Trueblood and Sired. Truebloods make up the aristocracy, and are born if union between two vampres; Sired vampires are former mortals (mainly humans, though others exist) turned by a vampire.

Lifespan: vampires live an extraordinarily long time, with the eldest among them being over 1000 years old.

Alignment: thanks to their rigid society and parasitic nature, vampires trend to lawful evil

Speed: 30 ft walking

Darkvision (the kind tieflings have)

Ability score increase: your charisma score increases by 2

Necrotic thirst: your fangs can serve as a melee weapon. They have the finesse property, and deal 1d4 necrotic damage. Additionally, a successful bite heals you equal to 1/2 your proficiency modifier. For each week you go without drinking blood, you suffer a point of exhaustion

Sunlight Sensitivity

Beguile: you can cast Charm Person once per day without expending a spell slot. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

Languages: you speak common and 2 languages of your choice



TRUEBLOOD
---
ASI: your intelligence score increses by 1

Vampiric Flight: you have the ability to fly via a dark magic. You have a fly speed of 30ft as long as you are not wearing heavy armor and are not encumbered

Xxxxxx

Obviously it needs cleaning up and language brought in line with standards. I also need to figure out what Sired vampires do, to make them appealing against, yknow, flight. I know i want them to get their ASI bonus to strength. 

As for what i used as a guide for balancing this, i looked at Aaracockra. They get 50ft fly speed and a d4 natural weapon as well. I feel like the sunlight sensitivity (and the lesser fly speed) is enough of a downside that i could even add something else beyond the charm person, but iunno.

,dating,"I could write a book on how many stuff I struggle with about dating, but this in particular is bugging me right now.

I've started working at this place around 2 months ago, along with ""Suzy"" who joined at the same time. I think we hit it off well since day one. We talk to each other a lot at work, and text each other every single day nearly ever since then. We tease each other a lot too, which I guess you could call flirting. At least at work we don't really speak to other colleagues the same way we do with each other.

Other colleagues have already dropped a couple of hints about the way Suzy and I act towards each other (I'll also add that, where I live, dating your colleagues from work isn't exactly frowned upon). Even our boss once jokingly said ""you guys can do whatever you want together, as long as you don't do it here [at the workplace].""

At this point you're probably thinking that I should have asked her out already. Well, around week 3, while we're texting about horror movies, I suggest we should actually watch a movie together. Suzy replies that I better ask her again after she comes back from a week long trip she took the next week, so essentially in 2 weeks. Sure; time passes, she comes back, and 3 days later I ask her if she's doing something that Wednesday, since our workplace is always closed that day. She replies that she wants to take the day off to recharge batteries at home, and that I should do the same.

Now, taking in account all my previous lackluster dating experience (mostly from Tinder, I admit, which I don't use anymore), I get the vibe I tend to get from most girls who seem to hit it off with me. They seem to avoid going out with me. I've tried asking them early on, not so early on, later on, not so later on, and it always seem to not go past that. Either they ghost me right there, brush it off and gradually ghost me, or keep avoiding it. Even if they don't ghost me, I don't know if they do really intend to go out with me eventually, but I start feeling bad that I might be getting too pushy or desperate if I keep trying. That's basically where I am right now with Suzy.

And there's one other situation that happened more recently. Although I'm no longer on Tinder, I use this app called Vampr which is a sort of ""Tinder for finding musicians"". While I've always used it strictly as such (95% of people there are men anyway), one day I get a notification that ""Beth"" has swiped right on me. I asked her if she played any instruments, and she says she isn't a musician and just wants to meet other people with similar tastes.

We do happen to share a lot in common in our tastes, and soon we're also texting everyday, sharing new songs, talking about each other, and gradually start flirting (I think). While we're talking about some shows we we both want or are going to attend, I drop the hint that ""we might cross paths eventually"". She gives me a somewhat vague answer, like ""I don't see how we would cross paths unless we bumped at each other at X show"", and I already start getting **that** feeling. Anyway, we keep texting nonetheless, with the teasing gradually escalating, and 2 days later (today) I just bluntly ask her if she's free this week to meet for a coffee. There's a check sign meaning that she read my message, but she didn't reply yet. And she stopped texting me today quite sooner than she usually does, so at this point I'm pretty sure of what's (not) going to happen.

So for those of you that read through my wall of text, what's your take on this and what do I seem to be doing wrong?",t2_incaz,,,0,,I can't get dates with girls that I go along well with,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'I Need Advice'}]",r/dating,False,1.0,dating,,,,,,False,dark,,,public,,0.0,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},I Need Advice,False,3,,,,self,False,,[],{},,True,,,richtext,1.0,,,text,self.dating,,,,,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],,False,19ec58c2-9f74-11e7-81a1-0e2bf15991f0,True,False,False,,,,,,,t5_2qhb1,,,,,b2sqqb,True,,harowkun,,4,True,house_only,False,,False,,/r/dating/comments/b2sqqb/i_cant_get_dates_with_girls_that_i_go_along_well/,house_only,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/b2sqqb/i_cant_get_dates_with_girls_that_i_go_along_well/,94223.0,1552968772.0,0.0,,False,,,,,,,,,,,1412122418.0,1560229450.0,vampr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,reddeadredemption,"Spoilers below for those that haven't finished the story!

&amp;#x200B;

I love the fact that Arthur was so artistic and I love his sketches and his writing style. I also love the fact that John is the complete opposite, really bad drawings and you can tell writing isn't his thing. Gives them both character.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone know of an online resource that compares both of their Journal entries? I assume there are items you come across that depending on when (and with whom) you found them, there are two versions of the entires (Arthur's and John's). I'd love to see a side-by-side of their interprations and entries for these things.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I just completed the Saint Denis vampire encounter as John. His vampre drawing was quite humorous (and terrible).

,WeAreTheMusicMakers,"Hey everyone. I just posted an article on Songathon's blog, but I also thought I'd share the info here as well. Hope you'll find this helpful!

*Offline Places To Look For Collaborators* -

**Gigs of other local musicians:** Research local music venues, and consider attending gigs of other musicians in your area. Not only will the performing artist/band be glad that you showed up, but many of the times, the performer will have other musician friends who will be in the audience supporting them that you can connect with, too!

**Open Mic Nights:** Local open mic nights are great ways to display your talent to the local community. You’ll also be able to meet other people in the area interested in writing and performing with you.

**Local music schools, music classes, and rehearsal studios:** Attending a music-related college program can be a great way to meet other serious musicians, but it’s not the only way. Check out what types of shorter-term group music classes that are offered in your area. In may cities there are schools offering programs ranging from guitar and drums to music production and DJ-ing.

**Local songwriting meet-up and networking groups:** Check out Meetup.com and Eventbrite.com for songwriting and music-related meet-ups.

**Music Industry Conferences and Events (in your area and beyond):** Events like Songathon and the ASCAP Expo are places where songwriters from all over gather to network and connect with other music industry professionals. Check them out if you’re interested in meeting songwriters with more experience as well as meeting people on the industry side of things as well.


*Online Places To Look For Collaborators* -

**Facebook groups:** Search for groups on Facebook related to music and songwriting. There are also music groups on Facebook that are more locally-focused as well.

**Music networking apps:** There are some great apps available, specifically dedicated to musician networking. One example is Vampr, which describes itself as “Tinder for musicians.”

**Social media and Youtube:** Searching for hashtags like #songwriter or #nycsongwriter (or the equivalent in your city) on platforms like Instagram and Twitter can help you discover songwriters that you would like to work with. Youtube is also a great place to search for songwriters posting videos of their original music.

**Craigslist:** In every local Craigslist site, there is a section called “Musicians”. Check it out and consider posting your info there.

**Online music courses that foster a community:** Online music courses/challenges like SongFancy’s 5 in 5 Challenge and Hyperbits’ Music Production Masterclass often include a community component like a Facebook group for everyone who is enrolled in that course or participating in the challenge. Those Facebook groups are often great places to find people who are committed to learning and growing as a musician.

**Reddit:** Head to Reddit to find tons of forums dedicated to music creators of different genres. One we like – /r/Wearethemusicmakers ;)

Please let me know if I missed anything!

,nosleep,"There was a canvas-muffled *thump* as Captain Dobbs knocked on the cubicle wall. “Hey.”

Mackey and I turned around. “Hey, Dobbs.”

“Either of you two know about any new street gangs in the area?”

“New street gangs?” Mackey said. He shot me a look and pursed his lips. “Not really. MS-13, Easies, Devils. Who else we got? Handful of dope-slingin’ ops in the Projects. Same old.’”

Dobbs looked unsatisfied. “Huh. Just we keep hearin’ about some new group on the streets. *Ferals,* they call ‘em. Hyper violent. Started off near the Heights, weirdly. Now we got reports of attacks comin’ in from all over the Projects. Apparently the Mayor’s asked the Chief to look into it directly.”

“Heard something about it on the news last night,” I said. “Some kind of new gang’s got the other freaks in hiding. New turf war in the works?”

“Not from what we can tell. Bump in homicides, but they don’t seem to be targeting any one group in particular.”

“Serious?” Mackey said. “Bump in homicides with the other gangs on the down low? So this one group’s making up for all the other guys?”

“More than making up for ‘em.”

“And we're sure it’s not one guy?”

“Positive. Killings are happening at the same time, opposite ends of the neighborhood. All similar enough to be connected, but they don’t match the M.O of any known entities. What was the murder you were on yesterday, Ethan?”

“Uh, Vanessa Bell,” I said. “Dancer down at Lucky’s. Found her all fucked up in her kitchen. Had two puncture wounds right here.” I tapped my neck just below the jaw. 

“Huh. You clear that one?”

“Nah, still open. Found a text to her from Davon Hall, so last night we paid him a visit and dragged his ass in here.”

“And?”

“Wasn't him. He was actually surprised to find out she’d died.”

“So what was up with the text?”

“Booty call, wasn’t it?” Mackey said. 

“Yeah. Apparently he’d been fucking her and left a few hours before we got the call. Had no idea it’d happened till I showed him the picture, though.”

“How’d he take it?”

“Guy was scared shitless, Cap. Said ‘can’t tell you who did it man. They’ll do it to me.’ Matter of fact when we cuffed him he almost looked relieved it was the PD and not… whoever else.”

“Shit. Who do we got on our hands that could put the fear of the Lord into *Davon Hall?*” He trailed off for a bit before adding, “Where is he now?”

“Had nothing on him. Donovan picked him up.”

“Dennis Donovan? Guy’s a schmuck. Anyway. You two work on this, will ya? I wanna know who these freaks are. Ask around in the Projects.” He turned to walk off, but he paused then, and turned back around to our cubicle. “And…  don’t tell the Chief you’re lookin’ into this.”

I blinked. “I thought Mayor Carver asked him to handle it-?”

Dobbs looked around the rest of the precinct, and then leaned in and whispered, “He did, its just - I overheard it. I wasn’t tasked on this, you know? You know how Seales gets when he finds out we’re ‘wastin’ money on unauthorized investigations,’ blah blah blah.”

Mackey and I looked at each other. Then we turned back to Dobbs, and Mackey said, “Sure, Cap. Keep it on the DL. No problem.”

—

“Ayy, man!” Hopps said. He stepped up and hugged me. 

“Hopps, buddy. How you doin?”

“Same old, man. Same old. Thought you forgot about me.”

“Couldn’t forget about you if I tried. This is Mackey, by the way. My partner.”

“Hey, Hopps.” 

“Yo.” Hopps said. He ignored Mack’s outstretched hand and turned back to me. “So you got my loot?”

I handed him his bag. “Black and milds, a forty and a ham and cheese six inch from Sub Shack.” He grabbed it from me and sat down in the grass and unloaded his food. Then I said, “So! You got *my* loot?”

He unwrapped his sandwich and took a bite. “That’s good shit there, my man,” he said. “Got that double meat too. I’m about that double meat.”

“Come on, Hopps. I scratch your back, you scratch mine.” Mack and I sat down on either side of the man while he ate. “You heard about any new gangs lately? Any group called ‘Ferals, by any chance?”

Hopps took another bite. “Shit, everyone round here knows about the Ferals. Freaks be poundin’ on Darmarcus Manning’s boys *and* Davon Hall’s boys. Plus they scared off all them other gangs into hidin.’ Least during the night time that is.”

“Why night time?” Mack said.

“Cause these Ferals only be comin’ out at night. So you still gots them corner niggas sellin’ dope durin’ the day, but at night? Even the hardest of ‘em snuffs the lights and lock the doors.”

“And that’s when these new guys - the ‘Ferals’ - come through?”

“Yeah,” he said. And he took another bite. “And any corner niggas who ain’t be hidin’ usually get they asses killed. An’ you know it was the new boys who do it too - cause when you *do* find the bodies they’s always got two big ass holes right here,” he said. And he tapped his neck twice below the jaw. I looked at Mackey, and he looked at me, and we shared the same intuition. *Vanessa Bell.* 

“Have the big guys taken their boys off the block?” Mackey said. 

“Couldn’t tell you that, man. Alls I know is there be less an’ less niggas sellin’ even durin’ the day. Not worth the risk I guess. Makes it hard for a brother to cop out here in the conditions, you know?”

“Well we can’t help you there, Hopps.”

“I know, I know. I’m just sayin’ on behalf of a friend of mine. Says its tough to score.”

“And these new guys - these *Ferals* - what’s their deal? Do they sell? Any word on who’s involved, who how you get in the group, or-?”

But Hopps was shaking his head long before I finished. “Nah, you got it all wrong, man,” he said. “These boys ain’t about taggin’ signs or ownin’ corners or gettin’ in on the heroin connect. Y’all probably need a word for ‘em other than ‘gang,’ you know? Cause they just be out for blood. Ain’t nobody knows why, neither. But I seen ‘em in person. Feral dude got these red-ass eyes, man. Big, dumb expression on his face too. Saw a corner nigga try to pop a cap in his head but he missed and that thing just *tore into him.* I just ran.”

Mackey and I exchanged a worried glance. Then I said, “So nobody knows where they came from? Or what their deal is?”

Hopps lit up a cigarette and puffed on it for a bit, before putting the lighter on the grass. “You ain’t hear this from me, a’ight? But some niggas be sayin’ some rich-ass white boy that just moved into the Heights is behind it all, someway, somehow. And another thing, man - they be sayin’ them Ferals ain’t normal folks at all. They sayin’ they be straight up blood-suckers.”

—

“Vampires?” Dobbs said. He laughed once, sharply.

“That’s what he said, yes sir.” 

“Vampires. Like uh, what was that Hugh Jackman movie. Van Halen?”

“Van Helsing,” Mackey said. “And Hugh Jackman was a vampire hunter.”

Dobbs laughed mightily at the thought. “Well get him down here then!” And he stepped outside his office and shouted into the bullpen, “Hey anyone got Hugh Jackman’s number? Abrams, you got Hugh Jackman’s number?” Abrams showed him the middle finger, and Dobbs laughed even harder. “Vampires, man. That’s good. That’s new.” He sat back down and his monstrous weight pushed the chair to within an inch of the carpet. “So uh… why vampires, exactly?”

Mackey shrugged. “Makes sense if you’re dumb, right? He said the freaks come out at night. Don’t care about drugs or signs or money. They just kill.”

“You know what it probably is?” Dobbs said, through a mouthful of danish. “Same old gangs, worrying the cops are getting too close to the wallet. So they shake it up to distract us. That’s all we got. Ambitious new banger in charge. It was probably Hall all along who killed that Bell chick. Organized a hit when he found out she was sleeping around behind his back.”

“Vanessa Bell wasn’t shot, Cap,” I said back. “That’s the thing. She wasn’t shot or stabbed. She was so fucked up I would’ve guessed someone ran her over in a truck, if we hadn’t found her in her kitchen. And now that I’m thinking about it, she did have those two puncture wounds in her neck. Remember?”

“You were serious about that?” Dobbs said, suddenly having lost his smile. I took out my phone and flipped to the picture of the deceased Miss Bell, and I showed it to Dobbs. “Huh,” he said. And he took another bite of his danish. “So… what are you thinking, then? You guys think we have actual werewolves in town?”

“Vampires,” Mackey said. “And no, we don’t. But we’ve got somethin. Probably just a few eccentrics. You know how kids are, especially when they’re hopped up on whatever new drug’s the rage. But they’re dangerous, Cap.”

The Captain leaned back and drummed a beat on the desktop with his fingers. “And he said this stuff is coming down from the Heights?”

“Yes, sir. Every night. Said something about a guy who just moved into that neighborhood. Might know something.”

“Huh. The hell are those rich bastards up to?” And trailed off for a bit, lost in thought. Then he snapped out of it. “Anyway. That’s for tomorrow, gentlemen. You guys ready?”And he stood up and grabbed his jacket and his keys. 

“For-?”

“Benefit tonight. Remember? We sent out the memo a week ago.”

“Didn’t read it.”

“Yeah, well it’s mandatory. Some new guy’s supposedly a big friend of the badge, so the Chief’s throwing some kind of crackers and cheese thing at the Hall.” He paused at the door and said, “Hey, this guy’s new in the Heights. Maybe he’s your Count Dracula.” And he laughed and headed towards the elevator. 

—

“So without further ado,” Chief Seales said, “Let’s give a warm welcome to Mister Winston Harlowe!”

The room broke out into polite applause, and Seales handed the microphone over to a tall and well groomed man in his early to mid sixties. He stepped into the center of the room. 

“Thank you!” He said, in a slightly diluted European accent I couldn't quite place. “Its wonderful to be here among the town’s finest in one of *the* finest towns I’ve yet visited or done business in. The way I see things, if you men and women are putting your lives on the line to keep men like myself safe, then the least I can do is make sure you’ve got the resources you need to do your jobs well.” He looked over the gold-plated Donor’s plaque that’d been handed to him. “It is an honor and a privilege to accept this award and be a part of this community, and I’m very much looking forward to working with law enforcement further. Thank you all very, very much.”

The room applauded again and drank in unison, and the music and the mingling began. When it did, Mack leaned into me and said “Yeah, I don’t trust that dude as far as I can throw ‘em.”

—

“Hey, Ethan!” Dobbs said. “Roland! Get over here!”

I turned around. The Captain had been chatting up Mr. Harlowe for some time when he called Mack and I over. 

“This is Ethan Davis and Roland Mackey - the two guys I put on that new gang case. Hey, hey - tell Mister Harlowe what that guy said earlier. ‘Bout the vampires.” He lightly tapped Harlowe’s arm with the back of his hand. “Gotta hear this.”

“Uh, hi.” I said, and I shook the man’s hand after Mack. “Thank you for all his, sir. The support.”

“Of course, of course. What’s all this about *vampres?* Sounds quite intriguing.”

“Uh, well. Its an ongoing case, so we probably shouldn’t-”

“Oh, come on!” Dobbs said, but when he realized he wouldn’t get more out of us he added, “Alright, *I’ll* tell it, then. So these two guys come into my office, right? And say one of their dopehead buddies says there are *vampires* on the streets. I just got a kick out of that.”

Dobbs started giggling again, but Harlowe just kept his grin and took a sip from his cup. “Perhaps I’ve picked the wrong town after all.” And we shared an uncomfortable laugh.

“And it’s startin’ up in the Heights, ain’t it?” said Dobbs. “Maybe he’s your guy.” And he threw his thumb in the direction of Harlowe and laughed heartily. 

Harlowe smiled just a bit wider, but the intent behind it was impossible to read. He simply said, “I’ll let you know what I hear.” And off he went to mingle with the rest of the precinct. 

When he was gone I said, “Dobbs, what the hell?”

“What?”

Mack said, “Why would you let loose about the case like that? You don’t know who that guy is.”

“Fellas, c'mon here. Are we seriously referring to this ‘vampires’ thing as a *case?* Far as I’m concerned we’re still at square one on that.”

“Dobbs, its just-“

“Hey, Ethan,” White said, having walked up to the three of us from behind. “Roland, Dobbs. You too.”

“What’s up?”

“Your boy just turned himself in.”

“Who?”

“Hall.”

—

“Davon Hall,” Dobbs said. He shut the door of the interrogation room behind the three of us. “What brings you here tonight? Shouldn’t you be out uh, jackin’ cars, or some shit?”

“What you think this is, fatass? *Grand Theft Auto?*”

“Easy,” I said. I turned to Dobbs. “Let me and Mack take this. Davon and I have a thing.”

“Fuck you.”

“See?”

“Alright,” Dobbs said. “Keep me in the loop.” And he shut the door again and left Mackey and I alone with our guest. There were no handcuffs this time. 

“So!” Mackey said. “Guy’s a trip but that question was valid, Hall. Why *are* you here?”

I offered him a cigarette, but he waved me off. “We cleared you in the Bell murder,” I said. “Nothin’ on the books against your name at the moment. And yet here you are.”

“Here I am. With the pig who broke my car windows and a black Uncle Tom motherfucker.”

“Uncle Tom!” Mack said. “Wow. Haven’t been called that since middle school. A point for creativity. Minus ten for being stupid enough to walk your ass in here on your own volition.”

“Stop wasting our time, Hall,” I said. “Why’d you turn yourself in?”

“Cause I did some bad shit. I run a gang, ain’t you heard? Whole package, man. So throw me in the can, nigga. I ain’t goin nowhere.”

“No lawyer this time?”

“Don’t know I’m here.”

“Lets keep it that w-,“ Mackey began, but I cut him off. 

“Are you hiding from someone?” I said. And there was a pause. Mackey looked at me, and then at Hall. Hall just looked at his hands. 

“Maybe,” he said. “What of it?”

I leaned back and crossed my arms. “So let me get this straight. You’re on the run from someone, and you come here, of all places? Why? To spend a night in the joint? What about your boys?”

“They on the run too, dawg. Ones who are left, anyway.”

“You don’t have a girl you could crash with?” Mackey said. 

“Y’all know what happened to Bell.”

“Guy like you only fucks one girl at a time?”

“Man’s gotta have a code.”

Mack scoffed. “And you got no out of town hook ups?”

“Nah, man. Here or the gutter. Just where I’m at right now; brother’s gotta survive someway, somehow.” He looked at both of us in turn. “So? You gonna lock me up or what?”

“Who’re you on the run from, Hall?” I said. 

“Man I told you last time I can’t tell you that. You wasn’t listenin?’”

But we didn’t budge. “If you want our services,” Mackey said, “then you better start talking.”

And Hall looked at his hands again and sighed. “A’ight. A’ight, its a guy named Ruth.”

“Ruth?” I asked. “And what’s Ruth’s deal?”

Hall wiped his nose with his hand and said, “Some dude who offered to help me clear the Ferals, man. So he said.”

“You guys been gettin’ hit hard by them? The Ferals, I mean?”

“Hell yeah, man. Them motherfuckers is vicious. First they be attackin’ Damarcus Manning’s boys, cause he owns the corners closest to the Heights where they be comin’ from, right? An’ I’m like, ‘Yo, enemy of my enemy is my friend.’ Maybe I can meet these new boys. Strike some kinda deal.”

“But then they started hittin’ your crew.”

Hall shook his head. “Came outta nowhere. man, you feel me? Everything from Charter to Block. Those were my niggas out there. We owned that shit. Then these new freaks shows up.  Beatin’ on my boys. Killin’ ‘em.” There was a pause before he added, “An’ they got Bell, man. She didn’t deserve to go like that, you know?”

“So how does Ruth fit in?”

“My boy down at the docks calls me up an’ he’s all, ‘Yo, I’m supposed to set a meet wit’ you an’ this dude Ruth. Wants to get paid to take out the Ferals’ for you. An’ he tells me the where an’ the when, and-”

“Why didn’t you try to handle the Ferals yourself?” I said. 

“We tried, man! Went out there to shoot, found some of ‘em - blood all over they mouth, man, snarlin’ an’ hissin’ like they be rabid. Sharp-ass teeth, too, and they just straight-up killed my boy Checkers.”

“Checkers?!” Mackey said, and he laughed. “You ran with a nigga named Checkers? Shit back in my day we had-”

“Ay, *fuck* you, man!” Hall snapped. “Y’all makin’ light o’ my boy then I ain’t tellin’ y’all a damn thing else. Fuck outta here.”

“Come on, Mack,” I said. “Apologize to the man.”

“Yeah, apologize, *Mack.” Kiss my ass.”

“Alright! Alright. A forty poured out on your boy’s marble. Can we keep this moving?”

“Whatever, man.”

“So, Checkers is dead. Ruth says he can handle them. What then? Why are you running from him?”

“Cause, man. I get down to the Dock Irons, right? An’ I meet my boy there an’ he takes me to Ruth. So I talk to him, an’ this Russian dude says he can take out the Ferals for me, an’ lays out his terms.”

“Which were?”

“Man ain’t after a paycheck. Dude wants to be paid in ‘favors.’”

“Favors? Seriously?”

“Yeah, man! An’ I’m all yo, what kinda mafia-ass bullshit is this? And I walk.”

“I’m guessing that wasn’t the end of it.”

“Nah, man. First my boy at the Dock Irons be callin’ me like, ‘yo, you need to work things out with Ruth or our whole deal is dead, you know?’ And when I ignored his ass that’s when Ruth started comin’ after me. An’ this dude, man - I saw him just destroy my boy Flitch like it weren’t nothin.’”

Under his breath Mackey snorted and said, *”Flitch.* Gotta be kiddin’ me.” But Hall either ignored him or didn’t hear. 

“An’ like, I didn’t know how to fix it, you know? So I ran, and -”

“And now you’re here,” I said. 

“Yeah. Now I’m here. And that’s what I know, too. So y’all gonna hook a brother up with a cot? Or what?”

Mackey and I looked at each other. Then we turned back to Hall. “Not yet,” Mackey said. 

“Your boy at the Dock Irons,” I said. “Tell us about him.”

—

“You have the right to remain silent,” Officer White said, as Bill Vietch was led out of the Union House in bracelets. “Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. Do you understand the rights I have just read to you? With these rights in mind, do you wish to speak to me?”

Veech didn’t speak at first, so I did. “I’ll be honest, Veech. We’re here as part of a bigger investigation. Anything you’ve got that can help us out will go a long way to getting these sentences reduced.”

There was a tear that rolled down his cheek. “I’m not givin’ up no Union guys,” he said. 
“So don’t ask.”

“We’re not after your Union, Veech,” Mack said, as the man was dipped into the cruiser, and as the cruiser peeled off for the station. Dobbs - who’d parked his ride only moments earlier - walked up to us and threw his thumb over his shoulder in the direction of the warehouse that’d been freshly raided for heroin. A handful of other longshoremen were being Mirandized themselves over by the piles of it. 

“Never thought I’d see the day,” he said. “Bill “the Veech” Veitch goes down in flames. It must be Christmas.”

“Yeah, you can thank one mister Davon Hall for that,” Mack said. “Man sang like a canary.” 

“Serious?”

“Yessir. Came in looking for witness protection, and agreed to testify against his supplier.”

“Veech was his guy? No shit.”

“Not exactly,” I said. “Apparently Hall’s got a connect out of town, but Veech moves in the product through the docks in exchange for a cut.”

“This is huge, guys,” Dobbs said, biting a cigar. He lit it and puffed and pocketed his lighter. “I mean this is *huge.* You guys gunnin’ for my job, or something?” We shared a laugh. “Seriously, though. Damn fine Police work. Chief just might warm up to the case if we hand him this.”

“Well we’re not done yet.”

---

“William Milhouse Veitch,” Barbara said. The attorney took her seat between myself and Mackey, and pulled out a file. “Let’s run through the charges delivered to the D.A.’s office. Money laundering. Smuggling. Drug trafficking. Racketeering. Extortion. The list goes o-” 

“Let’s discuss the deal, first, shall we?” Dennis Donovan said, from the other side of the table. “My client has agreed to cooperate fully with the prosecutor in exchange for a reduction of charges and the immunity of other members of his crew. Do all parties agree to the current arrangement?”

“We’re on the same page,” Barbara said. “But the number of years we can shave off his sentence will reflect the *extent* of his cooperation. What he knows. What he’s willing to trade. As it stands he’s looking at twenty years, minimum.” 

Veech shut his eyes and lowered his head. After a minute, he nodded. 

“So!” Barbara said. “Way we understand it, Mr. Veitch here has spent the better part of the last decade smuggling heroin for one Mr. Davon Anderson Hall, a local dealer, in exchange for a cut of, what was it, Veich? Ten percent of the profits?”

“Twelve and a half.”

“Twelve five. And earlier this evening we managed to uncover an extensive amount of illegal narcotics from the Dock Irons warehouse. Ten other longshoremen have been indicted. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were also found in a safe deposit box in the back of the building.”

“Let ‘em go,” Veech said. “Please, just let those guys go. This is on me.”

“They were involved too,” Mackey said. “Shouldn’t they see their day in court?”

“They were desperate!” Veech said. “Burtowski, Adams, Freamon - all those guys. A list ones were workin’ *maybe* a week a month ever since the canal opened and cut around us. Lower level men? They were getting called up less than half that amount of time.”

“And that’s supposed to excuse the extensive smuggling of schedule one narcotics into the city?” Barbara said. “If they-”

“Well *you* try makin’ it on three days a month!” He cut her off. “Less than two hundred for an honest fuckin’ day’s work! These guys got kids! They got wives! They got mortgages, and loan payments! They come to me every day and they say, ‘Veech, we’re dying out here. My car’s dead in the shop. I gotta make my cousin’s bail. My kid needs a doctor. Please, Veech. You gotta do somethin!’ The hell was I supposed to do? This precious fuckin’ town of ours left these men out to rot. They had *no one* to turn to when the ships stopped coming.’” 

“My client,” Donovan said, “is obviously emotional after today’s unfortunate events. He’s clearly not trying to *justify* the presence of those warehouse drugs.”

“So who approached who?” I asked. “Did Hall come to you? Did you go to Hall?”

“I don’t remember all the details. It was years ago and its been a quiet arrangement ever since.”

“And a lucrative one,” Mack said, off-handedly. 

“Listen, it was a mutual arrangement. I don’t remember who approached who, but we both shook hands on it so who gives a fuck?” 

“And who ships the drugs in?” Mack asked. “We know you unload it. We know Hall sells it and I’m guessing you take your twelve and a half out of whatever else he gives you that you send back to the connect. Who would that be?”

“I don’t know the name of the guy,” Veech said. “And that’s the truth. I deal with a guy who deals with a guy, if you know what I mean. Handles things real close to the chest.”

“Do you at least have documents of the transactions?” I said. 

“Fuck no. But I can give you the address I last sent the cash to. Some place in Hungary, or some shit.”

“Is it different from where payments normally went?”

“Changed every time.”

“How often did these transactions take place?”

“Varied. Hall would tell my guys when he needed a re-up. They’d tell me. I’d have my guy call whatever burner number I’d gotten along with the new mailbox, and tell ‘em what we needed and how much, and they’d hang up. Never once heard anyone on the other line. Then - a few weeks later, we’d get a ship in, unload the cans like normal, and whatever inside guy they had on deck would speak to me on the DL under the guise of me signing for the cargo, and he’d give me a new address to remit payment to and a new number to call for re-ups. And so it went, for years.”

I looked at Mackey. “We get that address, you think it’d take us to the ringleader?”

He shook his head and pursed his lips. “Probably not. Saw a case like this back in ‘07. We traced the money. Places were dead drops. Some guy picks it up there, sends it somewhere else, they do the same. On and on. Probably three or four stops minimum before it lands in whatever offshore account is running the show. And like he said, they change it up every time.”

“And when he was testifying himself,” I said, turning back to Veech, “Davon Hall mentioned that ‘his guy at the Docks’ - you, I’m guessing - had arranged a meet with someone he claimed was possibly affiliated with organized crime in Eastern Europe. Claimed you’d approached him with the deal in which that contact - thus far unidentified - had arranged to clear what are being called ‘Ferals’ from the streets of the Projects here in town, in exchange for favors.”

“You guys talked to Hall?”

“Says so in your warrant. Is his recalling of events accurate?”

“Far as I know. I had nothin’ to do with whatever deal they’d set up. I just set the meet. And I heard about these Ferals, too. Nasty fuckers, wreaking havoc all around town. Figured the guy who wanted to meet Hall - some feller named Ruth, if I remember - was workin’ with Hall’s connect across the pond and was inquiring about the dip in sales as a result of those Feral things. But I didn’t get involved further than that.”

“And did you know anything about the murder of Vanessa Bell?” I asked. 

“Heard about it. Hall’s chick, right?”

I nodded. 

“Yeah, doesn’t surprise me. That Russian guy and his buddies - whoever they are - man, they’re vicious. Not sure if this’ll help me at all, but about two years ago I wanted out. I’d made my money. My guys had made their money. So after a close call with the Feds I call Hall and the burner contact and tell ‘em to find another way to get drugs back and forth. And I hang up. Hall calls me up all day long. I ignore his calls, so he sent one of his fuckin’ crackhead bangers down to the docks to intimidate me. Doesn’t. I tell him to fuck off. Had my boys get up in his face. Guy pissed his pants and ran.”

“And yet the deal remained in place for two more years.”

“Yeah. That Ruth guy showed up. In my house, later that night. Made it real clear I was either playing his game or I was a loose end.” He paused for a bit and looked at his feet. Then he said, “Can’t really explain it. But he just got in my head, you know? Normally I’d knock that fucker out but I just… couldn’t. I was too scared. Like, *paralyzed* scared. So I just nodded and *yessir’d* and *no sir’d* him until he left. Never thought twice about backin’ out of the deal since then. So when he showed up in my house again lookin’ for Hall the other day, I didn’t ask why. I set the meet.”

“And all he wanted was to facilitate the drug trade in a mid-sized town? Seems like a huge amount of effort to go through for what can’t possibly be much in the way of profits.”

“Yeah,” Veech said. “Listen. They may have had us smuggle somethin’ other than dope, you know?” Mack and I and Barbara exchanged glances and leaned in. Even Donovan stopped rubbing his forehead and looked at his client. “Few months back. We got a crate, right? And its movin.’ Like there’s an animal inside there. An’ no matter how scared I am of Ruth there ain’t no way I’m moving any living shit other than plants. Normally I operate under a policy called ‘I don’t fucking wanna know.’ But I draw the line at human trafficking. Anyway. We bust the thing open. There was another crate inside, and a man inside that, thrashing around. Snapping and hissing. Literally chewing on the wood of the thing, I kid you not. Just *gnawing* on it.”

“A Feral,” I said. “What did you do?”

“Boxed it back up and moved it along, sad to say. Thing scared the shit out of me, though. Eyes red as blood.”

---

“Hey, Hopps!” I said. I dangled a bag of fast food from the window, and the man made his way down from his stoop to the car after sloppily stashing away his pipe. 

“Ethan, my man! What you got for me today?”

“Two burgers, fries, and a slice of that turtle pie. Fork’s in the bag with a can of diet. All yours *if* you help us find a guy by the name of Ruth.”

Hopps stopped in his tracks, and his grin vanished. “Yo, what you doin’ droppin’ that name out in the open, man? Gonna get a brother killed just for hearin’ it.”

“Well there’s nobody around, Hopps. You’re safe.”

“Yeah, I don’t know about that. That boy’s network runnin’ real deep and tight in the Projects. Like I said before, man, you ain’t any street wiser than a rock.”

“Well you’ll have to teach me your wisdom at a later date.”

“You might be beyond my expertise, know what I’m sayin? Besides, dirt on a man like that’s worth a whole lot more than a cheeseburger.”

“Well how about a cheeseburger *and* we don’t haul your ass downtown for possession?” Mack said. I shot him a look and smacked him in the shoulder with the back of my hand. He shrugged.

“Well the way these streets be at night with them Ferals I’d actually prefer that, man, you know? Besides, word is Davon Hall hisself came to ya’ll for protection and he be alive in some safehouse somewhere when his boys is anything but. That’s what he got for his knowledge. I just got a fuckin’ burger?”

“Easy, both of you. Okay?” I fished out a $50 from my wallet and handed it to Hopps. “Here. Burger and a $50. I’ll see if we can’t work in some kind of protection deal too, if you think you need it. So what do you say? Can you help me out?”

“Alright, man.” He stashed the bill in his pocket. “Alright. For *you.* Not for that Uncle Tom lookin’ motherfucker.”

“Again with this Uncle Tom line?” Mack said. “Am I the only black cop in America now? Damn.”

“I’ll make sure Mackey behaves himself.” I smiled at him and he gave me the finger. Then I turned back to Hopps. “So what do you got for me? Anything helps.”

“Word is that Ruth guy be runnin’ the show now that the gangs be out the way,” he said. 

“Yeah, we might’ve heard something about him bringing a Feral into town through the Docks. But we don’t know if there was any more than the one.”

“Only need one, man,” Hopps said. “Ferals make Ferals. Assumin’ they leave somethin’ behind to rise up and be one of them.”

“Rise up?”

“Yeah, man. When Ferals kill a brother the brother turns into one. Then you got two Ferals. Seen it happen with my own eyes. Shit was terrifyin.’”

“You saw him literally rise up from the grave?”

“Nah, man. But I saw him gettin’ feasted on by one of them things, and I ran. Two nights later I saw him *as* one of them things. Know what I mean? That’s how they be spreadin.’”

“And have you seen him since?”

“Nah. Thank God, too, know what I mean? But word is these new boys is clearin’ ‘em. Probably workin’ for Ruth, or Harlowe, or somethin.’”

“Wait… Harlowe?” Mack said. He shot me a look and then leaned closer towards my window. “Winston Harlowe?”

“Yeah. That’s who they say Ruth is workin’ for, anyhow. They say he’s like Count Dracula, or somethin,’ like Chief bloodsucker behind all this mess. But its all he-said-she-said rumor at this stage, far as I know. And even if its true, though, you know, a rich ass white boy like that? Ya’ll ain’t never gonna catch in the same room as his own shit.”

---

“You wanted to see us, sir?” 

“Vampires?” Chief Seales said from his desk. He found much less humor in the idea than Dobbs. 

Mackey and I stepped in and shut the door behind us. Then I said, “Yes, sir. We’d been investigating a new gang on assignment from Captain Dobbs, sir. Rumors of these ‘Feral’ people running around, causing extreme violence. Vanessa Bell was killed in this manner, as was John Paul Young. As was Felicity Allen and David-“

“Yeah, yeah, I know the names. I know the names. Gang murders, all of them. And to my knowledge that’s what you two were supposed to be investigating, was it not? Then you - what, exactly? Got an assignment from the fuckin’ Vatican?” He stormed over to the door and leaned out and said, “Dobbs! Get your ass in here!!”

“Sir,” Mackey said, as the Chief returned to his desk. “We don’t believe we have actual vampires in the streets either. But the fact remains that these Ferals *are* out there, right in the Projects.”

“And have you *seen* any of these so-called ‘Ferals?’” Seales said. 

“Not - not directly, no, sir. But the Easies have gone into hiding. Same with MS-13. Same with the Devils. Same with Davon Hall’s men *and* Damarcus Manning’s sellers. We need to find out why.”

“So our corners are clean for the first time since the dawn of man, and this is a bad thing? You been raiding the evidence stash, Roland? If this new gang is doing our job for us then I’ll just hire their asses and kick you two morons to the curb!”

“The corners are clean of the known entities, sir, but these new things need to be dealt with,” I said. “I have a man on the street who says Winston Harlowe might be involved in the violence, so we-“

“Winston Harlowe?!” He cut me off. 

“Yes, sir,” Mack said. “We don’t know anything yet. We just need you to clear us for surveillance, and-“

“Denied.”

“You wanted to see me, sir?” Dobbs said. I turned around to see the Captain hanging cautiously behind the wall, barely peeking in so as to avoid the crossfire. 

“I said get your ass in here, Dobbs, not stick your neck in.” When Dobbs had shut the door behind him Seales continued. “So, *Captain.* Today I come into my office and I have two detective of yours who tell that while Nichols and Abrams and White and Short and Payton and McDonald are all out solving murders and burglaries and drug deals, you’ve got these two running hunting *vampires.* Can you believe that? And earlier today I get that Dennis Donovan asshole pestering me about some plea deal crap with Davon Hall, because lord knows we could all use a nice *fucking lawsuit for the holidays!*”

“Sir, I-“

“Oh! Oh, and get this - *now* they’re telling me that some streetside dope fiend has implicated one Mister Winston Harlowe in the tragic, tragic gang violence that’s terrorizing our poor citizens.” He put a sarcastic hand to his heart. 

“Sir, all we said was want to talk to the man,” Mackey said. “We just-“

But Seales cut him off. “This recent surge in crime has driven off guess what percentage of our middle class citizens to the suburbs in the last five years? Huh?”

“I don’t know, sir.”

“Five percent? Eight percent? Ten? Anybody?” He searched around the room for an answer that didn’t come. Then he leaned down on his desk. “The answer, gentlemen, is fifteen. *Fifteen percent.* Add to that an additional eight from the Heights and the resulting commercial decline and you’ve got a mayor who’s missing so much of his tax base that the city’s finest is *begging* for scraps *and* being screamed at to do a damn thing about it.”

“Sir-“

“But then along comes Winston Harlowe!” He said, cutting Mack off this time and walking slow laps around his office. “A man with deep pockets and a love of justice. And he offers to bankroll the force. So now the government can funnel what it needs into schools and roads and whatever else and *we still get paid.*” He’d returned to his desk now and leaned on his knuckles while standing. “You like getting paid, Captain Dobbs?”

“Yes, sir, I do.”

“You like getting paid, Detective Mackey?”

“Yes, sir.”

“You like getting paid, Detective Davis?”

“...Yes, sir.”

“Good! Cause I like getting paid too. And in fact I like getting paid *so much* that Mister Winston Harlowe would have to have quite the *fucking rap sheet* for me to go barking up that tree. We lose Harlowe and the only three officers the precinct can afford to have on the force will be rounding up gangbangers on *fucking horseback!!*” He breathed then, and stood up tall and straightened his tie. “Now. The streets are clean,” he said. “If the people come back home to roost as a result and the city’s coffers lose their cobwebs, *then* we can go *where the facts may lead us.* But until we no longer need Winston Harlowe I don’t want to hear another word about him, and I don’t want to hear another word about werewolves and boogeymen or anything else that will *embarrass my ass with the mayor’s office* or knock our clearance rate into the dirt. Is that clear?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Yes, sir.”

“The budget for the Harlowe case just hit zero, gentlemen. Get back to work.” The Chief put his reading glasses on and went back to his files, and we left the office in a line. Dobbs stormed off immediately, and once the door was shut and we were in the clear Mack leaned in and he said, under his breath, “We’re not done, are we?”

“No. But we need [proof.”](https://m.facebook.com/thejesseclarknosleep/)

,nosleep,"There was a canvas-muffled *thump* as Captain Dobbs knocked on the cubicle wall. “Hey.”

Mackey and I turned around. “Hey, Dobbs.”

“Either of you two know about any new street gangs in the area?”

“New street gangs?” Mackey said. He shot me a look and pursed his lips. “Not really. MS-13, Easies, Devils. Who else we got? Handful of dope-slingin’ ops in the Projects. Same old.’”

Dobbs looked unsatisfied. “Huh. Just we keep hearin’ about some new group on the streets. *Ferals,* they call ‘em. Hyper violent. Started off near the Heights, weirdly. Now we got reports of attacks comin’ in from all over the Projects. Apparently the Mayor’s asked the Chief to look into it directly.”

“Heard something about it on the news last night,” I said. “Some kind of new gang’s got the other freaks in hiding. New turf war in the works?”

“Not from what we can tell. Bump in homicides, but they don’t seem to be targeting any one group in particular.”

“Serious?” Mackey said. “Bump in homicides with the other gangs on the down low? So this one group’s making up for all the other guys?”

“More than making up for ‘em.”

“And we're sure it’s not one guy?”

“Positive. Killings are happening at the same time, opposite ends of the neighborhood. All similar enough to be connected, but they don’t match the M.O of any known entities. What was the murder you were on yesterday, Ethan?”

“Uh, Vanessa Bell,” I said. “Dancer down at Lucky’s. Found her all fucked up in her kitchen. Had two puncture wounds right here.” I tapped my neck just below the jaw. 

“Huh. You clear that one?”

“Nah, still open. Found a text to her from Davon Hall, so last night we paid him a visit and dragged his ass in here.”

“And?”

“Wasn't him. He was actually surprised to find out she’d died.”

“So what was up with the text?”

“Booty call, wasn’t it?” Mackey said. 

“Yeah. Apparently he’d been fucking her and left a few hours before we got the call. Had no idea it’d happened till I showed him the picture, though.”

“How’d he take it?”

“Guy was scared shitless, Cap. Said ‘can’t tell you who did it man. They’ll do it to me.’ Matter of fact when we cuffed him he almost looked relieved it was the PD and not… whoever else.”

“Shit. Who do we got on our hands that could put the fear of the Lord into *Davon Hall?*” He trailed off for a bit before adding, “Where is he now?”

“Had nothing on him. Donovan picked him up.”

“Dennis Donovan? Guy’s a schmuck. Anyway. You two work on this, will ya? I wanna know who these freaks are. Ask around in the Projects.” He turned to walk off, but he paused then, and turned back around to our cubicle. “And…  don’t tell the Chief you’re lookin’ into this.”

I blinked. “I thought Mayor Carver asked him to handle it-?”

Dobbs looked around the rest of the precinct, and then leaned in and whispered, “He did, its just - I overheard it. I wasn’t tasked on this, you know? You know how Seales gets when he finds out we’re ‘wastin’ money on unauthorized investigations,’ blah blah blah.”

Mackey and I looked at each other. Then we turned back to Dobbs, and Mackey said, “Sure, Cap. Keep it on the DL. No problem.”

—

“Ayy, man!” Hopps said. He stepped up and hugged me. 

“Hopps, buddy. How you doin?”

“Same old, man. Same old. Thought you forgot about me.”

“Couldn’t forget about you if I tried. This is Mackey, by the way. My partner.”

“Hey, Hopps.” 

“Yo.” Hopps said. He ignored Mack’s outstretched hand and turned back to me. “So you got my loot?”

I handed him his bag. “Black and milds, a forty and a ham and cheese six inch from Sub Shack.” He grabbed it from me and sat down in the grass and unloaded his food. Then I said, “So! You got *my* loot?”

He unwrapped his sandwich and took a bite. “That’s good shit there, my man,” he said. “Got that double meat too. I’m about that double meat.”

“Come on, Hopps. I scratch your back, you scratch mine.” Mack and I sat down on either side of the man while he ate. “You heard about any new gangs lately? Any group called ‘Ferals, by any chance?”

Hopps took another bite. “Shit, everyone round here knows about the Ferals. Freaks be poundin’ on Darmarcus Manning’s boys *and* Davon Hall’s boys. Plus they scared off all them other gangs into hidin.’ Least during the night time that is.”

“Why night time?” Mack said.

“Cause these Ferals only be comin’ out at night. So you still gots them corner niggas sellin’ dope durin’ the day, but at night? Even the hardest of ‘em snuffs the lights and lock the doors.”

“And that’s when these new guys - the ‘Ferals’ - come through?”

“Yeah,” he said. And he took another bite. “And any corner niggas who ain’t be hidin’ usually get they asses killed. An’ you know it was the new boys who do it too - cause when you *do* find the bodies they’s always got two big ass holes right here,” he said. And he tapped his neck twice below the jaw. I looked at Mackey, and he looked at me, and we shared the same intuition. *Vanessa Bell.* 

“Have the big guys taken their boys off the block?” Mackey said. 

“Couldn’t tell you that, man. Alls I know is there be less an’ less niggas sellin’ even durin’ the day. Not worth the risk I guess. Makes it hard for a brother to cop out here in the conditions, you know?”

“Well we can’t help you there, Hopps.”

“I know, I know. I’m just sayin’ on behalf of a friend of mine. Says its tough to score.”

“And these new guys - these *Ferals* - what’s their deal? Do they sell? Any word on who’s involved, who how you get in the group, or-?”

But Hopps was shaking his head long before I finished. “Nah, you got it all wrong, man,” he said. “These boys ain’t about taggin’ signs or ownin’ corners or gettin’ in on the heroin connect. Y’all probably need a word for ‘em other than ‘gang,’ you know? Cause they just be out for blood. Ain’t nobody knows why, neither. But I seen ‘em in person. Feral dude got these red-ass eyes, man. Big, dumb expression on his face too. Saw a corner nigga try to pop a cap in his head but he missed and that thing just *tore into him.* I just ran.”

Mackey and I exchanged a worried glance. Then I said, “So nobody knows where they came from? Or what their deal is?”

Hopps lit up a cigarette and puffed on it for a bit, before putting the lighter on the grass. “You ain’t hear this from me, a’ight? But some niggas be sayin’ some rich-ass white boy that just moved into the Heights is behind it all, someway, somehow. And another thing, man - they be sayin’ them Ferals ain’t normal folks at all. They sayin’ they be straight up blood-suckers.”

—

“Vampires?” Dobbs said. He laughed once, sharply.

“That’s what he said, yes sir.” 

“Vampires. Like uh, what was that Hugh Jackman movie. Van Halen?”

“Van Helsing,” Mackey said. “And Hugh Jackman was a vampire hunter.”

Dobbs laughed mightily at the thought. “Well get him down here then!” And he stepped outside his office and shouted into the bullpen, “Hey anyone got Hugh Jackman’s number? Abrams, you got Hugh Jackman’s number?” Abrams showed him the middle finger, and Dobbs laughed even harder. “Vampires, man. That’s good. That’s new.” He sat back down and his monstrous weight pushed the chair to within an inch of the carpet. “So uh… why vampires, exactly?”

Mackey shrugged. “Makes sense if you’re dumb, right? He said the freaks come out at night. Don’t care about drugs or signs or money. They just kill.”

“You know what it probably is?” Dobbs said, through a mouthful of danish. “Same old gangs, worrying the cops are getting too close to the wallet. So they shake it up to distract us. That’s all we got. Ambitious new banger in charge. It was probably Hall all along who killed that Bell chick. Organized a hit when he found out she was sleeping around behind his back.”

“Vanessa Bell wasn’t shot, Cap,” I said back. “That’s the thing. She wasn’t shot or stabbed. She was so fucked up I would’ve guessed someone ran her over in a truck, if we hadn’t found her in her kitchen. And now that I’m thinking about it, she did have those two puncture wounds in her neck. Remember?”

“You were serious about that?” Dobbs said, suddenly having lost his smile. I took out my phone and flipped to the picture of the deceased Miss Bell, and I showed it to Dobbs. “Huh,” he said. And he took another bite of his danish. “So… what are you thinking, then? You guys think we have actual werewolves in town?”

“Vampires,” Mackey said. “And no, we don’t. But we’ve got somethin. Probably just a few eccentrics. You know how kids are, especially when they’re hopped up on whatever new drug’s the rage. But they’re dangerous, Cap.”

The Captain leaned back and drummed a beat on the desktop with his fingers. “And he said this stuff is coming down from the Heights?”

“Yes, sir. Every night. Said something about a guy who just moved into that neighborhood. Might know something.”

“Huh. The hell are those rich bastards up to?” And trailed off for a bit, lost in thought. Then he snapped out of it. “Anyway. That’s for tomorrow, gentlemen. You guys ready?”And he stood up and grabbed his jacket and his keys. 

“For-?”

“Benefit tonight. Remember? We sent out the memo a week ago.”

“Didn’t read it.”

“Yeah, well it’s mandatory. Some new guy’s supposedly a big friend of the badge, so the Chief’s throwing some kind of crackers and cheese thing at the Hall.” He paused at the door and said, “Hey, this guy’s new in the Heights. Maybe he’s your Count Dracula.” And he laughed and headed towards the elevator. 

—

“So without further ado,” Chief Seales said, “Let’s give a warm welcome to Mister Winston Harlowe!”

The room broke out into polite applause, and Seales handed the microphone over to a tall and well groomed man in his early to mid sixties. He stepped into the center of the room. 

“Thank you!” He said, in a slightly diluted European accent I couldn't quite place. “Its wonderful to be here among the town’s finest in one of *the* finest towns I’ve yet visited or done business in. The way I see things, if you men and women are putting your lives on the line to keep men like myself safe, then the least I can do is make sure you’ve got the resources you need to do your jobs well.” He looked over the gold-plated Donor’s plaque that’d been handed to him. “It is an honor and a privilege to accept this award and be a part of this community, and I’m very much looking forward to working with law enforcement further. Thank you all very, very much.”

The room applauded again and drank in unison, and the music and the mingling began. When it did, Mack leaned into me and said “Yeah, I don’t trust that dude as far as I can throw ‘em.”

—

“Hey, Ethan!” Dobbs said. “Roland! Get over here!”

I turned around. The Captain had been chatting up Mr. Harlowe for some time when he called Mack and I over. 

“This is Ethan Davis and Roland Mackey - the two guys I put on that new gang case. Hey, hey - tell Mister Harlowe what that guy said earlier. ‘Bout the vampires.” He lightly tapped Harlowe’s arm with the back of his hand. “Gotta hear this.”

“Uh, hi.” I said, and I shook the man’s hand after Mack. “Thank you for all his, sir. The support.”

“Of course, of course. What’s all this about *vampres?* Sounds quite intriguing.”

“Uh, well. Its an ongoing case, so we probably shouldn’t-”

“Oh, come on!” Dobbs said, but when he realized he wouldn’t get more out of us he added, “Alright, *I’ll* tell it, then. So these two guys come into my office, right? And say one of their dopehead buddies says there are *vampires* on the streets. I just got a kick out of that.”

Dobbs started giggling again, but Harlowe just kept his grin and took a sip from his cup. “Perhaps I’ve picked the wrong town after all.” And we shared an uncomfortable laugh.

“And it’s startin’ up in the Heights, ain’t it?” said Dobbs. “Maybe he’s your guy.” And he threw his thumb in the direction of Harlowe and laughed heartily. 

Harlowe smiled just a bit wider, but the intent behind it was impossible to read. He simply said, “I’ll let you know what I hear.” And off he went to mingle with the rest of the precinct. 

When he was gone I said, “Dobbs, what the hell?”

“What?”

Mack said, “Why would you let loose about the case like that? You don’t know who that guy is.”

“Fellas, c'mon here. Are we seriously referring to this ‘vampires’ thing as a *case?* Far as I’m concerned we’re still at square one on that.”

“Dobbs, its just-“

“Hey, Ethan,” White said, having walked up to the three of us from behind. “Roland, Dobbs. You too.”

“What’s up?”

“Your boy just turned himself in.”

“Who?”

“Hall.”

—

“Davon Hall,” Dobbs said. He shut the door of the interrogation room behind the three of us. “What brings you here tonight? Shouldn’t you be out uh, jackin’ cars, or some shit?”

“What you think this is, fatass? *Grand Theft Auto?*”

“Easy,” I said. I turned to Dobbs. “Let me and Mack take this. Davon and I have a thing.”

“Fuck you.”

“See?”

“Alright,” Dobbs said. “Keep me in the loop.” And he shut the door again and left Mackey and I alone with our guest. There were no handcuffs this time. 

“So!” Mackey said. “Guy’s a trip but that question was valid, Hall. Why *are* you here?”

I offered him a cigarette, but he waved me off. “We cleared you in the Bell murder,” I said. “Nothin’ on the books against your name at the moment. And yet here you are.”

“Here I am. With the pig who broke my car windows and a black Uncle Tom motherfucker.”

“Uncle Tom!” Mack said. “Wow. Haven’t been called that since middle school. A point for creativity. Minus ten for being stupid enough to walk your ass in here on your own volition.”

“Stop wasting our time, Hall,” I said. “Why’d you turn yourself in?”

“Cause I did some bad shit. I run a gang, ain’t you heard? Whole package, man. So throw me in the can, nigga. I ain’t goin nowhere.”

“No lawyer this time?”

“Don’t know I’m here.”

“Lets keep it that w-,“ Mackey began, but I cut him off. 

“Are you hiding from someone?” I said. And there was a pause. Mackey looked at me, and then at Hall. Hall just looked at his hands. 

“Maybe,” he said. “What of it?”

I leaned back and crossed my arms. “So let me get this straight. You’re on the run from someone, and you come here, of all places? Why? To spend a night in the joint? What about your boys?”

“They on the run too, dawg. Ones who are left, anyway.”

“You don’t have a girl you could crash with?” Mackey said. 

“Y’all know what happened to Bell.”

“Guy like you only fucks one girl at a time?”

“Man’s gotta have a code.”

Mack scoffed. “And you got no out of town hook ups?”

“Nah, man. Here or the gutter. Just where I’m at right now; brother’s gotta survive someway, somehow.” He looked at both of us in turn. “So? You gonna lock me up or what?”

“Who’re you on the run from, Hall?” I said. 

“Man I told you last time I can’t tell you that. You wasn’t listenin?’”

But we didn’t budge. “If you want our services,” Mackey said, “then you better start talking.”

And Hall looked at his hands again and sighed. “A’ight. A’ight, its a guy named Ruth.”

“Ruth?” I asked. “And what’s Ruth’s deal?”

Hall wiped his nose with his hand and said, “Some dude who offered to help me clear the Ferals, man. So he said.”

“You guys been gettin’ hit hard by them? The Ferals, I mean?”

“Hell yeah, man. Them motherfuckers is vicious. First they be attackin’ Damarcus Manning’s boys, cause he owns the corners closest to the Heights where they be comin’ from, right? An’ I’m like, ‘Yo, enemy of my enemy is my friend.’ Maybe I can meet these new boys. Strike some kinda deal.”

“But then they started hittin’ your crew.”

Hall shook his head. “Came outta nowhere. man, you feel me? Everything from Charter to Block. Those were my niggas out there. We owned that shit. Then these new freaks shows up.  Beatin’ on my boys. Killin’ ‘em.” There was a pause before he added, “An’ they got Bell, man. She didn’t deserve to go like that, you know?”

“So how does Ruth fit in?”

“My boy down at the docks calls me up an’ he’s all, ‘Yo, I’m supposed to set a meet wit’ you an’ this dude Ruth. Wants to get paid to take out the Ferals’ for you. An’ he tells me the where an’ the when, and-”

“Why didn’t you try to handle the Ferals yourself?” I said. 

“We tried, man! Went out there to shoot, found some of ‘em - blood all over they mouth, man, snarlin’ an’ hissin’ like they be rabid. Sharp-ass teeth, too, and they just straight-up killed my boy Checkers.”

“Checkers?!” Mackey said, and he laughed. “You ran with a nigga named Checkers? Shit back in my day we had-”

“Ay, *fuck* you, man!” Hall snapped. “Y’all makin’ light o’ my boy then I ain’t tellin’ y’all a damn thing else. Fuck outta here.”

“Come on, Mack,” I said. “Apologize to the man.”

“Yeah, apologize, *Mack.” Kiss my ass.”

“Alright! Alright. A forty poured out on your boy’s marble. Can we keep this moving?”

“Whatever, man.”

“So, Checkers is dead. Ruth says he can handle them. What then? Why are you running from him?”

“Cause, man. I get down to the Dock Irons, right? An’ I meet my boy there an’ he takes me to Ruth. So I talk to him, an’ this Russian dude says he can take out the Ferals for me, an’ lays out his terms.”

“Which were?”

“Man ain’t after a paycheck. Dude wants to be paid in ‘favors.’”

“Favors? Seriously?”

“Yeah, man! An’ I’m all yo, what kinda mafia-ass bullshit is this? And I walk.”

“I’m guessing that wasn’t the end of it.”

“Nah, man. First my boy at the Dock Irons be callin’ me like, ‘yo, you need to work things out with Ruth or our whole deal is dead, you know?’ And when I ignored his ass that’s when Ruth started comin’ after me. An’ this dude, man - I saw him just destroy my boy Flitch like it weren’t nothin.’”

Under his breath Mackey snorted and said, *”Flitch.* Gotta be kiddin’ me.” But Hall either ignored him or didn’t hear. 

“An’ like, I didn’t know how to fix it, you know? So I ran, and -”

“And now you’re here,” I said. 

“Yeah. Now I’m here. And that’s what I know, too. So y’all gonna hook a brother up with a cot? Or what?”

Mackey and I looked at each other. Then we turned back to Hall. “Not yet,” Mackey said. 

“Your boy at the Dock Irons,” I said. “Tell us about him.”

—

“You have the right to remain silent,” Officer White said, as Bill Vietch was led out of the Union House in bracelets. “Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. Do you understand the rights I have just read to you? With these rights in mind, do you wish to speak to me?”

Veech didn’t speak at first, so I did. “I’ll be honest, Veech. We’re here as part of a bigger investigation. Anything you’ve got that can help us out will go a long way to getting these sentences reduced.”

There was a tear that rolled down his cheek. “I’m not givin’ up no Union guys,” he said. 
“So don’t ask.”

“We’re not after your Union, Veech,” Mack said, as the man was dipped into the cruiser, and as the cruiser peeled off for the station. Dobbs - who’d parked his ride only moments earlier - walked up to us and threw his thumb over his shoulder in the direction of the warehouse that’d been freshly raided for heroin. A handful of other longshoremen were being Mirandized themselves over by the piles of it. 

“Never thought I’d see the day,” he said. “Bill “the Veech” Veitch goes down in flames. It must be Christmas.”

“Yeah, you can thank one mister Davon Hall for that,” Mack said. “Man sang like a canary.” 

“Serious?”

“Yessir. Came in looking for witness protection, and agreed to testify against his supplier.”

“Veech was his guy? No shit.”

“Not exactly,” I said. “Apparently Hall’s got a connect out of town, but Veech moves in the product through the docks in exchange for a cut.”

“This is huge, guys,” Dobbs said, biting a cigar. He lit it and puffed and pocketed his lighter. “I mean this is *huge.* You guys gunnin’ for my job, or something?” We shared a laugh. “Seriously, though. Damn fine Police work. Chief just might warm up to the case if we hand him this.”

“Well we’re not done yet.”

---

“William Milhouse Veitch,” Barbara said. The attorney took her seat between myself and Mackey, and pulled out a file. “Let’s run through the charges delivered to the D.A.’s office. Money laundering. Smuggling. Drug trafficking. Racketeering. Extortion. The list goes o-” 

“Let’s discuss the deal, first, shall we?” Dennis Donovan said, from the other side of the table. “My client has agreed to cooperate fully with the prosecutor in exchange for a reduction of charges and the immunity of other members of his crew. Do all parties agree to the current arrangement?”

“We’re on the same page,” Barbara said. “But the number of years we can shave off his sentence will reflect the *extent* of his cooperation. What he knows. What he’s willing to trade. As it stands he’s looking at twenty years, minimum.” 

Veech shut his eyes and lowered his head. After a minute, he nodded. 

“So!” Barbara said. “Way we understand it, Mr. Veitch here has spent the better part of the last decade smuggling heroin for one Mr. Davon Anderson Hall, a local dealer, in exchange for a cut of, what was it, Veich? Ten percent of the profits?”

“Twelve and a half.”

“Twelve five. And earlier this evening we managed to uncover an extensive amount of illegal narcotics from the Dock Irons warehouse. Ten other longshoremen have been indicted. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were also found in a safe deposit box in the back of the building.”

“Let ‘em go,” Veech said. “Please, just let those guys go. This is on me.”

“They were involved too,” Mackey said. “Shouldn’t they see their day in court?”

“They were desperate!” Veech said. “Burtowski, Adams, Freamon - all those guys. A list ones were workin’ *maybe* a week a month ever since the canal opened and cut around us. Lower level men? They were getting called up less than half that amount of time.”

“And that’s supposed to excuse the extensive smuggling of schedule one narcotics into the city?” Barbara said. “If they-”

“Well *you* try makin’ it on three days a month!” He cut her off. “Less than two hundred for an honest fuckin’ day’s work! These guys got kids! They got wives! They got mortgages, and loan payments! They come to me every day and they say, ‘Veech, we’re dying out here. My car’s dead in the shop. I gotta make my cousin’s bail. My kid needs a doctor. Please, Veech. You gotta do somethin!’ The hell was I supposed to do? This precious fuckin’ town of ours left these men out to rot. They had *no one* to turn to when the ships stopped coming.’” 

“My client,” Donovan said, “is obviously emotional after today’s unfortunate events. He’s clearly not trying to *justify* the presence of those warehouse drugs.”

“So who approached who?” I asked. “Did Hall come to you? Did you go to Hall?”

“I don’t remember all the details. It was years ago and its been a quiet arrangement ever since.”

“And a lucrative one,” Mack said, off-handedly. 

“Listen, it was a mutual arrangement. I don’t remember who approached who, but we both shook hands on it so who gives a fuck?” 

“And who ships the drugs in?” Mack asked. “We know you unload it. We know Hall sells it and I’m guessing you take your twelve and a half out of whatever else he gives you that you send back to the connect. Who would that be?”

“I don’t know the name of the guy,” Veech said. “And that’s the truth. I deal with a guy who deals with a guy, if you know what I mean. Handles things real close to the chest.”

“Do you at least have documents of the transactions?” I said. 

“Fuck no. But I can give you the address I last sent the cash to. Some place in Hungary, or some shit.”

“Is it different from where payments normally went?”

“Changed every time.”

“How often did these transactions take place?”

“Varied. Hall would tell my guys when he needed a re-up. They’d tell me. I’d have my guy call whatever burner number I’d gotten along with the new mailbox, and tell ‘em what we needed and how much, and they’d hang up. Never once heard anyone on the other line. Then - a few weeks later, we’d get a ship in, unload the cans like normal, and whatever inside guy they had on deck would speak to me on the DL under the guise of me signing for the cargo, and he’d give me a new address to remit payment to and a new number to call for re-ups. And so it went, for years.”

I looked at Mackey. “We get that address, you think it’d take us to the ringleader?”

He shook his head and pursed his lips. “Probably not. Saw a case like this back in ‘07. We traced the money. Places were dead drops. Some guy picks it up there, sends it somewhere else, they do the same. On and on. Probably three or four stops minimum before it lands in whatever offshore account is running the show. And like he said, they change it up every time.”

“And when he was testifying himself,” I said, turning back to Veech, “Davon Hall mentioned that ‘his guy at the Docks’ - you, I’m guessing - had arranged a meet with someone he claimed was possibly affiliated with organized crime in Eastern Europe. Claimed you’d approached him with the deal in which that contact - thus far unidentified - had arranged to clear what are being called ‘Ferals’ from the streets of the Projects here in town, in exchange for favors.”

“You guys talked to Hall?”

“Says so in your warrant. Is his recalling of events accurate?”

“Far as I know. I had nothin’ to do with whatever deal they’d set up. I just set the meet. And I heard about these Ferals, too. Nasty fuckers, wreaking havoc all around town. Figured the guy who wanted to meet Hall - some feller named Ruth, if I remember - was workin’ with Hall’s connect across the pond and was inquiring about the dip in sales as a result of those Feral things. But I didn’t get involved further than that.”

“And did you know anything about the murder of Vanessa Bell?” I asked. 

“Heard about it. Hall’s chick, right?”

I nodded. 

“Yeah, doesn’t surprise me. That Russian guy and his buddies - whoever they are - man, they’re vicious. Not sure if this’ll help me at all, but about two years ago I wanted out. I’d made my money. My guys had made their money. So after a close call with the Feds I call Hall and the burner contact and tell ‘em to find another way to get drugs back and forth. And I hang up. Hall calls me up all day long. I ignore his calls, so he sent one of his fuckin’ crackhead bangers down to the docks to intimidate me. Doesn’t. I tell him to fuck off. Had my boys get up in his face. Guy pissed his pants and ran.”

“And yet the deal remained in place for two more years.”

“Yeah. That Ruth guy showed up. In my house, later that night. Made it real clear I was either playing his game or I was a loose end.” He paused for a bit and looked at his feet. Then he said, “Can’t really explain it. But he just got in my head, you know? Normally I’d knock that fucker out but I just… couldn’t. I was too scared. Like, *paralyzed* scared. So I just nodded and *yessir’d* and *no sir’d* him until he left. Never thought twice about backin’ out of the deal since then. So when he showed up in my house again lookin’ for Hall the other day, I didn’t ask why. I set the meet.”

“And all he wanted was to facilitate the drug trade in a mid-sized town? Seems like a huge amount of effort to go through for what can’t possibly be much in the way of profits.”

“Yeah,” Veech said. “Listen. They may have had us smuggle somethin’ other than dope, you know?” Mack and I and Barbara exchanged glances and leaned in. Even Donovan stopped rubbing his forehead and looked at his client. “Few months back. We got a crate, right? And its movin.’ Like there’s an animal inside there. An’ no matter how scared I am of Ruth there ain’t no way I’m moving any living shit other than plants. Normally I operate under a policy called ‘I don’t fucking wanna know.’ But I draw the line at human trafficking. Anyway. We bust the thing open. There was another crate inside, and a man inside that, thrashing around. Snapping and hissing. Literally chewing on the wood of the thing, I kid you not. Just *gnawing* on it.”

“A Feral,” I said. “What did you do?”

“Boxed it back up and moved it along, sad to say. Thing scared the shit out of me, though. Eyes red as blood.”

---

“Hey, Hopps!” I said. I dangled a bag of fast food from the window, and the man made his way down from his stoop to the car after sloppily stashing away his pipe. 

“Ethan, my man! What you got for me today?”

“Two burgers, fries, and a slice of that turtle pie. Fork’s in the bag with a can of diet. All yours *if* you help us find a guy by the name of Ruth.”

Hopps stopped in his tracks, and his grin vanished. “Yo, what you doin’ droppin’ that name out in the open, man? Gonna get a brother killed just for hearin’ it.”

“Well there’s nobody around, Hopps. You’re safe.”

“Yeah, I don’t know about that. That boy’s network runnin’ real deep and tight in the Projects. Like I said before, man, you ain’t any street wiser than a rock.”

“Well you’ll have to teach me your wisdom at a later date.”

“You might be beyond my expertise, know what I’m sayin? Besides, dirt on a man like that’s worth a whole lot more than a cheeseburger.”

“Well how about a cheeseburger *and* we don’t haul your ass downtown for possession?” Mack said. I shot him a look and smacked him in the shoulder with the back of my hand. He shrugged.

“Well the way these streets be at night with them Ferals I’d actually prefer that, man, you know? Besides, word is Davon Hall hisself came to ya’ll for protection and he be alive in some safehouse somewhere when his boys is anything but. That’s what he got for his knowledge. I just got a fuckin’ burger?”

“Easy, both of you. Okay?” I fished out a $50 from my wallet and handed it to Hopps. “Here. Burger and a $50. I’ll see if we can’t work in some kind of protection deal too, if you think you need it. So what do you say? Can you help me out?”

“Alright, man.” He stashed the bill in his pocket. “Alright. For *you.* Not for that Uncle Tom lookin’ motherfucker.”

“Again with this Uncle Tom line?” Mack said. “Am I the only black cop in America now? Damn.”

“I’ll make sure Mackey behaves himself.” I smiled at him and he gave me the finger. Then I turned back to Hopps. “So what do you got for me? Anything helps.”

“Word is that Ruth guy be runnin’ the show now that the gangs be out the way,” he said. 

“Yeah, we might’ve heard something about him bringing a Feral into town through the Docks. But we don’t know if there was any more than the one.”

“Only need one, man,” Hopps said. “Ferals make Ferals. Assumin’ they leave somethin’ behind to rise up and be one of them.”

“Rise up?”

“Yeah, man. When Ferals kill a brother the brother turns into one. Then you got two Ferals. Seen it happen with my own eyes. Shit was terrifyin.’”

“You saw him literally rise up from the grave?”

“Nah, man. But I saw him gettin’ feasted on by one of them things, and I ran. Two nights later I saw him *as* one of them things. Know what I mean? That’s how they be spreadin.’”

“And have you seen him since?”

“Nah. Thank God, too, know what I mean? But word is these new boys is clearin’ ‘em. Probably workin’ for Ruth, or Harlowe, or somethin.’”

“Wait… Harlowe?” Mack said. He shot me a look and then leaned closer towards my window. “Winston Harlowe?”

“Yeah. That’s who they say Ruth is workin’ for, anyhow. They say he’s like Count Dracula, or somethin,’ like Chief bloodsucker behind all this mess. But its all he-said-she-said rumor at this stage, far as I know. And even if its true, though, you know, a rich ass white boy like that? Ya’ll ain’t never gonna catch in the same room as his own shit.”

---

“You wanted to see us, sir?” 

“Vampires?” Chief Seales said from his desk. He found much less humor in the idea than Dobbs. 

Mackey and I stepped in and shut the door behind us. Then I said, “Yes, sir. We’d been investigating a new gang on assignment from Captain Dobbs, sir. Rumors of these ‘Feral’ people running around, causing extreme violence. Vanessa Bell was killed in this manner, as was John Paul Young. As was Felicity Allen and David-“

“Yeah, yeah, I know the names. I know the names. Gang murders, all of them. And to my knowledge that’s what you two were supposed to be investigating, was it not? Then you - what, exactly? Got an assignment from the fuckin’ Vatican?” He stormed over to the door and leaned out and said, “Dobbs! Get your ass in here!!”

“Sir,” Mackey said, as the Chief returned to his desk. “We don’t believe we have actual vampires in the streets either. But the fact remains that these Ferals *are* out there, right in the Projects.”

“And have you *seen* any of these so-called ‘Ferals?’” Seales said. 

“Not - not directly, no, sir. But the Easies have gone into hiding. Same with MS-13. Same with the Devils. Same with Davon Hall’s men *and* Damarcus Manning’s sellers. We need to find out why.”

“So our corners are clean for the first time since the dawn of man, and this is a bad thing? You been raiding the evidence stash, Roland? If this new gang is doing our job for us then I’ll just hire their asses and kick you two morons to the curb!”

“The corners are clean of the known entities, sir, but these new things need to be dealt with,” I said. “I have a man on the street who says Winston Harlowe might be involved in the violence, so we-“

“Winston Harlowe?!” He cut me off. 

“Yes, sir,” Mack said. “We don’t know anything yet. We just need you to clear us for surveillance, and-“

“Denied.”

“You wanted to see me, sir?” Dobbs said. I turned around to see the Captain hanging cautiously behind the wall, barely peeking in so as to avoid the crossfire. 

“I said get your ass in here, Dobbs, not stick your neck in.” When Dobbs had shut the door behind him Seales continued. “So, *Captain.* Today I come into my office and I have two detective of yours who tell that while Nichols and Abrams and White and Short and Payton and McDonald are all out solving murders and burglaries and drug deals, you’ve got these two running hunting *vampires.* Can you believe that? And earlier today I get that Dennis Donovan asshole pestering me about some plea deal crap with Davon Hall, because lord knows we could all use a nice *fucking lawsuit for the holidays!*”

“Sir, I-“

“Oh! Oh, and get this - *now* they’re telling me that some streetside dope fiend has implicated one Mister Winston Harlowe in the tragic, tragic gang violence that’s terrorizing our poor citizens.” He put a sarcastic hand to his heart. 

“Sir, all we said was want to talk to the man,” Mackey said. “We just-“

But Seales cut him off. “This recent surge in crime has driven off guess what percentage of our middle class citizens to the suburbs in the last five years? Huh?”

“I don’t know, sir.”

“Five percent? Eight percent? Ten? Anybody?” He searched around the room for an answer that didn’t come. Then he leaned down on his desk. “The answer, gentlemen, is fifteen. *Fifteen percent.* Add to that an additional eight from the Heights and the resulting commercial decline and you’ve got a mayor who’s missing so much of his tax base that the city’s finest is *begging* for scraps *and* being screamed at to do a damn thing about it.”

“Sir-“

“But then along comes Winston Harlowe!” He said, cutting Mack off this time and walking slow laps around his office. “A man with deep pockets and a love of justice. And he offers to bankroll the force. So now the government can funnel what it needs into schools and roads and whatever else and *we still get paid.*” He’d returned to his desk now and leaned on his knuckles while standing. “You like getting paid, Captain Dobbs?”

“Yes, sir, I do.”

“You like getting paid, Detective Mackey?”

“Yes, sir.”

“You like getting paid, Detective Davis?”

“...Yes, sir.”

“Good! Cause I like getting paid too. And in fact I like getting paid *so much* that Mister Winston Harlowe would have to have quite the *fucking rap sheet* for me to go barking up that tree. We lose Harlowe and the only three officers the precinct can afford to have on the force will be rounding up gangbangers on *fucking horseback!!*” He breathed then, and stood up tall and straightened his tie. “Now. The streets are clean,” he said. “If the people come back home to roost as a result and the city’s coffers lose their cobwebs, *then* we can go *where the facts may lead us.* But until we no longer need Winston Harlowe I don’t want to hear another word about him, and I don’t want to hear another word about werewolves and boogeymen or anything else that will *embarrass my ass with the mayor’s office* or knock our clearance rate into the dirt. Is that clear?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Yes, sir.”

“The budget for the Harlowe case just hit zero, gentlemen. Get back to work.” The Chief put his reading glasses on and went back to his files, and we left the office in a line.

,webdev,"Well... I had the original idea before Vampr to make a site that would help musicians find gigs, bandmates and engineering work while allowing musicians to sell music, anybody to list their events and allowing people to sell physical albums easily.

That site is https://wavlist.co (I know, stupid name but what are you going to do to come up with a catchy name?)

I completed it around March or April and further worked on it until there was nothing that I could do to improve it due to a lack of people using the site (despite my promotional efforts, nobody used the site). I had future plans to make it more of a platform for musicians to get some serious work done which included video/audio conferencing, something similar to Snapchat/Instagram/whatever site ripped it off at the moment stories where people could promote events, mixers and opportunities and a support system where people could contact support with what problems they were having and mods would respond to it through a customized section that also did modding for the rest of the site (and some editing that didn't require code changes, just a click of a button).

I had plans to monetize the site through the usage of paying to have sponsored listings appear in a different color and given priority in specific sections, subsections and even the front page as well as having the option to extend the listing past 1 month if you paid to do it.

There was even going to be international language/country/reigon versions that were unique and a specific section for which music industry/mainstream listings would be listed.

A lot of those ideas never came to fruition due to my inability to promote the site.

What I did manage to build however is a functioning site that is not only easy to use but secure and bulletproof. Unregistered users can post listings provided they click the email activating the listing and are given a link to edit or delete the listing while registered users can post listings without having to go to their email to activate each listing and have the additional benefit of having their listings viewable from their profile, the ability to post to social networks Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr (I have accounts for Twitter and Tumblr and I can find a way to pass the Facebook developers app I created to you) and the ability to add images to listings.

Registered users can add contacts which have to be approved by the user who received the contact request and have the ability to engage in 12 person conversations (this was untested due to lack of participants, the original messaging system was designed for 2 people and a number can be set to allow for more participants.) Users can also block contacts (which prevent them from adding them as their contact and messaging them in listings) and also have the ability to customize their profile page with a bio, social media links and an avatar which also serves as the background.

Push notifications can be sent to the user's device if they enable it in settings and users have the option to disable the contacts functionality, in addition profiles can be hidden if they have no use for the profile functionality.

The entire site is designed to use Invisible reCAPTCHA and is the only site that serves as a proof of concept of Invisible reCAPTCHA's use on a mainstream site. I did a lot of coding work to make the invisible reCAPTCHA reset itself the user clicked out of the captcha and tied a lot of buttons to trigger the invisible reCAPTCHA (which was hard work due to the usage of tabs), I also modified featherlight.js' Z-index in the CSS file to both replicate the black transparent background of the lightbox and to make it so that Google's reCAPTCHA could be front and center.

The search engine was designed with describers (I don't know the proper term) in mind and a lot of work went into it to recognize what was in quotes and what wasn't as well as program the describers to filter out results based on location, description and title. There exists a refine hamburger menu sidebar to filter by section, subsection and sort by date or title. There is some untested stuff for specific sections though...

The design isn't desktop friendly but it's a one-size-fits-all design that's perfect for mobile phones and usable on Desktop devices if not a bit cumbersome. The design was clearly influenced by Android and every image relating to the interface uses SVG images so that it could work with any device size. A hamburger menu to the left provides options relating to users (links to their own listings, contacts they currently have, easy link to edit their profile, favorite listings, user profile and contains the privacy policy and terms of use while for logged-in users, an inbox button with a working notification count and AddThis functionality for the listings.

It's also AMP compatible and I did a lot of work (basically I'm using a well known open source anti-spam service) to ensure that spambots don't easily abuse that format to get information like emails and phone numbers.

Conversation messages and stuff such as email/password or both changes are encrypted in a way that allows for security but long message lengths. That and the scaling system I added for embeddable content for the web makes a lot of the code I wrote valuable even if this site doesn't work out. 

There is a lot that went to the design of what could of been a resource for musicians... However, there are some cons that I realized while reading this subreddit.

1. Heavily dependent on jQuery... I did a lot of work to make sure that my website worked with Google PageSpeed optimizations I installed for nginx. A lot of scripts were deferred and a lot of delays were added. jQuery is one of those things that impacts a pagespeed score and it's hard to defer or async or both. While working on optimizing for the pagespeed, I had to create a way to get recaptcha.js to load or unload based on which featherlight window was open (examples include creating a listing and logging in at the same time). I didn't think I would be able to create entire websites for a living (while I'm able to figure out solutions to design things I didn't think would be possible in PHP, I am never going to be a PHP master.) and my brain struggles to figure out how to create entire sites using different formats like node.js so I consider this the best I can do with the skillset that I have. You could try migrating everything to a different JS library or rewriting the site in a different format.

2. A lot of features are untested. While I did my best to code using guesswork and logic, features such as the multi-user conversations and some specialized sections are untested. I don't know what else is untested due to my knowledge of the site evaporating due to time but I don't know if it'll work and while I'm pretty sure it will work, I can't be entirely sure unless I had people to test it with.

3. A lot of third party dependence. This thing relies on reCAPTCHA (specifically the invisible one), AddThis and CKEditor for it to work. In addition it uses a node.js notification system (based on a dead tutorial that doesn't even exist anymore) as well as JWT in the API system (I built an API for the fun of it, it was hard and it doesn't exactly work due to nginx/PHP not being able to create proper JSON responses.) If you feel like you like these services, go ahead and take the plunge but I can understand if you might be worried due to these third party dependencies.

4. Requires a lot of configuration. The site is a PHP 7.1/MySQL/jQuery/sendmail/nginx site with separate servers required. (for the API, it might be possible to host it on the same server), I spent/wasted a lot of time configuring the site so that it got a good pagespeed score, felt fast and most of all worked on my 128MB VPS. To migrate this to the new owner will be hard due to the amount of configuration I did. (I also included a CRON script to delete images automatically, there was going to be more CRON scripts to automatically email users a digest if they opted in but eh.) It was hard for me due to my lack of experience, lack of growth potential and lack of patience when it comes to getting things to work but it might be easy for you, who knows...

Those are a lot of cons but I put my heart and soul into this website and it would be a shame if I just let it get deleted. Encrypted messages, invisible reCAPTCHA, the scaling system for embeddable content. There is a lot of potential and even though Vampr exists now, I still feel like there's room for a craigslist for music.

If anybody's interested, reply in the comments and I'll DM you regarding how to make this happen.

Working Ranking of r/Castlevania: 

1) Symphony of the Night

2) Aria of Sorrow

3) Order of Eccelsia  

4) Rondo of Blood
&gt;Breakdown: Rondo's support has skyrocketed it into the top 5.

5) Portrait of Ruin

6) Tie: Castlevania III &amp; IV
&gt;Breakdown: III &amp; Super Castlevania are too close to seperate. There is a slight advantage to IV, but III has more first place ranks, so it is probably more fair to leave it as a tie for now.

8) Tie: Castlevania I &amp; Dawn of Sorrow
&gt;Breakdown: Places 2-8 are all very close, with a large gap between 8 and the rest of the rankings, and an even larger gap between SotN and the rest of the top 8.

10) Bloodlines

11)Tie: Harmony of Dissonance &amp; Lords of Shadow

13) Circle of the Moon

14) Castlevania II: Simon's Quest

15) Castlevania II: Belmont's Revenge

16) Lament of Innocence

17) Tie: Lords of Shadow 2, Castlevania 64, Harmony of Despair

20) Lords of Shaddow-Mirror

21) Adventure ReBirth

22-29) ?

30) Judgement

*This is an updated version of [last month's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/5l5sf2/2016_snapshot_of_all_partially_completed/).*

A list of everything started but not finished was what I sought when I discovered the game and wanted to help. After getting to understand it all better, I made one myself.

Below is a table of every partially complete character, from those that have kisekae import codes to those that are only waiting for someone to pose the models and upload them to the game. I previously went through every post and comment on the subreddit and added the date that work was most recently observed on the character. As you can see from the tables, it's dialogue that holds us back far more than any other factor. If you're looking to help somewhere, why not find a character that you're familiar with and add some lines for her or him? (More resources for helping can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/5orz4k/welcome_newcomers_here_is_a_list_of_development/).)

As this is a snapshot, I will not be updating it with every change over the coming weeks. However, I will remove characters from here when they are released. The four characters from last month's list that were released were Leela, Korra, Jasmine, and Alice.

**Jan 30 update:** Very significant progress has been made for the dialogue on many of these characters, so I felt compelled to update this document so that it's more helpful. Any future updates will be in a February snapshot post.

Characters who have dialogue documents that you can contribute to:

,TownofSalemgame,"Okay, so... Me and a couple of friends decided to play All Any (No, we didn't give out our roles at all.)

I ended up getting the role which I kind of hated the most - **Witch.**

I was thinking that for sure I was gonna die night 1 or something.

The theme for that round was Spongebob. I was Mr Krabs.

Fastforward to the end of the game, and it was a stalemate between the Arsonist and Vampire, and I had to decide who won.

So, I asked my friends: **""Who do you think is deserving of the win?""**

I put Vampire on the stand, and they all agreed on letting the Vampre win, so I let the Vampire down from the stand, and vote up the Arsonist and lynch him, 2-0.

The poor Vampire never won a game, so I gave him the win because I felt like being a ~~bitch~~ snap crackle pop

I bet he was ~~damn~~ gee golly surprised when I chose to backstab him.

TL;DR: I let Vampire win instead of Arsonist who had helped me throughout the game.

,MinuteFrontier,"EDIT: Includes Classes added by 2/5/16 update

This table gives the stat gains by class.  It should aid in directing your level, especially if you're through picking up passive abilities.  To me there are a few interesting bits, specifically that HP is never greater than 3/level.  Additionally, some other stats have a class with a 5, though a few do not.  Brave has the highest total growth per level, with Vampire and Priest having the lowest.  Finally, I wonder if something is up with Clown.  Poor growth as an auto-moving class, but no actual abilities.

,LITTLEPERSONALS,"Hi, Im new to the world of DDLG but have been following it on tumblr for the last 6 months and its been something ive been interested in greatly.

Im 23 years old and reside in Los Angeles, Ca. Im not opposed to a LDR if its with the right person (Terrible experience previous) I have a lot of hobbies but il go into small detail about them al l. Much like the rest of the world I enjoy my video games, my favorite game will be Halo (Halo 3 specifically) followed by World of Warcraft. I play League of Legends but its out of sheer boredom lol. I do watch anime and it is a passion of mine, I plan on becoming a voice actor in both gaming and animation. That being said my favorites in their own retrospect are Dragonball Z, Fairy Tail, Code Geass, Rosario Vampre, Highschool DxD and literally tons of others. For normal tv im a big fan of Supernatural, Arrow, The Flash, The Originals, Vampire Diaries, Grimm and a few smaller ones. I play basketball when I can but that's just for exercise and the fun of it haha. I really enjoy tcg's so I try almost any of them but Magic the Gathering is by far my favorite and most devoted.

Appearance wise im 6'1 with blonde hair and blue eyes, Im a large guy but by no mean a couch potato as I am fairy active.

What im looking for in a little is someone I can talk to, be with and something permanent. Im not a fan of something that wont be for endgame because I feel as if its a waste of time. I have a thing for girls who happen to have colored hair which is at this point completely irrelevant. I would prefer if you were smaller then me so it makes stuff funner when I can pick you up with little to no effort.

If this interests you at all send me a message and we can Kik, im  not on here often but il try my best.

CASE Number: **15 KCC - 07 -**


CHARGE: **FalseHope.gif**


CHARGE: **LiarLiarPantsOnFire**



---


Welcome one and all to yet another internal case! Today, we shall bring forth /u/PastyDeath, in a hope to correct his wrong doing ways!


I give you [Exhibit Alpha](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourtBlog/comments/3d989s/i_challenge_you_pastydeath/)! A game, if you will, in order to bring our humble head editor out of the hole he's been hiding in lately. It's quite the simple challenge, a game of TicTaqToe© was to be played, by the old rules (honestly, I have no idea what the old rules are, other than you must accept a challenge, and you must play to win).


But was our dear /u/PastyDeath present? Barely! If you'll look through the challenge, you'd see he chose to respond to my challenge, accepting, but never following through with a move. [Here](http://reddit.com/r/KarmaCourtBlog/comments/3d989s/i_challenge_you_pastydeath/ct6zbh6) (Exhibit B), he can clearly be seen falsely raising my expectations for a game by stating his move is soon to come... But it never came... Thus, I was left a disappointed who're, giving myself to a cause, just to have it rejected.

,Diablo,"[This comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/3de4z9/if_theres_a_2nd_expansion_would_there_even_be/ct4g6yw) by u/BoomShackles made me write down my ideas for a D3 Necromancer.
I love the idea of his proposed Resource so much that I based the whole class around it.

I would really like to see a ""dark"", morally flexible class in Diablo 3 and I think the Necromancer would be a perfect fit.
With a lot of people hoping for a class with a shapeshifting aspect, I also thought up something like this for a Diablo 3 Necromancer and I think it would fit the theme quite well.

Please post some comments on what to add/ change and I will edit this post.

-
Resource: **Balance of Death** (credit goes to u/BoomShackles)

[Here is a quick mockup of the Resource](http://imgur.com/Ni1nghs)

100 Balance points.

Half black and half white. Some skills lower the balance while others raise it. 
You can't use certain skills anymore if there is an imbalance.

-
Main Stat: **Vitality**

At first I thought that a char with Vitality as main stat would be a bad idea, because the character would probably feel too tanky.
After a quick check on [d3planner.com](http://www.d3planner.com/119449541) it turned out, that even with all ancient items and Vit + Armor + AllRes on almost every piece you're only at ~27mio toughness.
You have around ~2mio life, but you're really lacking Armor and AllRes compared to the other classes.
This leads to a very low Recovery stat and probably would make the Necro a pretty bad melee character.
With the help of some passives that reduce life by a certain percentage but increase your AllRes or Armor, this might be less of a problem though.


-
---

-
**Skills:**
-

Skills can either raise the balance or lower it. 

Skills that damage an enemy directly raise the balance (you take someones life away), 
while summoning skills lower the balance (you give life to something).

-
**Bone and Posion Skills**
-
**Teeth**

Raise balance on hit.

**Poison Nova**

**Bone Prison**

**Bone Armor**

Your armor is increased by 20% for 60 seconds. Your balance is raised by 5 points everytime you are hit.

---

-
**Curse Skills**
-

I'm not sure how many curse skills there should be and what should be done with runes yet.

-
**Amplify Damage**

Increases damage taken of your target. Every cursed enemy raises your balance by 1 point every second.

*Runes*

- Iron Maiden (Damage dealt is damage received)

- Life Tap (Attacking a cursed soul gives you health)

**Weaken**

Decreases the damage the target can do. Every cursed enemy raises your balance by 1 point every second.

*Runes*

- Terror (Cursed enemy runs in fear)

- Decrepify (Targets Speed is reduced)

**Vanish**

The cursed enemies no longer hinder your movement. Your movement speed is increased by 15%. Raise balance by 5 points. Cooldown: 6 seconds.

This skill is something like a Spirit Walk curse, I can't think of a better mobility skill yet.

**Sacrifice**

Curse your self by reducing your own life in order to restore the balance by 30 points.

---

-
**Summoning Skills**
-

**Raise Skeleton** 

Raise a skeleton at the position of you cursor that fights for you for 10 seconds. Lowers balance by 20 points.

*Runes:*

- Skeleton Army (Raise 3 skeletons that fight for 12 seconds)

- Skeletal Mage (Deal random elemental damage) This should maybe be a skill on its own.

- Giant Skeleton (Raise one giant skeleton for 30 seconds)

- Exploding Skeleton (Summon an unstable skeleton that explodes after 1 second)

-
**Raise Golem** 

Passive: Raise a Golem that fights by your side. Lowers balance by 1 point every second.

Active: The Golem moves to the position of your cursor.

*Runes:* 

- Clay Golem (More Damage)

- Blood Golem (Life Leech)

- Iron Golem (Maybe there is way for this to work with Legendary Affixes)

- Fire Golem (Burns the Ground it walks on)

- Teleporting Golem (Active attack teleports your Golem to the target destination)

-
**Raise Demon**

Raise a Demon that charges to the target position and deals damage on its path. Lowers balance by 20 points.

Would be a mixture of [Phalanx](http://eu.battle.net/d3/de/class/crusader/active/phalanx) and [Zombie Charger](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/class/witch-doctor/active/zombie-charger).
A skill that deals massive damage and ""costs"" resources.

---

-
**Shapeshifting Skills**
-

**Vampre**

Inspired by /u/Ceek4y and the [Trang-Oul's Avatar](http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/items/sets/sets7.shtml#trangouls) set from Diablo 2

Passive: Transforms the Necro into a Demon. Adds life leech and increases Movement and Attack Speed. Lowers balance by 2 points every second.

Active: Cast a Fire Ball. Raises Balance by 5 points for every enemy you hit.

I don't know about skills like fire wall and meteor. They might be too similar to the wizard skills

-
Edit: Below are my old suggestions for a shapeshifting demon, but maybe it doesn't fit the necro theme very well.

**Inner Demon**

Passive: Transforms the Necro into a Demon. Adds Resistance to all Elements and Attack Speed. Lowers balance by 2 points every second.

Active: Attack with a powerful melee attack for 400% weapon damage. Raises Balance by 5 points for every enemy you hit.

*Runes*

- Fiery Demon (Attack becomes ~ Disintegrate - Orlash Style)

- Poisoned Demon (You release a vile stench that deals 500% weapon damage as Poison every second to enemies within 8 yards.

- Demonic Slaves (Summons two Demonic Slaves that fight by your side and are connected to you and to each other with a chain)

- Behemoth (Bigger, more damage)

**Winged Terror**

When in demon form, you grow a pair of wings and charge through enemies to the selected location. Lowers balance by 10 points.

**Fires of Hell**

When in demon form, you release a gigantic wave of power, dealing damage to all enemies 15 yards. Raises Balance by 2 points for every enemy hit.

-
---

-
**Passives**
-

As mentioned above, there should be somne passives to help the Recovery stat of a Vitality based class. 
Passives that restore some percentage of your life or that lower your life but increase your Armor/AllRes.

---

-
**Items**
-

I really like the idea of a set that doesn't support specific skills, but changes the way you play.

My idea would be a ""Balance of Life"" set, that increases your damage depending on how balanced your resources are.
So if they are exactly 50/50, your damage is increased by 1000%, but if the difference is greater than 40/60 the damage increase is only 500%, down to 0% by 10/90.

This would probably be a 6pc set bonus, with the 4pc bonus balancing out your resources by 1 point every second or something like that.

-
Another set could be focused around your summoning skills, by making your Skeletons last until they die and increasing your pets' damage to cursed enemies.
Supporting items could give Raise Skeleton the Skeleton Army rune or give your Golem the Teleporting rune.

-
---

I had a lot of fun writing down my ideas and I hope a lot of people join this discussion about possible skills for a Diablo 3 Necromancer.
After hearing about the Witch Doctor in Diablo 3 I thought that there wouldn't be the need for another summoning class.
But after writing down all this stuff I think that it would fit in the game quite well.

What are your thoughts?

-
---

**Edit 2:** Seems like it's divided more or less 50/50 into people that just want the good old Diablo II Necro back and think that a shapshifting Necro doesn't make sense at all, and people that think that the WD has taken the place of the Necro and therefore a Necro in D3 will never happen.

I don't know what to think yet, but I'm happy the post got as much attention as it did. I like thinking and talking about ideas for stuff that will probaly never be in the game :D

People really seem to like the idea of a balance resource and I think the game is lacking a shapeshifting class, so maybe it's not for the Necromancer, but for some kind of Warlock/Cultist to fill the void. Something that fits the demonic shapeshifting theme better. A character with an inner fight between good and evil.

Thanks for the discussion, I had a lot of fun reading your comments!

,powerrangers,"Back when I was kid I made a list of Power Ranger team ideas and drew pictures. Later when I learned about sentai, I gave them new names. Still can't find the pictures but here are the details from the list:

**Power Rangers: Sky Strike**

**Niji Sentai Skyranger**

Motif: Chinese Zodiac

Story: Earth is protected by seven colors that fill the sky. These colors keep a dark force from corrupting the world around us. A long time ago, when the dark forces were sealed, the emperor of a faraway land used the power of the sky to bless twelve animals to protect the world should darkness return. That time has come.
The orange ranger was going to be the team’s mentor since he was injured but later rejoins the fight as the sixth hero. The indigo ranger spends the majority of the season on the villain’s team because she’s deceived/brainwashed.

Red (M)-Dragon &amp; Rat

Orange (M)-Tiger &amp; Monkey

Yellow (F)-Rooster &amp; Sheep

Green (M)-Ox &amp; Snake

Blue (M)-Dog &amp; Horse

Indigo (F)-Cat &amp; Jade

Violet (F)-Rabbit &amp; Boar

**Power Rangers Fear Force**

**Kowai Sentai Monranger**

Motif: Classic movie monsters

Story: Five high school students wander into an abandoned house where they find a genie’s lamp. The magic released causes other monster to rampant in the city. The students become cursed with the “Monster Gene” and must return all the other monsters to the haunted library before they mutate into their respective monster.
This would be a character heavy season where each curse reflects their character flaws. Red was an opportunistic douche, Black was a cold loner, Blue was an immature slob, Yellow was vain, and pink was a doormat. Later White tried to help the team but was accidently killed by Black. He was brought back to life with the monster Gene as a ghost, reflect his need for attention. The genie spends the first half trapped with the antagonists, but frees herself and joins as a purple Bangai hero.

VampRed (M)

WereBlack (M)

GillBlue (M)

MumYellow (F)

WitchPink (F)

PhantoWhite (M)


**Power Rangers Showstoppers**

**Yumi Sentai Cirqueman**

Motif: Circus

Story: Five people lead the Dream Dimension Circus where they traverse the multiverse trying to spread never ending joy to children. However, their most recent stop has led to them Earth where their Dream Particles have led to nightmares coming to life instead of dreams. Now these five young people must fight the evil they have inadvertently caused. Later on, their boss joins the fight as a Gold ranger. They are also sometimes helped by two orphan children from Earth who dream about Bangai heroes to help with the fight.

Red Magician (M)

Blue Strongman (M)

Green Clown (M)

Yellow Acrobat (F)

Pink Tamer (F)

Gold Ringmaster (M)

White (M) &amp; Black (F)


**Power Rangers Astro**

**Hoshi Sentai Astroman**

Motif: Western Zodiac/Constellations

Story: Ages ago the constellations took on the form of warriors and fought in an epic battle. In the end, only fourteen warriors remained. Thirteen of them banded to gather to stop the Argo warrior, but one of them, Ophiuchus, turned traitor at the last moment. The twelve warriors finished them off, but Ophiuchus swore to return on another world and wreak havoc. The twelve remaining warriors claimed a truce with each other. The warriors used the power of the stars to reincarnate wherever they were needed, hoping to not involve other lives with their senseless fight. This brought them to Earth, where they are reborn, and slowly trying to regain the memories of who they used to be.

All of the sentai and monster are based on Ptolemy’s 48 constellations. The warriors don’t know the full story, so it begins with two teams of sentai. One is good and the other is working for Ophiucus and act in a way similar to the Psycho Rangers but work with the Rangers on occasion. They also have civilian identities as well, so there is tension on who’s an enemy and who’s a friend.

Blue Sagittarius (M)

Violet Aquarius (F)


Vermillion Taurus (M)

**Power Rangers Tempest Strike**

**Sora Sentai Stormman**

Motif: Weather

Story: An aging scientist is betrayed by his assistant who begins building an army for conquest. The scientist’s death wish is to see his work so something good. He asks his daughter to take the remains of research and find more heroes to join in the fight. They start as a three man team but are joined by two more. Later on a meteor crashes that morphs into an alien Bangai hero.

Red Tornado (M)

White Snow (F)

Black Fog (M)

Blue Rain (F)

Yellow Sun (M)


**Power Rangers ???**

**Shosetsu Sentai Pageman**

Motif: Books/Genres

Story: Five students seek unfathomable knowledge and open the forbidden Sealed Tome. The words come to life as a mysterious knight seeking to finish his story. However the knight brings destruction to those around him, so the students use their accumulative knowledge and some magic from the book to build suits and machines to stop the knight. The knight responds by making similarly themed generals and continues to grow stronger. They are later joined by an aspiring author who thinks the experience will make him write the story of the century.

All operatives are killed except for the three men and two women. The men insist on them leaving, but the girls secretly take two morphers from the vault and join to fight and hope to survive. Later they are aided by a friend they thought died

The company explains that they’ve been trying to expose the evils of FRONT for a while, and now wants the teenagers to testify against them. However, they are unable to prove anything, so they ask instead to fight against the test subjects that are destroying the city and hope to expose FRONT’s evil somehow. Later on the son of FRONT’s CEO begins fighting the espers, only it’s revealed that his father has converted him into a cyborg and he joins the Busters.

The company explains that they’ve been trying to expose the evils of FRONT for a while, and now wants the teenagers to testify against them. However, they are unable to prove anything, so they ask instead to fight against the test subjects that are destroying the city and hope to expose FRONT’s evil somehow. Later on the son of FRONT’s CEO begins fighting the espers, only it’s revealed that his father has converted him into a cyborg and he joins the Busters.&lt;/p&gt;

	There was an urgent need to evacuate Portuguese from Indian sub continent. Diplomatic effort of Indian Government had failed to convince the Portuguese government for handing over the islands - Goa, Daman and Diu and Anjadiv. There was no option open other than capturing the islands by force. In 1961, 18 December India attacked Portuguese India to seize the islands by force. Army Navy and Air Force – all the three forces had participated for strike in that 36 plus hours war. The Indian navy was engaged in the war with 1 light Aircraft Carrier, 2 Cruisers, 1 Destroyer, 8 frigates, 4 Mine Sweepers, 20 Canberras, 6 Vampres, 6 Toofanis, 6 Hunters and 6 Mysteres.  Other side poruguese India resisted Indian attack with only 1 frigate and 3 Petrol boats. The Indian Naval command assigned the task of securing the island of Anjidiv to the INS Trshul and INS Myshore. INS Delhi was leading to secure Diu, and other ships were sent to secure Goa.  
	
In the early morning Portuguese frigate the Afonso de Albuquerque received information that the Indian Arm forces had launched ‘Operation Vijay’. The Portuguese Navy immediately took the position. At 0900 hours, 3 Indian frigates took up position off the harbor. The ships were just waiting for orders to attack the NRP Afonso and secure sea access to the port. At 1100 hours Indian Air Force bombed Mormugao harbor. The land communication infrastructure was destroyed by the Indian Air Force attack. At 1200 hours INS Beas and INS Betwa received green signal from HQ. Both entered the harbor. NRP Afonso was leading the Portuguese Navy. The ship had taken the responsibility to maintain radio communications between Goa and Lisbon as the land communication was destroyed by the IAF attack. INS Beas and Betwa opened fire on NRP Afonso with 4.5 inch gun. The leading ship Betwa asked Portuguese commanders to surrender. But they refused. 

Instead of surrendering NRP Afonso moved in the direction of enemy ships for counter attack. At the same time, the final radio message was sent to Lisbon, “We are being attacked, we are responding.” NRP Afonso responded fire with 120 mm guns as per the instruction of Lisbon. But it could not sustain in front of 4.5 inch gun. At 1215 hours, when she was trying to maneuvers to a position in which she could use all its guns, took a direct hit on its control tower injuring its weapon officer. At 1225 the Indian vessel directly exploded an anti personnel sharpnail bomb directly over the ship.  It killed ships radio officer and seriously injured Captain Cunha Aragao. The captain ordered the first officer sarmento Gouveia, to assume command of the ship with instructions not to surrender. Under heavy fire directed at the ship, some of the crew evacuated the injured officer to the shore, and transferred him by car to medical facilities at Panjim.

 At 1235 hours under massive fire its boiler and engines destroyed. The propulsion system completely paralyzed. During her last combat, it is estimated that the NRP Afonso de Albuquerque fired almost 400 shells.  The advantage of Indian Navy was significant, as their ships were more modern and armed with quick firing guns. At about 1250 hours the ship was initiated to abandonment. At 1310 hours the crew disembarked directly to the beach setting fire to the ship. The Afonso lay grounded at the beach near Dona Paula. In 1962 it was towed to Mumbai. Parts of the ship were recovered and are on display at a museum in Mumbai. The remainder of the ship was sold as scrap. 

The Portuguese frigate NRP Afonso de Albuquerque fought up to the last moment but could not survive in front of strong Indian Navy. It died like a brave soldier.  It was a deceive victory of India ending 451 years Portuguese colonial rule in Goa. It was liberation of historically Indian Territory. 22 Indian and 30 Portuguese were killed in that war.
