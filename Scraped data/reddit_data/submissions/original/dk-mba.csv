,MBA,"I am a 27 year old Indian guy with a 2018 Bachelors in Engineering from one of the top 3 IITs (top engineering schools in India) and a 2023 MBA from one of the top 3 IIMs (top Bschools in India). I have worked for 3 years preMBA across consulting, product and analytics roles at a couple of unicorns (industries- fintech, media, hospitality) and almost an year postMBA in a CEO‚Äôs Office role at a fintech unicorn. I recently joined an early stage VC fund, well known in the Indian circle. 

I really wish to make a career in tech investing in US or in general a buy side role but based out of the States but my experience so far has been limited to the Indian ecosystem. 
Would you all recommend going for a second MBA in 2025/26 after 1/2 years at this VC fund?
I would like to understand the opportunity set, the risks and the ROI.

My current fears/constraints/questions are:
1. Already done an MBA from a very good school
2. Age. 27 now. Will be 28/29 by the time I go, if I go
3. Too many job switches across roles and industries (a drifter?) (5th job in 4 years)
4. Relevance of my Indian work experience in the US
5. Do I have a real shot at HSW Booth? I don‚Äôt really want to go below that
6. Should I instead go for a specialised 1 year program in Finance or something of that sort?
7. I don‚Äôt want to wait a lot (like 3-5 years) before moving 
8. VC, in general, is a very localised business so the probability of you making a lateral geography switch is very low.

,MBA,"I don't want to get into too much details, but I work in tech sales and my co workers aren't the brightest people. They are very great at what they do and have great EQ, with some being nice and others being outright assholes. 

But as an example, we went to pub trivia for a social. And our co workers couldn't answer very basic questions. Like ""what famous dystopian novel's title is a year?"" Or even ""Who painted the Mona Lisa."" Or ""what does www stand for in a website address."" Or ""Which British band is famous for the album 'Abbey Road?"" Or ""what is the largest Ocean in the world."" 

That was just the beginning rounds and we completely shat the bed in the following, actually harder rounds. I was the only reason my specific team stayed afloat. 

All my co workers do outside of work is watch reality TV &amp; scroll mindlessly on TikTok. They work out, eat healthy, do soul cycle/bodyrock/pilates/barry's/corepower/class pass/whatever other HIIT thing is a fad. They have good fashion sense and know how to look ""good."" They are active in hobbies (but mainly sports things). But otherwise, they are not very smart. 

I don't think they're naturally dumb, but just completely jack intellectual curiosity. 

I want OUT of this environment, to the maximum degree that I can. I went to a T30 undergrad university and have a 3.8 GPA in Communications. I studied my butt off on the GRE and got good scores, like 170 on quant and 166 on verbal, so pretty good GRE scores. 

I was thinking initially something like law school, but I want to balance EQ &amp; IQ, something where you still have to be reasonably social so my skills having done sales don't go to waste, but I do more intellectually stimulating work and am surrounded by smart co workers.

So I'm thinking investment banking or management consulting. PE sounds cool but I don't have the background for it. 

So which schools would be best for me? I heard Darden is pretty academic heavy. And post-MBA, it seems Boston/Cambridge could have a high concentration of high IQ folks, same with possibly San Francisco given the tech concentration (Salespeople are dumb, but engineers are not). I'm ruling out NYC and LA, as well as Chicago because there are too many dumbs there.

,resumes,"So there have been some extenuating circumstances since moving back from abroad, which took a lot of my mental focus, but dad is doing much better and I'm ready and eager to get back to real work. 

I've actually been applying since I got back, first off and on to test the waters but far more consistently since the start of this year. Maybe 2 interviews that made it to a hiring manager months ago, and more recently 1 phone screen with a recruiter for a role that was ultimately put on hold. I'm based in Seattle but have also been applying to major hubs in California and the East coast.

I've gone through several iterations of my resume, and while I've been adding in more buzzwords here and there, the listed experience has stayed the same. This version of my resume I re-did yesterday so haven't sent it out yet and just tryng to get a little more objective feedback before I do. 

Been a little difficult trying to pivot from tech to pharma/healthcare companies, which I've learned have a preference for more traditional science folks, even with a couple referrals here and there. So any advice from recruiters in that field would be especially appreciated because I'm this close to giving up on the health sciences and just focusing on tech again. 

I'm open to program manager, marketing, product, product marketing, and strategy/innovation type roles. Trying to stay away from sales/biz dev since I got pigeon-holed into that for awhile and would rather not go back to it.

,cissp,"Really thought I was struggling all throughout. When I got to question 125 I almost didn‚Äôt want to hit next, thinking it would stop because I failed. 

But I‚Äôm so happy to say I passed! 

Definitely a tough exam that meshes security and management. 

It took me a little under 45 minutes. 

Background on me:
1. Bachelors‚Äô in Computer Science
2. MBA, cybersecurity specialization
3. Security+, CySA+ certifications
4. Some foundational AWS, other certs
5. Almost 5 years full time experience as a security engineer


Materials used:
1. The all-in-one book. I‚Äôve used these for all certs. I like how they‚Äôre written and the questions included
2. Learnzapp. Cranked out questions for each domain, did practice tests
3. Watched ‚Äúhow to think like a manager for CISSP‚Äù on youtube this morning. Helped get in the mindset

A few tips that really helped me in no particular order:
1. Looks for the words risk/business in answers
2. Eliminate answers that contain absolutes, unless a question is asking for something that is NOT. Then, the opposite is true
3. Think like a consultant - recommend improvements, don‚Äôt necesarilly try to fix something. 
4. Other key words to look for: impact, CIA, accountability, classification

,redscarepod,"I met him online when we were both 19. Our first date was at Burger King in which I paid for my our meal, we then went to the cinema and I paid there as well. He was handsome, funny, intelligent, ambitious, compassionate. So sad how it would all come crumbling down. 

Within a month of knowing each other he asked me to be his girlfriend. Granted I made it extremely obvious that I liked him and nudged him towards it. Leading up to this moment he had been talking to another girl who he described to me as ‚Äúsubmissive‚Äù and ‚Äúperfect in every way‚Äù one who he ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt get in many arguments with‚Äù, but was however just not me. He also mentioned all the beautiful girls he was talking to, which he had to give up, because apparently I was just so different and special. 

Soon after asking me to be his girlfriend one day we had planned to meet at the bus station. There was a miscommunication about which bus station, so by the time I had realised I was at the wrong one, I couldn‚Äôt even call him because my phone signal wasn‚Äôt working (which he knew before hand). I went to the correct bus station thinking it would be a little mix up we could laugh about because fundamentally I was just so excited to see him. I greeted him with a smile and a bag full of clementines and soon enough I saw the frown on his face. As I approached him, he started shouting at me saying ‚Äúwhere the fuck were you?!‚Äù, I explained I just mixed up the bus stations but he went on to berate me, list of all the times I had been late before (which was literally just a lie, I hadn‚Äôt been late ever at this point), and lecture me about how I should get my phone fixed. When I finally got connection, my phone buzzed with 11 different messages from him all saying something to the effect of ‚Äúwhere the fuck are you?!‚Äù. Did I mention he‚Äôs 170cm? 
After this ordeal, he apologised and said unprompted that he didn‚Äôt want to remind me of any of my abusive exes and didn‚Äôt want to talk to me like that because it reminded him of how his dad would talk to his mom. Little did I know this was just the beginning.

He constantly complained about how women are hypocritical for wanting taller guys. He would say things like ‚Äúwomen shouldn‚Äôt get mad when guys say they don‚Äôt want to date fat chicks if they‚Äôre going to have such standards‚Äù. He brought this up constantly, and my response would always be ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs something that only really matters in high school‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs arbitrary either way. There‚Äôs guys who like fat girls, like there‚Äôs girls who like short guys. It‚Äôs not a big deal‚Äù. He lamented taller women not being interested in him (even though I was 3cm taller than him. After him repeatedly bringing it up, I had to explicitly ask him to stop talking about it because he has a girlfriend now anyways so why should it matter. 

One day after finding out a friend of his that he viewed as below him (which I would come to find was the general theme for the friends he kept around) had in fact had a threesome, he messaged me angry and confused because this friend prior to this had a body count of only two. I told him it was weird he knew all his friends‚Äô body counts (he had many friends, he kept track of all of their body count!), he then said it was because his friends were losers (birds of feather). He then proceeded to ask me my body count. I told him. He said his was around the same (lie). I thought that was the end of the conversation but actually that night he had gone on to Quora to commiserate with the people on there and he then came clean and said his body count was a lower number that was still a lie btw, and that the Quora consensus was that I was a hoe. I said, it‚Äôs fine and understandable if it‚Äôs a problem for you, we can break up. He said that I was ‚Äúnot like other girls‚Äù and because of that he‚Äôll overcome my terrible body count which would be a hard thing for any man to do. 

The next months he berated me for it, repeatedly asked me the penis sizes of past sexual partners, if I had done BDSM, how many guys I let hit me during sex, who the oldest guy I slept with was. All of this shit. When I told him about the virginity testing I went through as a child (literally from age 10) and how that traumatised me, he said that was bullshit, when I told him I lost my virginity to a 20 year old when I was I was 16 (which was statutory rape where I live) he managed to find a way to chastise me, a minor at the time, for having sex with an adult. When I told him that weeks before meeting him a guy had raped me in my sleep 1.) within seconds of me recounting what happened he accused me of lying  2.) when I had to explain it all in excruciating detail, and he realised I wasn‚Äôt lying his first question was ‚Äúdid he use a condom?‚Äù. When the answer was no (obviously not) he got mad at me, gave me a lecture about how I could‚Äôve given him HIV and when I said I would go get tested he then told me not to. He was the only person I had told about that mind you. 

For months he would continue to call me a slut, a prostitute, constantly accused me of wanting attention from random men on the street. When some guy (and I didn‚Äôt even notice this) was looking at my boobs, he got mad at me and said I wanted him to look. He told me that 99% of men wouldn‚Äôt want me and that he‚Äôs the 1% of idiots who did. Whenever I tried to defend myself he said I was just playing victim and I don‚Äôt take accountability. He told me my religion (Catholicism) was a front and said that ‚ÄúYou can go to confession and have a priest forgive you and God forgive but that doesn‚Äôt absolve you of anything‚Äù (umm actually it does). He never cared about my culture or religion, but I read three books about his religion (Judaism), studied the Old Testament and would try to talk to him about it, and even took Hebrew classes (that I‚Äôm still doing now lol). The more I learnt, the more I realised that he didn‚Äôt seem to know that much about the religion aspect of Judaism‚Äî at first he made it seem like he knew a lot, but he didn‚Äôt even know which parts of the Bible were the Torah and which were the New Testament and confused certain beliefs (eg: an eye for an eye, from the Torah/Old Testament) with being uniquely Christian (which Matthew chapter 5 re-contextualises, so it‚Äôs like turn the other cheek for Christians) as a means to criticise Christianity; also he told me he could speak Hebrew and after three Hebrew lessons it became abundantly clear to me that he knew no Hebrew (no words, not the alphabet, not even basic introductions). 

He was really violent, sex obsessed, lazy, all round scrub.

Nine months in I broke up with him because 1.) he was mean to me all the time, no matter how hard I tried to make him happy (and believe you me, I tried extremely hard), 2.) he had messaged his ex girlfriend asking her her body count because ‚Äúhe needed a woman‚Äôs perspective on the matter because he didn‚Äôt like what I was saying‚Äù 3.) he had zero aspirations, no job, not in school, no hobbies. When I asked him about it, and asked him to just start doing something, working towards something - he told me he was happy the way he was and didn‚Äôt want to do anything and planned to stay with his dad until he would need to start receiving welfare and finally 4.) he had relapsed with drugs and lied to me about it.

Soon after he promised me he would change and my mom also told me that we should get back together. I was still very much in love with him so I was easily persuaded. He stopped smoking, and got a job which he quit after three weeks. In this time he would also reveal that he went through my messages behind my back because he didn‚Äôt trust me - mind you this was shortly after I paid for our holiday (paid for literally everything). Of course he was hoping to find evidence of me cheating which he did not. He told me this was ‚Äúnot his character‚Äù, but the paranoia from the drugs. 

Somewhere along the line he relapses again, lies to me about it, tells me he‚Äôs going to change, doesn‚Äôt change at all and still treats me like shit ‚Äî I end the relationship for good. The only reason I found out about the relapse was because there was a text from a dating app on his phone; an argument ensued, I mention how he‚Äôd been acting weird, and that‚Äôs when he came out with it.

Following the final breakup, I found out he lied to me about a bunch of things. It would take too long to go into detail so here‚Äôs a summarised list of his lies:

1. He lied and told me about this distant cousin from the countryside who was in love with him and had been for five years. I found out that the distant cousin was actually his first cousin who lives in the same city as us, who he house kept for, whose dog he walked, and who he would regularly meet for coffee and told me he loved dearly.

2. He told me he was the only man in his family to graduate high school. His dad has an MBA from a top business school and holds a senior position at a major corporation and his brother has a business degree and works a well paying job at a major corporation. 

3. He told me he only had one girlfriend before me six years ago. He had had five girlfriends. Two of which (three including me) had accused him of sexual assault. 

4. He told me his mother had terminal cancer and was struggling with maintaining chemo because of expenses, bad healthcare from public hospitals etc, etc. The mom HAD cancer, he did not lie about that. But she managed to beat it and received treatment from the best hospital in the country. He also made it seem like she was neglectful and mean. She could‚Äôve mean idk, but it turns out she was extremely hands on, was a part of the PTA, helped him through all his assignments at school, and helped him graduate high school. 

5. He told me he was poor. Actually lived in a very wealthy neighbourhood + his dad paid for everything. 

6. Told me he left university cos it was too expensive; he flunked out.

7. Lied about his father being absent. Dad is home most days a week and they go out to fancy restaurants once a month (keep in mind we‚Äôre adults and in comparison to my actual absent father this seems (relative to our age, early 20s) extremely hands on. But what do I know, I moved out when I was 18).

A lot more stupid lies he told. Moral is: don‚Äôt listen to the evil ‚ÄòThe Guardian‚Äô articles that tell you to date short men or demonises 4-year age gaps between consenting adults. Im taking a year off of dating to cleanse myself of this all, the fact that this relationship lasted for over a year, the fact that I stayed for over a year highlights some deficits in my character.  These were amongst the worst months of life. I lost friends, my hair started falling off so bad I developed a Prince William bald spot on the crown of my head, I‚Äôve got all types of weird  and painful anxiety ticks that I can‚Äôt control now. We‚Äôve been broken up for a month, and little by little I‚Äôm remembering who I was before.

Im taking a year off of dating to cleanse myself of this all, the fact that this relationship lasted for over a year, the fact that I stayed for over a year highlights some deficits in my character.  These were amongst the worst months of life. I lost friends, my hair started falling off so bad I developed a Prince William bald spot on the crown of my head, I‚Äôve got all types of weird  and painful anxiety ticks that I can‚Äôt control now. We‚Äôve been broken up for a month, and little by little I‚Äôm remembering who I was before. &lt;/p&gt;

But I‚Äôm so happy to say I passed! 

Definitely a tough exam that meshes security and management. 

It took me a little under 45 minutes. 

Background on me:
1. Bachelors‚Äô in Computer Science
2. MBA, cybersecurity specialization
3. Security+, CySA+ certifications
4. Some foundational AWS, other certs
5. Almost 5 years full time experience as a security engineer


Materials used:
1. The all-in-one book. I‚Äôve used these for all certs. I like how they‚Äôre written and the questions included
2. Learnzapp. Cranked out questions for each domain, did practice tests
3. Watched ‚Äúhow to think like a manager for CISSP‚Äù on youtube this morning. Helped get in the mindset

A few tips that really helped me in no particular order:
1. Looks for the words risk/business in answers
2. Eliminate answers that contain absolutes, unless a question is asking for something that is NOT. Then, the opposite is true
3. Think like a consultant - recommend improvements, don‚Äôt necesarilly try to fix something. 
4. Other key words to look for: impact, CIA, accountability, classification

,FinancialCareers,"Hi, I‚Äôm hoping this sub can help me decide what path to take for school. I have a BA in English from 2011. It‚Äôs a long story but I started working as an accounts receivable specialist about two years ago. Three years ago, I started as a billing specialist. And to my surprise, I‚Äôm good at crunching numbers and I really enjoy it. 

I‚Äôm currently at a technical school taking classes for an accounting certificate program. It‚Äôs only four classes then I‚Äôll have earned the certificate by December 2024. 

My plan is to then go to the local university and take accounting prerequisite classes so that I can eventually apply for the master‚Äôs in accounting program. It‚Äôs gonna take me a while since I can only go part-time and my BA was in English. 

I was doing research today and I am curious as to whether or not an MBA or even a Master‚Äôs in Public Administration would be better for me. 

My main goal is to make a lot more money and I‚Äôm not sure if I really want to supervise people. I‚Äôm an introvert and like working on my own. But I‚Äôm also good at working with people if needed. I have a strong customer service background and I also used to be a teacher. 

I came across the position of budget analyst and it sounds really interesting to me. I love personal finance and I really enjoy managing my own family‚Äôs budget. 

With all things considered, what path should I take? Continue to pursue the master‚Äôs in accounting? Or pursue the MBA or the MPA? The semester is almost over and I have a 96 average in my intro to accounting class. 

I‚Äôm looking for something that can be done online as I work full time and I also have a husband and a toddler. Life is pretty busy as it is, to say the least!

\-Start with paid coaching 1-3 hours depending on your needs. Since I do admissions coaching, I will provide the brainstorming coaching for reduced cost. This part will not be for free in order to make sure you take this seriously. I have worked with over &gt;100 clients, over 70% with interviews at top 10, many HBS/GSB admits. 

\-I will review output of your essays working with the tool to ensure its improving. This is free admissions consulting work. 

\-Only additional cost will be for high volume usage of the AI tool that will be pass through costs of based on your input/output. This will be transparently passed thru. 

\-If additional coaching is needed, this would not be for free. I put this in place in case you are not patient enough to provide feedback on the AI tool and want to complete the process the traditional way.

**Requirements:** 

be prepared to apply to HBS in R1 in September 2024 (prefer that your GMAT/GRE is done)

,ApplyingToCollege,"Hi,

My daughter just heard back from different schools and is debating between a few choices - 

1. Rice 
2. UT Austin (in state) - Plan II/Data Science (dual major)
3. Duke
4. Emory (have a 100K scholarship) (QSS major)

We are fortunate that $'s are not the main driver of the decision, but we are of course value conscious. My daughter is not interested in pre-med/pre-law or graduate school (possibly MBA) but these things can obviously change. 

She values flexibility of curriculum, ability to do undergraduate research, being in a collaborative environment where people help each other get better, is more of an introvert.

Her preferred areas of interest - Psychology and Data science/Statistics but of course no one can be 100% sure that they will do exactly what they start their college life with. And she is a singer, won several national level recognition, wants to pursue music at college. 

I believe members here might have unique perspectives, hence the post.

For MIT I just listed SciOly, Research at the two universities, and the women in cs club as my ECs. Dance and orchestra were included as awards since you include have 5 scholastic and 5 non-scholastic awards. 

LORS: being conservative here

1. Chemistry teacher: 8/10. Known him since sophomore year and had a good relationship. Talked to him about the research I was doing as well. One of the few underclassmen in his ap chem class and did really well
2. Research mentor: 10/10. Had a really good relationship with her and was impressed with the work I was doing.
3. AP Lang Teacher: 7-8/10. Solid relationship with her and took initiative in her class. She had us fill out this rec info form and most of the info that I put on there was included in the rec.

Essays:

1. Common app: 7/10. Wrote an essay about storytelling and how I use it to connect/communicate with others
2. Supplements: All 8-9/10. Spent a lot of time on these and was really happy with how they turned out. Talked about interest in biochem research, biotech, entrepreneruship, hobbies I had, etc.

Interviews:

1. MIT: 8-9/10. Said he was impressed with me. We were both interested in chemistry and research and had a lot to talk about
2. Dartmouth: 9/10. Really conversational, and she was a recent grad as well
3. Duke: 8/10. Had similar interests in music and chemistry and connected well. The only issue is that he was really particular about cutting it off at 30 mins in the email
4. Northwestern: 6/10. Mid, nothing really special
5. Harvard: 7/10. Similar interests in entrepreneurship. Interviewer went to Harvard for MBA so it was a bit difficult to talk about the undergrad experience. Other than that we jumped around and talked about a lot of different things and I think I did a good job of expressing my intersts
6. Princeton: 8/10. Really conversational, connected a lot on community, women in stem, imposter syndrome, and entrepreneruship. 

Results:

Cornell, UPenn, Dartmouth: Waitlisted

JHU and Northwestern: Rejected

Wash U: Waitlisted

Stanford: will update in 5-6 hours lol

Thoughts/reflections:

MIT was one of my dream schools so after I got in, I was really excited. I think this all comes to show how random the college application process can be and that FIT IS SUPER IMPORTANT. I don't think I did a good job of showing that I was interdisciplinary in my Yale application so after that rejection I  worked really hard to tailor my essays to the fit/values of each school. I guess it didn't work out but at the end of the day, we're all destined to get into the college we belong to!

Advice for all the young ones who lurk here: Work hard and keep pushing. Not everything you touch will be gold. Some of you will have more lows before you get to those big highs and that's okay.

,PublicSpeaking,"I would be starting my MBA this fall from one of the top colleges in USA. But instead of being excited, I am a bit nervous about it.

,stocks,"Daily queries growth of 63% and 131% Net Revenue Retention at the low end of the (non AI) cycle show just how much they sandbagged guidance of 22%. Both lead to future revenue growth. For comparison, they just achieved 36% annual revenue growth with daily queries growth of 73% and 158% NRR as the cycle was trending down. Now the cycle is about to trend up. I'd be surprised if revenue growth is lower than 27% this year.

The new CEO Sridhar Ramasway is better than Slootman in every way. Slootman was a has-been MBA suit cashing in on his cachet like John Chen at BlackBerry. Took extreme stock based comp for himself and kept selling shares nonstop, while not keeping up with industry competition. Tech expertise is essential for tech CEOs to lead their companies to a monopolistic outcome. Research on the economics of tires (Slootman), not so much.

The company is about to become relevant in the AI space due to this change in leadership. And web services companies are probably the biggest long term beneficiaries of AI. They have better economics (network, scale, incremental capital requirements). The new CEO expects several new product launches this year and he delivered one [yesterday](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/unlock-insights-with-snowflake-data-clean-rooms/). That's impressive after a little over one month on the job.

By now everyone knows the CEO bought $5m shares as part of his compensation contract this week. However, what's actually more interesting is Mark D. McLaughlin bought $501k worth of stock above $165 this month without being required to do so as part of any agreement. He similarly added $300k early last year at a higher price. He's a director of Snowflake and Palo Alto Networks, and Chairman of Qualcomm. Definitely the kind of guy who has is finger on the pulse of the tech scene. So if he's buying more this year than last year at the same price, he is more confident in the company's future now.

,Futurology,"Like everyone else I hear a lot about the coming debt, social security, and depopulation crisis.  I note a growing number of smartly dressed MBA types landing on a the solution of ""the elderly will have to work longer"", and quoting ages like 73, 75, even 77.  The throw down comment is ""living longer and healthier longer"".

I'm wondering if this is really sensible, or if it's just blatant mendacity via looking at a small tail of the population and just assuming that is, or will be, most.  I'm asking because of what I see.

I have two relatives in different long term care facilities, and 3 more that live on their own.  They are between 65 and 80.  Because of the two, I get to see a lot of older people.  We go over to their facilities twice a month for dinner.  These two facilities cater to the wealthy and healthy portion of the elderly population:  people who can drive, pay their own bills, cook, clean their own apartment, and basically just want someone close in case they have a stroke or fall down.

Here is what I see in that population.  They get by okay, but with the exception of a very small percentage of licensed engineers and doctors, there is no way in hell these people at age 70 can do enough productive labor to offset the cost of Payroll/HR maintenance.  Maybe you'd get 5 hours a week of the kind of mental snap and productivity you and I would consider acceptable in a coworker?  

And these are smartest, most successful, and highly educated part of the elderly population.  The three live at home elderly in my family are basically highly skilled manual labor time.  It's a cruel cynical joke to think uncle Lam, healthy feisty and strong as he is, has any business driving a mail truck, stocking shelves, or doing the Electrician work that got him to old age.  From a work perspective he was pretty damn broken down by age 58 - and that's when he was a supervising master electrician.

SOOOOO.....the ""people must work longer"" crowd is actually thinking, what are they seeing in the numbers that make them think is actually possible at scale?

,u_GearDelicious8415,"Hey everyone, just wanted to share my experience with the Genealogical Research certificate program at Boston University (BU) which I went through in the Fall of 2023. Unfortunately, it fell way short of expectations, and I'm hoping to warn others who might be considering it.

**Workload Woes:**  They advertise 20-30 hours a week, but the reality is it is closer to 40-60!  And this wasn't just me who suffered through this - other students were drowning too.  Apparently, this has been an issue in past semesters as well.

**Communication Chaos:**  The course description was missing info about prerequisites, which they added *after* I enrolled.  Never got told about this change, and somehow still got accepted despite not meeting the new requirements.  Not cool, BU.

**Grading Gaffe:**  Inconsistent grading and unhelpful feedback were the norm.  One gem I got on a research paper -  a dismissive ""mosh-mosh.""  Seriously, where's the constructive criticism? I have a Master's Degree and never received such poor grades C's and D's, nor have I ever received such awful feedback.

**Limited Support, Big Drop-Out:**  The program relied heavily on self-learning with minimal instructor interaction.  They were usually only available online for about an hour a week (sometimes even less!).  This lack of support unsurprisingly led to a whopping 67% drop-out rate in my cohort, which apparently reflects previous semesters too.  Yeesh.

**Colleague Confirms Concerns:**  This wasn't just my perception.  A colleague at the University where I work, who holds numerous degrees - Ph.D. in Psychology, an MBA in Strategy &amp; Innovation, an MTS in World Religions &amp; Ethics and is also an Associate Dean even weighed in after hearing my struggles.  They said the program ""runs without clear or basic pedagogical organization, leaving students lost and frustrated."" They further stated ""it's like a puzzle with missing pieces:  students are left to struggle to connect the scattered pieces, while trying to find clarity to help process material into the intended course goals.""

**Tried Everything:**  Since November, I've tried reaching out to instructors, program leadership, the Ombuds office, and even the Provost's office. The Ombuds office was initally receptive and agreed with my assessment, but crickets since then.  I did get one response from an Assoc. Dean Cessa who never acknowledged my issues and then wished me well in my genealogical career. What????

**Escalating to the Board:**  Left with no other options, I recently submitted a formal request for a refund and program review to BU's Board of Trustees.  Having paid a lot for this program, a full refund for the undelivered service seems more than fair. I doubt I'll get anything but worth the try.

**Looking for Fairness and Change:**  Escalating to Reddit wasn't my first choice, but the lack of communication from BU leaves me with no other option.  Hoping for a full refund for this program that clearly wasn't what it was advertised to be.  Also, wouldn't it be great if BU reviewed this program to address workload, communication, grading, and instructor support for future students?

,MBA,"I'm Army Reserve, sitting at 90% GI Bill... planning to increase that to 100% this year.  I'm torn between a few programs that I'd like advice on.  I live in St. Louis (a California transplant) and work as a Project Manager for a Fortune 500 company.   

1. Olin's Flex MBA - Olin seems to have a great reputation, and I can attend in person classes during evenings and weekends.  They even offer international trips for their Flex MBA students, which appeals to me.  Attended their launch party and their students are enthused about the school.  Seems the most likely option for me.  Plus the housing allowance would be $2100 (all pocketed since I'll remain at my current job).  Seems like the only program I've found with deferential treatment to military officers.  Considering Olin my ""safety"" school because I'm pretty confident about getting accepted.  
2. Tepper's online MBA - I only recently started contemplating Tepper.  However, I'm hesitant about renting out my house to move to a city where the housing allowance is less than St. Louis.  Hence, considering the online MBA from them.  Still, would get a housing allowance of $960/ month, all pocketed.  
3. McDonough - Considering their Flex MBA program (could do online the first year; potentially in person the second if I can get my employer to approve me working remotely for a year).  Georgetown has been on my list forever only due to their Walsh School of Foreign Service.  Seems like their MBA program is meh but the university is renown.  
4. Haas - Considering their Flex MBA program.  Definitely my reach school.  Also one where I could do online the first year and request to work remotely the second.  The benefit for this besides a great program (although no international study abroad opportunities like Olin), is a high housing allowance.  This also works out as a great location because my Reserve unit is also Bay Area, so that would be a huge plus not flying to drills each month.    


Observations:  
Olin - no test scores required/ no recommendations required   
Tepper - test scores waiver possible/ 1 letter of recommendation required   
McDonough - test scores required/ 1 letter of recommendation   
Haas - test scores required/ 2 letters of recommendation   


Profile: 

Age: 32 / 11 years' work experience/ 4 years management experience in that 11  
Graduated from a no-name university in 2013 with a 2.3GPA in International Studies &amp; French (no mitigating circumstances) (1 semester abroad taking all courses in French)   
Lived and taught English in Brazil for 3 years after graduation  
Fluent in Portuguese   
Volunteered with Boy Scouts/ now Scouts between 2013 and 2020   
Took a couple classes in 2018, did well, even though it doesn't change undergrad GPA  
Enlisted under OCS contract in 2018, commissioned in 2019   
Deployed to Iraq twice   
Project Manager for Midwest energy company  
Industry experience: wine/ viticulture, supply chain, energy   


Hobbies: travel - 5 continents/ 17 countries visited (could prioritize the last 2 before applying, I imagine schools don't have people that have been to all the continents as their unique factor lol)

Dings:  
Graduated more than 10 years ago; seems like certain classes will apply towards your MBA if taken 10 years ago or earlier...   
Low undergrad GPA - on the flip side, could I show improvement by taking some quant college classes?  Other ideas?    
White &amp; male  


Goals:   
No debt - still have 20k in undergrad loans, although being military helped me reduce it down from 50k.  I don't want to go into debt for an MBA program.    
Career change - always wanted to do management consulting, hoping to pivot into that.  Also open to Aerospace &amp; Defense, sticking with energy, returning to supply chain   
Name brand - I want to diversify and show that even though my undergrad wasn't great, I can still ""hack it"" at a decent, and prestigious school.  Expectations are tempered cause I obv. don't plan on applying to Ivy League schools... nor full-time programs.  I want a strong alumni culture and a great learning program.  It's not just a check-the-box MBA for me.  Genuinely want to learn, improve, and change careers.    
Hope to stay in the Midwest: St. Louis or Chicago would be the best, but open to other locations domestic and abroad.  If abroad, hope to get Latin America.  Long-term Army Reserve goal is Foreign Area Officer, and you need a strong regional background for that position.

,MBA,"I'm looking to apply to business school in the fall for 2025 and finalizing my school/program list. I'm currently a PM at a bank and my goal post MBA is to either switch to PM at big tech with a focus on health tech, or do consulting then corp strategy at big tech/pharma for health tech. A lot of schools I'm considering have some sort of a dual degree offering with their MBA, though it ranges in rigor from programs like LGO with a full MS to Columbia's MBA/MS which has kind of a catch-all ""Executive MS"".

While most students don't need one-on-one tutoring, some do.

In addition to GMAT exam strategy we also work together on your MBA/Grad School admissions.

First, let's meet for a free evaluation procedure (this would include some GMAT prep work based on a mock exam) so that we can both evaluate the work. I will next lay out my preparation plan for you based on the evaluation. You can determine whether or not this meets your needs. You will not be charged until one-on-one tutoring sessions begin

,MBA,"Hello Fellow Redditors,

I'm currently in a bit of a predicament. I've been accepted into two fantastic online MBA programs ‚Äì University of Michigan Ross's and University of Southern California Marshall's ‚Äì and I'm having a tough time deciding between the two. I've done extensive research on both, but I'm hoping to get some outside perspectives to help me make my decision. And yes, I‚Äôve definitely decided on an online MBA program as this makes the most sense for my needs and lifestyle at this time. Regarding the programs, here‚Äôs what I've found so far:

**University of Michigan Ross Online MBA:**

Pros:
- Ross's online MBA program is ranked among the best by US News and World Report. Additionally, there MBA program is consistently ranked in the top 10.
- The program offers an immersive, flexible, and highly interactive online experience. It also requires three in-person residencies, and I can choose to do them at the main campus or at various international locations. 
- Access to a vast alumni network that spans pretty much any industry. 
-My goal is to live and work on the East coast, primarily in the tech industry.

Cons:
- The tuition is quite steep, costing approximately $120,000 for the entire program.
- The program requires three in-person residencies, which I am excited about, but it might end up being slightly inconvenient as I do have a very high-pressure job full-time job.

**University of Southern California Marshall Online MBA:**

Pros:
- USC Marshall also ranks highly and has climbed in the rankings the past couple of years especially. It‚Äôs now in the top 15 MBA programs according to US News World &amp; Report.
- The program offers an integrative curriculum focused on five core business areas.
- USC Marshall has a powerful alumni network, especially in Southern California.
- No mandatory in-person residencies.
-Given my goals to work in tech as a product manager, USC is a big name in this industry (but I wonder if the name is as ‚Äúbig‚Äù on the East coast?).

Cons:
- The tuition costs around $90,000, which is slightly less than Ross but still a considerable amount.
- Even though the program has claimed the rankings in recent years, I wonder if it will fall (whereas Ross has a very consistent history of being a top business school).

I would really appreciate if anyone with experience in either of these programs could weigh in. I'm looking for advice on the quality of the education, networking opportunities, career services, and any other factors you think might be important.

As for which program I'm leaning towards, it's hard to say. Both programs have great reputations and offer strong curriculums. USC Marshall is more affordable and doesn't require in-person residencies, which is a plus. However, Ross's unique MAP course and strong ranking are also very appealing. So, I'm still undecided‚Ä¶ but I guess I am favoring Ross.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and advice.

,mac,"I bought a MBA M3 15‚Äù 24GB/1TB two weeks ago.

Today is the 14th day and I pulled the trigger (in the other direction).

Believe me, it is an impressive machine, the best laptop in the world probably.

The GoFetch vulnerability scared me, but what forced me to return is how the vulnerability has been managed from Apple: just silence.

Apple has been informed on 5th of December about it. No real comments about it right now.

If you do not know GoFetch please read the details about it, just search ‚ÄúGoFetch vulnerability‚Äù.

I made my own research a lot and I would like to share my knowledge about information that are difficult to find or understand immediately:

- This is a new vulnerability, the paper is new and not peer reviewed but the authors are reliable experts
- The risk is considered low right now
- The vulnerability is theoretically VERY bad
- In the real world it could be nothing or a disaster, we still do not know if the research was conducted on Linux Asahi or MacOS Sonoma. If the former than it could be a no issue for Sonoma
- The research was conducted with a quiet environment in the L2, could it work on a normal device in normal activity?
- It is fake news that physical control of the machine is needed, it could theoretically happen remotely, theoretically through Java Scripts visiting a website. Theoretically because like already said, it is not known exactly what are the precise limits and conditions. But these vectors can not be excluded either!
- User privileges are enough, Admin/Root is NOT needed.
- The issue involves the private keys, but this might be just the appetizer. The original paper itself explains that every cached information could be - again, theoretically - fetched.
- The research ran on M1 Chips, but is reasonable to speculate that M2 and M3 are involved as well.
- In this case the M1+M2 have a different mitigation as M3, maybe a less efficient on. The consequence of these mitigations is a loss in performance but it is not known how much thus if it is relevant. 
- If the problem is real (read above) and therefore a mitigation is needed, then the loss in performance is probably very acceptable in order to protect the private keys on M3 BUT (!) the software developers must independently employ the mitigation, as there is not - right now - a system patch through Apple. 
- In order to protect the private keys there should be mitigations on M1+M2 as well (run the encryption through the efficiency cores only) but they are more difficult to implement. In oder to protect just the private keys, then the performance should not be impacted too much on M1+M2 too.
- If the attack goes public and mainstream and it works good on MacOS, remotely through JavaScripts and with a noisy L2 and without much knowledge and control about what is running on the system‚Ä¶ if, if, if‚Ä¶ then the far west is coming.
- In this worst case scenario, it should be then always possible to protect the private keys somehow, but it will never be possible to protect all fetchable informations without a HUGE performance impact, (possibly on M3 as well!).

Therefore there is a real possibility that the M3 devices experience longevity problems in the next years.

TL;DR:
A lot of ‚Äútheoretically‚Äù, ‚Äúif‚Äù, ‚Äúpossibly‚Äù‚Ä¶ the situation is still very unclear, potentially very bad. Hence my decision to

&lt;li&gt;This is a new vulnerability, the paper is new and not peer reviewed but the authors are reliable experts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The risk is considered low right now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The vulnerability is theoretically VERY bad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the real world it could be nothing or a disaster, we still do not know if the research was conducted on Linux Asahi or MacOS Sonoma. If the former than it could be a no issue for Sonoma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The research was conducted with a quiet environment in the L2, could it work on a normal device in normal activity?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is fake news that physical control of the machine is needed, it could theoretically happen remotely, theoretically through Java Scripts visiting a website. Theoretically because like already said, it is not known exactly what are the precise limits and conditions. But these vectors can not be excluded either!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User privileges are enough, Admin/Root is NOT needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The issue involves the private keys, but this might be just the appetizer. The original paper itself explains that every cached information could be - again, theoretically - fetched.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The research ran on M1 Chips, but is reasonable to speculate that M2 and M3 are involved as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this case the M1+M2 have a different mitigation as M3, maybe a less efficient on. The consequence of these mitigations is a loss in performance but it is not known how much thus if it is relevant. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the problem is real (read above) and therefore a mitigation is needed, then the loss in performance is probably very acceptable in order to protect the private keys on M3 BUT (!) the software developers must independently employ the mitigation, as there is not - right now - a system patch through Apple. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In order to protect the private keys there should be mitigations on M1+M2 as well (run the encryption through the efficiency cores only) but they are more difficult to implement. In oder to protect just the private keys, then the performance should not be impacted too much on M1+M2 too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the attack goes public and mainstream and it works good on MacOS, remotely through JavaScripts and with a noisy L2 and without much knowledge and control about what is running on the system‚Ä¶ if, if, if‚Ä¶ then the far west is coming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this worst case scenario, it should be then always possible to protect the private keys somehow, but it will never be possible to protect all fetchable informations without a HUGE performance impact, (possibly on M3 as well!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore there is a real possibility that the M3 devices experience longevity problems in the next years.&lt;/p&gt;

,chinalife,"New to the subreddit, but glad I was able to read through a lot of perspectives and experiences.

Just wanted to get more perspective and advice.

Currently in the US, with 10 years of experience in CPG, as a Marketing Manager, undergrad and MBA (Top 25 school). Wife (Still on Chinese passport), from Shanghai, is a bilingual Chinese Teacher at a US public school.  I'm also Chinese, but moved to the US a kid and grew up here.  Fluent in speaking, and proficient at reading, no writing skills :)

Wife got a job at a top international school in BJ and pretty adamant about moving. I do believe it's a very good opportunity for her and for our kids to attend. The plan is that she would start and I would hopefully follow in a year with our 2nd kid. I don't think I would have an issue living in BJ with 2 kids.  I have done remote work in SH and was pleasantly surprised with the experience, post COVID. I could almost get by as a local.  

My concern is that It would be hard for me as a US citizen to find a job, that could come close to replacement my salary in the US, and coming back to the US could also be potentially difficult.  

The best case scenario is that my company would give me an expat opportunity which is in discussion or place me in China as a ""local hire"" although our HQ is in SH and not BJ.

Outside of asking friends, and family for connection. I understand using your guanxi when able to in situation like this, but plan to tap in to it as a last resort.

I guess my question is, what should I expect in terms of looking for a job there? Outside of MNC, would any Chinese company hire a foreigner that's already there?  I have done some research in terms of job sites, as well as posting on company sites.  What would be the recommend way to even understand the opportunities that are out there? What could I expect for salary.  We are combined $225K in the US right now, and her BJ job would be $95K with additional housing assistance, so our COL would be quite low in BJ.

We could just do long distance for a couple of years.  I would need to figure out what to do with our house and stuff in the US. But reality is that this wasn't really a part of our life plan, or my life plan.  So all of sudden I'm finding myself needing to look for a job in China. 

Sorry for the rant, TIA.

Interviews:

Rice 9/10 - first interview so rlly nervous but went great, interviewer was sooo sweet and we are going into a similar field so we talked a lot abt that. They only asked pretty basic why school, what major, etc, those kind of questions. And then it was just me asking a lot of questions.

MIT 7.5/10 - the interviewer just seemed rlly cold and went to MIT for MBA not even undergrad so not too much to bond over, but they did emphasize much loved their time at MIT and called it life-changing. They began with emphasizing a few things like how conversational the interview was suppose to be but then began grinding me with questions üò≠ and was legit just taking notes the entire time. Gave 1-2 curveball questions but overall I think I did well.

URochester 9/10 - just a chill 30 min phone combo with pretty basic questions, interviewer was rlly nice and chill.

Princeton 8.5/10 - pretty decent. I answered the questions pretty well. Interviewer was rlly nice but our interests were just so different, but I managed to find one small thing to bond over at the end.

Duke 11/10 - absolutely LOVED my interviewer. Most sweetest and chill person ever. They only had 2 actual questions for me, and then they just asked abt my career and gave me a bunch advice on that and on college.

UPenn 8.5/10 - ummmm. Pretty hard to schedule cuz my interviewer checks their email every ‚Äú2-4 business days,‚Äù and kept giving tentative dates and never respond back until after the dates. Worst one because I was just extremely extremely nervous, which rlly sucks cuz it was my top choice school. Quite a few curveball questions which honestly I did not know how to answer and it was pretty obvious, but the interviewer was just so cool abt it and keep reassuring me üò≠. But I did well on the rest ig?? üî´üî´

Personal Statement 7/10 - Not my best work honestly since it was the first college essay I wrote. Picked a pretty common topic but had a slightly creative twist to it.

Supplementals 11/10 - For the most part, my supplementals were very good since I did like 10 drafts for each. I spent my entire summer on them and ended up with like 147 total pages. Especially loved my community and why us essays. I found ways to incorporate my ECs into a lot of my essays since I definitely think ECs were the most important part of my app.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviews:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rice 9/10 - first interview so rlly nervous but went great, interviewer was sooo sweet and we are going into a similar field so we talked a lot abt that. They only asked pretty basic why school, what major, etc, those kind of questions. And then it was just me asking a lot of questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT 7.5/10 - the interviewer just seemed rlly cold and went to MIT for MBA not even undergrad so not too much to bond over, but they did emphasize much loved their time at MIT and called it life-changing. They began with emphasizing a few things like how conversational the interview was suppose to be but then began grinding me with questions üò≠ and was legit just taking notes the entire time. Gave 1-2 curveball questions but overall I think I did well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;URochester 9/10 - just a chill 30 min phone combo with pretty basic questions, interviewer was rlly nice and chill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Princeton 8.5/10 - pretty decent. I answered the questions pretty well. Interviewer was rlly nice but our interests were just so different, but I managed to find one small thing to bond over at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duke 11/10 - absolutely LOVED my interviewer. Most sweetest and chill person ever. They only had 2 actual questions for me, and then they just asked abt my career and gave me a bunch advice on that and on college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPenn 8.5/10 - ummmm. Pretty hard to schedule cuz my interviewer checks their email every ‚Äú2-4 business days,‚Äù and kept giving tentative dates and never respond back until after the dates. Worst one because I was just extremely extremely nervous, which rlly sucks cuz it was my top choice school. Quite a few curveball questions which honestly I did not know how to answer and it was pretty obvious, but the interviewer was just so cool abt it and keep reassuring me üò≠. But I did well on the rest ig?? üî´üî´&lt;/p&gt;

,ukvisa,"Helloo,

I understand that one must live for 5 years continuously with no major gap in between to apply for ILR.

My concern is that if I decide to do a MBA after 2 years on work visa (in UK itself), will the one year gap on which I'll go back to student visa I believe cause issue in applying to ILR? 

Something like this:  
3 years on student visa  
\-  
2 years of work visa  
1 year of student visa  
2 year of work visa

Do I need to stay on work visa for all of the 5 years preceeding ILR application?

&lt;p&gt;I understand that one must live for 5 years continuously with no major gap in between to apply for ILR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My concern is that if I decide to do a MBA after 2 years on work visa (in UK itself), will the one year gap on which I&amp;#39;ll go back to student visa I believe cause issue in applying to ILR? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something like this:&lt;br/&gt;
3 years on student visa&lt;br/&gt;
-&lt;br/&gt;
2 years of work visa&lt;br/&gt;
1 year of student visa&lt;br/&gt;
2 year of work visa&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I need to stay on work visa for all of the 5 years preceeding ILR application?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

,CATpreparation,"24M GEM, 7/6/6, 12 months as an Engineering Trainee and then 8 months as Engineer - marketing in the same company.  


Panelists: 1F (P1), 2M (P1 &amp; P2), all were faculties and the interview was around 15-18 mins.  


P1: You have a very nice profile, 12 month as a trainee and then a jump to marketing, how?  
A - I was given the right opportunities to learn and grow within my company. (Could've been better but I was stumped and blushing)

P1: When was your company established, where was it established? Told

P1: People usually get into MBA to get into marketing and other roles where already worked in marketing, then why MBA?  
A - Ma'am I am 24 and I feel its the right time for me to get the holistic experience that a b-school provides in all aspects of growth so that I can transform into a good manager and a leader and make well informed decision considering all aspects of the business.

P1: Can we touch on some of your mechanical engineering subjects? Sure

P1: What is stress and strain? Told

P1: Draw stress strain diagram and explain? Told

P1: What are the types of stresses?  
A - Shear stress and axial stress, explained them as well (Brain dead moment, the answer was tensile, compression, torsional, etc but it didn't click at that time).

P2: Do you know what are SEZ ( Special economic zones)?   
A - Didn't know, I said I'll check it out after the interview

P2: What are multinational companies?  
A - Companies which are present in multiple countries. (Half correct, the correct is that a company which operates within its home country as well as other countries)

P2: What are transnational companies?  
A - Didn't know, I said I'll check it out after the interview

P2: What are some chip manufacturing companies?  
A - Didn't click so I said I'll check after the interview. (Ik, this is BAD, the answer was so obvious)

P3: Who is India's competition?  
A - China

P3: 2 Strengths and 1 weakness of India and china?  
A - Started out as democracy vs authoritarian but somehow got interrupted.

P3: Why do you look so different from your photo?  
A - Sir I knew this would be a problem (because I've grew long of hairs, well groomed though), SO I have my Aadhar card with me.  


(All started laughing)  


P1: But you knew that you have to be formal in the interview.....  
A - Ma'am the email asked me to wear formals, I am wearing shirt and am well groomed as well. (At first I thought they expected a blazer and a tie)

P1: But why the long hair?  
A - Ma'am I feel they are well groomed as well, I am also wearing a hairband so that they don't look messy.

P1: Why did you decide to grow long hair?  
A - Ma'am actually my managing director has long hairs and we both love the same genre of music, Rock and Roll.

P1: How did rock and roll start?  
A - Answered.

P3: I thought you are a Thala fan

(Everyone laughed)  


P2: Okay, thank you, you can log off.  


Me: (I froze for 5 seconds because I didn't expect the interview to be over so soon) Okay sir, thank you sirs, and ma'am. I just want to say that I was going through the XIMB website and noticed that XIMB provides pre-MBA classes for all the converted students to teach them the basics of Accounts, finance, etc, because it is very difficult for say an Engineer like me to learn the sophisticated terms of other subjects and this kind of levels the playing field a bit.  


P1: Something Something...... (dont remember) when you are at XIMB/at the b-school (something in those terms but positive)  
Me: I'll be lucky to be in XIMB ma'am, thank you so much, have a nice day  


What are your thoughts guys? yay or nay? IK, some answers could've been better but ahh...wth.

A - Didn&amp;#39;t know, I said I&amp;#39;ll check it out after the interview&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P2: What are multinational companies?&lt;br/&gt;
A - Companies which are present in multiple countries. (Half correct, the correct is that a company which operates within its home country as well as other countries)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P2: What are transnational companies?&lt;br/&gt;
A - Didn&amp;#39;t know, I said I&amp;#39;ll check it out after the interview&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P2: What are some chip manufacturing companies?&lt;br/&gt;
A - Didn&amp;#39;t click so I said I&amp;#39;ll check after the interview. (Ik, this is BAD, the answer was so obvious)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P3: Who is India&amp;#39;s competition?&lt;br/&gt;
A - China&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P3: 2 Strengths and 1 weakness of India and china?&lt;br/&gt;
A - Started out as democracy vs authoritarian but somehow got interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P3: Why do you look so different from your photo?&lt;br/&gt;
A - Sir I knew this would be a problem (because I&amp;#39;ve grew long of hairs, well groomed though), SO I have my Aadhar card with me.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(All started laughing)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P1: But you knew that you have to be formal in the interview.....&lt;br/&gt;
A - Ma&amp;#39;am the email asked me to wear formals, I am wearing shirt and am well groomed as well. (At first I thought they expected a blazer and a tie)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P1: But why the long hair?&lt;br/&gt;
A - Ma&amp;#39;am I feel they are well groomed as well, I am also wearing a hairband so that they don&amp;#39;t look messy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P1: Why did you decide to grow long hair?&lt;br/&gt;
A - Ma&amp;#39;am actually my managing director has long hairs and we both love the same genre of music, Rock and Roll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P1: How did rock and roll start?&lt;br/&gt;
A - Answered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P3: I thought you are a Thala fan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Everyone laughed)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P2: Okay, thank you, you can log off.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: (I froze for 5 seconds because I didn&amp;#39;t expect the interview to be over so soon) Okay sir, thank you sirs, and ma&amp;#39;am. I just want to say that I was going through the XIMB website and noticed that XIMB provides pre-MBA classes for all the converted students to teach them the basics of Accounts, finance, etc, because it is very difficult for say an Engineer like me to learn the sophisticated terms of other subjects and this kind of levels the playing field a bit.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P1: Something Something...... (dont remember) when you are at XIMB/at the b-school (something in those terms but positive)&lt;br/&gt;
Me: I&amp;#39;ll be lucky to be in XIMB ma&amp;#39;am, thank you so much, have a nice day  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts guys? yay or nay? IK, some answers could&amp;#39;ve been better but ahh...wth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

,CryptoCurrency,"I bought a MBA M3 15‚Äù 24GB/1TB two weeks ago.

Today is the 14th day and I pulled the trigger (in the other direction).

Believe me, it is an impressive machine, the best laptop in the world probably.

The GoFetch vulnerability scared me, but what forced me to return is how the vulnerability has been managed from Apple: just silence.

Apple has been informed on 5th of December about it. No real comments about it right now.

If you do not know GoFetch please read the details about it, just search ‚ÄúGoFetch vulnerability‚Äù.

I made my own research a lot and I would like to share my knowledge about information that are difficult to find or understand immediately:

- This is a new vulnerability, the paper is new and not peer reviewed but the authors are reliable experts
- The risk is considered low right now
- The vulnerability is theoretically VERY bad
- In the real world it could be nothing or a disaster, we still do not know if the research was conducted on Linux Asahi or MacOS Sonoma. If the former than it could be a no issue for Sonoma
- The research was conducted with a quiet environment in the L2, could it work on a normal device in normal activity?
- It is fake news that physical control of the machine is needed, it could theoretically happen remotely, theoretically through Java Scripts visiting a website. Theoretically because like already said, it is not known exactly what are the precise limits and conditions. But these vectors can not be excluded either!
- User privileges are enough, Admin/Root is NOT needed.
- The issue involves the private keys, but this might be just the appetizer. The original paper itself explains that every cached information could be - again, theoretically - fetched.
- The research ran on M1 Chips, but is reasonable to speculate that M2 and M3 are involved as well.
- In this case the M1+M2 have a different mitigation as M3, maybe a less efficient on. The consequence of these mitigations is a loss in performance but it is not known how much thus if it is relevant. 
- If the problem is real (read above) and therefore a mitigation is needed, then the loss in performance is probably very acceptable in order to protect the private keys on M3 BUT (!) the software developers must independently employ the mitigation, as there is not - right now - a system patch through Apple. 
- In order to protect the private keys there should be mitigations on M1+M2 as well (run the encryption through the efficiency cores only) but they are more difficult to implement. In oder to protect just the private keys, then the performance should not be impacted too much on M1+M2 too.
- If the attack goes public and mainstream and it works good on MacOS, remotely through JavaScripts and with a noisy L2 and without much knowledge and control about what is running on the system‚Ä¶ if, if, if‚Ä¶ then the far west is coming.
- In this worst case scenario, it should be then always possible to protect the private keys somehow, but it will never be possible to protect all fetchable informations without a HUGE performance impact, (possibly on M3 as well!).

Therefore there is a real possibility that the M3 devices experience longevity problems in the next years.

,Zepbound,"Motivation

This medication helps a lot. It makes what we‚Äôre doing possible, but it‚Äôs not magic. To get results there is work to be done. And that‚Äôs the business we‚Äôre in guys‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre weight losing craftsmen and we‚Äôre working on our craft. There is nothing easy about the business we are in. 

Like anything else, there are good days and there are hard days. It‚Äôs the hard days that define us. It‚Äôs digging deep when we have to, it‚Äôs about getting up when we get knocked down, it‚Äôs about keeping our composure when we get punched in the face, it‚Äôs about keeping our focus on our goal. 

I started this journey more motivated to make a lasting and sustainable change than any other time I‚Äôve tried to lose weight in my life. I don‚Äôt know exactly why that is, nor do I know how to manufacture that - simply said I think this is something that has to come from within. Something finally clicked and I told myself ‚Äúyou‚Äôve always told yourself that one day you‚Äôd get your weight under control and you kicked the can down the road, well there isn‚Äôt any more road left, Launch, so now is the time‚Äù.  And I‚Äôm pretty sure that all of us got pretty highly motivated in our own ways - we wouldn‚Äôt have taken the steps to be where we are today if we weren‚Äôt significantly motivated. 

But there is a difference between getting motivated and staying motivated, and that‚Äôs the whole point of this post. Unlike the initial motivation that got me to start this process of losing weight, I believe that I can manufacture and continue to sustain personal motivation to keep me going on this journey. So my intention with this post is to share the things I‚Äôm doing to keep my motivation super high in case any of these ideas feel like they would work for you, and I‚Äôm hoping to find out any tips for what works for you. 

So here are the things that are working for me:

1) Big and Small Goals - I have three goals: my total weight loss is my long term goal, and I don‚Äôt even have this goal define yet as a number, my plan is to figure that out with my PCP at my next checkup. My mid term goal is to lose 100 pounds in 2024. My short term goal is always in 5 pound increments of loss. I‚Äôm working on a -45 pound milestone right now. These 5 pound milestones are the ones I celebrate with my ‚Äúaccountability people‚Äù. 

2) Accountability - In the past I usually didn‚Äôt share that I was trying to lose weight with a lot of people. I probably didn‚Äôt want to because I didn‚Äôt want my failure to evident to them and I probably didn‚Äôt really believe that I could achieve what I was trying to do. So definitely my wife would know when I was dieting, maybe told my brother, maybe someone at work knew I was eating Paleo or whatever diet fad at the moment‚Ä¶ but this time I did something different. I told a lot of people - I told my whole family, I told my group of best friends, I told my boss and a bunch of other people at work, peers and even people reporting to me‚Ä¶ and I didn‚Äôt just tell them that I‚Äôm losing weight, I told them specifically that I‚Äôm going to lose 100 pounds this year. With all of these people I have built a long time reputation of achieving specific goals I set my mind to, so for me this means putting both my person and professional reputation on the line. 

3) Top of Mind - I try to keep everything related to this journey at the top of my thinking. That means being active on Reddit on different subs related to this medication but also fitness, nutrition, etc. getting motivated by seeing other people‚Äôs milestones achieved, and also seeing that it‚Äôs okay to have setbacks and watching others struggle with the same things. I truly feel like I‚Äôm part of a community this time, when every time before I felt pretty alone. If you‚Äôve ever been the one guy in a room of 30 women for a weight watchers meeting, you know the type of alone I mean. And not just Reddit, but also my podcast rotation is getting more and more about fitness, but also about self-improvement in general. And even though I don‚Äôt really feel like I need it, I also started Noon, just to keep me focused daily on this, force myself keep thinking about what I‚Äôm doing. 

4) Reminding myself of my real goal - for me weight loss is a short hand for what I want to achieve. Yes I want to lose weight for a lot of reasons, and many are pretty superficial- I want to look better, I don‚Äôt want to be the ‚Äúbig guy‚Äù any more, I want to be able to see my dick without having to try to see around my stomach‚Ä¶ and some are very practical- I want to be able to do physical activity better, I want to fit better in a plane seat, I want to be able to hike further, I want to improve (maybe even cure?) my sleep apnea. But deep deep down there are really real and critically important goals- I want to live a longer life. I want to walk my daughters down the aisle, I want to travel when I retire, I don‚Äôt want to leave my wife a widow for 20+ years. These last goals are the ones that I force myself to think about, and this is new for me, and they are hard and scary to think about, because not achieving those goals are really hard things to think about - leaving my kids without a father, working hard my whole life and not being able to enjoy it, leaving my life partner to navigate this world alone‚Ä¶. I can‚Äôt let any of those things happen, not if I can control it. 

5) My personal mission statement - I got my MBA about a decade ago - and at the beginning of that program we wrote personal mission statements as an exercise. I gave up on New Year‚Äôs resolutions a long time ago, countless times I resolved to diet, etc, and it never lasted. But I have created a habit of rewriting my personal mission statement every year in January for the last decade. This has been very helpful for me to really think about what it is that I want to live for (I.e purpose) and who I want to be and what I stand for. For the first time in my life I printed this out (small canvas print that I ordered online) and hung it up in the bathroom above the toilet. Every morning I wake up, pee, and then I read my mission statement to myself as a reminder to start my day. Even though this is something deeply personal and pretty private I want to share it here with you fine people, especially the first line and the second to last line because this is what is also drives and motivates me to put in the hard work that is needed to lose weight. 

I hope there was something in that list that resonates with you. What keeps you on track deep down? How are you handling the business of weight loss?",t2_5fbab,False,,0.0,False,Motivation,[],r/Zepbound,False,,,0.0,139.0,,True,t3_1bqq6io,False,light,1.0,,public,1.0,0.0,{},140.0,,False,[],,True,False,,{},Tips/Tricks,False,1.0,,False,False,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/8me2hI0kXVIvD62lZvZYPhOQXrM0eH9MxW-RxO6muHE.jpg,False,,[],{},,False,,1711721290.0,text,,,,text,i.redd.it,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motivation&lt;/p&gt;

Yes I want to lose weight for a lot of reasons, and many are pretty superficial- I want to look better, I don‚Äôt want to be the ‚Äúbig guy‚Äù any more, I want to be able to see my dick without having to try to see around my stomach‚Ä¶ and some are very practical- I want to be able to do physical activity better, I want to fit better in a plane seat, I want to be able to hike further, I want to improve (maybe even cure?) my sleep apnea. But deep deep down there are really real and critically important goals- I want to live a longer life. I want to walk my daughters down the aisle, I want to travel when I retire, I don‚Äôt want to leave my wife a widow for 20+ years. These last goals are the ones that I force myself to think about, and this is new for me, and they are hard and scary to think about, because not achieving those goals are really hard things to think about - leaving my kids without a father, working hard my whole life and not being able to enjoy it, leaving my life partner to navigate this world alone‚Ä¶. I can‚Äôt let any of those things happen, not if I can control it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) My personal mission statement - I got my MBA about a decade ago - and at the beginning of that program we wrote personal mission statements as an exercise. I gave up on New Year‚Äôs resolutions a long time ago, countless times I resolved to diet, etc, and it never lasted. But I have created a habit of rewriting my personal mission statement every year in January for the last decade. This has been very helpful for me to really think about what it is that I want to live for (I.e purpose) and who I want to be and what I stand for. For the first time in my life I printed this out (small canvas print that I ordered online) and hung it up in the bathroom above the toilet. Every morning I wake up, pee, and then I read my mission statement to myself as a reminder to start my day. Even though this is something deeply personal and pretty private I want to share it here with you fine people, especially the first line and the second to last line because this is what is also drives and motivates me to put in the hard work that is needed to lose weight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope there was something in that list that resonates with you. What keeps you on track deep down? How are you handling the business of weight loss?&lt;/p&gt;

,mac,"I live in Italy and I'm currently looking for a MacBook with an M1/M2 chip (possibly even M3). My requirements shouldn't be extraordinary by any means but I'm struggling to find what I actually want for a reasonable price.

My requirements are the following

* US ANSI keyboard
* 16GB of RAM
* Not overpriced

I feel like I'm living the three toggles meme looking for a damn laptop here in Italy.

[Amazon.it](https://Amazon.it) currently sells only base-model Macbook Airs (8gb RAM, DoA for me) and even then, only Italian ISO layout would be available. For reference, the M2 MBA in 8/256 now sells for 1099 euros, which is... okay.

Then there's the official [Apple.com](https://Apple.com) website, where I can configure a Macbook Air to my likings. Except the prices are not... reasonable at all. The base model M2 MBA goes for 1249 euros. M3 goes for 1349.16GB of RAM is +230 euros. Grand total for the M2 MBA in 16/256 would be 1479 and for reference the same laptop in the USA would be 1112 euros without tax. Adding 22% VAT that would translate to roughly 1250 euros and considering our wages are dogshit compared to the States I don't think there's the need to keep going with this topic.

Anyways, the big question is - are there any websites, other than Apple, that are currently selling ARM Macbooks (even refurbished) with an American keyboard (and more than 8gb of RAM)?

As I mentioned before, I am from Italy but I'd be able to get one in Austria too since that's where my girlfriend is from.

Hi I am looking for advice. 
Short background on me. I am 30yrs old recently went back to school to finish my Bachelors in Finance, with only 2 semesters left. I have 8 years of management / sales experience and 2 years of analyst experience in Allocations (Logistics). 
I have been slowly networking and getting information and advice from people in the finance field from alumni, bankers, business owners, and corporate finance people that I know. 

My current job pays well but my wife is already pretty successful so we are in a position for me to move into something with less pay to get into the finance industry and I have her full support. 

I guess I‚Äôm looking for some advice from anyone on here as to what would be beneficial my last year in undergrad? Planning on doing MBA maybe with some experience under my belt first too. 

Would an internship be the right path? 
Straight into MBA? 
I know it‚Äôs vague and I might be ‚Äúlate‚Äù to the game but I appreciate any piece of advice y‚Äôall got!

,MBA,"**TLDR: Transitioning to MBB/Tier 2 Consulting in the UK from a Big 4 Firm in APAC - what can I do to achieve it.**

Recently, I applied to an MBA program at LBS (my only choice), but, unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately), I was rejected. While I initially felt the sting of rejection, I am gradually coming to terms with it, believing that rejection is merely redirection.

I am currently employed with a Big 4 practice in the APAC region, working on a value-creation project with a focus on operational improvements and cost optimization. Before this, I was in governance and risk consulting for about three years. Having been with the same firm for five years, I am now looking to broaden my horizons.

I have always aspired to have an international career and am particularly interested in working in the UK, with the possibility of extending my reach to wider Europe or the Middle East. While I am aware that I could leverage the network of member firms to achieve this, my preference is to move outside the firm if possible. To clarify, there isn't a strong push factor prompting this desire‚Äîrather, it's the allure of opportunities beyond my current scope that draws me. Moreover having a global career is something that interest me much.¬†

I aspire to move into MBB/Tier 2 strategy and operations consulting, intending to eventually transition into a PE operations role managing port cos. This ambition prompted my MBA application and my interest in moving abroad. However, given that my initial plan did not come to fruition, I am seeking advice on alternative paths that could lead me to MBB/Tier 2 consulting roles in the UK, specifically London, given my background.

I may consider applying for an MBA again, but certainly not for the Class of 2027, as my rejection was for Round 2 of the Class of 2026. The earliest I might apply would be for the Class of 2028, provided I still want to pursue an MBA and may not have achieved my desired career trajectory or am not on the path to it by then.

FYI I am 28 this year and if I were to apply for Class of 2028 I will be 30 and by graduation will be 32 - not sure if this is too old. Additionally, I will certainly need visa sponsorship if I were to work in the UK unless its an international secondment within my firm.

To clarify, there isn&amp;#39;t a strong push factor prompting this desire‚Äîrather, it&amp;#39;s the allure of opportunities beyond my current scope that draws me. Moreover having a global career is something that interest me much.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I aspire to move into MBB/Tier 2 strategy and operations consulting, intending to eventually transition into a PE operations role managing port cos. This ambition prompted my MBA application and my interest in moving abroad. However, given that my initial plan did not come to fruition, I am seeking advice on alternative paths that could lead me to MBB/Tier 2 consulting roles in the UK, specifically London, given my background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may consider applying for an MBA again, but certainly not for the Class of 2027, as my rejection was for Round 2 of the Class of 2026. The earliest I might apply would be for the Class of 2028, provided I still want to pursue an MBA and may not have achieved my desired career trajectory or am not on the path to it by then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FYI I am 28 this year and if I were to apply for Class of 2028 I will be 30 and by graduation will be 32 - not sure if this is too old. Additionally, I will certainly need visa sponsorship if I were to work in the UK unless its an international secondment within my firm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any insights, advice, or experiences shared would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

,WGU,"I'm trying to finish in 20 weeks.... just because it's ""Purdue"" is cool.

WGU sucks....

I'm kidding. Listen, no matter how you get it done, get it done. Learn as much as you can and enjoy the journey. I have a coworker who graduated from GA State University and she don't know ""ish"", a manager who has an MBA from UGA and she can't manage. Getting a degree means you understood the courses, it doesn't mean you know what you are doing and how to apply them. That task is up to you. WGU gets you career ready.

I didn't realize this but they have testers for these course. I guess they are current professionals in the field of study, who get paid to make sure the course is useful. Idk. Ive visted other online program forums and none of the communities are as great as this one. 

Side note..I may go here after I'm done with my BAITM and MSHRM...

Oh before I forget...the MSHRM is a great value for that program. The workplace credential alone is worth $2k. It's aligned with SHRM and HRCi but it's a fresh alignment. As in other schools aren't up to date with their HR program. Take advantage. I have two months before my term ends and 8 classes. Let me get to work. Hahaha

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m kidding. Listen, no matter how you get it done, get it done. Learn as much as you can and enjoy the journey. I have a coworker who graduated from GA State University and she don&amp;#39;t know &amp;quot;ish&amp;quot;, a manager who has an MBA from UGA and she can&amp;#39;t manage. Getting a degree means you understood the courses, it doesn&amp;#39;t mean you know what you are doing and how to apply them. That task is up to you. WGU gets you career ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t realize this but they have testers for these course. I guess they are current professionals in the field of study, who get paid to make sure the course is useful. Idk. Ive visted other online program forums and none of the communities are as great as this one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side note..I may go here after I&amp;#39;m done with my BAITM and MSHRM...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh before I forget...the MSHRM is a great value for that program. The workplace credential alone is worth $2k. It&amp;#39;s aligned with SHRM and HRCi but it&amp;#39;s a fresh alignment. As in other schools aren&amp;#39;t up to date with their HR program. Take advantage. I have two months before my term ends and 8 classes. Let me get to work. Hahaha &lt;/p&gt;

,CATpreparation,"**Profile:** GEM (24 yo)  
10th: 9.6 CGPA, 12th: 91, [B.Tech](https://B.Tech) (Mech): 9.35 CGPA  
20 months of work experience in Technology consulting space (still working)

**2022: Building Blocks**  
The story starts when I was in my penultimate year of undergrad and was sure that I do not want to work in the core mechanical engineering sector. So, the next obvious step was to explore other avenues and that is when data science caught my eye. So I honed my skills and took an off campus job in the same domain. This was in Jan 2022. I was enjoying my work there but it was around September that I realized the scope of impact business consultants and product managers made to a project. I was quite intrigued by their work - began researching and that is when I realized the next step for me to get into Product roles, has to be an MBA from a Tier-1 insti. Started preparing for CAT alongside my job. Prepped for around 1.5 months and scored **92.38 percentile**.  
Got only CAP calls, had applied nowhere else. **Converted none**.

**2023: The sprint**  
I knew that given an ample amount of time, I should be able to score a good percentile in CAT. Started prep from April, enrolled in a test series, purchased Arun Sharma's books , solved the problems diligently. For VARC, I made a habit to read newspaper for half an hour before office and made sure to solve and analyze at least 1 RC per day. Similarly for LRDI, I solved 1 set per day. I practiced QA on weekends as that was my strongest suit. The targets I set for myself were quite attainable.  
Of course I increased the number (of RCs and LRDI puzzled) to 5-7 per day as the CAT approached.  
Meanwhile my job got pretty hectic as I was promoted to senior position within the company and this took a toll on my prep. Took a week leave from work before CAT (which was quite necessary).  
Got a **percentile of 98.29 with a meagre 64.xx percentile in LRDI.**   
**XAT - 97.453x (all sectionals cleared)**  
Didn't qualify for CAP, SPJIMR, IITB, IITD. BLACKISM was out of question given the scenario this year (especially being a GEM). Converted IMT-G's PGDM core and will probably convert XIMB as well. XLRI(BM) interview didn't go as expected. I have a call from IIFT which to be frank is my best bet at the moment.  
If I don't convert IIFT (Delhi) or XLRI(BM) this year I will probably repeat and take my last shot at CAT this year with an aim of getting into BLACKISM, SPJIMR, FMS. Will take GMAT as well for ISB. Cannot settle for anything less.

I see pros to both:

MBB:
- prepared to be an operational leader and advisor
- better interim exit opportunities into corporate strategy and leadership roles
- broader skillset
- executive presence and leadership

IB:
- core finance skills will vastly increase ability to actually raise the capital to do any of these paths
- connections with LPs
- more direct path to traditional PE opportunities

Hello. During the current round 1 of university admissions, I have applied for BS in Media Sciences at Szabist Karachi and have been selected. I have also applied for BBA at CBM/IOBM, the final list will be out soon in a few days. Anyways my question is: is a BBA worth it because I'm hearing different stories all of a sudden why it's a waste in Pakistan, would it be better to pursue Media instead?

As far as my interests are concerned, I have read the semester outlines and I'm fine with doing any of these two programs. My plan after graduation is to either go abroad for work or work here and use the money to do an MBA, this brings my second question: is it wise to do an MBA after BBA or is it better to do any bachelors degree + MBA?

I‚Äôm Aryan, 18 y/o raising funds for CANCER TREATMENT of my father. Our family is facing a tough battle as my father has been diagnosed with cancer. The doctors say it's still early, and surgery could be the solution. But the expenses are overwhelming us. We're struggling to afford his medications, tests, surgery and my sister's and my own education fees.

Dad is more worried about our future than his own health. He blames himself for not being able to provide for us during this time. I'm in 12th grade, studying hard for IIT-JEE and my sister is preparing for civil services as she wants to become an IAS Officer. She is in Delhi University right now. We both are academically inclined, I secured 95% scholarship in recent vidyamandir classes IIT-JEE scholarship test &amp; my sister scored 97% in 10th class with 100/100 in maths. She is also preparing for CAT (to do MBA from top IIM) as a backup option. We don't want to be burden on him. We want to make him proud, but we can't do it alone. We are only raising the amount, which we are unable to arrange through loans and savings. We're reaching out for help, for his treatment and our education so that one day me and my sister can donate back to society. Every little contribution counts, it could be sharing this page with your friends &amp; family or 1 upvote also. Your Donation can make a difference in saving a kind man‚Äôs life and helping his son(18) and daughter(20) fulfill their childhood dreams of becoming an Engineer &amp; IAS officer respectively. 

My dad also visited Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai, but the wait is too long, like 1.5-2 months. They quoted around 3 lakhs just for surgery only, plus more for radiation and meds. Now it makes sense to get the treatment started from somewhere else If we‚Äôre getting similar cost but asap, rather than waiting &amp; letting the cancer grow. One of our relatives is a dentist, she referred him to one surgeon in Mumbai and right now he is overseeing him. Let's come together to support my dad in his fight against cancer and ease his worries about our future. Thank you from the depths of our hearts for your kindness and support during this incredibly challenging time.

""Aditi, now 29, is what neighbours and relatives want their daughters to be. A quiet, well-mannered woman, Aditi has gone on to lengths to have this facade working. From visiting temples, to dressing modestly, to working at a high-paying job after completing her MBA from an Ivy League university - she has done it all.

However, Aditi harbors a secret that only she, and a select few know. A crazed nymphomaniac, Aditi was diagnosed with hypersexuality when she was 16. The next few years saw Aditi learning how to manage her needs, waking up most mornings, disgusted with the choices she made the night before.\\

Plenty of therapy sessions later - today Aditi is at a stage in her life, where she is well-versed with managing both her tame, domesticated side, and her wild and irrationally corrupted side

However, fate has dealt her another strange deck of cards. Her father, a well-known builder, has arranged Aditi's marriage to Sanjay, an investment banker, son of an equally wealthy businessman in Mumbai.

To her dismay, Aditi soon realises that Sanjay is diametrically opposite to her. With just one 1-year relationship in his life, Sanjay is both inexperienced in matters of sex - and matters of managing a woman's emotions.

**This roleplay has multiple directions it could go**

\- It could be an interesting slice of life, transformation roleplay, where Aditi will make Sanjay understand her nymphomania, and take him to sexual journeys that he never imagined (the most preferred)

\- Aditi can start living another double life, having affairs on side (I'll play multiple characters, not something I'd prefer but can try).

**With that said, my ideal partner would be someone who -**

\-has a flair in writing, can write in multiple paragraphs (5-6 lines), is comfortable in English, Hindi, Hinglish

,MenOnTirz,"This medication helps a lot. It makes what we‚Äôre doing possible, but it‚Äôs not magic. To get results there is work to be done. And that‚Äôs the business we‚Äôre in guys‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre weight losing craftsmen and we‚Äôre working on our craft. There is nothing easy about the business we are in. 

Like anything else, there are good days and there are hard days. It‚Äôs the hard days that define us. It‚Äôs digging deep when we have to, it‚Äôs about getting up when we get knocked down, it‚Äôs about keeping our composure when we get punched in the face, it‚Äôs about keeping our focus on our goal. 

I started this journey more motivated to make a lasting and sustainable change than any other time I‚Äôve tried to lose weight in my life. I don‚Äôt know exactly why that is, nor do I know how to manufacture that - simply said I think this is something that has to come from within. Something finally clicked and I told myself ‚Äúyou‚Äôve always told yourself that one day you‚Äôd get your weight under control and you kicked the can down the road, well there isn‚Äôt any more road left, Launch, so now is the time‚Äù.  And I‚Äôm pretty sure that all of us got pretty highly motivated in our own ways - we wouldn‚Äôt have taken the steps to be where we are today if we weren‚Äôt significantly motivated. 

But there is a difference between getting motivated and staying motivated, and that‚Äôs the whole point of this post. Unlike the initial motivation that got me to start this process of losing weight, I believe that I can manufacture and continue to sustain personal motivation to keep me going on this journey. So my intention with this post is to share the things I‚Äôm doing to keep my motivation super high in case any of these ideas feel like they would work for you, and I‚Äôm hoping to find out any tips for what works for you. 

So here are the things that are working for me:

1) Big and Small Goals - I have three goals: my total weight loss is my long term goal, and I don‚Äôt even have this goal define yet as a number, my plan is to figure that out with my PCP at my next checkup. My mid term goal is to lose 100 pounds in 2024. My short term goal is always in 5 pound increments of loss. I‚Äôm working on a -45 pound milestone right now. These 5 pound milestones are the ones I celebrate with my ‚Äúaccountability people‚Äù. 

2) Accountability - In the past I usually didn‚Äôt share that I was trying to lose weight with a lot of people. I probably didn‚Äôt want to because I didn‚Äôt want my failure to evident to them and I probably didn‚Äôt really believe that I could achieve what I was trying to do. So definitely my wife would know when I was dieting, maybe told my brother, maybe someone at work knew I was eating Paleo or whatever diet fad at the moment‚Ä¶ but this time I did something different. I told a lot of people - I told my whole family, I told my group of best friends, I told my boss and a bunch of other people at work, peers and even people reporting to me‚Ä¶ and I didn‚Äôt just tell them that I‚Äôm losing weight, I told them specifically that I‚Äôm going to lose 100 pounds this year. With all of these people I have built a long time reputation of achieving specific goals I set my mind to, so for me this means putting both my person and professional reputation on the line. 

3) Top of Mind - I try to keep everything related to this journey at the top of my thinking. That means being active on Reddit on different subs related to this medication but also fitness, nutrition, etc. getting motivated by seeing other people‚Äôs milestones achieved, and also seeing that it‚Äôs okay to have setbacks and watching others struggle with the same things. I truly feel like I‚Äôm part of a community this time, when every time before I felt pretty alone. If you‚Äôve ever been the one guy in a room of 30 women for a weight watchers meeting, you know the type of alone I mean. And not just Reddit, but also my podcast rotation is getting more and more about fitness, but also about self-improvement in general. And even though I don‚Äôt really feel like I need it, I also started Noon, just to keep me focused daily on this, force myself keep thinking about what I‚Äôm doing. 

4) Reminding myself of my real goal - for me weight loss is a short hand for what I want to achieve. Yes I want to lose weight for a lot of reasons, and many are pretty superficial- I want to look better, I don‚Äôt want to be the ‚Äúbig guy‚Äù any more, I want to be able to see my dick without having to try to see around my stomach‚Ä¶ and some are very practical- I want to be able to do physical activity better, I want to fit better in a plane seat, I want to be able to hike further, I want to improve (maybe even cure?) my sleep apnea. But deep deep down there are really real and critically important goals- I want to live a longer life. I want to walk my daughters down the aisle, I want to travel when I retire, I don‚Äôt want to leave my wife a widow for 20+ years. These last goals are the ones that I force myself to think about, and this is new for me, and they are hard and scary to think about, because not achieving those goals are really hard things to think about - leaving my kids without a father, working hard my whole life and not being able to enjoy it, leaving my life partner to navigate this world alone‚Ä¶. I can‚Äôt let any of those things happen, not if I can control it. 

5) My personal mission statement - I got my MBA about a decade ago - and at the beginning of that program we wrote personal mission statements as an exercise. I gave up on New Year‚Äôs resolutions a long time ago, countless times I resolved to diet, etc, and it never lasted. But I have created a habit of rewriting my personal mission statement every year in January for the last decade. This has been very helpful for me to really think about what it is that I want to live for (I.e purpose) and who I want to be and what I stand for. For the first time in my life I printed this out (small canvas print that I ordered online) and hung it up in the bathroom above the toilet. Every morning I wake up, pee, and then I read my mission statement to myself as a reminder to start my day. Even though this is something deeply personal and pretty private I want to share it here with you fine gentlemen, especially the first line and the second to last line because this is what is also drives and motivates me to put in the hard work that is needed to lose weight. 

I hope there was something in that list that resonates with you. What keeps you on track deep down?

,MBA,"Hi everyone! I‚Äôm sure there are similar LBS vs Cambridge vs Oxford posts here, but I haven‚Äôt found any related to entrepreneurship. I‚Äôm very grateful to be able to choose between LBS, Cambridge, and Oxford for my MBA. My head and heart are torn between Cambridge and LBS. Which school would you consider better for entrepreneurial opportunities, start-up recruitment, and social impact?

I have a varied professional background (family business, entrepreneurship, and a small stint in e-commerce consulting‚Äîall in the Middle East). I have no desire to return to corporate life, and my post-MBA goals are to start a business, work at a startup, or work in social impact. My goal is to work in the UK for two years after graduation and then move back to Saudi Arabia.

Cambridge has the Cambridge Cluster, which means I could potentially work with start-ups there. I loved that Judge students can sit in on other faculty‚Äôs classes and really diversify their learning. The way the housing/college system is set up (mixing students from different faculties) seems to create an innovative/supportive community, which is really attractive to me. 

LBS has a two-year program, a larger network (esp in the Middle East), and the courses offered are much more varied and seem really interesting and challenging. I know I could learn and grow so much there, but I don‚Äôt necessarily sense an entrepreneurial culture. Although LBS has the Entrepreneurship Summer School and similar initiatives, it still feels very catered to corporate recruitment. This is just my opinion from visiting the school and talking to alumni. I could be wrong, so please shed some light if you‚Äôre an LBS student or alum. 

I‚Äôd appreciate any advice based on my goals, especially if you‚Äôve been to either of these schools. Thanks!

My offers:

* One of H/S for MBA
* One top European school (LBS/INSEAD) for MBA
* Top UK University (think Oxford/Cambridge) for research Masters in current industry (with full academic scholarship and living expenses)

Questions for you:

1. Am being asked by H/S whether I am considering another MBA or another degree. Should I be honest?
2. Would you go one step further and consider asking for a one-year deferral to pursue the fully funded research Masters?  

   1. Ultimately still want to switch career, but feels like an amazing opportunity to study at a top institution for free.
   2. I would not be considering this if it wasn't for the scholarship.
   3. Do they even often deferrals?

1. Am being asked by H/S whether I am considering another MBA or another degree. Should I be honest?
2. Would you go one step further and consider asking for a one-year deferral to pursue the fully funded research Masters? 
   1. Ultimately still want to switch career, but feels like an amazing opportunity to study at a top institution for free. 
   2. I would not be considering this if it wasn't for the scholarship.
   3. Do they even often deferrals?

Thank you. I know I'm in a really fortunate position; hope you all can share some insights.

I‚Äôm Aryan, 18 y/o raising funds for CANCER TREATMENT of my father. Our family is facing a tough battle as my father has been diagnosed with cancer. The doctors say it's still early, and surgery could be the solution. But the expenses are overwhelming us. We're struggling to afford his medications, tests, surgery and my sister's and my own education fees.

Dad is more worried about our future than his own health. He blames himself for not being able to provide for us during this time. I'm in 12th grade, studying hard for IIT-JEE and my sister is preparing for civil services as she wants to become an IAS Officer. She is in Delhi University right now. We both are academically inclined, I secured 95% scholarship in recent vidyamandir classes IIT-JEE scholarship test &amp; my sister scored 97% in 10th class with 100/100 in maths. She is also preparing for CAT (to do MBA from top IIM) as a backup option. We don't want to be burden on him. We want to make him proud, but we can't do it alone. We are only raising the amount, which we are unable to arrange through loans and savings. We're reaching out for help, for his treatment and our education so that one day me and my sister can donate back to society. Every little contribution counts, it could be sharing this page with your friends &amp; family or 1 upvote also. Your Donation can make a difference in saving a kind man‚Äôs life and helping his son(18) and daughter(20) fulfill their childhood dreams of becoming an Engineer &amp; IAS officer respectively. 

My dad also visited Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai, but the wait is too long, like 1.5-2 months. They quoted around 3 lakhs just for surgery only, plus more for radiation and meds. Now it makes sense to get the treatment started from somewhere else If we‚Äôre getting similar cost but asap, rather than waiting &amp; letting the cancer grow. One of our relatives is a dentist, she referred him to one surgeon in Mumbai and right now he is overseeing him. Let's come together to support my dad in his fight against cancer and ease his worries about our future. Thank you from the depths of our hearts for your kindness and support during this incredibly challenging time.

I‚Äôm Aryan, 18 y/o raising funds for CANCER TREATMENT of my father. Our family is facing a tough battle as my father has been diagnosed with cancer. The doctors say it's still early, and surgery could be the solution. But the expenses are overwhelming us. We're struggling to afford his medications, tests, surgery and my sister's and my own education fees.

Dad is more worried about our future than his own health. He blames himself for not being able to provide for us during this time. I'm in 12th grade, studying hard for IIT-JEE and my sister is preparing for civil services as she wants to become an IAS Officer. She is in Delhi University right now. We both are academically inclined, I secured 95% scholarship in recent vidyamandir classes IIT-JEE scholarship test &amp; my sister scored 97% in 10th class with 100/100 in maths. She is also preparing for CAT (to do MBA from top IIM) as a backup option. We don't want to be burden on him. We want to make him proud, but we can't do it alone. We are only raising the amount, which we are unable to arrange through loans and savings. We're reaching out for help, for his treatment and our education so that one day me and my sister can donate back to society.

,CATpreparation,"I've always wanted to study and work. After my graduation I wanted to go abroad and do my master's but considering the huge amount of money required to do so, my dream remained just that, a dream. Financial aid is available but those are extremely competitive and mostly available in ivy league which is way out of my league. I want to do MiM in France but it's so expensive.

I'm confused about profile building. In my previous post, I talked about how I did an internship for a shitty company that didn't pay me and didn't even give me a certificate. The one I'm doing right now is kind of similar, with absolutely zero communication from their side, which is hindering my progress.

I can't keep messing up like this. On top of that, parents don't support my plan of doing an mba. I can't keep failing at every internship. It gets difficult to give them an answer after every failed internship. 

Coming back to the title of the post, where the fuck do I get meaningful internships? I tried internshala, and when I finally got an hr internship,  for which I was very excited, it ended up being a borderline line sales job (made a post about it) My role was to call potential leads and take their aptitude test. I had to convince them that this is legit and not a scam. Correct me if I'm wrong, but that's not what hr is supposed to do. I wasted so much time on that, didn't get paid, no certificate either. 

I recently attended a webinar by an iim ahmedabad alumni about marketing, which confused me more. I asked the guy directly whether a digital marketing certification would help me because one of my friends is also doing it, and I thought it had a lot of scope. The guy basically said that it's not gonna do anything for me ""matlab bas usse ye hoga ki pata chalega ki tumhe usme interest hai"". He's an iim a alumni, so of course I take his word for it, but then what am I supposed to do now? I'm not gonna waste any money on certifications if this is the case.

,CATpreparation,"Need some advice 

I'm in a delima right now whether I should do ACCA or not. I don't know whether I'll be able to clear it or not, also I don't want to be writing exams for years as I feel if I don't pass I'll waste my years in exams instead of doing something productive like graduation with many upskilling.

Question is : Should I invest my time in ACCA or do my graduation with industry oriented courses (online upskilling) given below: 

* *ACCA Diploma in IFRS*
* *Certificate in Financial Modelling &amp; Valuation Online Live*
* *Certification in Blockchain Online Live*
* *Business Intelligence using Power BI and Tableau*
* *Post Graduate Programme in Finance and Accounting* (4-6 months)(This is more valuable I guess)
* *Certification in Investment Banking Online Live*

These certifications or courses are offered by a  company in top 5 of accounting firms.

The reason I'm asking this doubt is because I don't see myself working in a company for life, I want to work in a company to gain knowledge, exposure, experience and networking as far as the business world is concerned.
I see myself being a businessman, entrepreneur and investor in the long term.

Please give me your honest opinion about this.

,ExperiencedDevs,"Hello folks. This question will have some India-specific context but I'm hoping for input from everyone here!

I work as a C++ dev at an HFT in a core team (think OrderEntry/MarketData/Simulation) and have \~2 years of work experience. The work-life balance is decent and so is the compensation, however, I do not feel satisfied in my current role and am looking at potential options to transition to -

1. Transition to a quant role at an HFT, but I'm unsure if I'll get interviews given my experience as a c++ dev. Because I have experience in the industry, will I be expected to hit the ground running in a new junior quant role? If not, are there places that would train me as they would a junior quant who joins as a college fresher? (I'm only looking at quant roles because they're first-class citizens at HFTs, make good money and work on interesting problems).
2. This next option is evidence of how indecisive I am - should I maybe get an MS or an MBA and transition to a different role? I don't think an MS abroad opens new doors for me in India and I do not want to settle abroad in the long term. An MBA on the other hand can help me pivot to other roles, but I'd likely start at a much lower salary if I get a job in India.
3. Other options? Open to suggestions. Maybe just switch companies and grind it out?

Because if you have 5 Y.O.E in general in my industry, it would fetch you 40lpa, then two years more if I add MBA time, expect to add one more year and it would get 60LPA, so an increase to 120k from monetary terms didn't seem that much, definitely the overall experience of working in countries like Netherlands would be far better, but not accounting that I don't find it that lucrative.

&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts? Is a MS redundant if you&amp;#39;ve already completed the BS, have other degrees, relevant experience, and are more keen on operational forecasting than research? Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

,careerguidance,"
I'm currently working as a content marketer in India (basically I write ads &amp; comms for a product company.)

(3+ years of work-ex with 2 yrs in content; Pay is better than what people with the same work-ex in the same industry get)

I like the work, but I'm not as creative as my peers and have no concrete aspirations of venturing deeper into core advertising/design roles.

Additionally

* I have a keen interest in personal finance &amp; investing.
* I'm organised, methodical, and good at strategizing &amp; prioritizing things
* I don't have a good artistic sense, and I'm not a social media/content creation buff
* I'm good with numbers

Keeping the above points in mind, which industry should I switch to?

If I do, then is it possible to make the switch at the same pay/slightly higher pay?

For making the switch, will doing an online executive MBA help me in any way?

If not, then is there any specific marketing role that I can switch to that doesn't involve creativity/involves minimal creativity?  (Again at the same pay/slightly higher pay)

Step 1: Get a 700 or higher on the GMAT, if you can‚Äôt do this frankly you can wait 3 years to be a PM at a tech startup that doesn‚Äôt work and never will 

Disclaimer: This process quite literally took 5 years off of my life, I wasted my 20s drunk on GMATClub at the Bar, this is okay, every serious relationship I have been in has ended like a 60s era Ford Pinto 

Step 2: Have a REAL major, ‚ÄòOh im studying Organizational Psychology at (Middling state university or Money Laundering Private School)‚Äô Okay like I said you can wait to be a PM

I study engineering and was the TA for Thermo 1, this is not relevant to MBA programs I just really want the reader to be floored by my supposed intelligence

Step 3: This is by far the most important step and cannot be stated enough, LIE, lie on everything, lie on your resume, lie in your interviews, lie in your essays

If this makes you uncomfortable I hope you see the irony in wanting to pursue an MBA  

I told one AdCom I‚Äôm 6‚Äô5, Im 6‚Äô4, but I felt like an extra inch was what I needed to get off the waitlist. (I was right) 

Step 4: Pretend you know what you want to do as long as it‚Äôs not consulting, if it‚Äôs consulting you HAVE TO come up with a really lame answer to hide that fact. I told them I wanted to combine my engineering degree with a sustainability MBA in order to pursue my own CleanTech firm. (This was a blatant lie I don‚Äôt even believe in Climate Change) 

Step 5: ‚ÄòOh are you scared about recruiting and maybe not getting a salary that matches the investment?‚Äô 

No, ever since I was 12 I understood myself to be senior partner material 

THINGS THAT MIGHT HELP: If you grew up wealthy I cannot see you pulling this off. I am the descendant of generationally poor Irish Coal Miners. I was also regularly beaten by the Catholic nun who ran the gifted program at my Rust Belt elementary school.

,MBA,"Hi! This is my first post here but this community has been super helpful to me in the last year so thank you all for that! :) 

So a quick background -
- I worked for 1.5 years as an analyst in Barclays (as part of both middle and front office roles) before moving to my current job - I work at an Impact VC that is raising a fund to invest in Series B rounds of impactful companies (financial inclusion and climate solutions) and my experience so far has been extremely enriching.
- Done with GMAT classic, measly score of 690 but I won‚Äôt give it again. 
- I also have a small sustainability startup that I co-founded (we sell upcycled clothes and accessories in the UK, stitched by rural women in India - profitable but quite small).
- Have a small sustainability focused blog, started around a year ago, and a few published research papers and articles. 

Here‚Äôs the thing - by the time I apply for R1 in 2024 September (target schools Oxford, Cambridge, NUS, Melbourne and a few others like UBC) I‚Äôll have around 2.5 years of experience and 3 by the time I join and I‚Äôm starting to think it may not be enough; if I apply just a year later in 2025 then I‚Äôll have 3.5 years when applying and therefore 4 years when I join the program. The only issue is that the maximum possible position I can get in my current company is Analyst (as Associates need an MBA, CFA, or CA degree) and I‚Äôm not sure how it‚Äôll look if I have only ever been an analyst when I apply for an MBA. Not sure also if running a startup on the side qualifies as good management experience. 

Question: does it matter? Will that 1 year of experience make that much of a difference? Will it impact both admission and scholarship opportunities?

The only issue is that the maximum possible position I can get in my current company is Analyst (as Associates need an MBA, CFA, or CA degree) and I‚Äôm not sure how it‚Äôll look if I have only ever been an analyst when I apply for an MBA. Not sure also if running a startup on the side qualifies as good management experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question: does it matter? Will that 1 year of experience make that much of a difference? Will it impact both admission and scholarship opportunities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would appreciate your opinions a ton! &lt;/p&gt;

,college,"Hey everyone,

I have gotten through with college decisions - (I didn't get into my tops:( - but I have decided to choose between UA and IU. I am really stricken between the two, and would appreciate any help y'all could give me to help me decide. 

For some details, I got direct admission into Kelley School of Business and IU honors, and I also got into UA Culverhouse Business and their honors college. I live in Alabama so I will get instate tuition for UA. I will get OOS for Indiana. I am getting the top merit scholarships (presidential) for both universities, along with some extras for Bama. So, I am paying around 5k for Indiana, and around 3-7k for Bama (a year). I also really doubt I will get any financial aid from the FAFSA. 

My parents are gratefully paying for 2 years of my tuition, and the other two years I will get a loan for. My dad wants me to go to IU because he argues that I can pay the \~100k debt off fairly quickly because I will be single and he feels like I can budget correctly. And he believes if I work hard enough and strike a job in a top firm, my salary will be really good. He is telling me to not worry about the tuition so much, but it still is a big deal.  

I saw a similar post from **ScreenName77** on the website College Confidential and that person had some good stuff on the pros and cons of each university, but I wanted to ask again. Here is the link to that site[ https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/alabama-or-indiana/1794620](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/alabama-or-indiana/1794620). I am going to copy and paste some of the pros and cons that person listed cause it's a really good list.

""Education   
Bama: Alabama is ranked somewhere in the 80s for my major. That speaks for itself. I won‚Äôt have to worry about not getting classes I want.

IU: Kelley has the 8th ranked program in the country for my major. I was stunned after attending direct admit day, which is a massive presentation on Kelley for incoming students. They are a machine that provide their students incredible opportunities and prepare them extremely well for the real world. With their connections training it seems hard not to be successful. Also, a degree from Kelley can help me get into good grad schools. ""

Another thing I know is necessary for success in the business field is a more elite program within the business school. I know Bama‚Äôs business school has a business honors program that is 90 students and very competitive and cycles into top companies. Bama also has the Culverhouse Investment Management Group and the Investment Banking Academy (IBA), both of which are really elite and the IBA has 100% placement to top wall street firms. 

Kelly (IU business school) has something similar. Kelly has the Investment banking and investment management workshop, and they also have a HUGE networking group. Top in the country.

I plan to get an MBA after working a bit after college, where I plan to go to a top MBA school for finance. I don‚Äôt know for sure what I want to do as an occupation, but I love the stock market and Wall Street seems interesting. So maybe something finance related like investment banking, investment management, or something similar. 

Thank y'all so much for actually reading my huge post and helping me decide between Bama and IU. This is my future and any help will be appreciated so much. Thanks again!

,Mommit,"I (33F) am a single mom of 6, 13M, 12F, 12M, 9F, 6M, 3M. Divorced in 2022. We live in Brooklyn, but today my new employer confirmed that they can work with a start date of June, which coincides with the end of my kids‚Äô school year. It‚Äôs a director-level position for respiratory care, it‚Äôs in a university-affiliated hospital which means 100% tuition remission for my kids and for me to complete my MBA, more upward mobility, and with what I have saved we should be able to buy a house in a good school district within the next year. Home ownership here in Brooklyn is increasingly out of reach. However, the kids love Brooklyn and when I broke the news to them tonight, you would‚Äôve thought I told them we were moving to the underworld. I understand that they love the city, but it is just not sustainable for us. I tried to point out all the good things about the new city and acknowledge their feelings but then my 13yo son looked up some demographics. He goes, ‚Äúit says that 3.2% of this town‚Äôs population is Black! When we move there that might actually double.‚Äù They‚Äôre Afro-Latinos ‚Äî I am African-American and my ex-husband is Puerto Rican.  Needless to say, the kids are unhappy with finding out that we‚Äôll be leaving NY.

,MBA,"Profile: 335 GRE, 3.0 GPA, Comp Sci BA from Canadian university, ORM

I'm a 26M SWE working at a company named after a certain former mayor working on the financial engineering side. I applied R2 to T10 (excluding GSB and HBS) and got rejected from all of them. My only interview was at Tuck, which I think was mainly due to having connected with a Tuck alumni and adcom. My only acceptance was NYU (sticker) and I'm having mixed feelings about attending.

My main goal for attending MBA is to switch out of engineering, a career I don't enjoy and don't see a future for myself, and get into PM. My concern with NYU is that it's finance focused and not as well-rounded compared to other schools. Additionally, it's extremely expensive and the opportunity cost is massive. On the other hand, I'm not getting any younger and would like to leave engineering soon.

My GPA easily the weakest part of my profile and that won't change. While I am looking for a new job, I don't think it will make a massive difference in my profile. I am looking to be more involved with my volunteering extracurricular that might turn into a full-time job as PM/Tech lead, likely being the biggest change to my profile. Will R1 next year have a big difference compared to the results from R2 this year? I am also highly considering CBS January intake as it would allow me to graduate at the same time as the incoming 2024 class and can I find work part-time in the city. CBS was my number 1 choice throughout the process.

Also is it appropriate to go to admissions offices to ask these kind of questions? Like CBS January intake vs traditional fall 2025 intake.

,MBA,"M7 2023 grad here.  We all know the job market was brutal for '23 grads.. Finally found a job but at a 140K base salary with no bonus and simply had to take it.  I know I should be grateful because a ton of '23 grads are still looking - needless to say I'm still feeling pretty dejected about all of it.  

1st - I have student loans.  That's 1.5K a month right there. 

2nd - I live in an expensive market/the job is in office.  My rent is 3K which is not at all bad for where I am but that is almost half of my take home...  I'm single to boot so yup paying it all myself. 

3rd - credit card debt.  Racked that up over the months I was unemployed.. Putting 2K a month toward that.  

That literally leave me about 1000 or so for food/takehome.. 

In addition to all that, I don't even like my new job (it's basically my same job from before b school just at a diff company that paid peanuts for me cuz they knew they could).  During b-school I tried pivoting into a non-IB finance role but couldn't.. now with this current role, I don't even feel like I'll be able to in a year or so when the market improves and will become less likely the longer I'm on this trajectory.  I feel like the whole MBA was a waste.. I was even making more prior to b-school w bonus.  

Sorry for the downer post but anyone else in same boat?  I know I can prob try switching in a year or so but I feel like it will be a while (years) for the market to shake out in a way that could reasonably allow a pivot.

,gradadmissions,"I am about to finish the MENG program (AI/DS track) at UCLA and I want to share some of my thoughts about the program since it is quite new. I hope this can help you when making a decision.

**Pros:**

\- Weather is really nice. It is LA.

\- Tuition is relatively cheap. It is around 50k for the entire program.

\- Fast, complete within one year (we were allowed to extend for another semester this year)

\- Brand name 

\- The AI/DS courses offered at UCLA are really great, professors are great too

\- They will find you an internship for the summer (the capstone course), it is a great opportunity since you can put the company on the resume 

\- They also allow you to find your own internship for the summer. They do expect you to be within the US for the capstone course even though there are no lectures

\- The engineering department is really trying to advocate the program so we are treated pretty well.

**Cons:**

\- LA is really expensive and without a car it is pretty difficult to navigate, and if you are from the east  coast you may need some time to adjust

\- Quarter system

\- Your major is not printed on the degree, just Master of Engineering (honestly I don't think it matters)

\- The MBA courses are kinda meh, but the pros are that these courses are light so you can focus on other things

**Compare to MSCS**

\- The admission rate for MSCS is around 9 percent and MENG is around 30 percent. The data is actually skewed, since MSCS admission will prioritize Californian residents. You have a much better shot with the MENG program.

\- MENG students can take AI/DS courses offered by the COMSCI/ECE department, complete list is [here](https://grad.ucla.edu/programs/school-of-engineering-and-applied-science/engineering-master-of-engineering/). AI/DS courses tend to be popular, we had a easier time enrolling the courses compare to the MSCS students since these courses are required for us. I got most of the courses I wanted

\- It is not a CS degree, so you can't take courses like algorithms/web dev (technically you can but mostly likely you won't be able to)

\- Unlike MSCS, MENG is not a research program. You just take courses that's it. You can contact the professors if you want to work in their labs but it is up to you

**Overall:**

It is a great program if you want to specialize in ML. if you have more questions about the program feel free to comment below. I will try to answer them if I can but unfortunately I won't be able to answer admission related questions.

,GRE,"I hope these scores are competitive for top MBA programs especially because I come from an overrepresented community. Will the low AWA score be a problem?

Anyway wanted to give back to this thread by sharing some insights.

I used only Gregmat. Most authentic, genuine, affordable prep you can get.

TLDR: The big picture of my prep was following Greg and Vince‚Äôs strategy but I happily broke some rules along the way and experimented (as I was not very disciplined and I had a time constraint). 

I prepared for about 45 days alongside a full time job. The idea was to do the 1 month study plan, but I kinda ended up doing my own thing (ofc following greg‚Äôs various advices from videos)

For verbal TC and SE, I watched all of Greg‚Äôs strategy videos. I enjoyed them. Ultimately everything is Math Strategy in some way or the other. This is what I would do -
1) Read the sentence to get a gist 
2) Identify support or contrast and then the foothold of the sentence
3) Sometimes I would struggle to predict a word with time pressure, so I would just predict if it should be positive or negative and then look at the answer choices and figure (If you are aiming for a super high verbal score, its probably not the best idea)
4) I did all the groups of the Vocab Mountain. It‚Äôs important and it‚Äôs possible. There would be an occasional odd day where I would be so exhausted to revise all the groups. I would just skip that day but then do everything sincerely the next day.

For reading comprehension, I did not have sufficient time to look at much of the strategies. But I took the basics from the strategy sessions. When reading, I would try to get the main idea (i would fail several times in complicated passages) I would try not to focus on the details and get like a vague, hand wavy idea of the passage. Also although it seems obvious, it is very important to read the question properly. 

I solved only official material for practice. Get excited when u get something wrong in practice and spend lots of time understanding why. Fill the chinks in your armour.

For Quant, when Greg says Foundations, trust me it‚Äôs the most important thing. The best and most underrated resource is the Quant Flashcards. It‚Äôs brilliant. I went over them many times and in the exam I could solve at least 3-4 questions purely based on concepts.
I would read all the flashcards of a group (let‚Äôs say Geometry) and then shut the laptop, take a piece of paper and just try to write the concepts. It takes 15 mins to do this exercise.
And ofc when it comes to Math, practice is a must.
Watch Greg‚Äôs video on skipping. It is a very important strategy in Quant imo. I realized it when I screwed up big time in one of my powerpreps.

My mock scores:
Powerprep 1: Q164 V165
Powerprep 2: Q160 V159
Powerprep plus (paid and 3rd one): Q167 V161

Greg is an expert so his advice is gold, and I have a feeling more than a business this is about passion for him. 

But also feel free to break rules and experiment what works best for you. Be honest to yourself.

I would like to express my gratitude to Greg, Vince and this subReddit.

On those tough practice days, I would remember what Greg once said. ‚ÄúIf it were easy, everyone would do it.‚Äù

I know it‚Äôs not easy to find, but I‚Äôd like to search to see if it resists. Online dating can be tricky, but you have my commitment to open communication and an effort to get to know you if we find a spark. 

So with that, a little about me.

Although high school me would be absolutely shocked, I have an MBA and a great job. I enjoy my work and look forward to growing my career more, but I would like to see my personal life advance further first. 

I enjoy getting outside when I can. Usually that is done by bike. I got into cycling when the pandemic hit and have not stopped. I enjoy trying to top my longest distance each ride. Traveling to national and state parks are fun, but it would be better to have someone to do it with. 

My music taste ranges from classic rock, down to jazz, and even some of the more pop-oriented music released. Lately I‚Äôm more podcast than music and I‚Äôm always open for suggestions. 

I watch less and less tv. Live sports is great background noise for me when working about the apartment. Although, I‚Äôll consume all Wes Anderson projects immediately upon release. 

Politics are important to me due to the people who could be impacted by the policies we set forth. I‚Äôd consider myself a progressive. I enjoy reading about the historical context and practices in place around the world when it comes to the modern issues. I feel to speak about or feel confidently informed with our beliefs that we need to understand the context and history of the issue.

Applied to 28 ( I see the judgemental eyes), poured my heart out for each sup essays, checking each application for 2 hours before submitting,.... I'm rejected from 20, waitlisted at 4, accepted at 4 ( three of them did not give me aid). Paradoxically, Richmond is only school I'm admitted to and have decent financial aid while also is the only school I didn't put much care in. 
When I say I failed, it doesn't mean that I failed of getting into my dream school. I failed for not caring for myself and my family. I blame myself for not doing enough while my parents blame themselves for not being wealthy. And I feel sad about this. Few years ago my parents were making amazing money, but my mom and my grandmother got cancer. It is a miracle that they overcome it. But the medical costs, well, take almost everything from us. And now my mom could not come back to her old job. My mom cried, said if only she did not have cancer, I will not have to worry about money when applying. I have to admit, there are times I wonder ""what if mom didn't have cancer, will life be better""
I am sad for not getting in my dream school. Let me be. And you all derserve to be sad and think why not me, I qualified. Be the prestige whore, why is it bad when you work hard and aim for the top?
But in the end, we musn't think that we're not worthy. Sounds cliche but when you get what you want, that God's direction, when you don't get what you want, that's God's protection.
For years, I imagined myself going around the Bonfire at Dartmouth or singing Everytime we touch at Duke's basketball game. And now, I can't see myself there anymore. 

I will learn to love Richmond. It is hard, considering my long time unrequited love for other schools. But I will take this as guidance, maybe I will thrive better there. If anyone has some informations about Richmond, please let me know, I'm eager to know more. 
 
I will work hard and enjoy my best 4 years in the US. Someone told me that I can come to Duke and Dartmouth for MBA or PhD. No. F it. I'm going to Harvard. No one wants to love their crush again after being brutally rejected, I will be the main character in Korean drama. I will aim for the rich and handsome CEO.
For today, be selfish, cry all you want, be the most annoying bitch, you've been through enough. 
I had amazing time on this sub it connected me with so many amazing individuals. I just have one wish for everyone that please be gentle and thoughtful to the upcoming class. Everyone has had it rough.

N√£o consigo dar andamento a cursos, estou acima do peso, n√£o consigo juntar dinheiro, n√£o tenho nenhum bem material, n√£o sou promovida no trabalho, tenho fobia social..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me sinto principalmente um fracasso na carreira, sou formada (tenho MBA e p√≥s gradua√ß√£o), mas n√£o tenho dinheiro nem para comprar um p√£o.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;por causa da fobia social n√£o consigo manter contato nem com os meus amigos pr√≥ximos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Em dois anos perdi a minha v√≥ por c√¢ncer e meu pai por parada card√≠aca&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sou noiva, me d√≥i ver meu namorado se esfor√ßando para juntar dinheiro para a nossa casa e eu n√£o ter quase nada de dinheiro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estou acima do peso, a comida √© a √∫nica coisa que me faz feliz &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;J√° tentei entrar em v√°rios projetos, mas nunca foi cad√™ncia. J√° tentei fazer uma nova faculdade, ingl√™s , dan√ßa...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;N√£o sei o que me fazer, s√≥ consigo me sentir triste e vazia... &lt;/p&gt;

,resumes,"I feel lost and frustrated.

I don‚Äôt even know what kind of jobs to apply for.

There are two imgur links in the comments for more context (one resume, one analysis).

You noticed that I left nine jobs for OTHER. These reasons are:

‚Ä¢ MBA school (big mistake, too vague)

‚Ä¢ two I was bored and became a courier

‚Ä¢ six with a new job waiting for me.

I wasn‚Äôt impressing anyone at all the jobs, with PIPs involved at several. I spent six years combined as a courier between firings and one year straight as a math tutor during the housing crisis. I‚Äôve never been unemployed for longer than a week. I'm underemployed at the moment.

I have tested as above average intelligence, but I‚Äôve wondered about ADHD or something. People tell me most introverts aren't funny like me. I was a nationally ranked quiz bowl player in high school, placing in the top ten nationally at eleven different tournaments. My ultimate dream is Jeopardy. I refuse to attend my high school reunions because my underachieving is humiliating. My 30th is next year.

All 14 of the firings have been for performance. HR/Hiring manager always says ‚Äúwe like you it‚Äôs just not working out, incorrect reports, too many mistakes.‚Äù It‚Äôs never been behavior related such as lateness, insubordination, fighting, etc.

All 12 contract layoffs were designed to end, and I have several LinkedIn recommendations. The nearly three years job that was a merger, I asked my boss for a recommendation and he never responded.

My blood sugar hovers at 300 and I‚Äôm up at 5am 366 days a year. Starting in 1996, I attempted suicide eight times (emotional abuse from my family of origin). My parents are dead, I missed both funerals, and I speak to none of my siblings, cousins, etc. I haven‚Äôt attempted suicide since 2001 when I met my wife. We got married in 2006. Our son is eleven. I have suicidal thoughts again, but my marriage is wonderful and our son is even better. It would change them forever. Therapy has kept me alive.

We short sold our house for $150,000 and now it‚Äôs worth $350,000. I owed $35,000 for my bachelors degree in 1999. We now owe $95,000 for our three degrees. It is heartbreaking. We have two paid-for cars and no credit card debt.

I‚Äôve run three businesses, and I feel like it‚Äôs all been for nothing. I love being an analyst, but I‚Äôm clearly not very good at it. I grew up having every decision made for me and now my life is messed up.

&lt;p&gt;Didn‚Äôt get any $ from any schools and now looking at paying the sticker price, wanted to ask whether Kellogg is still the obvious choice? Also, is it possible to negotiate some $ in this situation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: Also waitlisted at Darden, Booth, Tuck with interviews and waitlisted Stern without interview. Canadian applicant (Born in India), undergrad: India, Masters: Canada. &lt;/p&gt;

,ProductManagement,"Hi all,
I have been a PM for 4.5 years. 3.5 years in a big tech corporate and 1 year in a startup. I have worked in B2B, B2C, UX, data, and now AI. I have a master‚Äôs degree in computer science and dropped out of my PhD(so a lot of research and teaching experience). I have been doing a part time MBA that last 3 years and graduating now. The more I learn about the business and strategy side on things the more I feel like I don‚Äôt want to be traditional PM anymore. My current role is in a startup and as impactful as it is, I am doing the job of a project manager, designer, and even contract negotiations. I only like 30% of the things I spend my time on. I have done some sales, marketing, and strategy in the past as part of my PM roles and have gotten great feedback working with external stakeholders as well.
 I want to find a role or even a career that I can use my background in and feel happy. I feel like my degrees, experience, and learnings give me a very unique set of skills. But I don‚Äôt know where to apply them. I would love the role of an AI consultant(I did my grad research on ML), product strategy, or even a product evangelist.

,clinicalresearch,"This is an update.
I made a decision.

Thanks to all of you who gave me input to choose between my current position in Observational Research and the new position as an SSU CRA II.

I decided to jump ship.

I'm stuck in my career at Parexel.

I'm heading over to ICON for a change from Observational Research to Interventional Research.

Why?
Because Interventional Studies experience is more marketable than Observational Research experience.

I want to move forward in my career.

I want a shot at being a medical science liaison or PL one day in the not too far future.

Or a well paid LM.

The downside was that I had to take a pay cut:
From 72150‚Ç¨ now to 66500‚Ç¨ in the new role.
Upside: car and fuel card, that I didn't have in my old position.

I tried to look further than only considering the pay cut.
I also need to consider the opportunity cost.
Just like someone who pays 100‚Ç¨k for an MBA from a top school to get into executive banking needs to consider the 2 years that they are without an income and assess it against what they can earn afterwards, I assessed what the interventional know-how can bring me and decided to jump ship and take the pay cut.

I negotiated a sign on bonus of 3000‚Ç¨.
They originally offered 65000‚Ç¨ for CRA II, but I countered with 69000‚Ç¨ and they came back with 66500‚Ç¨ max.

Now my package will look as follows for CRA II:

1. Mealvouchers 7‚Ç¨ per worked day.
2. Car ( also for private use )
3. Fuel card ( also for private use)
4. Pension saving (6%)
5. Healthcare insurance with dental care included
6. 4777‚Ç¨ gross per month (2930‚Ç¨ net) X 13.92 = 66500‚Ç¨ per year.

FSP for Novartis.

My previous package looked as follows:
1.  72150‚Ç¨ gross per year. 5182‚Ç¨ gross per month X 13.92. Net per month was 3178‚Ç¨.
2.  No car and no fuel card.
3. Pension saving (6%)
4. Health insurance, no dental care.
5. Mealvouchers 8‚Ç¨ per worked day.
6. Employment disability insurance ( in case of accident at work , covered for salary ).


Pros of ICON:
1. CRA II = very marketable title.
2. Possibilities to be internalized by the sponsor because of experience with FSP 
3. Car and fuel card. 

Cons of ICON:
 lower salary than previously.

Pros of Parexel:
1. Higher salary

Cons of Parexel: 
1. Stuck at Observational Research Specialist level.
Little room for growth.

,FinancialCareers,"Hey all. I've been working at a BB for just over 2 and a half years now. I graduated from a decent school in the northeast (not an ivy), and was ecstatic to receive a six figure salary when in my first job. I never thought that by this time in my career I would be this unsure of the next steps. I currently work on the credit side in a support group, and don't really love what I do. I've been setting up coffee chats with people all around the bank, but have had 0 luck with any lateral movements. I do really enjoy my current work life balance compared to someone in IB, but I also find myself craving something slightly more intellectually stimulating. As I see analysts in rotational programs around the bank, I can't help but feel jealous at their opportunity to test out the waters in very lucrative positions around the bank. I hadn't known of the typical hiring process for banks when I was in college, and in hindsight would've leapt at that opportunity.

I've been studying for the GRE since I assumed that getting an MBA might be the right next step to get me out of this very mid position, but now I'm even doubting that approach. I feel that actually moving to a team where I can learn and grow in would be a far better time spent in my prime years than going back to school. At the same time, it seems like my current experience in a support group lacks so much transferability. I've learned a lot about the specifics of how banks service credit to companies, but many of the positions I'm interested in don't seem impressed in the slightest. In short, I'm pissed. I feel that I've chained myself to a silver handcuff (not even gold), when I would rather be expanding my skillset in a field with growth opportunities. 

I've come to here to vent, because I can't really explain this issue to most of my family and friends irl. Everyone seems to think I have my life set, but they don't really understand the intricacies of this industry. Maybe I'm the one overreacting, but I don't really see a clear path forward.

I have received and admit from SFU with $5,500 scholarship. My main plan for funding my MBA is with student loans (Prodigy/Mpower).

My second choice is Degroote MBA with Co-op, had my interview and awaiting decision but they announced that decisions will be out mid-April. Degroote works both with Prodigy and Mpower but their tuition fee is a lot more than SFU. 

Meanwhile the deadline for payment of deposit for SFU is April 11. I feel so anxious because I fear I might lose on both ends. There‚Äôs no certainty of a positive response from Degroote, yet SFU‚Äôs financing option don‚Äôt seem promising at this point.

,Luxembourg,"A brief introduction of myself, just to give you some context: I (26F) was born and raised in Latin America and have double citizenship (I am also italian citizen). I am a graduated in Business Administration and I am finishing an MBA in Risk. From Luxembourg's official languages, I only speak french, but I also speak spanish, portuguese, italian and english. 

My fiance and I plan to leave our home country next year after we get married since it is a plan both of us had for a while, but finding a new home isn't an easy task. Luxembourg is a place that has grown a lot on us recently due to high life quality standards and being a calm and good place to raise children.

Now, to the questions...

We typically hear that Finance careers and Luxembourg are a match. But is it a good place for Credit Risk professionals, specifically? I have been working for almost 5 years in a large tech company, went from Intern to Sr. analyst during this time, and I really enjoy my job and want to continue investing in my growth in the area. No wonder it is a good place but is Luxembourg the best place to consolidate my career in Credit? I am constantly looking at LinkedIn jobs and there seems to be more jobs (in Credit) available in other european countries like Switzerland, but I could be the one not going deep enough on my research.

Now, to the other part of the question: the prejudice problem. I am Italian citizen, so I am legally able to work in Luxembourg, but will hiring managers WANT to hire me? My education is all LA-based and, so far, I haven't done any degree in Europe, although I plan to. I am not questioning the quality of my education, but people might do it, and I am afraid I will struggle to find good jobs with good salaries because my education was not Europe/North America-based. How likely is it for me to face discrimination in a place like Luxembourg?

,FinancialCareers,"Hi, i‚Äôll try to make it short and give you a brief about my current situation.

I am doing my MBA in business analytics and I recently secured an IB internship(as a part of a 2 month mandatory uni internship programme) at one of the top semi-govt. financial firms in India. Although others have gotten internships at companies which are paying them, quite decently as well, mine is an unpaid internship.
The reason I opted to go for this internship is because I was always fascinated by investment banking, I know it is incredibly difficult but I‚Äôm ready to put in the work for the sole reason that I think I can do it better than most other interns(I‚Äôm sorry if it‚Äôs boastful). The long hours, the stress and the intensity is all the more exciting and the more I think about it the more i get pumped up w adrenaline.
But I received this internship offer after a referral from my father(he‚Äôs not into IB and is a govt. employee at a very high post in the  power sector and has good networks) and although i‚Äôm not worried about it being unpaid, I‚Äôm just hoping to know if there‚Äôs a scope for me to make it in the long run in the IB industry. Any tips or guidance would be great! 

Also, if anyone here can share resources that i should go through it‚Äôll really help me a lot! Thanks!
(P.S. i‚Äôm already doing certifications in Financial Modelling and Valuation and Capital Markets from CFI)

,h1b,"I'm thrilled to share that I've been admitted to Wharton's MBA program but I am currently navigating the financing this dream without scholarship support. I'm exploring all avenues to fund the $160,000 tuition in a way that's financially sustainable in the long run, aiming to keep my total repayment under $300,000 (ideally $250,000).

  
My quotes from Prodigy and MPower are astronomically high, projecting over $600,000 for the two years, which is far beyond my comfort zone. I'm desperately looking for ways to bring it down to a more manageable $500,000 total, with the aim of refinancing later.

  
I have resources to cover living expenses and some of the tuition through internship earnings, but securing a loan for the rest at a fair interest rate is proving to be a hurdle. My recent transition from a FAANG company to freelancing is adding a twist to the loan application process. Not sure if it's affecting how lenders view my employment status, so any advice on this would be great.

  
I'm reaching out for insights and experiences on the following:

  
Specific Loan Refinancing Companies:  
I've heard about Sofi and Earnest among others. Are these companies accommodating to international MBA students? Are there any other lenders you'd recommend?  
Any tips on getting initial quotes from Prodigy and MPower as low as possible?

  
Ease of Approval:  
What was your visa status when you applied, and how did it affect your application?  
Were you employed, unemployed, or self-employed? How did this impact your approval chances?  
Did you require a cosigner?  
Had you built any credit in the US before approval? What did you do to build it?

  
Interest Rates and Repayment:  
What interest rates were you able to secure, and how does it compare to initial quotes?  
How much were you able to reduce your total debt or monthly payments by refinancing?

  
Fixed vs. Variable Rates:  
Experiences with choosing between fixed and variable rates, especially considering the long-term implications of each choice for international students?

Just about to finish my MBA program this fall after working as an AE (Mid-market and Enterprise) and my last job as an AM at a mid-size startup for three years.   
I accepted a job as  Regional Sales Manager and today marks my two months. The company failed to secure the funding and I was told that I‚Äôll be part of the big layoff, which will reduce the firm down to 60%.   
This was a huge career jump from my previous role (AM), as an IC, to Regional Sales Manager but ended up with only two months of management experience under my belt. I‚Äôm looking for another IC opportunity as an Enterprise/Strategic AE/AM at Fortune 500/big corp.   
Is it best to include the management experience (laidoff company) or just remove it from my resume? 

What are the best ways for me to leverage my MBA degree to find a better AM/AE role for Enterprise/Strat? Would it be better for me to find entry level management role?

,sofi,"I'm thrilled to share that I've been admitted to Wharton's MBA program but am currently navigating the challenge of financing this dream without scholarship support. I'm exploring all avenues to fund the $160,000 tuition in a way that's financially sustainable in the long run, aiming to keep my total repayment under $300,000 (ideally $250,000).

My quotes from Prodigy and MPower are astronomically high, projecting over $600,000 for the two years, which is far beyond my comfort zone. I'm desperately looking for ways to bring it down to a more manageable $500,000 total, with the aim of refinancing later.

I have resources to cover living expenses and some of the tuition through internship earnings, but securing a loan for the rest at a fair interest rate is proving to be a hurdle. My recent transition from a FAANG company to freelancing is adding a twist to the loan application process. Not sure if it's affecting how lenders view my employment status, so any advice on this would be great.

I'm reaching out for insights and experiences on the following:

   * Any tips on getting initial quotes from Prodigy and MPower as low as possible?

   * What was your visa status when you applied, and how did it affect your application?
   * Were you employed, unemployed, or self-employed? How did this impact your approval chances?
   * Did you require a cosigner?
   * Had you built any credit in the US before approval? What did you do to build it?
* **Interest Rates and Repayment:**
   * What interest rates were you able to secure, and how does it compare to initial quotes?
   * How much were you able to reduce your total debt or monthly payments by refinancing?
* **Fixed vs. Variable Rates:**

,interviews,"I recently applied for a role as a procurement specialist with an organization based on the the job description they posted  online I knew I was more than qualified. I get called for an interview this past Tuesday and during the interview it was brought up that the location stated on the job posting was incorrect and that if selected I would actually be going to their HQ which would be a 40-60 min drive depending on traffic and asked if I would be ok with that, which I stated provided everything else with the job offer works out I would be.

 The hiring manager goes on to describe all these additional tasks that the role would be responsible for including building out the supply chain team from the ground up as this was a new department. Prior to now they had allowed each department manager to handle procurement as they deemed necessary. I inquired if they were also looking to hire a procurement manager or supply chain manager/director as those are typically the roles that handle the full on development of a supply chain department, and told not at this time.

Not sure if it&amp;#39;s affecting how lenders view my employment status, so any advice on this would be great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m reaching out for insights and experiences on the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific Loan Refinancing Companies:&lt;/strong&gt; 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;ve heard about Sofi and Earnest among others. Are these companies accommodating to international MBA students? Are there any other lenders you&amp;#39;d recommend?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any tips on getting initial quotes from Prodigy and MPower as low as possible?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ease of Approval:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What was your visa status when you applied, and how did it affect your application?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Were you employed, unemployed, or self-employed? How did this impact your approval chances?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you require a cosigner?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had you built any credit in the US before approval? What did you do to build it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interest Rates and Repayment:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What interest rates were you able to secure, and how does it compare to initial quotes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much were you able to reduce your total debt or monthly payments by refinancing? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixed vs. Variable Rates:&lt;/strong&gt; 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experiences with choosing between fixed and variable rates, especially considering the long-term implications of each choice for international students?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any shared experiences or advice would be immensely valuable. Thank you in advance for your time and help!&lt;/p&gt;

Looking for some advice on next steps for my career. 

I have a BS Biology and currently work in the infectious disease research space as a PM with the government (3 YOE in this role, ~7 years YOE in this research space). Lately I have been feeling like there will be an inevitable glass ceiling on my career progression without advanced (PhD) level science degrees in this field. This has brought me to a few possible thoughts / options for next steps in my career. 

Option 1) Pursue an MBA, from a not top ranked school since ~100k masters is out of the question, and keep in my current field with hopes to progress or switch into biotech/Pharma. I‚Äôve read this may not be worth it if you‚Äôre not attending a top program anyways. 

Option 2) Pursue a MSCS / MSDS / MSBiotech degree to pivot my career somewhat. I don‚Äôt have any formal experience in the CS side but I could see Data analytics / the CS side of bio as an interest to me. Again, maybe move into the pharma / biotech space with this. Would possibly make me eligible for IT project management roles. In this option I would take prerequisite CS classes at my local college to fill the knowledge gap in preparation for a MSCS / MSDS. 

Thoughts on the best path forward?

,MBA,"Got into Kellogg &amp; Yale SOM. Very fortunate to be in this place. I love both schools.
Would hope to learn ppl‚Äôs opinions on how to decide.

About me:
International candidate.
Pre-MBA: software product manager -&gt; VC in my home country 
Post-MBA: my primary goal is to stay in there US. Hopefully can do VC in the States, but I‚Äôll also work on PM recruiting for tech firms in the Bay Area.

Kellogg pros:
- a M7 brand
- a strong alum network. A lot of ppl of my network go to Kellogg. They are very supportive to my professional and application journey.
- strong CMC (I think I‚Äôll achieve my career goal easier with Kellogg‚Äôs support)

Kellogg cons:
- entrepreneurship ecosystem seems to be less vibrant than Yale.
- hear about the ‚Äúparty school‚Äù culture. Not sure if it‚Äôs for me.
- less prestigious parent uni brand 

Yale pros:
- an Ivy League brand
- I like the overall vibe of the school and its students. I think I will be happy that my peers are ppl who share similar value for ‚ÄúBusiness and Society‚Äù. I like the artistic vibe of the school.
- can take courses across the campus. Able to network with undergraduate students as well.
- able to build great relationships with professors 

Yale cons:
- less support for VC and tech recruiting compared to Kellogg
- less opportunities to network with ppl from the Bay Area. (Kellogg has a San Francisco immersion quarter)
- the school is stronger for consulting, asset management, non-profit management recruiting. B-school ranking lower than Kellogg

Some questions:
1. Does an Yale brand make a big difference in VC recruiting? I heard that VC has a preference for Harvard and Stanford graduates. I wonder if an Ivy brand makes a difference?

In other words, how are both schools‚Äô network in VC?

2. Will there be a difference between tech recruiting for the Bay Area?

Thank you.

,MBA,So I graduated with my bachelor‚Äôs in 2022 from a state school and my school had an easy and cheap accelerated MBA program and decided to do it with no work experience. I thought it was smart bc it would only be an extra $10k and would be in a time period and age where I don‚Äôt have much responsibility.

,PLC_Career_Advice,"
Background: I am a mechanical engg. major. In my senior year, I started to develop an interest in the field of Industrial Automation and did a few online courses on PLC programming. I got an entry-level position, I started working for a South American IT company just for reference let's consider it to be Brazilian they have an office in Brazil and one in the US. I have been working with them for over a year now. They have one office in the US that is mainly Sales and Finances (no one from controls background). Prior to this I had done 2 internships one in Design (3d modeling) and other in manufacturing.   Job: Involves going to the client site and improving/adding to the current logic. Sometimes for productivity and sometimes for SCADA applications. For past few months I have been reading alot of logic understanding the machines adding a few things to it with the set template they provided to me. Doing alot of documentation and organization stuff. During the interview, they told me they would train me on Controls and would use my industrial knowledge for growing the company as I could see potential areas of improvement and implement some of methodologies like Lean Six Sigma etc. I could calculate mean time to failure for equipment for them to help maintainanace dept etc. Initially, it was good, I got to learn a few things here and there and had a self-learning mindset as I read on this sub too, that no one will officially train you but your manager will provide you with ""wisdom"". In my case I go to these client sites and usually, some senior engineer with more than 7+ years in controls/ PLC /automation accompanies me. Some of them are as old as me, I am 25+, and some of them in their 40's and 50's.

I make less than 4k / month after taxes which is decent for family of 3. But forget about training me on anything. They would talk to the remote team, in their foreign language.

In my senior year, I started to develop an interest in the field of Industrial Automation and did a few online courses on PLC programming. I got an entry-level position, I started working for a South American IT company just for reference let&amp;#39;s consider it to be Brazilian they have an office in Brazil and one in the US. I have been working with them for over a year now. They have one office in the US that is mainly Sales and Finances (no one from controls background). Prior to this I had done 2 internships one in Design (3d modeling) and other in manufacturing.   Job: Involves going to the client site and improving/adding to the current logic. Sometimes for productivity and sometimes for SCADA applications. For past few months I have been reading alot of logic understanding the machines adding a few things to it with the set template they provided to me. Doing alot of documentation and organization stuff. During the interview, they told me they would train me on Controls and would use my industrial knowledge for growing the company as I could see potential areas of improvement and implement some of methodologies like Lean Six Sigma etc. I could calculate mean time to failure for equipment for them to help maintainanace dept etc. Initially, it was good, I got to learn a few things here and there and had a self-learning mindset as I read on this sub too, that no one will officially train you but your manager will provide you with &amp;quot;wisdom&amp;quot;. In my case I go to these client sites and usually, some senior engineer with more than 7+ years in controls/ PLC /automation accompanies me. Some of them are as old as me, I am 25+, and some of them in their 40&amp;#39;s and 50&amp;#39;s.

I wanted to get an MBA because I wanted to increase pay, and possibly allow an MBA to open doors for unlimited opportunities. 

I plan on working 3 more years, and save up lots of money to cover my tuition, books, and rent money worth 2 years.

After MBA I plan on going back in working Government Job like County of Riverside jobs or County of Orange jobs

My overall question is an MBA from CSUF worth it given all my background?

In terms of commute, is it worth commuting from Riverside (thats where i live now) to Fullerton back and forth from Monday to Friday? Or should look for a place to stay in Fullerton?

,GradSchool,"I've noticed there is hardly any info, reviews, or discussion regarding Amberton U, so thought I would put it out there. I was in their MBA program. 

When I signed up for classes there was no way to see the balance due and had to call the school to get the amount. Apparently, they email your school email address. If you are brand new, I would never think to look there before the semester started.

I signed up for 3 classes, thinking that would be a full-time course load. During week 1 I realized that was way too much and dropped 1 of the courses by going into my schedule online and withdrawing... easy enough. I didn't get a refund. I called the school and the advisor said that someone should be calling me in a week to get my CC number since they don't keep them on file. Why can't I get an instant refund - big red flag and I never got a call.

Going through the coursework, there was no instruction. One of the teachers has several documents and you have to study her 2 syllabi + the online moodle to understand her expectations and due dates. She has pieces scattered everywhere and it was obviously recycled every semester. Confusing as hell. 

That teacher had a weekly meeting where you ask questions and she skims through the chapters using a ppt with pictures from the book. No real instruction or supplementary materials or information. The assignments were based on the book and scholarly journal research. The book was shit and the expectations in the paper took a lot of research on your own.

The 2nd class was basically the same. We had 1 zoom call during the 2nd week and he went over APA format. He expected a 5pg paper based on another shitty book and scholarly journal research. No teaching instruction or supplementary materials at all. He made it clear that he was there if you had questions, but you're basically on your own.  

The assignments from the 2 classes were very similar and I could copy/paste huge paragraphs from 1 into the other. 

I ended up dropping the other 2 classes realizing I was learning it all on my own and wondering why I would pay and stress myself out for no reason. 

After I withdrew from the 2 classes, I still did not get a refund. They require students to fill out a form by hand and send in the official withdrawal to the office. The forms are not on their website and it does not state it anywhere that I could find. 

I called the school again and was told there is another form to fill out by hand to request a refund. What the actual fuck? I asked if they needed my cc info since they didn't keep it on file and they stated they didn't. How many requests do I need to make to receive a $2k refund? Why isn't it printed anywhere and why aren't the forms online? 

All in all this school was a huge waste of time and stress with no instruction. The instructors were supportive in that you could ask questions (thru chat or email) and get quick answers. If you learn best this way, go for it. I would prefer to learn by instruction and interaction in real-time. I would also prefer to know my account balance and receive a refund right away -- like almost every other online business.

,careerguidance,"Hello, I find myself at a crossroads of some sort. For background I am 28M with a Bachelor‚Äôs in Business Administration, it never really seemed to get me far and I felt worse about the field as I completed my degree in 2018 (it felt very artificial) but I feel like I could do much more. I don‚Äôt have very specific interests in terms of potential careers, I love video games but most avenues on that are not fruitful. I have tried Esports, Event management, hospitality, IT, and GIS. I feel like I only have more secondary skills that are easily brushed over or picked up as part of a job and no real hard skills. 

I do find some technical things interesting but feel like I am not educated/skilled enough and maybe missed the boat. For example, computers are cool but I can‚Äôt code; I worked in utilities for a bit as a designer but ultimately failed as I was never properly trained and couldn‚Äôt keep up; I could never sell myself enough to get something with events or it all seemed based on who you knew and my networking is terrible. I have learned I enjoy creating processes and innovating on them to make them more efficient and solve a problem/puzzle with them.

I guess ideally how I would prefer to work is either 9-5 with hybrid/remote options (I very much dislike the feeling of living at work at my same desk after a while but dont mind occasional-mostly computer work just not 100% of the time) or a more condensed schedule (4 10s, 3 12s). If I could move around physically in the job with some fielding or maintenance that won‚Äôt destroy my body, I have enjoyed that in the past. 

My current situation is that I am at a simple and pretty easy admin position, it is primarily data entry. I picked it up from a random contract and they kept me on and hired me full time; I took it as I needed work and kept it as it wasn‚Äôt terrible. It is fine as a bridge job but I don‚Äôt see much growth and it‚Äôs not the best benefits but the workplace is fine and co workers are cool. I don‚Äôt enjoy having to go to the office every day though and sometimes sit around, other times just enter and clean up info in the system we use. It is overall comfy and pays well for what it is but I feel it could be a dead end. I‚Äôve been there for a little over 5 months. Lifestyle wise I am fairly frugal and expenses are low with my housing situation.

I guess in terms of goals owning a house would be great and retiring early would be great. I ultimately see work as a means to an end to survive and enjoy the things I like, the less I need to work each day the better. My girlfriend also wants to be a pilot and saving to help with that would also be a good direction to work toward and something that lets me travel more with her would be wonderful. I have no plans to have kids and neither does my girlfriend.

In terms of thinking forward I have thought of a few options I‚Äôd like to explore and would like some thoughts from you all based on how I sound to you or your experience with these fields:

Keep trucking with current job and get more experience since I‚Äôm not in a terrible spot and see if it can grow:

Try to get into some kind of logistics field like Supply Chain (stemmed from my event management days)

Consulting - a friend described it as just learning whatever your current project is on for a bunch of different fields or hone in on one which sounds interesting but I hear the work can be horrible with workload and cultures.

Safety for some kind of factory or plant - Seems to have a good mix of setting up systems, computer work, and moving around the place while needing some skills/knowledge to understand and fix issues.

Or go back to school (my dad has offered a masters degree but I have declined so far since I did not want to go in blind and without a plan) 

MBA - I would probably go for something like project management in construction, maybe special events

Technical degree - my friend has suggested an instrumentation tech path that worked out well for him with a 2 year associates

GIS - not sure what path or degree to take with this one but I have the baseline from my previous job but no proper education. 

Trades - could be interesting for raw skills in fields and figuring out how more of society functionally works, is there a way to try out many in a short period of time?

Overall I have felt like I‚Äôve been going through jobs doing what anyone else can do and I feel like I could do well with a niche if I can find it.

For background I am 28M with a Bachelor‚Äôs in Business Administration, it never really seemed to get me far and I felt worse about the field as I completed my degree in 2018 (it felt very artificial) but I feel like I could do much more. I don‚Äôt have very specific interests in terms of potential careers, I love video games but most avenues on that are not fruitful. I have tried Esports, Event management, hospitality, IT, and GIS. I feel like I only have more secondary skills that are easily brushed over or picked up as part of a job and no real hard skills. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do find some technical things interesting but feel like I am not educated/skilled enough and maybe missed the boat. For example, computers are cool but I can‚Äôt code; I worked in utilities for a bit as a designer but ultimately failed as I was never properly trained and couldn‚Äôt keep up; I could never sell myself enough to get something with events or it all seemed based on who you knew and my networking is terrible. I have learned I enjoy creating processes and innovating on them to make them more efficient and solve a problem/puzzle with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess ideally how I would prefer to work is either 9-5 with hybrid/remote options (I very much dislike the feeling of living at work at my same desk after a while but dont mind occasional-mostly computer work just not 100% of the time) or a more condensed schedule (4 10s, 3 12s). If I could move around physically in the job with some fielding or maintenance that won‚Äôt destroy my body, I have enjoyed that in the past. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current situation is that I am at a simple and pretty easy admin position, it is primarily data entry. I picked it up from a random contract and they kept me on and hired me full time; I took it as I needed work and kept it as it wasn‚Äôt terrible. It is fine as a bridge job but I don‚Äôt see much growth and it‚Äôs not the best benefits but the workplace is fine and co workers are cool. I don‚Äôt enjoy having to go to the office every day though and sometimes sit around, other times just enter and clean up info in the system we use. It is overall comfy and pays well for what it is but I feel it could be a dead end. I‚Äôve been there for a little over 5 months. Lifestyle wise I am fairly frugal and expenses are low with my housing situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess in terms of goals owning a house would be great and retiring early would be great. I ultimately see work as a means to an end to survive and enjoy the things I like, the less I need to work each day the better. My girlfriend also wants to be a pilot and saving to help with that would also be a good direction to work toward and something that lets me travel more with her would be wonderful. I have no plans to have kids and neither does my girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of thinking forward I have thought of a few options I‚Äôd like to explore and would like some thoughts from you all based on how I sound to you or your experience with these fields:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep trucking with current job and get more experience since I‚Äôm not in a terrible spot and see if it can grow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try to get into some kind of logistics field like Supply Chain (stemmed from my event management days)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consulting - a friend described it as just learning whatever your current project is on for a bunch of different fields or hone in on one which sounds interesting but I hear the work can be horrible with workload and cultures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safety for some kind of factory or plant - Seems to have a good mix of setting up systems, computer work, and moving around the place while needing some skills/knowledge to understand and fix issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or go back to school (my dad has offered a masters degree but I have declined so far since I did not want to go in blind and without a plan) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MBA - I would probably go for something like project management in construction, maybe special events&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technical degree - my friend has suggested an instrumentation tech path that worked out well for him with a 2 year associates&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GIS - not sure what path or degree to take with this one but I have the baseline from my previous job but no proper education. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trades - could be interesting for raw skills in fields and figuring out how more of society functionally works, is there a way to try out many in a short period of time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I have felt like I‚Äôve been going through jobs doing what anyone else can do and I feel like I could do well with a niche if I can find it. I just have trouble honing in on what that could be and have not experimented enough to see what it could be. If anyone could give input on what seems like a good course of action for me or if you‚Äôre in any of these fields I would love to hear the path you took! Sorry this ended up as a massive wall of text but I appreciate anyone who took the time to read.&lt;/p&gt;

,BESalary,"Hi all,

Is this a decent wage? Should I accept the offer? I come from ex-FAANG company relocating back to Belgium for family, from having spend years abroad.

Whatever I do, even adjusted for COL, it seems I have to slash my salary expectations in half or even more. This market does not pay well it seems if you are looking for anything above 120k/y payroll. 

How does this offer relate in the BE labour market, given it's an IC role with leadership without authority (no direct reportees).

They shared their dilemma about whether to disclose their autism to their peers, given the social-centric nature of MBA programs. The feedback was overwhelmingly in favor of hiding their autism to avoid stigma and deep social ostracization. 

Here's several of the comments:

* ""MBAs are not accepting people in this context. Mask if you can.""
* ""Don‚Äôt disclose, and don‚Äôt expect this group to be accepting in the slightest.""
* ""Do NOT disclose. Autism is not nearly as socially accepted as ADHD.""
* "" Look at this subreddit‚Äîdoes this seem like a group of well adjusted, open-minded, accommodating people to you?""

So my question reading this: imagine it's the year 2005. What if the same question was asked, but instead of autism, it was being gay? Being gay is so normalized and accepted in 2024, but it wasn't in 2005. Would the overwhelming majority of comments also recommend the hypothetical incoming M7 student to ""keep that shit to their grave"" if they are gay? Would they also say that being gay is not socially accepted? Would they say ""being yourself doesn't necessarily mean using a highly stigmatized word to describe yourself?"" Or ""I can't even imagine having to overcome the social hurdle of telling people you're gay."" 

Because if so, that doesn't reflect well on MBAs. That means that MBAs would overwhelmingly be on the wrong side of history. 

For what it's worth, I got a Masters in Social Welfare back in 2005, and we were very pro-LGBTQ even back then.",t2_x4ubezeww,False,,0.0,False,"Following up on the overwhelming consensus to not disclose your autism to M7 classmates or face social Ostracization, Imagine it's the year 2005. would m7 MBAs similarly Overwhelmingly Recommend to hide that you're gay or face social ostracization?",[],r/MBA,False,6.0,,0.0,,,True,t3_1bpyujz,False,light,1.0,,public,1.0,0.0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},On Campus,False,1.0,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1711640976.0,text,6.0,,,text,self.MBA,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following up on this &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1bokm2x/incoming_m7_student_who_is_autistic_should_i/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;amp;utm_name=MBA&amp;amp;utm_content=t3_1bosbc6""&gt;discussion thread&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by an incoming M7 student who is on the autism spectrum. They shared their dilemma about whether to disclose their autism to their peers, given the social-centric nature of MBA programs. The feedback was overwhelmingly in favor of hiding their autism to avoid stigma and deep social ostracization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s several of the comments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;MBAs are not accepting people in this context. Mask if you can.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Don‚Äôt disclose, and don‚Äôt expect this group to be accepting in the slightest.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Do NOT disclose. Autism is not nearly as socially accepted as ADHD.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot; Look at this subreddit‚Äîdoes this seem like a group of well adjusted, open-minded, accommodating people to you?&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;I would take that shit to your fucking grave brother&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t even imagine of having to overcome the social hurdle of telling people you&amp;#39;re autistic.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Autism gets interpreted as ‚ÄúI have a mental deficiency of social skills.‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Do not disclose to anyone&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;do not disclose unless absolutely necessary. will hurt more than help.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Being yourself doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean using a highly stigmatized word to describe yourself.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;I don‚Äôt really have advice but this is so sad that people in the MBA community are not accepting of this :(&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question reading this: imagine it&amp;#39;s the year 2005. What if the same question was asked, but instead of autism, it was being gay? Being gay is so normalized and accepted in 2024, but it wasn&amp;#39;t in 2005. Would the overwhelming majority of comments also recommend the hypothetical incoming M7 student to &amp;quot;keep that shit to their grave&amp;quot; if they are gay? Would they also say that being gay is not socially accepted? Would they say &amp;quot;being yourself doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean using a highly stigmatized word to describe yourself?&amp;quot; Or &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t even imagine having to overcome the social hurdle of telling people you&amp;#39;re gay.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because if so, that doesn&amp;#39;t reflect well on MBAs. That means that MBAs would overwhelmingly be on the wrong side of history. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For what it&amp;#39;s worth, I got a Masters in Social Welfare back in 2005, and we were very pro-LGBTQ even back then.&lt;/p&gt;

This is the selection criteria for IIM Kashipur(MBA-Analytics course)

This course has got to have one of the worst selection criteria's, I dont even know who the fuck gets the approval to set these parameters

Cat score weightage- 20%, calculated as percentile \* 0.20

acads- 40%, workex-10%, gender and acad diversity-10%

Lets assume there are two friends A and B. Both are freshers and A is engineer, male and B is non engineer female and both have equal acads. Both are general. Lets assume A has scored 99.99% and B has scored 60% in CAT

For the cat score weightage- A with 99.99% in CAT will get \~19.99/20, B with 60% will get 12/20.

For workex both will get 0 points and for acads bot will get same points.

Now by virtue of gender and acad diversity B gets 10 points extra. So B&gt;A by 2 points in total composite score. LMAO

So 60%&gt;100% what a joke

,MBA," Hello, everyone!

I‚Äôm a medical doctor, a graduate of a reputable European university, with a year‚Äôs experience working as a locum doctor across various medical fields. Currently, I'm five months into a psychiatry residency in Italy. Alongside my medical career, I‚Äôve accumulated two years of experience in my family's aerospace business, which has a team of 100 employees.After much reflection, I've decided to pivot from clinical medicine to business/entrepreneurship. To make a serious transition, I believe my best options are pursuing an MBA or a master's in health administration. Considering I haven't ruled out the possibility of joining my family business post-business school, an MBA seems to be the more versatile choice, especially with my aspiration to eventually start my own business.I'm trilingual, though I've yet to sit for the GMAT‚Äîadmittedly, it's a bit daunting, given the minimal math in my background. Do you think my chances are solid if I secure a strong GMAT score and obtain two good letters of recommendation? Should I not secure a spot, would opting for a Master's in Health Management at a prominent European business school be a prudent fallback plan?I appreciate any insights or advice from this community on navigating this career shift.

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm a medical doctor, a graduate of a reputable European university, with a year‚Äôs experience working as a locum doctor across various medical fields. Currently, I&amp;#39;m five months into a psychiatry residency in Italy. Alongside my medical career, I‚Äôve accumulated two years of experience in my family&amp;#39;s aerospace business, which has a team of 100 employees.After much reflection, I&amp;#39;ve decided to pivot from clinical medicine to business/entrepreneurship. To make a serious transition, I believe my best options are pursuing an MBA or a master&amp;#39;s in health administration. Considering I haven&amp;#39;t ruled out the possibility of joining my family business post-business school, an MBA seems to be the more versatile choice, especially with my aspiration to eventually start my own business.I&amp;#39;m trilingual, though I&amp;#39;ve yet to sit for the GMAT‚Äîadmittedly, it&amp;#39;s a bit daunting, given the minimal math in my background. Do you think my chances are solid if I secure a strong GMAT score and obtain two good letters of recommendation? Should I not secure a spot, would opting for a Master&amp;#39;s in Health Management at a prominent European business school be a prudent fallback plan?I appreciate any insights or advice from this community on navigating this career shift.
Thank you! &lt;/p&gt;

,csuf,"Hello Everyone, just wanted to ask if a Full-Time MBA from Cal State Fullerton worth it? 

Here is my background

Graduated in 2021 from UCR with a BS in Business Administration (emphasis in Finance)

After graduation, I started my 1st job at Riverside County Sheriff as a Corrections Assistant Trainee, like Admin clerical work

Then in 2022, got promoted to Corrections Assistant I

Then in 2023, got promoted to Corrections Assistant II

Then earlier in 2024, got promoted to Supervising Corrections Assistant

I wanted to get an MBA because I wanted to increase pay, and possibly allow an MBA to open doors for unlimited opportunities. 

I plan on working 3 more years, and save up lots of money to cover my tuition, books, and rent money worth 2 years.

After MBA I plan on going back in working Government Job like County of Riverside jobs or County of Orange jobs

My overall question is an MBA from CSUF worth it given all my background?

In terms of commute, is it worth commuting from Riverside to Fullerton back and forth from Monday to Friday? Or should look for a place to stay in Fullerton?

,MBA,"Hello everyone,

I'm currently in the fortunate position of having been accepted to both Oxford and Cambridge for their MBA programs, and I'm seeking some advice on which one to choose. My post-graduation plans revolve around either pursuing tech entrepreneurship (specifically in software development) or  government tech advisory, both in Asia. After digging around, here's my breakdown of the pros and cons of each program:

**Oxford Pros:**

* Slight Edge in Brand Name: Oxford holds slightly more recognition in Asia, which could potentially benefit me in securing partnerships, clients, investors, or woo-ing government officials. We're talking about non-MBA, non-MBB people that probably don't in-the-know about MBA or objective rankings.
* Adcom Experience: My adcom experience has been very DELIGHTFUL. They've been prompt, detailed, and very helpful, which makes me feel appreciated.
* Better Alumni Network in Asia: Given Oxford's larger cohort and brand recognition, the alumni network in my country seems more substantial.

**Oxford Cons:**

* Curriculum: Upon reviewing the curriculum, it feels somewhat lacking and generic, especially in terms of technology management.
* Non-Tech Focus: The program and university aren't particularly known for their focus on technology or STEM subjects.

**Cambridge Pros:**

* More Tech and Entrepreneurship Focus:  After talking to both alumns, I  feel like their curriculum and cohort are way more entrepreneurial and a  lot more got into tech (at least where I live). Maybe because of  Cambridge being more STEM focus and its proximity to the Silicon Fen,  although the Fen seems to be more of a hardware engineering center  rather than software.
* Curriculum: I REALLY LIKE their listed curriculums, be it in tech, management, or  finance. The modules seem to be in depth and their concentrations feels  like that they really go beyond book knowledge.
* Industry Sentiment: Feedback from MBB/Banking people that I talked to in Asia suggests that Cambridge alumni more highly regarded and tend to progress faster than their Oxford Peers.

**Cambridge Cons:**

* The Adcom Experience: My interactions with the Cambridge admissions committee have been less favorable. They're very slow to respond and seem more detached, which doesn't make me feel as appreciated.
* Brand Name: While Cambridge is prestigious, its recognition may not be as widespread in my region compared to Oxford, potentially impacting my ability to impress potential clients or partners.

I'd greatly appreciate any advice or insights from those who have experience with either program. Thanks in advance!

,CharteredAccountants,"I don't know if this is the right place to ask but I have been having some stupid doubts regarding my future. So I recently gave all my 12th board exams this year. I wrote all my exams well and expecting above 90 in boards. I am usually considered a good scoring and a bright student by many of the people I know (used to get 80-85% in pre boards and school exams and yes I know thats average and not really the standard for doing CA ACCA or any other difficult course). I really have no clue on what to do or what I should pursue after exams. I know there are options like CA ACCA MBA after 12th commerce. I have found accounts fun and been interested in learning more about it. Some people have been asking me to do CA or ACCA saying it fits for me. But I really have no idea what to do. I am mostly going for a bcom after my 12th and then have to do some other course after that because having simply a bcom degree is not going to get you anywhere. Though I am still not sure if I should just skip college and start studying for foundation instead. I would like to ask some questions and if anyone is kind enough to spare some time answering them I would appreciate it.


1. Which is better abroad? CA or ACCA in middle east? What is the scope of these 2 degrees abroad? I am planning to go abroad in GCC for jobs after I complete my studies in India.
2. Is maths required for these courses? I have not picked maths as my optional subject for 11th and 12th. I am weak in maths and my 9th 10th maths did not go well because I was struggling with health issues during that time. All I know is basic mathematical skills (Add subtract multiply divide %) and some little basic algebra.
3. Do these courses require expensive training and coaching classes? I have never went to any tuition nor used any youtube for my class 11th and 12th. All I used was the textbooks and they helped me in conceptual clarity. I know the cbse boards are nothing compared to CA as they are like 100x tougher. I am willing to start preparing for these courses as early as possible like even now. I could use the 3 years for bcom on preparing for ca inter.
4. Is a laptop required for progressing better? I do not have a laptop or any good computer skills for word excel powerPoint. I come from a financially weak background so I cannot do anything expensive or fun. 


Due to my financial conditions. I want to finish my education as early as possible. I know the journey will definetly not be simple but I am willing to work hard for it. I really have no talent other than mindlessly studying. I would appreciate if anyone is willing to take time to help out a clueless 12th passout. 

I am also open to talk to or chat with anyone. I have been lonely my whole life and my mental health is not upto the standards.

Ig it could be called an advantage because being lonely gives you more free time. I am always wasting my time doing unproductive work and I want to change that. &lt;/p&gt;

Hey everyone!

I find myself at a crossroads and in dire need of some insightful advice. I've been fortunate enough to receive admission offers from both IE Business School for their International MBA (IMBA) program and Imperial Business School for their Full-Time MBA. However, with the deposit deadline looming, I'm feeling the pressure to make a decision, especially considering the financial implications.

Here's a breakdown of my situation:

**IE Business School IMBA**:

Tuition Fees: 82,000 euros

Scholarship: 12,000 euros

**Imperial Business School FT MBA**:

Tuition Fees: 67,500 pounds (**awaiting scholarship decision**)

**I'll need to secure an education loan to cover the cost of the MBA program and living expenses.**

Background: Indian, Male

GMAT Score: 710

TOEFL Score: 111

GPA: 3.4

My priorities after completing the MBA are as follows:

1. Consulting
2. Product Management
3. Business Analytics

Given this information, I'm torn between the two options. Both schools have their unique strengths, and I want to make sure I'm making the best decision for my future career aspirations.

Any insights or experiences you can share regarding the reputation of these programs, the career opportunities they offer in my chosen fields, the quality of the education, or any other factors I should consider would be immensely helpful.

Thank you in advance for your input and guidance!

&lt;p&gt;I find myself at a crossroads and in dire need of some insightful advice. I&amp;#39;ve been fortunate enough to receive admission offers from both IE Business School for their International MBA (IMBA) program and Imperial Business School for their Full-Time MBA. However, with the deposit deadline looming, I&amp;#39;m feeling the pressure to make a decision, especially considering the financial implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a breakdown of my situation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IE Business School IMBA&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuition Fees: 82,000 euros&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholarship: 12,000 euros&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imperial Business School FT MBA&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuition Fees: 67,500 pounds (&lt;strong&gt;awaiting scholarship decision&lt;/strong&gt;)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;ll need to secure an education loan to cover the cost of the MBA program and living expenses.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Background: Indian, Male&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GMAT Score: 710&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOEFL Score: 111&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GPA: 3.4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My priorities after completing the MBA are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consulting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product Management&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business Analytics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this information, I&amp;#39;m torn between the two options. Both schools have their unique strengths, and I want to make sure I&amp;#39;m making the best decision for my future career aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any insights or experiences you can share regarding the reputation of these programs, the career opportunities they offer in my chosen fields, the quality of the education, or any other factors I should consider would be immensely helpful.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you in advance for your input and guidance!  &lt;/p&gt;

,careeradvice,"Looking for some advice on next steps for my career. 

I have a BS Biology and currently work in the infectious disease research space as a PM with the government (3 YOE in this role, ~7 years YOE in this research space). Lately I have been feeling like there will be an inevitable glass ceiling on my career progression without advanced (PhD) level science degrees in this field. This has brought me to a few possible thoughts / options for next steps in my career. 

Option 1) Pursue an MBA, from a not top ranked school since ~100k masters is out of the question, and keep in my current field with hopes to progress or switch into biotech/Pharma. I‚Äôve read this may not be worth it if you‚Äôre not attending a top program anyways. 

Option 2) Pursue a MSCS / MSDS / MSBiotech degree to pivot my career somewhat.

,jobs,"Career/Job Offer advice

Hi Reddit, I find myself in a lucky (?) position where for the first time I was headhunted/contacted directly for a position. I know there's mixed reactions/reviews with recruiters and this is my first interaction with one. I think for the type of work, it's not usually headhunted? Or more so, I guess I reached a certain level of experience, where I'm in a small pool now, and can be ""in demand"". So I'm trying not to get too ahead of myself, and also reigning in my expectations. At this point, I'm all ""big eyes and Wow"", but I'm also thinking, work safety, mental health, work life balance. Things that you can't put a dollar sign to replace. I have a linkedin profile, and though I'm not actively looking, I've always been ""open"" to see new opportunities. Who doesn't want 'more'? In terms of career progression, professional growth, prestige, accomplishments/recognition and of course. Money.

Perhaps this is a great dilemma to be in. I feel I have nothing to lose but at the same time, everything to lose.

For the first time, I'd say I am happy in my job. I progressed and really moved up (in the role capacity I'm in), I'd say I've reached the epitome of it. I'm not going to speak highly of myself and what I do, I am an EA/PA/Coordinator/Glorified Secretary. But I do my job well, and it's a complex role. I support the #1 and #2 in my organization of 700+ employees. I may just be a personal assistant, but I do anything (and with that...everything). Unlike the traditional job - lawyer, doctor where it's easy to see prestige and what they do, I always felt my role never carried much ""oomph"". If you're good at what you do, no one will notice, but you get the job done. If you're bad at what you do, you're incompetent, and easily replaceable. Anyways, long story short. I'm a PA and I'd proudly say, a pretty damn good one. I have a Degree in Business, and did some pre-masters certification (I'm not necessarily in a rush to go for an MBA or Masters in general), I have nothing to prove, but I've done some courses here and there, whilst working my way up.

I like my bosses and respect what they do and stand for. And I feel they recognize what I do, and appreciate me and I'm pleased to say I really like the organization, culture, people and the values. But at the end of the day, it's just a job, right? I don't own them loyalty, even though in a way I feel like I'm ""betraying"" them by even entertaining the thought of leaving. But I know in the end, we're all replaceable.

The new position being offered (which of course I still need to go through the motions of formally interviewing for) - I'd say the biggest ""sell point"" is.

Money Prestige / Brand name recognition I recently got a salary review, so in a few months my yearly salary will be $93k. When I was approached by the recruiter I wanted to be very upfront, for me to even consider any move, I'm looking at least a 20% bump. Frst of all, I thought I was being ridiculous. In the role I do, I'm already considered in the high salary range. I asked for such an amount, kind of assuming that I'm asking too much and they'll drop me, and then boom decision making dilemma solved. But the recruiter got back to me and said they can meet that, and said salary with bonus (my current role doesn't have a bonus), I'd be earning $117k yearly. I'm not gonna lie, when the recruiter nonchalantly replied to me (rather quickly) in what seemed like ""oh, that number? That's not a problem, we can do that"".

I had two reactions:

Damn! I should've asked for more Omg, I can't believe I'm that employable to even get to make ""salary demands"" Never in my life have I ever thought I'd ever be in a position, where I'd be earning that sort of money. I've worked my way up, and job hopped in my earlier years before settling in my current role (where I've been at 8 years now), which was a selling point to the recruiter. Longevity. I've just accepted whatever increment came my way, and promotions (total 3) I got along the way, grateful for whatever came my way. I've never been in the position where I go to say ""I want more money"". So it's new territory for me, but it also made me very reflective on my competency and capabilities, and though I feel I do my job well, I know it's not for everyone. You really got to be an all rounder and flexible, and manage the shit whilst also faking it a lot of the time. Anyways, going way off topic. Basically it's made me realize, the work experiences I have and the skill sets I've gained, I'm..... in demand????

I work in private education K-12 level with 700+ employees supporting the #1 &amp; #2. This new role would be a university role with 3500+ employees supporting the #1.

Daunting. I know.

At first I thought, I'm not qualified for this. But then I realize, on paper. Hell yeah I am. I could do this. That's why a recruiter reached out to me, right?

So yeah, that's my dilemma.

So I pursue this? For essentially more money, prestige, experience of this scale. Or stay where I'm at, where I'm comfortable, but know where I've essentially ""peaked"". I've hit the highest I could go, and I've hit the highest I can go ""salary scale"" wise. I don't think I will have many opportunities like this, so I'd be silly to not consider it.

What worries me is... ""i'm comfortable"". I recently bought a house, I have a mortgage now, the current role I'm in, is essentially what they call an ""iron rice bowl"". I'll have this job for life (if I want it), job security is there, I like the people, culture, work life, I get 35 days off a year, and I'm familiar with everything. A new job is starting new, and being a noob at an environment all over again. That's daunting to me.

Financially, I feel I can get by staying put. Sure, who wouldn't want more money, I can buy nicer things, have a more cushy life, but I can make do with what I have now. Jumping to this new role would:

1) for the money 2) for the prestige 3) for the prestige and potential growth

But that said, I feel a EA/PA if you're good at what you do, no one wants to move you/get rid of you. There's no moving up. To me the only way to move up is just this. Money. Prestige.

Even though I shouldn't let my emotional/personal attachment/loyalty to my bosses, who I feel have really supported me throughout my entire tenure, I feel I'd be betraying them leaving. But I also get, no one is here forever, they would leave eventually too.

My worry is let's say I jump, I leave, take the new job and nice paycheck. What if I hate it? What if I suck at it? What if there's no long term prospect for it, was the larger pay check worth it for the short term? I'm looking for long term employment, stability, familiarity.

So yeah, that's where I'm at. I think I described in quite long detail all my dilemmas and though process. I don't want to ask friends because most of my closests friends are all colleagues, so I know they won't be able to give me an unbiased opinion. So here I am Reddit, asking you, someone who doesn't know me, reading about this dilemma, I'm asking....what should I do? What would you do in my shoes?

Thank you for listening to my speech, haha, I know I wrote a lot, but wanted to put it all out there, so the full picture is there. I'm genuinely really unsure what I want. And what I'm willing to do.

If I had to go with my (stubborn) gut. My gut...my ""right now"" answer? It says, stay put. Why change for uncertainty. I'm comfortable now. I'm happy where I'm at. I can pay my bills okay. I have good work life balance, and my mental health now is in a so much better place now with my role. I worry, I'm jumping into too much unknown just for money/prestige. But at the same time, I worry I'll regret not taking it too.

AHHHHH! Like I said.....dilemma huh?

At the same time, what should I be asking the recruiter?",t2_cnpra,False,,0.0,False,Amazing Job Opportunity vs. Content at current role dilemma?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Leaving a job'}]",r/jobs,False,6.0,,0.0,,,True,t3_1bpssnp,False,dark,1.0,,public,1.0,0.0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Leaving a job,False,1.0,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1711623722.0,richtext,6.0,,,text,self.jobs,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Career/Job Offer advice&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Reddit, I find myself in a lucky (?) position where for the first time I was headhunted/contacted directly for a position. I know there&amp;#39;s mixed reactions/reviews with recruiters and this is my first interaction with one. I think for the type of work, it&amp;#39;s not usually headhunted? Or more so, I guess I reached a certain level of experience, where I&amp;#39;m in a small pool now, and can be &amp;quot;in demand&amp;quot;. So I&amp;#39;m trying not to get too ahead of myself, and also reigning in my expectations. At this point, I&amp;#39;m all &amp;quot;big eyes and Wow&amp;quot;, but I&amp;#39;m also thinking, work safety, mental health, work life balance. Things that you can&amp;#39;t put a dollar sign to replace. I have a linkedin profile, and though I&amp;#39;m not actively looking, I&amp;#39;ve always been &amp;quot;open&amp;quot; to see new opportunities. Who doesn&amp;#39;t want &amp;#39;more&amp;#39;? In terms of career progression, professional growth, prestige, accomplishments/recognition and of course. Money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is a great dilemma to be in. I feel I have nothing to lose but at the same time, everything to lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time, I&amp;#39;d say I am happy in my job. I progressed and really moved up (in the role capacity I&amp;#39;m in), I&amp;#39;d say I&amp;#39;ve reached the epitome of it. I&amp;#39;m not going to speak highly of myself and what I do, I am an EA/PA/Coordinator/Glorified Secretary. But I do my job well, and it&amp;#39;s a complex role. I support the #1 and #2 in my organization of 700+ employees. I may just be a personal assistant, but I do anything (and with that...everything). Unlike the traditional job - lawyer, doctor where it&amp;#39;s easy to see prestige and what they do, I always felt my role never carried much &amp;quot;oomph&amp;quot;. If you&amp;#39;re good at what you do, no one will notice, but you get the job done. If you&amp;#39;re bad at what you do, you&amp;#39;re incompetent, and easily replaceable. Anyways, long story short. I&amp;#39;m a PA and I&amp;#39;d proudly say, a pretty damn good one. I have a Degree in Business, and did some pre-masters certification (I&amp;#39;m not necessarily in a rush to go for an MBA or Masters in general), I have nothing to prove, but I&amp;#39;ve done some courses here and there, whilst working my way up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like my bosses and respect what they do and stand for. And I feel they recognize what I do, and appreciate me and I&amp;#39;m pleased to say I really like the organization, culture, people and the values. But at the end of the day, it&amp;#39;s just a job, right? I don&amp;#39;t own them loyalty, even though in a way I feel like I&amp;#39;m &amp;quot;betraying&amp;quot; them by even entertaining the thought of leaving. But I know in the end, we&amp;#39;re all replaceable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new position being offered (which of course I still need to go through the motions of formally interviewing for) - I&amp;#39;d say the biggest &amp;quot;sell point&amp;quot; is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Money Prestige / Brand name recognition I recently got a salary review, so in a few months my yearly salary will be $93k. When I was approached by the recruiter I wanted to be very upfront, for me to even consider any move, I&amp;#39;m looking at least a 20% bump. Frst of all, I thought I was being ridiculous. In the role I do, I&amp;#39;m already considered in the high salary range. I asked for such an amount, kind of assuming that I&amp;#39;m asking too much and they&amp;#39;ll drop me, and then boom decision making dilemma solved. But the recruiter got back to me and said they can meet that, and said salary with bonus (my current role doesn&amp;#39;t have a bonus), I&amp;#39;d be earning $117k yearly. I&amp;#39;m not gonna lie, when the recruiter nonchalantly replied to me (rather quickly) in what seemed like &amp;quot;oh, that number? That&amp;#39;s not a problem, we can do that&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had two reactions:&lt;/p&gt;

That&amp;#39;s not a problem, we can do that&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had two reactions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damn! I should&amp;#39;ve asked for more
Omg, I can&amp;#39;t believe I&amp;#39;m that employable to even get to make &amp;quot;salary demands&amp;quot; Never in my life have I ever thought I&amp;#39;d ever be in a position, where I&amp;#39;d be earning that sort of money. I&amp;#39;ve worked my way up, and job hopped in my earlier years before settling in my current role (where I&amp;#39;ve been at 8 years now), which was a selling point to the recruiter. Longevity. I&amp;#39;ve just accepted whatever increment came my way, and promotions (total 3) I got along the way, grateful for whatever came my way. I&amp;#39;ve never been in the position where I go to say &amp;quot;I want more money&amp;quot;. 
So it&amp;#39;s new territory for me, but it also made me very reflective on my competency and capabilities, and though I feel I do my job well, I know it&amp;#39;s not for everyone. You really got to be an all rounder and flexible, and manage the shit whilst also faking it a lot of the time. Anyways, going way off topic. Basically it&amp;#39;s made me realize, the work experiences I have and the skill sets I&amp;#39;ve gained, I&amp;#39;m..... in demand???? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work in private education K-12 level with 700+ employees supporting the #1 &amp;amp; #2. This new role would be a university role with 3500+ employees supporting the #1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daunting. I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first I thought, I&amp;#39;m not qualified for this. But then I realize, on paper. Hell yeah I am. I could do this. That&amp;#39;s why a recruiter reached out to me, right? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, that&amp;#39;s my dilemma. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I pursue this? For essentially more money, prestige, experience of this scale. Or stay where I&amp;#39;m at, where I&amp;#39;m comfortable, but know where I&amp;#39;ve essentially &amp;quot;peaked&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;ve hit the highest I could go, and I&amp;#39;ve hit the highest I can go &amp;quot;salary scale&amp;quot; wise. I don&amp;#39;t think I will have many opportunities like this, so I&amp;#39;d be silly to not consider it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What worries me is... &amp;quot;i&amp;#39;m comfortable&amp;quot;. I recently bought a house, I have a mortgage now, the current role I&amp;#39;m in, is essentially what they call an &amp;quot;iron rice bowl&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;ll have this job for life (if I want it), job security is there, I like the people, culture, work life, I get 35 days off a year, and I&amp;#39;m familiar with everything. A new job is starting new, and being a noob at an environment all over again. That&amp;#39;s daunting to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financially, I feel I can get by staying put. Sure, who wouldn&amp;#39;t want more money, I can buy nicer things, have a more cushy life, but I can make do with what I have now. Jumping to this new role would:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) for the money 2) for the prestige 3) for the prestige and potential growth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that said, I feel a EA/PA if you&amp;#39;re good at what you do, no one wants to move you/get rid of you. There&amp;#39;s no moving up. To me the only way to move up is just this. Money. Prestige. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I shouldn&amp;#39;t let my emotional/personal attachment/loyalty to my bosses, who I feel have really supported me throughout my entire tenure, I feel I&amp;#39;d be betraying them leaving. But I also get, no one is here forever, they would leave eventually too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My worry is let&amp;#39;s say I jump, I leave, take the new job and nice paycheck. What if I hate it? What if I suck at it? What if there&amp;#39;s no long term prospect for it, was the larger pay check worth it for the short term? I&amp;#39;m looking for long term employment, stability, familiarity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, that&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;m at. I think I described in quite long detail all my dilemmas and though process. I don&amp;#39;t want to ask friends because most of my closests friends are all colleagues, so I know they won&amp;#39;t be able to give me an unbiased opinion. So here I am Reddit, asking you, someone who doesn&amp;#39;t know me, reading about this dilemma, I&amp;#39;m asking....what should I do? What would you do in my shoes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for listening to my speech, haha, I know I wrote a lot, but wanted to put it all out there, so the full picture is there. I&amp;#39;m genuinely really unsure what I want. And what I&amp;#39;m willing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to go with my (stubborn) gut. My gut...my &amp;quot;right now&amp;quot; answer? It says, stay put. Why change for uncertainty. I&amp;#39;m comfortable now. I&amp;#39;m happy where I&amp;#39;m at. I can pay my bills okay. I have good work life balance, and my mental health now is in a so much better place now with my role. I worry, I&amp;#39;m jumping into too much unknown just for money/prestige. But at the same time, I worry I&amp;#39;ll regret not taking it too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AHHHHH! Like I said.....dilemma huh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, what should I be asking the recruiter?&lt;/p&gt;

My question here is does it affect my chances getting into an good MBA program if I choose Core Company over the BIG 4? I already worked in one of the Big 4's, feel like one is enough. 

I know MBA Admission is holistic process, but the above question is bothering me a lot. I can  put some stats here, which may help you better.

Hey guys,

Context - MBA Supply Chain - Good University - Top 40

What a great start to 2024 huh. 0  Interview call backs- couple hundred applications and constant ghosting. I've been through multiple interviews 5-6 rounds to either be ghosted or passed on by someone who was a better fit. 

Twice I've crossed the finish line only to be held up in expecting an offer - my impatience may have cost me those roles; tbh I waited a good 1 month-1.5 months for some movement on those companies part; at one company they knew I had to move out of state and was staying in a motel because they kept telling just one more week- despite them knowing I was taking on a hotel costs and putting my life on hold. But I was patient for 1 month- at that point I got fed up of sitting in a hotel room and not being able to just live- I told them I was backing out because of the process; only to be met by a rude email from hr saying ""OK"" - no apology for their lack of movement or explanation. Just pissed me off completely. 

Second I was told in the final round that we are most likely going to hire you- you have 99% chance blah blah- we even discussed in the interview where I should move and what areas were good. At the end of the call HR said give me 2 DAYS. I waited for a week - no response; assumed they were still ironing out stuff- this continued for another month then I got mad to just be left hanging without the courtesy of just letting me know FFS. Emailed the entire team that interviewed me HM, HR and members thanking them for the consideration but due to the lack of communication/professionalism I wasn't interested in the role anymore. I kept it clean no harsh words but wanted to throw HR under the bus- so sue me. Got an instant replying saying I said 2 weeks- but we decided you're not a good fit. I just laughed it off because clearly a firecracker got lit under the HR rep's ass. 2 weeks- please. 

Anyways That all happened in 2023 Q2-3 - since then I've just been interviewing and getting ghosted/passed on constantly. People say oh my resume is great blah blah- heard it all. It's been over a year now and I am still in the hole; keep trying to see the light in things but I just don't. I've lost the motivation to build my skills because the fuck does it matter- I get a certification in X but a company wants it in Y.  

At this point I got so desperate to just have some fkn purpose I offered people just give me a chance at their companies as an intern- I am a 30YROLD MBA - ha. I just wanted to keep the GAP closed on my resume and just have some purpose.  But no one wants to give me a training role, entry level role etc. 

I even got more desperate I messaged recruiters on LinkedIn- asking about the industry, if they had any advice- etc. Got only we'll keep you in mind or no responses.  I have 0 network but my family/friends have some pull. I went against all my judgements/ego just to get referred into an interview. 

First place - was supposed to be an easy 100% in- this was a close family friend- I've worked with them before and they knew me well. They were expanding their operations and I was the type of person that could add some function - aka be trusted in the industry/office. I deep down didn't want this role but it was a start and a lucrative industry. I could grow; and they'd pay me ok. I went to meet the CEO- only to be left waiting for 5-6 hours. It probably would've been another 4-5 hours before I could see this person as they were extremely busy. Their employees in the meantime were stuck just waiting with me as I couldn't be left alone at the factory - I could see their work was being held up because of me so I bowed out saying I should leave. I messaged the CEO letting them know that it seems extremely busy- let's meet over the weekend - he lives in the same neighborhood and we're close in terms of family relations. Unfortunately never heard from them again. Despite them saying themselves they wanted me back at the company and begging me to come work for them. Probably was all an act IDK. 

Weeks go by- a second friend sees my struggle and gets me an interview at a place. It's not in an industry I am well aware of - they weren't looking but out of respect for my friend they entertained an interview.  I've made the mistake of just conforming to jobs before to get experience and out of respect I told them exactly what I was looking for in terms of growth. I had a clear vision/path and their operations do revolve around what I was looking for. That being said I wanted to let them know what I am about and was clear on everything. Interview didn't go that great because I was honest- they felt I wouldn't stick around long enough for them to really see the value of taking me on as an ""intern"" - they wanted to know if they took me on full time what would I want as pay. I was extremely honest on my budget- throwing my leverage out the window because of my friend.  I lowballed myself to 50% of my rate just to show my interest in learning and getting involved. Seems that didn't work either... another situation which should've gone in my favor just out of my grasp. Either my pay requirement was too high or they felt I was a liability in their efforts for the long run/effort. I can respect that. 

At this point I've run out of ideas; I've redone my CV 100s of times, taken interview classes, tried speaking to people and IDK what else I can do. I am considering taking some initiative and starting a small business - but have no clue in what. Everything I look at has immense competition and bigger fish who can just quickly adapt to better ideas. I don't have an a specialized knowledge in niche area to leverage in a business. 

I just look at this void of ineffective applying.... wondering where did I fk up... was college a mistake....I've put everything in my life on hold. Don't want to get in any relationships/commitments because I am not financially stable to even think of a partner- despite family annoying the heck out of me to date lol. How could you... 

The only thing good going for me is that I've lost close to 150lbs because of my unhealthy work life and food habits. Was hit with T2 due to obesity at work and constant drinking/smoking stress. So atleast I've gone into remission on that... but fk I am just a mess. People just constantly judge me when I meet them and I don't really know what else I can do; I know my friend is going to be disappointed I didn't get that role. I know my family all stopped calling/asking me about my job hunt because they are disappointed. And everyone else who have offered to help just flake.

At this point I am just numb- unmotivated mentally and put on a fake smile. But deep down I just feel empty. When an entry level role needs 3-4 years experience in a specific industry application how can I even get in. 

I keep hearing Supply chain is so in demand how are you not getting anything I just want to die inside. I mean I've tried everything under the sun to get in.

Sorry for the long post- but can't be open with anyone. I hope I didn't depress you all too much with my mess of a life... I just hope I find my way sooner rather than later. If I ever do open anything my god I am going to help a lot of people.

&lt;p&gt;Second I was told in the final round that we are most likely going to hire you- you have 99% chance blah blah- we even discussed in the interview where I should move and what areas were good. At the end of the call HR said give me 2 DAYS. I waited for a week - no response; assumed they were still ironing out stuff- this continued for another month then I got mad to just be left hanging without the courtesy of just letting me know FFS. Emailed the entire team that interviewed me HM, HR and members thanking them for the consideration but due to the lack of communication/professionalism I wasn&amp;#39;t interested in the role anymore. I kept it clean no harsh words but wanted to throw HR under the bus- so sue me. Got an instant replying saying I said 2 weeks- but we decided you&amp;#39;re not a good fit. I just laughed it off because clearly a firecracker got lit under the HR rep&amp;#39;s ass. 2 weeks- please. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways That all happened in 2023 Q2-3 - since then I&amp;#39;ve just been interviewing and getting ghosted/passed on constantly. People say oh my resume is great blah blah- heard it all. It&amp;#39;s been over a year now and I am still in the hole; keep trying to see the light in things but I just don&amp;#39;t. I&amp;#39;ve lost the motivation to build my skills because the fuck does it matter- I get a certification in X but a company wants it in Y.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I got so desperate to just have some fkn purpose I offered people just give me a chance at their companies as an intern- I am a 30YROLD MBA - ha. I just wanted to keep the GAP closed on my resume and just have some purpose.  But no one wants to give me a training role, entry level role etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I even got more desperate I messaged recruiters on LinkedIn- asking about the industry, if they had any advice- etc. Got only we&amp;#39;ll keep you in mind or no responses.  I have 0 network but my family/friends have some pull. I went against all my judgements/ego just to get referred into an interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First place - was supposed to be an easy 100% in- this was a close family friend- I&amp;#39;ve worked with them before and they knew me well. They were expanding their operations and I was the type of person that could add some function - aka be trusted in the industry/office. I deep down didn&amp;#39;t want this role but it was a start and a lucrative industry. I could grow; and they&amp;#39;d pay me ok. I went to meet the CEO- only to be left waiting for 5-6 hours. It probably would&amp;#39;ve been another 4-5 hours before I could see this person as they were extremely busy. Their employees in the meantime were stuck just waiting with me as I couldn&amp;#39;t be left alone at the factory - I could see their work was being held up because of me so I bowed out saying I should leave. I messaged the CEO letting them know that it seems extremely busy- let&amp;#39;s meet over the weekend - he lives in the same neighborhood and we&amp;#39;re close in terms of family relations. Unfortunately never heard from them again. Despite them saying themselves they wanted me back at the company and begging me to come work for them. Probably was all an act IDK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weeks go by- a second friend sees my struggle and gets me an interview at a place. It&amp;#39;s not in an industry I am well aware of - they weren&amp;#39;t looking but out of respect for my friend they entertained an interview.  I&amp;#39;ve made the mistake of just conforming to jobs before to get experience and out of respect I told them exactly what I was looking for in terms of growth. I had a clear vision/path and their operations do revolve around what I was looking for. That being said I wanted to let them know what I am about and was clear on everything. Interview didn&amp;#39;t go that great because I was honest- they felt I wouldn&amp;#39;t stick around long enough for them to really see the value of taking me on as an &amp;quot;intern&amp;quot; - they wanted to know if they took me on full time what would I want as pay. I was extremely honest on my budget- throwing my leverage out the window because of my friend.  I lowballed myself to 50% of my rate just to show my interest in learning and getting involved. Seems that didn&amp;#39;t work either... another situation which should&amp;#39;ve gone in my favor just out of my grasp. Either my pay requirement was too high or they felt I was a liability in their efforts for the long run/effort. I can respect that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I&amp;#39;ve run out of ideas; I&amp;#39;ve redone my CV 100s of times, taken interview classes, tried speaking to people and IDK what else I can do. I am considering taking some initiative and starting a small business - but have no clue in what. Everything I look at has immense competition and bigger fish who can just quickly adapt to better ideas. I don&amp;#39;t have an a specialized knowledge in niche area to leverage in a business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just look at this void of ineffective applying.... wondering where did I fk up... was college a mistake....I&amp;#39;ve put everything in my life on hold. Don&amp;#39;t want to get in any relationships/commitments because I am not financially stable to even think of a partner- despite family annoying the heck out of me to date lol. How could you... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing good going for me is that I&amp;#39;ve lost close to 150lbs because of my unhealthy work life and food habits. Was hit with T2 due to obesity at work and constant drinking/smoking stress. So atleast I&amp;#39;ve gone into remission on that... but fk I am just a mess. People just constantly judge me when I meet them and I don&amp;#39;t really know what else I can do; I know my friend is going to be disappointed I didn&amp;#39;t get that role. I know my family all stopped calling/asking me about my job hunt because they are disappointed. And everyone else who have offered to help just flake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I am just numb- unmotivated mentally and put on a fake smile. But deep down I just feel empty. When an entry level role needs 3-4 years experience in a specific industry application how can I even get in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep hearing Supply chain is so in demand how are you not getting anything I just want to die inside. I mean I&amp;#39;ve tried everything under the sun to get in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long post- but can&amp;#39;t be open with anyone. I hope I didn&amp;#39;t depress you all too much with my mess of a life... I just hope I find my way sooner rather than later. If I ever do open anything my god I am going to help a lot of people.   &lt;/p&gt;

,mac,"Ill go straight to the point. 

Im a proggraming student and I want to upgrade my 2015-2017 MBA, and I found a 15"" MBA and a 14"" MBP for the same price, both being the base models (8 RAM, 256 SSD for the 15"" MBA and 16RAM, 512 SSD for the 14"" MBP)

Im asking here because Im getting frustrated as I've been researching for several days but I can not find an answer, so I hope some of you can give me a clear answer or at least some of your experiences with one of those laptops and help me decide.

So here is what im looking for:


I want to use it for almost everything possible (coding, watching videos, a bit of gaming, chatting...) so I need the most comfortable keyboard and a really good screen. Also I know that I wont ever connect an external display

I do spend hours watching video content so idk if its better a higher quality display or a larger one to watch this content.

I want something that feels good to use, something that gives you the feeling of wanting to be more time with that specific laptop because of how comfortable it is.

I also move a lot so I need a laptop that its comfortable to carry everyehere and I need the battery last several hours

I know that I wont ever edit videos or photos nor do 3D moddeling (at least professionally or continuously, maybe I slightly edit 1 or 2 random photos or something like that).

Id also like to keep the laptop for several years



I guess thats all I can say my use will be.

I used the word 'conundrum' for a reason. if you don't know its meaning, know that you are not someone with whom I'd fit in. I will prioritise writer with well-lived life, good vocabulary and English, and genuine understanding of what nymphomania is.

You will play the role of Aditi.

""Aditi, now 29, is what neighbours and relatives want their daughters to be. A quiet, well-mannered woman, Aditi has gone on to lengths to have this facade working. From visiting temples, to dressing modestly, to working at a high-paying job after completing her MBA from an Ivy League university - she has done it all.

However, Aditi harbors a secret that only she, and a select few know. A crazed nymphomaniac, Aditi was diagnosed with hypersexuality when she was 16. The next few years saw Aditi learning how to manage her needs, waking up most mornings, disgusted with the choices she made the night before.

Plenty of therapy sessions later - today Aditi is at a stage in her life, where she is well-versed with managing both her tame, domesticated side, and her wild and irrationally corrupted side

However, fate has dealt her another strange deck of cards. Her father, a well-known builder, has arranged Aditi's marriage to Sanjay, an investment banker, son of an equally wealthy businessman in Mumbai.

To her dismay, Aditi soon realises that Sanjay is diametrically opposite to her. With just one 1-year relationship in his life, Sanjay is both inexperienced in matters of sex - and matters of managing a woman's emotions.

***This roleplay has multiple directions it could go***  
\- It could be an interesting slice of life, transformation roleplay, where Aditi will make Sanjay understand her nymphomania, and take him to sexual journeys that he never imagined (the most preferred)

\- Aditi can start living another double life, having affairs on side (I'll play multiple characters, not something I'd prefer but can try).

**With that said, my ideal partner would be someone who -**

\-has a flair in writing, can write in multiple paragraphs (5-6 lines), is comfortable in English, Hindi, Hinglish

\-someone who won't shy away from doing the hard work of coming up with character bios.

**BG:**¬†26 yo female with 5 years of experience in venture capital and family office. Business major from undergrad. International student.

&amp;#x200B;

**Post-MBA goals:**¬†Pivot to tech PM, starting my own startup or join other tech startups, with goal to move west after graduation (preferably SoCal, then SF).

&amp;#x200B;

**Application results:**

**MBA**:

Haas - No scholarship awarded yet

Ross - Received the Dean‚Äôs Impact Scholars (Full-tuition scholarship + living stipend for two years of study at Ross)

Anderson - Half scholarship awarded. If go to Anderson, will try to apply for the MBA/MSCS (Master of Science in Computer Science) concurrent degree program during the study of the first semester.

HBS - Dinged after interview

Waitlisted on other M7s and awarded scholarships in other M16s.

**MIMS (Master of Information and Systems) at UC Berkeley School of Information**

I was very surprised to be admitted to the MIMS program as all my educational and working experiences are in business, non-tech-related. Since I hope to pivot to tech PM roles, I have been self-studying Python and algorithms from edX since last year to equip myself with the technical skills. I really loved the MIMS cohort (\~50 students) and the program‚Äôs focus on the intersection of technology, information, and people.

&amp;#x200B;

**Sincerely seek your perspectives and suggestions:**

Considering my post-MBA career goals and location preferences, I truly value your advice on which program I should choose.

I‚Äôve reached out to Berkeley Haas and the I School for possibility of pursuing both the MBA and MIMS program simultaneously, but they said NO. Should I enroll in the MIMS program this fall, accumulate work experience in the tech industry after graduation, and apply for the GSB MSx program and the MIT Sloan Fellow program in the future? Or should I opt for an MBA this fall? If so, I intend to apply for the OMSCS (Online Master of Science in Computer Science) at Georgia Tech to gain some technical skills.

I sincerely hope to receive your insights on which program I should pursue. Thank you very much for your help!!!

&lt;p&gt;Considering my post-MBA career goals and location preferences, I truly value your advice on which program I should choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve reached out to Berkeley Haas and the I School for possibility of pursuing both the MBA and MIMS program simultaneously, but they said NO. Should I enroll in the MIMS program this fall, accumulate work experience in the tech industry after graduation, and apply for the GSB MSx program and the MIT Sloan Fellow program in the future? Or should I opt for an MBA this fall? If so, I intend to apply for the OMSCS (Online Master of Science in Computer Science) at Georgia Tech to gain some technical skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sincerely hope to receive your insights on which program I should pursue. Thank you very much for your help!!!&lt;/p&gt;

Since I hope to pivot to tech PM roles, I have been self-studying Python and algorithms from edX since last year to equip myself with the technical skills. I really loved the MIMS cohort (\~50 students) and the program‚Äôs focus on the intersection of technology, information, and people.

 

**Fun storyÔºö**

To further my career aspirations, I applied for a tech PM role at an AI startup last year to gain relevant experience. Since I didn‚Äôt have any prior tech-related experience, I didn‚Äôt receive any response after interviewing for a full-time PM role at this AI startup. Facing the potential of rejection from this company, I spent a month diving deep into the product of this startup. I binge-watched all their YouTube videos and LinkedIn posts, read every single review about their products on Product Hunt and G2, and joined their Discord and FB groups to observe and understand the needs and feedback of their users. I did everything I could to learn all the info about the startup and its product. Then I sent two letters to the founder, detailing my analysis of the product‚Äôs strengths and challenges, and outlining my work plan after joining the company. Finally, I got the opportunity to intern at this startup without salary.

During this internship, I felt like I finally found my ‚Äúcareer‚Äù, instead of just a ‚Äújob‚Äù. Working at a startup was very intense. I slept only about an hour a day, but seeing the iterations of the product and helping the users was very fulfilling. However, after I came up with some questions and suggestions to the founder, I was let go.

When I joined the startup last year, they had \~20 people. Now they have \~40 people and have just closed a new round of financing, making them a Silicon Valley AI unicorn. Although I was let go, I am still very happy for them. Four lessons I learned from my unpaid internship there:

1. "" Having ownership"" might be a fallacy; sometimes we have too much ownership but are not the owners of the company.
2. Money matters. People don‚Äôt value the things they get for free.
3. I truly love building products!!!
4. Having a strong grasp of technical knowledge is very important for being a PM at a tech startup. Without this foundation, PMs may face challenges in effectively persuading developers and engineers to advance specific features. This has fueled my eagerness to deepen my technical expertise during my MBA studies.

After being let go by this startup, I was very fortunate to have the opportunity to return to the VC firm where I had previously worked. Otherwise, I would have been ""jobless"" during the application cycle.

,careerguidance,"I found this reddit group and realized that a lot of early career professionals who are where I was, LOST, in their 20s. I just want to share my story and hopefully this gives some hope.  
My Journey of Perseverance and Growth  
The Humble Beginnings  
My journey began in India, where I graduated with a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Mechanical Engineering from a reputable school. Despite my academic achievements, I lost track of my life when I moved to US for higher education. There was a time when I didn‚Äôt even have $4 to call my parents back in India. This moment of financial constraint marked the beginning of a series of challenges that would test my resolve and resilience.  
Chasing Dreams by coming to the United States  
Filled with dreams and ambition, I embarked on a new chapter by moving to the US for a Master‚Äôs program. However, the stress of adapting to this new environment while maintaining my personal well-being soon became overwhelming. Realizing the importance of my mental health, I made the difficult decision to drop out. This period was one of immense learning and introspection, during which a generous friend offered me shelter, helping me stay afloat during these tumultuous times.  
Rebuilding from Scratch  
Determined to rebuild my career, I pursued Java Programming certifications, laying the groundwork for what would become a decade of gradual progress and self-discovery. It was a time of reflection, hard work, and tenacity.  
A Turning Point  
A decade into my journey, I experienced an epiphany that set me on a path to maximize my potential. My life had always been a narrative of second chances, and with renewed vigor, I applied for a Master‚Äôs in Computer Engineering. My initial application was rejected due to my earlier academic dropout, but undeterred, I improved my application by excelling in courses at a local community college.  
Breaking Into Cloud Computing  
Gaining admission the following year, I delved into the paradigm-shifting field of cloud computing. This period required me to confront and overcome many internal demons, but it eventually led to a position at a pioneering company in cloud computing, balancing a demanding job with family responsibilities.  
Embracing Continuous Growth  
After years of professional stagnation, I sought ways to break free and continue growing. I adopted a contrarian thinking approach, cultivated a growth mindset, and consumed a vast array of knowledge through audiobooks on leadership, behavioral economics, neuroscience, psychology, and more. This quest for knowledge helped me challenge conventional wisdom and remain in a perpetual state of learning.  
A Story of Second Chances  
My persistence paid off when I was admitted to a top MBA program on my second attempt, overcoming significant internal struggles along the way. This achievement was a testament to the power of second chances and the importance of never giving up.  
Sharing My Methodologies  
Today, my life is a testament to breaking barriers and overcoming odds. My experiences have equipped me with concrete methodologies to escape the constraints of conventional thinking. It‚Äôs my belief that if I could navigate through these challenges and succeed, so can you.

M3 MBA vs M3 MBP: I've had this same question, but maybe a little more specific to my use of Final Cut Pro X. I make about hour-long school videos for their band and theater shows. I;m probably still in the amateur level of editing with my transitions, but I do try to make them nice. I do use 2 different cameras so I'm working with multiple files to edit different camera angles. I'm using an older 2017 MBP that still works, but is often in demand with the rest of the family. I also have an 2016 MBA (lower specs) that I wouldn't even try to use FCPX on because it's slow with normal apps (Safari, Chrome, etc...), but nobody ever wants to use it in the family because it's so slow, hahaha.

So, I'm thinking about getting another MacBook. I've thought about getting a 15"" M3 MBA with more memory which I think should have enough power behind it to use FCPX, however, I've read mixed reviews on the M3 MBA vs MBP. Mainly due to the lack of cooling fan. I really want to get the MBA over the MBP, but worried it might not keep up WRT not having a cooling fan.

Anyone have an opinion on M3 MBA vs M3 MBP WRT FCPX? (love the string of acronyms to finish the post :) )

After quiting HRM position I wanted to move up but don't have credentials as of yet(in school and studying also much cheaper than not being a student as it's only 25% of regular price vs non student). I applied to many jobs at Fed and state government and finally had the best or worse case scenario happen. 
Here's where I need yous guys help.

I applied for HR position at Amazon March 12 and then received a email from university recruiter same day in LinkedIn. I applied for both. I also failed to mention I applied for seasonal HR and was rejected around Christmas 23', so I reluctantly applied again. I received the congrats email from Amazon but still waiting on the details. Level4-5?, pay range 62-5/68-5. Signon and rsu TBD.  I applied for federal and state and got the following. I was approved for the only statuses available GS-4/5 and pay ranges from 40-57500 for pay. It's low especially for Chicagoland area but offers hybrid work environment. Given this information what would you guys choose? Also forgot the Fed position is a temp role for one year at a time.

,macbook,"Ill go straight to the point. 

Im a proggraming student and I want to upgrade my 2015-2017 MBA, and I found a 15"" MBA and a 14"" MBP for the same price, both being the base models (8 RAM, 256 SSD for the 15"" MBA and 16RAM, 512 SSD for the 14"" MBP)

Im asking here because Im getting frustrated as I've been researching for several days but I can not find an answer, so I hope some of you can give me a clear answer or at least some of your experiences with one of those laptops and help me decide.

So here is what im looking for:


I want to use it for almost everything possible (coding, watching videos, a bit of gaming, chatting...) so I need the most comfortable keyboard and a really good screen. Also I know that I wont ever connect an external display

I do spend hours watching video content so idk if its better a higher quality display or a larger one to watch this content.

I want something that feels good to use, something that gives you the feeling of wanting to be more time with that specific laptop because of how comfortable it is.

I also move a lot so I need a laptop that its comfortable to carry everyehere and I need the battery last several hours

I know that I wont ever edit videos or photos nor do 3D moddeling (at least professionally or continuously, maybe I slightly edit 1 or 2 random photos or something like that).

Id also like to keep the laptop for several years



I guess thats all I can say my use will be.

Never thought I'd be making a post like this (I prefer to lurk), but here goes. I really didn't think I'd be getting in, but I was admitted to Kellogg's 3-year JD-MBA this morning with $$ as a somewhat non-trad and I'd like to share my thoughts:

**1) They aren't kidding about the holistic admissions, and I'm specifically addressing this implicit idea that a GMAT/FE above 710/655 is what you** ***need*** **for the A.** 

I was a non-quantitative major at a US university, and when I started my GMAT prep, I was wildly out of my depth: I scored a 415 on my first mock. Granted, I'd taken the LSAT, so I was good at verbal, but quant and DI were horrid. Eventually, I brought it up to a 615 and finally a 635 (thanks TTP), neither of which I thought would be sufficient for the top JD-MBA programs. In fact, some current MBAs told me it probably isn't a score worth applying with. But six months into my prep and hundred of dollars later, I figured I might as well apply to dignify the hard work I put in (can elaborate on my GMAT journey if requested). When I received that 635 and sent it off to my schools, I found out I was at a whopping 47th percentile in the Kellogg applicant pool, which I thought would eliminate me right away. Of course, that kind of thinking was completely incorrect. What was the big takeaway here? Yes, your GMAT matters. And if I'd applied with that 415, I would've probably caught an R. But it isn't everything and, given the way American society's view of standardized testing is changing, there's a good likelihood it didn't matter nearly as much as I thought it would've. So what gives?

**2) Your personality is extremely important, probably more so than anything else**

Behind the anonymized, text-driven communications on Reddit, I found it easy to fall into the stat trap.  I saw someone doubting their own 720 score and somebody else discouraging a fellow r/MBA\-er from applying altogether because of their 2.8 UGPA. I'm not an AdCom, so that advice *might've* been sound, but I think your personality matters far more. Your 800 will mean nothing if you tick off your interviewer or if you've never assumed a leadership role. And your amazing personality will shine a million times brighter in your interview with your very human interviewer than your 630. So much so, in fact, that your AdCom may be willing to go to bat for you in a tie-breaker situation, or switch your R to a WL. A lot of people seem to lose sight that of the fact that business‚Äîand, by extension, the MBA‚Äîare highly relationship-driven. Put it this way: as an MBA student, *you* are the product, meaning your school is looking to coach you to be a conscientious businessperson and then ""sell"" you to an employer. Your personality, willingness to learn, and decorum are paramount in that process. I invite those who disagree with me to show me an employer who is persuaded by your GMAT alone to hire you.

**3) There are a million reasons you** ***shouldn't*** **apply to your desired program; none of them matter**

Obviously, I'm not talking about people who are in line for a $450k PE exit or big promotion at a FAANG. And I'm not talking about people whose familial concerns may make an MBA not worth it. If the cost of even applying to an MBA outweighs the benefits, don't bother. Rather, I am specifically addressing those who feel that you shouldn't apply based on a lack of stats. Quite frankly, I had no business applying: only &lt;2 YoE with a relatively standard role, leadership mostly from college, and laid off Q4 '23. My R's from everywhere else probably demonstrate that point. Whatever your reason is, it just doesn't matter. Unless you don't want to pay the application fee, I encourage anyone with any stats to apply to just one or two of the T20s if you could see yourself there. Nobody is qualified to tell you you shouldn't apply. I see this a lot with Indian engineers, many of whom are told to wait for a promotion or GMAT score because they're overrepresented and ""schools are tired of the archetype."" If the timing works for you, it's time to apply now and shoot your shot. What's the worst that happens?

,SarahBowmar,"Hello and welcome to r/SarahBowmar! This subreddit is dedicated to discussing all things Bowmar related. 

If you have stumbled across this sub, and are currently a Bowmar fan, here are a few reasons that you may want to re-evaluate that stance. And if you found your way here by Sarah being rude towards you‚Ä¶ welcome! :) Grab a glass of wine, and let‚Äôs get into all of the Bowmar controversies.

**Sarah‚Äôs poor business practices**

* Sarah appears unprofessional regarding her businesses often - in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/j5oe9l/you_can_go_live_and_not_save_it_but_its_still/) post, you can see how she responds to her competitors while live.
* Sarah spoke badly about the Girl Scouts for not working with her on a protein powder, which you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/kfb76r/sarah_talking_about_girl_scouts_rejecting_their/). She stated that they didn‚Äôt want to get into the protein business, which is clearly untrue, as seen [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/kfirv1/to_answer_the_girl_scout_question_someones_lying/) Shout out to the Girl Scouts for not associating with Sarah.
* There is evidence of Sarah being shady regarding her own company, Bowmar Nutrition. 
   * Their greens have no micronutrient information and she has ignored the question numerous times when asked. 
   * Their whey protein formula changed based on long-term customer perceptions of taste, smell, texture, mixing and cooking ability. When questioned, she stated that it was the cows. 

**Sarah‚Äôs BLM controversy**

* During the 2020 BLM protests, Sarah refused to acknowledge it. Once she was called out on it, she tweeted ‚ÄúIn case you need me to influence you to not be racist, Black Lives Matter.‚Äù She received a ton of backlash and ended up deleting her Twitter account. You can view the tweet [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/nagpjq/sarahs_blm_response_last_summer/).
* [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/koepyf/several_screenshots_of_sarah_lashing_out_at/) are more screenshots of the backlash.
* During all of this controversy, Sarah‚Äôs only black athlete (Libby Christiansen) spoke up regarding her horrible mistreatment by Sarah. Libby made an IG story after the BLM controversy when she broke her contract with Bowmar Nutrition, in which she spoke about the horrible mistreatment by Sarah and her unrealistic expectations, the miniscule amount of money that she made off of her sales, and the overall poor working experience that she had with Sarah. Her explanation was up for a while under her ‚ÄúBLM‚Äù highlight on her IG, but it has since been removed. Other influencers also broke their contract with Bowmar Nutrition over this - see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/gy3i3b/who_has_terminated_their_contract_with_bowmar/).
* Another consequence of her BLM response was her getting dropped by Balance Atheletica, who she was an athlete for. Sarah stated that ‚Äúshe had no idea why she was dropped‚Äù (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Ft9wz84tm1j451.jpg)), and Steve, Balance Athetica‚Äôs owner, went on live and made a statement that she knows exactly why she was dropped, and that it was due to her BLM response. No screenshots as it was live, but there is discussion about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/lhsq9q/can_someone_fill_me_in_one_what_happened_with/)

**Sarah &amp; Josh‚Äôs animal cruelty**

* Josh boasted about spearing a bear in Canada, which you can read more about [here.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/josh-bowmar-hunter-alberta-bear-spear-charges-prosecution-a7196346.html) This event led to them being dropped by Under Armour, more info on that [here.](https://www.businessinsider.com/under-armour-drops-sarah-bowmar-2016-8)
* This act of animal cruelty even led to a new law being adopted in Alberta, in which they made spearing a bear illegal. You can read about this [here.](https://globalnews.ca/news/4011535/alberta-bans-spear-hunting-bear-video/#:~:text=Spears%20and%20spear%2Dthrowing%20tools,gear%20will%20still%20be%20legal.) 
* Sarah has a plethora of farm animals, and things keep happening to them. Recently, her chickens got mutilated and died from a mink getting into their enclosure (TW - dead chickens, see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/1bjd9io/o_picking_up_the_dead_chickens/)). 
* Sarah bakes using chemicals and because she won‚Äôt eat food, she feeds them to the animals. See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/17056tt/what_eating_disorder/). This is not healthy or appropriate food for animals.

**Sarah &amp; Josh‚Äôs hunting practices**

* To preface - this sub is not anti-hunting. There are many hunters amongst us. The key difference is that our members are *ethical* hunters*.* 
* Sarah and Josh are certified poachers (more on the Bowmar v USA lawsuit down below.) [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/lwk5uo/read_all_comments_another_speeding_ticket/) is a charge for hunting without a tag or license. 
* [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/1bhcynf/for_the_sake_of_having_receipts_nsfw_swipe/) is a post where Sarah states the animals that she would never hunt, with another photo of her with the carcass of one of those said animals, a few years later.
* The general consensus of this sub is that Sarah has a white savior complex. When hunting in Africa, she makes it seem like she is single-handedly keeping a village alive by donating her meat, when donating is not even her own choice - it‚Äôs something that she has to do, because they cannot take the meat home with them. You can see more details about that[ here.](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F8twyc3e1q1pb1.jpg)
* Sarah and Josh are trophy hunters, even though they claimed not to be for years. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/q0bqgv/i_dont_hunt_is_it_normal_to_keep_the_stomach/) is just one example of her trophies.

**Sarah‚Äôs conspiracy theories** 

* Sarah does not believe in Covid-19. She spent the entirety of 2020 (and 2021, and 2022, and 2023, and now in 2024‚Ä¶) denying the pandemic. You can view posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/11cpuk0/im_confused_didnt_we_know_this_we_already_knew_it/), [here ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/j5n5ep/sarah_bowmar_talking_about_the_plandemic_video_in/)and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/rhh24e/sarah_and_her_conspiracy_theories/) regarding this.
* Sarah does not believe in climate change. [Here ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/isc3lj/oh_look_shes_posting_conspiracy_theory_shit_again/)is a post of her claiming that the government is starting wildfires, because a map showed the wildfire stopping at the US / Canadian border‚Ä¶. a map from a US government website. 

**Sarah‚Äôs harmful messages regarding health &amp; wellness**

* Sarah exercises for hours and hours, along with working out 7 days per week for her ‚Äúmental health.‚Äù [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/19eo0kd/so_much_to_unpack_here/) is a post where she exercised for 3.5 hours in one day, and [here](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F2pneng3whukc1.png) is a post where she shares that she does not take rest days.
* Sarah has claimed that taking testosterone will save 99% of marriages (seriously - see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/193ia2g/hormones_do_not_fix_intimacy/).) She also states that optimal levels for women are 200 - 300, and linked a [blog](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fliy176x1zrmc1.jpeg) that she found with this information. You will find that the appropriate number for women should be 15-70 ng/dl. Just about every website will tell you this if you google, but here is [one](https://www.verywellhealth.com/testosterone-levels-5212199). In this blog [post](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fdv2jwtuquwqc1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D1080%26format%3Dpjpg%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D0a7978f21c34dc72e8f21ba7d384d17e803389eb), she states that her testosterone levels are at 250. 
* Sarah claims that carrots detox extra estrogen. She went on a whole carrot salad kick, which you can see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/18jxbwq/she_really_takes_a_trend_and_runs_with_it_and_as/). I dug so deep for an evidence-based peer reviewed study on carrots detoxing estrogen, and not a single one exists. 
* Sarah posted that she doesn‚Äôt care if she gets cancer due to her excessive T use, which you can see [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/1471dws/so_much_to_call_out_but_shed_rather_have_cancer/) She said that by the time she gets cancer in 15 years, medicine will have advanced enough to cure it. Direct quote: ‚ÄúI would rather live like a superhero for the next 30 years and die of cancer, than feel like shit for 50 years.‚Äù
* Sarah constantly posts body checking photos. She is so proud of her [floor abs](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/18uflwp/daily_ab_check/) that she posts them quite literally every day. Members of this sub have stated how triggering these body checking posts are, as many of us have struggled / are currently struggling with eating disorders. 

**Sarah‚Äôs perfect marriage &amp; parenting**

* Sarah and Josh went on live once to discuss how testosterone saved their marriage.. She claimed that she was in one of the worst mental states of her life postpartum, and that Josh was hounding her for sex before she was even cleared for it. Sarah was uninterested (as most women are after birth), so Josh encouraged her to get on testosterone to increase her libido. In this sub‚Äôs opinion, this makes it seem that it wasn‚Äôt testosterone that saved her marriage - it was her putting out. Sarah has stated that she believes that sex is the only thing that differentiates a friendship from a relationship. In [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/193ia2g/hormones_do_not_fix_intimacy/), she talks about how once intimacy is established, the relationship will flourish.
* But it doesn‚Äôt stop there - apparently T wasn‚Äôt the cure for her marriage. [Oyster pills](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fudj5xosv3wub1.png), [pilates &amp; pelvic floor work](https://sarahbowmar.com/2023/10/pelvic-floor-pt-and-pilates-saved-my-marriage/) also saved her marriage.
* Sarah made a post regarding date nights (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/xhy2tr/more_of_her_trying_to_justify_their_shitty/)) and how date nights only contribute to 1% of a healthy marriage, and we should focus on the other 99% (allegedly, this means sex). 
* Sarah constantly makes posts online towards other men, stating that they ‚Äújust got her pregnant.‚Äù (See[ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/1abk93r/daddy_morgan/).) At one point, she was horny for a [truck.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/15p6xik/_/)
* Sarah and Josh would not take their children trick-or-treating because one neighbor made bullets, and one has peacocks. She stated that ‚Äúhell would freeze over before Josh misses a sit on Halloween to go trick or treating.‚Äù (Last photo on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/17l4kxw/for_anyone_who_missed_it_she_did_a_breakdown_of/))
* There are countless posts of her under-dressing her children in weather well below freezing. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/1afo8lo/mother_of_the_year_allowing_her_children_to_take/) is just one of many posts on it.
* Ever since Dean was born, he has appeared to have some health issues. Sarah stated that her pediatrician urged her to conduct a sleep study for him, but due to the sleep study being 2 hours away, she just didn‚Äôt have time so she wouldn‚Äôt be doing it, yet she spends countless hours doing other things. See [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/x3rwj2/taking_dean_on_a_trip_to_alaska_was_no_problem/)
* Sarah received a DM from someone regarding Oakley and how she was behind developmentally. Our sleuths on this sub (and MHGA) pointed out that the small part of the photo that was visible is identical to the Bowmar Farms account. Literally down to the same HEX#. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/wbxz7k/video_proof_sarah_used_her_bowmar_farms_page_to/) is the post theorizing this. This is an alleged opinion, and not proved.
* [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/18leiov/yeah_sarugh_your_feral_kids_dont_know_how_to/) is a photo where Sarah is showing Oakley measuring and weighing food. I will let you come to your own conclusions on how to feel about that.
* Sarah allows her children to play with animal [poop](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/16ckpga/playing_with_poop/) and [dead carcasses](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/1307wox/yep_letting_her_daughter_play_with_a_dead_bird/). 

**Sarah‚Äôs superiority complex**

* Sarah was pregnant for four years - with two children. World record pregnancy
* Her children are [19 months apart](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/17pt47t/get_off_the_internet_you_clown/)
* She is obsessed with [looking better than she did pre-pregnancy](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/17rnmoi/here_lies_sarah_bowmar/), and proved to the haters who told her it would be hard to bounce back wrong.
* She took speed reading in highschool
* She got her MBA in 11 months
* She‚Äôs married to a [Greek God](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/17hwyck/greek_god/), [all American athlete at a D1 school](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/z7e5mz/two_time_athletic_all_american_i_can_almost/), who is a [self-taught engineer](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/z7e5mz/two_time_athletic_all_american_i_can_almost/)

**Sarah‚Äôs world records**

* [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/18o17mo/another_one/) is Josh claiming that he got a world record croc.
* [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/v6kpv6/these_two_idiots_and_their_world_records_i_stg/) is Josh claiming that he caught a world record carp.
* [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/17o0qhv/first_documented_female_archer_also_josh_wasnt/) is Sarah claiming to be the first documented woman in history to harvest a hippo with a bow.
* [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/15ffxsr/world_record/) is Sarah showing off her trophies from her world record croc.
* [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/z3z4zf/trophy_hunting_lies/) is a post calling out their bullshit world records. The Bowmars claim that they have all of these world records, but we have yet to see a single record documented in any hunting record lists.

**Sarah‚Äôs abundance of law suits (if Sarah does have a world record in anything, I‚Äôd guess that it‚Äôs the outrageous number of lawsuits that she‚Äôs been in)**

* Sarah and Josh both pled guilty to a Lacey Act Violation in October 2022. It is a rabbit hole, which you can read more about [here](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2023/01/13/josh-sarah-bowmar-ankeny-youtubers-sentenced-probation-poaching-case-hunting-nebraska/69806012007/). Sarah and Josh vehemently denied any involvement in the case, and stretched the case out for years. When they could no longer deny it, Josh made a post in which he compared it to a speeding ticket. They took a plea deal, in which they got a slap on the wrist and a fine. 
* A lawsuit was opened against Bowmar Nutrition, on the grounds that their nutrition facts are wrongly reported, with claims that their macronutrients may be as much as 25% less than what is stated. You can read more about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/w1zsp7/damn_i_didnt_realize_it_was_that_far_off_on_their/). The lawsuit ended up being dropped.
* The man behind the instagram account ‚ÄúMaking Hunting Great Again‚Äù (MHGA) was sued for defamation after posting a youtube video that was completely factual and had receipts as proof. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/1210zex/welp_i_am_being_sued_by_bowmars/) is his post with his summons. The Bowmars used a lawyer out of Tennessee, because they tend to have loose defamation laws (speculated amongst this sub). Luckily, MHGA fought back, got a lawyer and refused to settle. The judge ordered the Bowmars to send in their tax forms, showing that they did in fact have a loss of income over this youtube video. They refused to [turn over the documents](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/18ymqi8/refusing_to_turn_over_evidence_in_mhga_case/), and the case was dropped. 
* The Bowmars opened a lawsuit against an Iowa news outlet, with charges of ‚Äúassault libel &amp; slander‚Äù when they broadcasted the news of their poaching case. The Bowmars claimed that they had suffered ‚Äúsignificant financial damages and damage to their reputation‚Äù and that this news station has led to them ‚Äúbeing attacked on the internet, and lied about by the public as a result of the defendants‚Äô false statements. They have lost money, productive time, and experienced anxiety and humiliation as a result of the false defamatory statements.‚Äù [Here](https://nebraskaexaminer.com/briefs/hunters-convicted-of-conspiracy-sue-tv-stations-owner-for-defamation/) is an article regarding this lawsuit. [Here](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67240922/bowmar-v-hearst-properties-inc/) is a super interesting page that lists all of the motions. 
* Josh burned down his neighbors cabin, when he was attempting a controlled burn. Please note that he attempted to put this fire out with a [leaf blower](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/wmry4g/is_this_not_considered_an_uncontrolled_burn_if/). The neighbor had to get into a legal battle with the Bowmars to get his cabin paid for. More info [here](https://www.aol.com/sports/ankeny-youtube-star-settles-lawsuit-213015590.html). The case was dismissed from criminal court, and was settled in civil court, with an undisclosed amount given to the neighbors.

**Other Bowmar miscellaneous controversies**

* A previous member of this sub claimed that she sent Sarah a DM when Sarah was claiming to be infertile. The member had shared her story about struggling with infertility for years, and felt it was unfair for Sarah to claim infertility after only 2 months of trying. Sarah lost it - she found this woman‚Äôs information from previous purchases that she made from Bowmar Nutrition, doxxed her on Instagram, and terrorized her with phone calls and threats. See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/tfyhkg/doxx_info/). These claims are made by the victim, and have not been proven that this harassment occured.
* Chris Pratt made a post about his wife, and an innocent man made a comment on the post. Sarah responded to him saying ‚Äúmaybe you wouldn‚Äôt be so angry if your wife put out - I have a highlight on HRT if you need it.‚Äù This man‚Äôs wife had just beat cancer &amp; they were actively trying to conceive. You can read more about this [here. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/17m01zm/did_anyone_else_catch_this_comment_under_chris/)
* Sarah created a blog post about struggling with infertility for two months, and became pregnant with Dean immediately after it was posted.
* Sarah made a post about struggling between having more kids, or not having more kids. See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/1bnx2nm/so_much_rambling/). The post genuinely made it seem like she was conflicted, and when people were offering her advice or kind words, she lost it. She claimed that she is suicidal and would never want to live that again, that she‚Äôs currently still ‚Äúin this phase.‚Äù The next day, she posted a [story](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/1bob9xa/so_mission_accomplished_eh_sarah/) about how she‚Äôs so glad she posted it because she got so much engagement. I am not claiming that Sarah was not suicidal or did not have or currently has severe PPD/A.

If you are here due to Sarah being rude towards you, you are not alone. Nearly every single one of us used to follow Sarah, take her advice, and support her businesses. There have been a couple of posts on this sub asking what the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back was. You can read them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/ob0qak/what_was_your_offense_for_getting_blocked_by/) and [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/17flhet/what_did_sara_do_that_broke_the_camels_back/)

Now, before engaging in this sub - head to the community information at the top of this page. There, you will find the wonderful mods that run the sub, and the community rules. It‚Äôs very important to follow these rules so that a.) you don‚Äôt get banned for breaking them, and b.) we can continue to have this sub without fear of getting it shut down. 

Thank you to the Mods for trusting me to write this post, and all of the community members that contributed their ideas on what to include. If there is anything I missed, please leave it in the comments below!

This subreddit is dedicated to discussing all things Bowmar related. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have stumbled across this sub, and are currently a Bowmar fan, here are a few reasons that you may want to re-evaluate that stance. And if you found your way here by Sarah being rude towards you‚Ä¶ welcome! :) Grab a glass of wine, and let‚Äôs get into all of the Bowmar controversies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah‚Äôs poor business practices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah appears unprofessional regarding her businesses often - in &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/j5oe9l/you_can_go_live_and_not_save_it_but_its_still/""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; post, you can see how she responds to her competitors while live.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah spoke badly about the Girl Scouts for not working with her on a protein powder, which you can find &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/kfb76r/sarah_talking_about_girl_scouts_rejecting_their/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. She stated that they didn‚Äôt want to get into the protein business, which is clearly untrue, as seen &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/kfirv1/to_answer_the_girl_scout_question_someones_lying/""&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt; Shout out to the Girl Scouts for not associating with Sarah.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is evidence of Sarah being shady regarding her own company, Bowmar Nutrition. 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their greens have no micronutrient information and she has ignored the question numerous times when asked. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their whey protein formula changed based on long-term customer perceptions of taste, smell, texture, mixing and cooking ability. When questioned, she stated that it was the cows. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah‚Äôs BLM controversy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the 2020 BLM protests, Sarah refused to acknowledge it. Once she was called out on it, she tweeted ‚ÄúIn case you need me to influence you to not be racist, Black Lives Matter.‚Äù She received a ton of backlash and ended up deleting her Twitter account. You can view the tweet &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/nagpjq/sarahs_blm_response_last_summer/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/koepyf/several_screenshots_of_sarah_lashing_out_at/""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; are more screenshots of the backlash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During all of this controversy, Sarah‚Äôs only black athlete (Libby Christiansen) spoke up regarding her horrible mistreatment by Sarah. Libby made an IG story after the BLM controversy when she broke her contract with Bowmar Nutrition, in which she spoke about the horrible mistreatment by Sarah and her unrealistic expectations, the miniscule amount of money that she made off of her sales, and the overall poor working experience that she had with Sarah. Her explanation was up for a while under her ‚ÄúBLM‚Äù highlight on her IG, but it has since been removed. Other influencers also broke their contract with Bowmar Nutrition over this - see &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/gy3i3b/who_has_terminated_their_contract_with_bowmar/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another consequence of her BLM response was her getting dropped by Balance Atheletica, who she was an athlete for. Sarah stated that ‚Äúshe had no idea why she was dropped‚Äù (see &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Ft9wz84tm1j451.jpg""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and Steve, Balance Athetica‚Äôs owner, went on live and made a statement that she knows exactly why she was dropped, and that it was due to her BLM response. No screenshots as it was live, but there is discussion about it &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/lhsq9q/can_someone_fill_me_in_one_what_happened_with/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah &amp;amp; Josh‚Äôs animal cruelty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Josh boasted about spearing a bear in Canada, which you can read more about &lt;a href=""https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/josh-bowmar-hunter-alberta-bear-spear-charges-prosecution-a7196346.html""&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt; This event led to them being dropped by Under Armour, more info on that &lt;a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/under-armour-drops-sarah-bowmar-2016-8""&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This act of animal cruelty even led to a new law being adopted in Alberta, in which they made spearing a bear illegal. You can read about this &lt;a href=""https://globalnews.ca/news/4011535/alberta-bans-spear-hunting-bear-video/#:%7E:text=Spears%20and%20spear%2Dthrowing%20tools,gear%20will%20still%20be%20legal.""&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah has a plethora of farm animals, and things keep happening to them. Recently, her chickens got mutilated and died from a mink getting into their enclosure (TW - dead chickens, see &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/1bjd9io/o_picking_up_the_dead_chickens/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah bakes using chemicals and because she won‚Äôt eat food, she feeds them to the animals. See &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/17056tt/what_eating_disorder/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This is not healthy or appropriate food for animals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah &amp;amp; Josh‚Äôs hunting practices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To preface - this sub is not anti-hunting. There are many hunters amongst us. The key difference is that our members are &lt;em&gt;ethical&lt;/em&gt; hunters&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah and Josh are certified poachers (more on the Bowmar v USA lawsuit down below.) &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/lwk5uo/read_all_comments_another_speeding_ticket/""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a charge for hunting without a tag or license. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/1bhcynf/for_the_sake_of_having_receipts_nsfw_swipe/""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a post where Sarah states the animals that she would never hunt, with another photo of her with the carcass of one of those said animals, a few years later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The general consensus of this sub is that Sarah has a white savior complex. When hunting in Africa, she makes it seem like she is single-handedly keeping a village alive by donating her meat, when donating is not even her own choice - it‚Äôs something that she has to do, because they cannot take the meat home with them. You can see more details about that&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F8twyc3e1q1pb1.jpg""&gt; here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah and Josh are trophy hunters, even though they claimed not to be for years. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/q0bqgv/i_dont_hunt_is_it_normal_to_keep_the_stomach/""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is just one example of her trophies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah‚Äôs conspiracy theories&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah does not believe in Covid-19. She spent the entirety of 2020 (and 2021, and 2022, and 2023, and now in 2024‚Ä¶) denying the pandemic. You can view posts &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/11cpuk0/im_confused_didnt_we_know_this_we_already_knew_it/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/j5n5ep/sarah_bowmar_talking_about_the_plandemic_video_in/""&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/rhh24e/sarah_and_her_conspiracy_theories/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; regarding this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah does not believe in climate change. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/isc3lj/oh_look_shes_posting_conspiracy_theory_shit_again/""&gt;Here &lt;/a&gt;is a post of her claiming that the government is starting wildfires, because a map showed the wildfire stopping at the US / Canadian border‚Ä¶. a map from a US government website. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah‚Äôs harmful messages regarding health &amp;amp; wellness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah exercises for hours and hours, along with working out 7 days per week for her ‚Äúmental health.‚Äù &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/19eo0kd/so_much_to_unpack_here/""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a post where she exercised for 3.5 hours in one day, and &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F2pneng3whukc1.png""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is a post where she shares that she does not take rest days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah has claimed that taking testosterone will save 99% of marriages (seriously - see &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/193ia2g/hormones_do_not_fix_intimacy/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) She also states that optimal levels for women are 200 - 300, and linked a &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fliy176x1zrmc1.jpeg""&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; that she found with this information. You will find that the appropriate number for women should be 15-70 ng/dl. Just about every website will tell you this if you google, but here is &lt;a href=""https://www.verywellhealth.com/testosterone-levels-5212199""&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;. In this blog &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fdv2jwtuquwqc1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D1080%26format%3Dpjpg%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D0a7978f21c34dc72e8f21ba7d384d17e803389eb""&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, she states that her testosterone levels are at 250. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah claims that carrots detox extra estrogen. She went on a whole carrot salad kick, which you can see &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/18jxbwq/she_really_takes_a_trend_and_runs_with_it_and_as/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I dug so deep for an evidence-based peer reviewed study on carrots detoxing estrogen, and not a single one exists. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah posted that she doesn‚Äôt care if she gets cancer due to her excessive T use, which you can see &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/1471dws/so_much_to_call_out_but_shed_rather_have_cancer/""&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt; She said that by the time she gets cancer in 15 years, medicine will have advanced enough to cure it. Direct quote: ‚ÄúI would rather live like a superhero for the next 30 years and die of cancer, than feel like shit for 50 years.‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah constantly posts body checking photos. She is so proud of her &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/18uflwp/daily_ab_check/""&gt;floor abs&lt;/a&gt; that she posts them quite literally every day. Members of this sub have stated how triggering these body checking posts are, as many of us have struggled / are currently struggling with eating disorders. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah‚Äôs perfect marriage &amp;amp; parenting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah and Josh went on live once to discuss how testosterone saved their marriage.. She claimed that she was in one of the worst mental states of her life postpartum, and that Josh was hounding her for sex before she was even cleared for it. Sarah was uninterested (as most women are after birth), so Josh encouraged her to get on testosterone to increase her libido. In this sub‚Äôs opinion, this makes it seem that it wasn‚Äôt testosterone that saved her marriage - it was her putting out. Sarah has stated that she believes that sex is the only thing that differentiates a friendship from a relationship. In &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/193ia2g/hormones_do_not_fix_intimacy/""&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;, she talks about how once intimacy is established, the relationship will flourish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But it doesn‚Äôt stop there - apparently T wasn‚Äôt the cure for her marriage. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fudj5xosv3wub1.png""&gt;Oyster pills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://sarahbowmar.com/2023/10/pelvic-floor-pt-and-pilates-saved-my-marriage/""&gt;pilates &amp;amp; pelvic floor work&lt;/a&gt; also saved her marriage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah made a post regarding date nights (see &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/xhy2tr/more_of_her_trying_to_justify_their_shitty/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and how date nights only contribute to 1% of a healthy marriage, and we should focus on the other 99% (allegedly, this means sex). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah constantly makes posts online towards other men, stating that they ‚Äújust got her pregnant.‚Äù (See&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/1abk93r/daddy_morgan/""&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;.) At one point, she was horny for a &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/15p6xik/_/""&gt;truck.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah and Josh would not take their children trick-or-treating because one neighbor made bullets, and one has peacocks. She stated that ‚Äúhell would freeze over before Josh misses a sit on Halloween to go trick or treating.‚Äù (Last photo on &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/17l4kxw/for_anyone_who_missed_it_she_did_a_breakdown_of/""&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are countless posts of her under-dressing her children in weather well below freezing. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/1afo8lo/mother_of_the_year_allowing_her_children_to_take/""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is just one of many posts on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ever since Dean was born, he has appeared to have some health issues. Sarah stated that her pediatrician urged her to conduct a sleep study for him, but due to the sleep study being 2 hours away, she just didn‚Äôt have time so she wouldn‚Äôt be doing it, yet she spends countless hours doing other things. See &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/x3rwj2/taking_dean_on_a_trip_to_alaska_was_no_problem/""&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah received a DM from someone regarding Oakley and how she was behind developmentally. Our sleuths on this sub (and MHGA) pointed out that the small part of the photo that was visible is identical to the Bowmar Farms account. Literally down to the same HEX#. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/wbxz7k/video_proof_sarah_used_her_bowmar_farms_page_to/""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is the post theorizing this. This is an alleged opinion, and not proved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/18leiov/yeah_sarugh_your_feral_kids_dont_know_how_to/""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a photo where Sarah is showing Oakley measuring and weighing food. I will let you come to your own conclusions on how to feel about that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah allows her children to play with animal &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/16ckpga/playing_with_poop/""&gt;poop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/1307wox/yep_letting_her_daughter_play_with_a_dead_bird/""&gt;dead carcasses&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah‚Äôs superiority complex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah was pregnant for four years - with two children. World record pregnancy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Her children are &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/17pt47t/get_off_the_internet_you_clown/""&gt;19 months apart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She is obsessed with &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/17rnmoi/here_lies_sarah_bowmar/""&gt;looking better than she did pre-pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;, and proved to the haters who told her it would be hard to bounce back wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She took speed reading in highschool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She got her MBA in 11 months&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She‚Äôs married to a &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/17hwyck/greek_god/""&gt;Greek God&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/z7e5mz/two_time_athletic_all_american_i_can_almost/""&gt;all American athlete at a D1 school&lt;/a&gt;, who is a &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/z7e5mz/two_time_athletic_all_american_i_can_almost/""&gt;self-taught engineer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah‚Äôs world records&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/18o17mo/another_one/""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is Josh claiming that he got a world record croc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/v6kpv6/these_two_idiots_and_their_world_records_i_stg/""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is Josh claiming that he caught a world record carp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/17o0qhv/first_documented_female_archer_also_josh_wasnt/""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is Sarah claiming to be the first documented woman in history to harvest a hippo with a bow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/15ffxsr/world_record/""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is Sarah showing off her trophies from her world record croc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/z3z4zf/trophy_hunting_lies/""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a post calling out their bullshit world records. The Bowmars claim that they have all of these world records, but we have yet to see a single record documented in any hunting record lists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah‚Äôs abundance of law suits (if Sarah does have a world record in anything, I‚Äôd guess that it‚Äôs the outrageous number of lawsuits that she‚Äôs been in)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah and Josh both pled guilty to a Lacey Act Violation in October 2022. It is a rabbit hole, which you can read more about &lt;a href=""https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2023/01/13/josh-sarah-bowmar-ankeny-youtubers-sentenced-probation-poaching-case-hunting-nebraska/69806012007/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Sarah and Josh vehemently denied any involvement in the case, and stretched the case out for years. When they could no longer deny it, Josh made a post in which he compared it to a speeding ticket. They took a plea deal, in which they got a slap on the wrist and a fine. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lawsuit was opened against Bowmar Nutrition, on the grounds that their nutrition facts are wrongly reported, with claims that their macronutrients may be as much as 25% less than what is stated. You can read more about it &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/w1zsp7/damn_i_didnt_realize_it_was_that_far_off_on_their/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The lawsuit ended up being dropped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The man behind the instagram account ‚ÄúMaking Hunting Great Again‚Äù (MHGA) was sued for defamation after posting a youtube video that was completely factual and had receipts as proof. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/1210zex/welp_i_am_being_sued_by_bowmars/""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is his post with his summons. The Bowmars used a lawyer out of Tennessee, because they tend to have loose defamation laws (speculated amongst this sub). Luckily, MHGA fought back, got a lawyer and refused to settle. The judge ordered the Bowmars to send in their tax forms, showing that they did in fact have a loss of income over this youtube video. They refused to &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/18ymqi8/refusing_to_turn_over_evidence_in_mhga_case/""&gt;turn over the documents&lt;/a&gt;, and the case was dropped. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Bowmars opened a lawsuit against an Iowa news outlet, with charges of ‚Äúassault libel &amp;amp; slander‚Äù when they broadcasted the news of their poaching case. The Bowmars claimed that they had suffered ‚Äúsignificant financial damages and damage to their reputation‚Äù and that this news station has led to them ‚Äúbeing attacked on the internet, and lied about by the public as a result of the defendants‚Äô false statements. They have lost money, productive time, and experienced anxiety and humiliation as a result of the false defamatory statements.‚Äù &lt;a href=""https://nebraskaexaminer.com/briefs/hunters-convicted-of-conspiracy-sue-tv-stations-owner-for-defamation/""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is an article regarding this lawsuit. &lt;a href=""https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67240922/bowmar-v-hearst-properties-inc/""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a super interesting page that lists all of the motions. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Josh burned down his neighbors cabin, when he was attempting a controlled burn. Please note that he attempted to put this fire out with a &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/wmry4g/is_this_not_considered_an_uncontrolled_burn_if/""&gt;leaf blower&lt;/a&gt;. The neighbor had to get into a legal battle with the Bowmars to get his cabin paid for. More info &lt;a href=""https://www.aol.com/sports/ankeny-youtube-star-settles-lawsuit-213015590.html""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The case was dismissed from criminal court, and was settled in civil court, with an undisclosed amount given to the neighbors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Bowmar miscellaneous controversies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A previous member of this sub claimed that she sent Sarah a DM when Sarah was claiming to be infertile. The member had shared her story about struggling with infertility for years, and felt it was unfair for Sarah to claim infertility after only 2 months of trying. Sarah lost it - she found this woman‚Äôs information from previous purchases that she made from Bowmar Nutrition, doxxed her on Instagram, and terrorized her with phone calls and threats. See &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/tfyhkg/doxx_info/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. These claims are made by the victim, and have not been proven that this harassment occured.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chris Pratt made a post about his wife, and an innocent man made a comment on the post. Sarah responded to him saying ‚Äúmaybe you wouldn‚Äôt be so angry if your wife put out - I have a highlight on HRT if you need it.‚Äù This man‚Äôs wife had just beat cancer &amp;amp; they were actively trying to conceive. You can read more about this &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/17m01zm/did_anyone_else_catch_this_comment_under_chris/""&gt;here. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah created a blog post about struggling with infertility for two months, and became pregnant with Dean immediately after it was posted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah made a post about struggling between having more kids, or not having more kids. See &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/1bnx2nm/so_much_rambling/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The post genuinely made it seem like she was conflicted, and when people were offering her advice or kind words, she lost it. She claimed that she is suicidal and would never want to live that again, that she‚Äôs currently still ‚Äúin this phase.‚Äù The next day, she posted a &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/1bob9xa/so_mission_accomplished_eh_sarah/""&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; about how she‚Äôs so glad she posted it because she got so much engagement. I am not claiming that Sarah was not suicidal or did not have or currently has severe PPD/A.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are here due to Sarah being rude towards you, you are not alone. Nearly every single one of us used to follow Sarah, take her advice, and support her businesses. There have been a couple of posts on this sub asking what the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back was. You can read them &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/ob0qak/what_was_your_offense_for_getting_blocked_by/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SarahBowmar/comments/17flhet/what_did_sara_do_that_broke_the_camels_back/""&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, before engaging in this sub - head to the community information at the top of this page. There, you will find the wonderful mods that run the sub, and the community rules. It‚Äôs very important to follow these rules so that a.) you don‚Äôt get banned for breaking them, and b.) we can continue to have this sub without fear of getting it shut down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to the Mods for trusting me to write this post, and all of the community members that contributed their ideas on what to include. If there is anything I missed, please leave it in the comments below!&lt;/p&gt;

,dirtypenpals,"You drive home from work the same way you do every day: furious. Another day of having to put up with my incessant demands, cocksure attitude, and general misogyny. You‚Äôve been with the company for decades, while I got promoted over you after only three years. You‚Äôd have blamed it on the company being a boys club, but our CEO is a woman. Although, you‚Äôve seen the way she laughs at my crude jokes, and you‚Äôre beginning to suspect that I ‚Äòearned‚Äô my promotion another way. Regardless of how it happened, I got made your boss a few months ago, and it‚Äôs been driving you insane ever since. 

So, since the day I got made your boss, your drive home has been your time to let your rage and frustration go. All the sexist comments, my condescending attitude towards you, and my incessant glances at your cleavage drive you insane, so you try to release that energy before you arrive back at your home. Your daughter is eighteen now, but she still doesn‚Äôt need to worry herself about your work problems. Ugh, the way your assistant giggled at the comment I made about your ‚Äòsubstandard‚Äô spreadsheet?! That little bitch better remember who she works for. You heard the rumor about her and me at the last company barbecue, and she‚Äôs on thin ice. 

Still, there‚Äôs a part of you that understands why I got the job and you didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm so talented, after all. And it‚Äôs been a long time since someone offered you high praise for anything. That spreadsheet could have been better too, so maybe some of my comments aren‚Äôt as far from the mark as you‚Äôd like to admit‚Ä¶

You see your daughter texts you. 

*Hey, mom! My new boyfriend is coming to dinner. I don‚Äôt know what you had planned, but could you try to make it not taste like cardboard? He‚Äôs really special!*

You roll your eyes. Your plans of ordering takeout are out the window. Your daughter has been dating some mystery man for weeks now, spending every waking moment on her phone with a dumb little grin plastered on her face. It would be cute if she wasn‚Äôt also so rude to you. The disrespect she shows you now that she‚Äôs 18 is unbelievable. You know you should stand up for yourself. Should assert yourself more. But it just doesn‚Äôt feel worth it. Sometimes, it even feels like you deserve it. She‚Äôs such a beautiful young woman, so vibrant and intelligent and lovely. And you‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs been a few years since you‚Äôve really felt attractive. And even longer since you‚Äôve had anyone touch you‚Ä¶ like *that*.

You heard her sneak whoever this new guy was into the house over the weekend. You had gone to your room early, but stayed up to mindlessly watch reality television on your phone. You heard the heavy footsteps of a man walking up the stairs, then a few minutes later you heard the sounds of your daughter moaning. Your hand may have moved towards your panties a bit before you snapped out of it. 

When you arrive at home, your daughter is wearing some skimpy little cocktail dress, clearly trying hard to look her best for this new boy. She even spent some time this afternoon cleaning the house. Whoever this guy is, he must be pretty impressive to make her clean. Of course, if he is as talented in bed as he sounded that night‚Ä¶ but you can‚Äôt bring yourself to think about that. 

As you hurry to make dinner, your mind returns to your frustrating day. Like most days lately, you spent it doing some menial task for me that was well beneath your status. You had an MBA and twenty years at this company, yet I insisted on giving you basic data entry assignments, and then even had the gall to tell you it wasn‚Äôt good enough! And that smug smile I had on my lips when I told you to do it again?! It was enough to make you want to strangle me. 

Of course, you‚Äôd never be able to do that. Standing up for yourself wasn‚Äôt exactly your strong suit. Even your own daughter walked all over you. And it wasn‚Äôt like you could do anything against me either. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô4‚Äù, my body packed with thick slabs of corded muscle. You understood what your secretary sees in me. And the CEO. And of course, you heard the gossip in the women‚Äôs room about the size of my cock. I was definitely an asshole. But you had to admit that I was hot. 

As dinner is about done, you hear the doorbell ring. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll get it!‚Äù Your daughter calls, an excitement in her voice that you haven‚Äôt heard for years. If this new boyfriend is making her feel so good, he must be pretty special. 

‚ÄúMom?‚Äù Your daughter says, entering the kitchen pulling a large, calloused hand behind her. ‚ÄúThis is my boyfriend.‚Äù

Dread fills your heart as the tall, powerful body becomes visible. Your jaw drops and your mind goes blank. Your daughter‚Äôs boyfriend‚Ä¶ the man she is so clearly in love with‚Ä¶ the man who made her moan so loudly that night‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs me. Your asshole boss. 

What are you going to do now?!

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Hey, y‚Äôall. I‚Äôm looking for someone who‚Äôs interested in playing a woman whose daughter is dating your asshole boss. If you‚Äôre more interested in playing as the daughter, that‚Äôs great too! 

I think that creativity is sexy as hell, so if you have any ideas for the characters or the plot, then please feel free to share. I‚Äôd love to adjust this story to make it as hot as possible for both of us. 

I think for this idea, cuckquean stuff and humiliation will feature prominently, as well as some mother/daughter stuff if you‚Äôre up for that. I‚Äôd love it if the daughter and your boss mock and ridicule you, then make you do more and more depraved things for their pleasure. And of course, once they figure out that it gets you off, the demands only get more and more intense. Soon, the two of us will be controlling every element of your life, making you dress like a slut for work, making you service me at my desk, and making you film yourself getting off in the office break room. You keep asking yourself why you do these things, but then the next order comes and you find yourself obeying like some disgraceful little whore. 

If you‚Äôre interested in that kind of stuff, please feel free to hit me up! I‚Äôd love to play with you.

Another day of having to put up with my incessant demands, cocksure attitude, and general misogyny. You‚Äôve been with the company for decades, while I got promoted over you after only three years. You‚Äôd have blamed it on the company being a boys club, but our CEO is a woman. Although, you‚Äôve seen the way she laughs at my crude jokes, and you‚Äôre beginning to suspect that I ‚Äòearned‚Äô my promotion another way. Regardless of how it happened, I got made your boss a few months ago, and it‚Äôs been driving you insane ever since. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, since the day I got made your boss, your drive home has been your time to let your rage and frustration go. All the sexist comments, my condescending attitude towards you, and my incessant glances at your cleavage drive you insane, so you try to release that energy before you arrive back at your home. Your daughter is eighteen now, but she still doesn‚Äôt need to worry herself about your work problems. Ugh, the way your assistant giggled at the comment I made about your ‚Äòsubstandard‚Äô spreadsheet?! That little bitch better remember who she works for. You heard the rumor about her and me at the last company barbecue, and she‚Äôs on thin ice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, there‚Äôs a part of you that understands why I got the job and you didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm so talented, after all. And it‚Äôs been a long time since someone offered you high praise for anything. That spreadsheet could have been better too, so maybe some of my comments aren‚Äôt as far from the mark as you‚Äôd like to admit‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe it's a quarter-life crisis lol. For context, I just turned 25 two weeks ago, I have an MBA, I work a job where I make roughly 70k, I have a great group of friends, and I still feel very sad and dreadful about my life at times. I think it is important to note that I have been diagnosed with PTSD from an abusive childhood (I was SA'd by a close childhood friend and grew up seeing my brother and mother physically abused by my father and previous stepfather respectively). I also have ADHD, depression, and anxiety but those feel sometimes more manageable than the PTSD I face. I struggle with romantic relationships, as I do not put myself out there. Often when I do, I get this fear that I am inviting someone into my life to hurt me and that it would be better keeping them from me. I also face a lot of rage towards my father and previous stepdad (my current one may be the kindest person I have ever met and treats my mom wonderfully.) But I have this rage inside of me, that they didn't face any real consequences for what they did. I haven't spoken to my dad in 5 years, after he got two SA charges in 6 months, took a plea deal to maintain his innocence, and faced no jail time. I also am frustrated because I am a creative person and I am not doing anything creative at the moment. I had a tiktok account with over 100K followers and have stopped posting on there because I would make profane jokes and I don't want to lose my job over that. I work in a corporate setting, where some days the job is cool, but I am not really passionate about it even though I am friends with my co-workers. Dating is super frustrating because I believe I am a handsome guy, and a charismatic one, but I keep shooting myself in the foot where I will pull away or mess things up on purpose to save myself from being hurt because I am scared of being vulnerable (which is ironic I know because being in a successful relationship is being vulnerable). I guess to summarize and stop word vomiting, sometimes life doesn't feel like the juice is worth the squeeze. (Not suicidal just have a fatigue for living at this current point in time). Sometimes the pain I feel outweighs how good my life is at this moment and I wish I could be more grateful for my situation, but I feel so much pain at times that it is hard for me to feel grateful. I just kinda feel lost in like what actionable steps I should take. At times I just feel like I am at sea, and I didn't even know that I was sailing.

&lt;p&gt;I make $80000 as an operations manager on a DOD IT Contract. I‚Äôm 25. I manage like 30 people across 10 or so teams, as well as the strategic goals of about 20 additional people in different teams. I‚Äôve got only one boss in my contract, and my responsibilities have been growing as I‚Äôve become more acquainted with my role. I‚Äôve been here for about 9 months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consumer price index rose by 3.3% in my area. From what I hear, my company does not typically give out raises of more than a percent or two, but that‚Äôs based on a boomer woman who‚Äôs about to retire (I highly doubt she‚Äôs ever negotiated a raise, or her salary, given she‚Äôs lost money in her position [40 years accross many contractors in the same position] so‚Ä¶) How much of a raise should I ask for?

,clinicalresearch,"Recently was offered a Senior Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) position at Mayo Clinic at Rochester with $71k salary and $9k relocation bonus. I'm currently at a CRC at a large academic university in the Midwest making $60k. I have my Master's and have my SoCRA CCRP certification.

I'm torn between the opportunity at Mayo Clinic and leaving behind my friends, family, and my girlfriend. I've also grown up here as well. I'm wondering if Mayo's prestige and potential career opportunities outweigh this sacrifice.

Here's where it gets tricky: my current university job offers good benefits, especially with tuition assistance. I have always loved finance and business and wanted to pursue an MBA after my Master's in Clinical Research since business and clinical trials go hand-in-hand. My university makes it very affordable and would cover around $27k of tuition per year, but Mayo would only cover $5k. 

This difference would mean that I won't pursue the MBA if I go to Mayo due to cost. Not sure how useful the MBA would be in my career in clinical research but I hoped that it would have opened some paths for the fiscal side of trials/hospital management.

I know this industry can be extremely demanding (explains the high turnover rate) and I am lucky to have a fantastic work team and manager at my current job. My work-life balance is great, with a steady $60k salary and a straight solid 40hr workweek. I would say I am happy with my job (pay could be better!) but I am also extremely ambitious and thoroughly excited about this opportunity. I've talked to my manager previously about moving to the senior role internally as I have the certification and experience required to move up. He says I'm doing a great job but can't give me a timeline for this since it's 'out of his control'. I can't afford to wait as I'm uncertain when another opportunity like this one will arise.

,MBA,"Hey everyone,

I'm looking for an honest profile review. This admissions season has been a humbling reality check for me, and with 0/6 admits so far I'm starting to believe I may have overestimated the strength my profile. I applied R2 and got rejected from H/S/W and waitlisted by CBS/Kellogg/Booth. 

Given the volume of applications each school received this year, and the apparently significantly higher than usual waitlisted candidates, I'm starting to prepare to reapply R1 coming up this fall and prepare for the worst. 

My background:

* 29M, Indian
* UG from T15 US school, double major in Math-CS and Econ, 3.62 GPA
* 740 GMAT
* 5 years work experience in tech/analytics @ a Fortune 500 in the US 
* Post MBA - trying to move into a PM role.

Potential weaknesses in application:

* Applied R2 - I know for Indian Males it's usually suggested to apply in R1
* Similar to above, it's possible my application was a little rushed. In retrospect, I'm not confident I did justice to my story (worked on it myself with feedback from students/family etc. Did not use any counselors/consultants)
* GMAT score - while 740 is slightly above the average for most M7, I've heard given my background I should be aiming for 750+?
* Not a ton of community involvement/ECA - had a very academically intense undergrad given I was trying to complete 2 degrees in 4 years so had minimal involvement outside of academics
* Didn't network enough with current students/alums/Adcoms for the schools I applied to when I applied this year
* I am 29 but will turn 30 soon after the R1 deadline passes if I reapply. Not sure if this is a weakness, but could it be perceived as a potential weakness?

Things that will change / improve when I reapply:

* Will apply R1
* Will work more closely on my story - might even work with consultants this time around
* Will improve on 740 GMAT. Not sure what the 750+ equivalent is of the GMAT Focus edition but will try to get a higher percentile (confident about this, was scoring in the 770 range in the GMAT practice tests but didn't have enough time to retake)
* Got promoted at work a month after the R2 deadline so couldn't get that into the application
* Got awarded a significant employee recognition leadership award at work last week - only 1% of the employees get the award and this is a 15,000+ employee company - again, couldn't get this into my application given timing of award
* Will try to get more community involvement hours in (not sure about this one, don't want it to seem disingenuous - it won't be, I truly believe in giving back but I have nobody but myself to blame for not putting in the effort)  


Long story short, I truly understand how competitive these schools are and I am grateful that I was even considered to be on the waitlist for 3 of them, but I was definitely a bit bummed out given I understand more often than not, waitlists are glorified dings. (trying not to lose hope just yet though)  


I appreciate any feedback and thoughts, or advice! If you've made it this far, thanks so much for taking the time to read this and my apologies for the dissertation!

For background, I have suspicion I may have ASD (currently waiting for an intake appointment) and wanted to help the community by going into the professor route as a career. I have a degree in Psychology and currently in an MBA program, and hopefully a PhD in management or psychology.

 I plan on taking the GRE and been testing a 300-305 in prep.

&lt;p&gt;I understand that just having an MBA won&amp;#39;t open any doors, but I&amp;#39;m hoping that learning some new skills, networking, and being motivated to finish will help me out in the long run. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice is appreciated! &lt;/p&gt;

,Arrangedmarriage,"Hello all, 
Been following this community from some time. It has been very informative and helpful in gaining understanding of different perspectives. This is my first post here, need your kind advice. Would like to apologise to you in advance as this will be a long read: 
About my family : Would probably put my family in upper middle class category with moderate to liberal outlook. Nuclear Family. Marwari, very Religious (although I ain't that level of religious but still little bit I don't know if I am making any sense), Vegetarians, Teetotalers (although I sometimes drink with friends)
About me : I am 25M. 6ft tall. MBA from a good foreign Uni. Living in a tier 2 city in Rajasthan. Working in my family business (industrialist) since past few years. Have started some new product lines ans expanded market but still don't have that good a technical or managerial grip as I would have liked to achieve in these few years but working upon it. Overweight - like a lot. Like around 140kgs. Have tried reducing it many times - gym, diets, yoga. But start to lose motivation everytime within a few weeks and fall back. I don't each much or binge at all, but somewhat hereditary and also too much of sitting in office + mentally exhausted when returning in evening from office so no energy left for gyming. No problems health wise yet(touch wood). Have been single since like birth tbh (just feels sad writting that lmao)
My dilemma : My parents are constantly after me to atleast make my biodata and give them so that they can start looking for a potential. They give me reasoning that everything should be done by a certain age (which may be correct in some parts and not in some) and that ""agar abhi dekhna chalu karenge tabh kahi 1-2 saal mai baat banegi"". Typical Tier 2 city Marwari Business Fam (those who know might empathize with me). 
The reason I am not giving yet is because I am very sure that due to me being overweight, every girl I will meet/show interest in, will reject me. And I am not very good at handling rejections. I have been told I have a good personality and am a good person. But I also know that no one would usually pref such an overweight partner due to many reasons - looks, potential future health risks etc. All genuine reasons in my opinion. I am trying to reduce but very slow in that. 
Secondly I don't feel I am professionally well settled yet meaning I don't think I have completly taken over majority reponsibilities of the fam business yet and so really atleast want to take little more time to be ready atleast on that front as marriage is a huge responsibilty for a person and their partner. 
Also my father is due for a major organ surgery. (Not required on an immediete basis but will be good to get it done as soon as possible)  However, he is delaying it because the success rate is 95% of the surgery and he says it is his wish to see his son get married before taking such risk or surgery as he will be on immunosuppressants for next atleast 1 year after surgery and in complete isolation. 
I feel his wish is also obviously correct and he has always been a father who has fulfilled all valid, genuine wishes of his kids and this is the first time he has sorta asked anything in anyway from me. But the above mentioned two reasons are pulling me away from even making the biodata. I am very confused. I literally don't know what to do. Have started having some anxiety issues, ""late night can't sleep due to overthinking"" episodes and irritation. I really hope my peers in the community can please guide me. All constructive criticism is welcome. All advices and views points, perspectives or any other way to help are also welcome. 
Thank you in advance and sorry once again for such a long post. And also, sorry for any typos, spellings or grammer mistakes. Thanks.

,mac,"I‚Äôm making this post to anybody wondering how much a 8gb ram M1 chip is compared to an i5 dual core 2.5ghz 16gb ram. I‚Äôm guessing most people would have an i7 or at least i5 quad-core by now. But anyway I wanted to upgrade my 2012 i5 dual core mbp, since it has 16gb ram I never ever wanted to go back to 8gb ram. So I was going to get the 2019 mbp i7 3.2ghz 16gb ram mbp (I think those were the exact specs) it was going for around 500-600 here at local shops in my area. But then I learned mac os would no longer be updating the intel chips after Ventura ( correct me if I‚Äôm wrong). So then I said I better just wait til I can get an m1. But like I said 16 ram is what I need because I like to run Logic Pro, Webull which must have some power to it damn sure makes my 2012 run when the market is open, shadow pc which I wasn‚Äôt to worried about since it‚Äôs more about streaming than anything, and then I‚Äôm taking some classes which I know I will eventually have to use python, docker, azure, and a few more programs in that field. 

Well I found someone selling an m1 8gb ram 256. For 550 I asked him to do 520. He did. It has 96% battery capacity and 20 cycle counts. It felt like a great deal and so I did it. 

The m1 air blows my 2012 mbp out the water to no surprise but I did think 16gb ram vs 8gb ram would make huge difference and I know it does I guess it‚Äôs the M1 chip. It runs Logic Pro so much better it hasn‚Äôt stopped on me not once and I make beats so quite a few tracks being used. What surprised me the most though is probably shadow. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect w logic since the ram downsize but logic is running 10x better. But shadow pc because it‚Äôs streaming I thought it‚Äôll be the same. Boy was I ever wrong I feel like I‚Äôm playing on console. So far I played Witcher 3, new 2k, ghost recon breakpoint, and division 2, oh and spiderman remastered I love that game but I just want to play as Spider-Man not other characters I hated that about the last gta. I just want to play as one character!! But anyway shadow runs so much better im guessing because the m1 does have a better WiFi reciever . But i have the rtx3070i w 1tb 28ram pc on shadow so it was my backup plan if I didn‚Äôt like the m1 performance since it‚Äôs only 8gb ram but man I love this computer and if it‚Äôs running this good on 8 I can only imagine an m3 chip. Give me 2 or 3 more years n I‚Äôll upgrade to m3 or preferably when I catch it around 500 dollars.

Sweat it out for two years in the MBA my university is not quite special according to the world rankings but it's fine actually I got very good quality education from London. Now after graduating I am in a fix, I actually have been unemployed for the past six months, recently joined the job as a barista but was fired from the job in my second week for some god forsaken reason. I feel like I failed in life but getting a job in this country is a nightmare. The basic problem here is about right to work which in my case is basically two years non extendable and I have previously worked in accounting and finance well because that was my experience from the very beginning. Even in London as well I did a role in the placement year in finance but that was a fixed term role. But ever since then I have been unable to find gainful employment anywhere else mostly due to my limited visa. Employers really don't want to hire I don't know if I'm lacking any skills or something but I believe I have a good skill set enough to make an entry level job. I also understand that the job market is completely shit right now everywhere but even a minimum wage job like working in dominoes or something is impossible to have without struggle just to put food on the table. 

I plan on moving to my home country secure employment but then again I feel like I will miss so much in this country living my own life. I just can't make up my mind and I am always overthinking and drowning myself into all it being my mistake.

,findapath,"Hello, I find myself at a crossroads of some sort. For background I am 28M with a Bachelor‚Äôs in Business Administration, it never really seemed to get me far and I felt worse about the field as I completed my degree in 2018 (it felt very artificial) but I feel like I could do much more. I don‚Äôt have very specific interests in terms of potential careers, I love video games but most avenues on that are not fruitful. I have tried Esports, Event management, hospitality, IT,  and GIS. I feel like I only have more secondary skills that are easily brushed over or picked up as part of a job and no real hard skills.  

I do find some technical things interesting but feel like I am not educated/skilled enough and maybe missed the boat. For example, computers are cool but I can‚Äôt code; I worked in utilities for a bit as a designer but ultimately failed as I was never properly trained and couldn‚Äôt keep up; I could never sell myself enough to get something with events or it all seemed based on who you knew and my networking is terrible. I have learned I enjoy creating processes and innovating on them to make them more efficient and solve a problem/puzzle with them.

I guess ideally how I would prefer to work is either 9-5 with hybrid/remote options (I very much dislike the feeling of living at work at my same desk after a while but dont mind occasional-mostly computer work just not 100% of the time) or a more condensed schedule (4 10s, 3 12s). If I could move around physically in the job with some fielding or maintenance that won‚Äôt destroy my body, I have enjoyed that in the past. 

My current situation is that I am at a simple and pretty easy admin position, it is primarily data entry. I picked it up from a random contract and they kept me on and hired me full time; I took it as I needed work and kept it as it wasn‚Äôt terrible. It is fine as a bridge job but I don‚Äôt see much growth and it‚Äôs not the best benefits but the workplace is fine and co workers are cool. I don‚Äôt enjoy having to go to the office every day though and sometimes sit around, other times just enter and clean up info in the system we use. It is overall comfy and pays well for what it is but I feel it could be a dead end. I‚Äôve been there for a little over 5 months. Lifestyle wise I am fairly frugal and expenses are low with my housing situation.

I guess in terms of goals owning a house would be great and retiring early would be great. I ultimately see work as a means to an end to survive and enjoy the things I like, the less I need to work each day the better. My girlfriend also wants to be a pilot and saving to help with that would also be a good direction to work toward and something that lets me travel more with her would be wonderful. I have no plans to have kids and neither does my girlfriend.

In terms of thinking forward I have thought of a few options I‚Äôd like to explore and would like some thoughts from you all based on how I sound to you or your experience with these fields:



Keep trucking with current job and get more experience since I‚Äôm not in a terrible spot and see if it can grow:

* Try to get into some kind of logistics field like Supply Chain (stemmed from my event management days)
* Go back to school (my dad has offered a masters degree but I have declined so far since I did not want to go in blind and without a plan)

* MBA - I would probably go for something like project management in construction, maybe special events
      -Technical degree - my friend has suggested an instrumentation tech path that worked out well for him with a 2 year associates
      -GIS - not sure what path or degree to take with this one but I have the baseline from my previous job but no proper education Trades - could be interesting for raw skills in fields and figuring out how more of society functionally works, is there a way to try out many in a short period of time? 
* Consulting - a friend described it as just learning whatever your current project is on for a bunch of different fields or hone in on one which sounds interesting but I hear the work can be horrible with workload and cultures.
* Safety for some kind of factory or plant - Seems to have a good mix of setting up systems, computer work, and moving around the place while needing some skills/knowledge to understand and fix issues.



Overall I have felt like I‚Äôve been going through jobs doing what anyone else can do and I feel like I could do well with a niche if I can find it. I just have trouble honing in on what that could be and have not experimented enough to see what it could be. If anyone could give input on what seems like a good course of action for me or if you‚Äôre in any of these fields I would love to hear the path you took!

,MBA,"Hi everyone,

Looking for some advice - I have been admitted to both IMD and HEC MBA programs with similar scholarships.

I am Swiss and intend to work in Switzerland afterwards and looking to change roles and industries. Here are some of my thoughts:

Reasons for IMD

* Rigorous and transformative program with leadership and personal growth focus (coaching, psychoanalysts etc..)
* Excellent brand in Switzerland
* Limiting because I have already lived in Switzerland and although i plan to settle there post-MBA, it would be great to get another experience abroad
* Expensive living costs

¬≠Reasons for HEC

* Program less rigorous and less focused on leadership
* Longer program with opportunities for international exchange
* Once in a lifetime opportunity to be on a university campus life with top facilities and close to Paris
* More prestigious internationally and better ranked

Essentially, I think that the IMD program is is more rigorous and transformative but the HEC experience might be richer overall and potentially has a better reputation.

Any thoughts on my situation? Any recommendations or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!

,MBA," Hello everyone,

I'm seeking some guidance on career transition strategies and would greatly appreciate your insights.

A bit about my background: I immigrated to the USA 6 years ago and have since completed my CPA. I've been working in tax compliance, primarily serving VC/PE and hedge fund clients. Recently, I was accepted into a T20 full-time MBA program, which I'm thrilled about!

My goal is to pivot into finance roles, specifically FP&amp;A, Corporate Development, or Strategic Finance. However, I've found it challenging to land an FP&amp;A job directly with my current experience.

As I prepare to embark on my MBA journey, I'm curious about the types of internships or roles I should target to facilitate this transition. Additionally, I'm wondering if participating in a Financial Leadership Development Program (FLDP) would be beneficial for my career aspirations.

Could anyone who has made a similar transition or has knowledge in this area share their experiences or offer advice on the best steps to take? Any recommendations on companies, roles, or specific programs that are receptive to professionals with my background would be incredibly helpful.

,FinancialCareers," Hello everyone,

I'm seeking some guidance on career transition strategies and would greatly appreciate your insights.

A bit about my background: I immigrated to the USA 6 years ago and have since completed my CPA. I've been working in tax compliance, primarily serving VC/PE and hedge fund clients. Recently, I was accepted into a T20 full-time MBA program, which I'm thrilled about!

My goal is to pivot into finance roles, specifically FP&amp;A, Corporate Development, or Strategic Finance. However, I've found it challenging to land an FP&amp;A job directly with my current experience.

As I prepare to embark on my MBA journey, I'm curious about the types of internships or roles I should target to facilitate this transition. Additionally, I'm wondering if participating in a Financial Leadership Development Program (FLDP) would be beneficial for my career aspirations.

Could anyone who has made a similar transition or has knowledge in this area share their experiences or offer advice on the best steps to take? Any recommendations on companies, roles, or specific programs that are receptive to professionals with my background would be incredibly helpful.

Thank you in advance for your help!",t2_5smueh5k,False,,0.0,False,Accepted into a T20 MBA Program: Seeking Advice for a Career Pivot into FP&amp;A/Corporate Development,[],r/FinancialCareers,False,6.0,,0.0,,,True,t3_1bpbjr8,False,dark,1.0,,public,1.0,0.0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1.0,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1711569975.0,text,6.0,,,text,self.FinancialCareers,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

,MBA,"Hi everyone,

Looking for some advice - I have been admitted to both IMD and HEC MBA programs with similar scholarships.

I am Swiss and intend to work in Switzerland afterwards and looking to change roles and industries. Here are some of my thoughts: 

Reasons for IMD

* Rigorous and transformative program with leadership and personal growth focus (coaching, psychoanalysts etc..) 
* Excellent brand in Switzerland
* Limiting because I have already lived in Switzerland and although i plan to settle there post-MBA, it would be great to get another experience abroad
* Expensive living costs 

¬≠Reasons for HEC

* Program less rigorous and less focused on leadership
* Longer program with opportunities for international exchange
* Once in a lifetime opportunity to be on a university campus life with top facilities and close to Paris
* More prestigious internationally and better ranked

Essentially, I think that the IMD program is is more rigorous and transformative but the HEC experience might be richer overall and potentially has a better reputation.

Any thoughts on my situation? Any recommendations or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

,MBA,"Hi Reddit,

I got my final school decision today and wanted to share my journey as a low test score applicant. I hope that this might be helpful to future applicants.

I was accepted to every school I applied to with a test waiver (plus Haas EW), but denied at all the schools I submitted my scores to. 

This is also just cathartic for me to write out!

**Stats and Experience:**

**Test Scores:** 316 GRE which is a \~600 GMAT score   
**Ethnicity:** Low Income ORM  
**Age:** 31  
**Undergrad:** Unknown school with 90%+ acceptance rate.   
**EC:** 4 years serving as a committee chair / board member of two different nonprofits. They each have a $20M budget  
**Work:** Finance &amp; Strategy at a $3B national nonprofit / financial institution. Led teams of 15+ to solve industry wide problems (with partnerships with national banks, government agencies, and philanthropic partners). Literally working to redefine our industry. 

Our team's work was turned into a case study at Harvard and Yale...and acknowledged by various City Mayors, and our State's Governor and Senate. 

Previously, I worked at a major financial institution (took a lot of networking to break in coming from my undergrad). 

**Essays:** Explaining why I transitioned to nonprofit work - the work that I'm doing is directly solving the challenges I faced growing up. Showing how my values are also reflected in my personal life and choices. Tried to demonstrate soft skills working with other people. I did a significant amount of school research (very specific and non-cliche examples). Learned from alumni and current students. Tied my contributions to the school on previous and relevant successes. 

I'm a lifelong writer / reader so I felt really comfortable with my essays (don't use this debrief as my writing sample since this more of a train of thought lol). Trying to make an essay sound emotionally poignant, but still professional and not self-pitying is quite a challenge! 

**Consultants:** I paid $10K for one of the ""top 15"" consultants and it was completely worthless. Honestly, I would just use ApplicantLab. I cannot stress how absolutely incredible the platform is. Maria is extremely smart and her advice / insights reflect that on ApplicantLab. I also had my two english major friends help with proofreading. 

**Career Goals:** Learn how to effectively lead teams. Short term, pivot into an impact team at a financial institution (which I already have a network in) and then long term, move into a CFO role at a nonprofit / gov agency.  

Alright! So with all of that, here are the results! 

**Test Waivers:**

Tuck ($$) -&gt; Accepted  
Ross -&gt; Accepted  
Stern -&gt; Accepted  
USC ($$) -&gt; Accepted 

**Part Time / Submitted Scores**

Haas EW ($) -&gt; Accepted  
   
**Full Time / Submitted Scores** 

Yale SOM ‚Äì&gt; Waitlisted Post Interview ‚Äì&gt; Denied  
Kellogg ‚Äì&gt; Denied (I was part of the 10% they didn't even interview lol)  
MIT Sloan ‚Äì&gt; Denied  
HBS ‚Äì&gt; Denied 

**Yale SOM Waitlist Strategy:**

Overall, my waitlist manager was super supportive. However, I was advised very specifically that my application was perfect in every way besides my test score. It was simply too far below their average score to warrant admissions.

The updates that I provided during the way: (i) the Gov. of our state acknowledged my work, (ii) various presentation to our Board / C-Suite and project managing org-wide initiatives, (iii) deeper involvement with the nonprofits I‚Äôm on the board of, and (iv) Alumni C-suite that I partnered with closely providing an additional letter of support. 

**Closing Thoughts:**

This has been a crazy and emotionally draining process. I'm so happy that it's over and Tuck is literally one of my favorite schools. The program was my top choice so it all worked out in the end! I absolutely fell in love with everything I learned about the school and location during my research phase! 

I honestly still believe that someone's test score shouldn't be indicative of their ability to be future leaders. 

I just can't help thinking that if I wasn't given test waivers, I probably wouldn't have been accepted anywhere. Like a school would value someone's ability to find the area of a right triangle over a proven record in building coalitions across an industry. 

I am Indian and recognize that some cultures instills in their kids that test taking is all that matters, but I can't help but think how flawed that is. Ultimately, I think it's someone's soft skills and critical thinking that helps them in the long run. 

I can't help but think of all of the other people that were in an upward trajectory in their career, could have really made a difference in the world using an MBA as a launching pad, but were never given the opportunity because of a test score... 

Best of luck to all of the other low test score applicants out there. 

**Tl,dr:** I hate that this is true and wish I could have proven it wrong, but ultimately, your experience doesn't matter if your test scores aren't in the right range. I really wish I could have proven this wrong (like you have no idea how frustrated it makes me), but my anecdotal experience shows otherwise.

P.s: if your initial reaction to this post is trying to justify that proven leadership skills are less important than someone's test score, or that it would be ""irresponsible"" for the school to admit someone with a lower score, please see paragraph four in the closing thoughts. Prefacing that because some people send some extremely dehumanizing / low EQ comments when someone mentions a low test score. Alright, thanks for listening to my Ted Talk!

&lt;p&gt;I got my final school decision today and wanted to share my journey as a low test score applicant. I hope that this might be helpful to future applicants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was accepted to every school I applied to with a test waiver (plus Haas EW), but denied at all the schools I submitted my scores to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also just cathartic for me to write out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stats and Experience:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test Scores:&lt;/strong&gt; 316 GRE which is a ~600 GMAT score&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ethnicity:&lt;/strong&gt; Low Income ORM&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Age:&lt;/strong&gt; 31&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Undergrad:&lt;/strong&gt; Unknown school with 90%+ acceptance rate.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;EC:&lt;/strong&gt; 4 years serving as a committee chair / board member of two different nonprofits. They each have a $20M budget&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Work:&lt;/strong&gt; Finance &amp;amp; Strategy at a $3B national nonprofit / financial institution. Led teams of 15+ to solve industry wide problems (with partnerships with national banks, government agencies, and philanthropic partners). Literally working to redefine our industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team&amp;#39;s work was turned into a case study at Harvard and Yale...and acknowledged by various City Mayors, and our State&amp;#39;s Governor and Senate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, I worked at a major financial institution (took a lot of networking to break in coming from my undergrad). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Essays:&lt;/strong&gt; Explaining why I transitioned to nonprofit work - the work that I&amp;#39;m doing is directly solving the challenges I faced growing up. Showing how my values are also reflected in my personal life and choices. Tried to demonstrate soft skills working with other people. I did a significant amount of school research (very specific and non-cliche examples). Learned from alumni and current students. Tied my contributions to the school on previous and relevant successes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a lifelong writer / reader so I felt really comfortable with my essays (don&amp;#39;t use this debrief as my writing sample since this more of a train of thought lol). Trying to make an essay sound emotionally poignant, but still professional and not self-pitying is quite a challenge! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consultants:&lt;/strong&gt; I paid $10K for one of the &amp;quot;top 15&amp;quot; consultants and it was completely worthless. Honestly, I would just use ApplicantLab. I cannot stress how absolutely incredible the platform is. Maria is extremely smart and her advice / insights reflect that on ApplicantLab. I also had my two english major friends help with proofreading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Career Goals:&lt;/strong&gt; Learn how to effectively lead teams. Short term, pivot into an impact team at a financial institution (which I already have a network in) and then long term, move into a CFO role at a nonprofit / gov agency.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright! So with all of that, here are the results! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test Waivers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuck ($$) -&amp;gt; Accepted&lt;br/&gt;
Ross -&amp;gt; Accepted&lt;br/&gt;
Stern -&amp;gt; Accepted&lt;br/&gt;
USC ($$) -&amp;gt; Accepted &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part Time / Submitted Scores&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haas EW ($) -&amp;gt; Accepted  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Time / Submitted Scores&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yale SOM ‚Äì&amp;gt; Waitlisted Post Interview ‚Äì&amp;gt; Denied&lt;br/&gt;
Kellogg ‚Äì&amp;gt; Denied (I was part of the 10% they didn&amp;#39;t even interview lol)&lt;br/&gt;
MIT Sloan ‚Äì&amp;gt; Denied&lt;br/&gt;
HBS ‚Äì&amp;gt; Denied &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yale SOM Waitlist Strategy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, my waitlist manager was super supportive. However, I was advised very specifically that my application was perfect in every way besides my test score. It was simply too far below their average score to warrant admissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The updates that I provided during the way: (i) the Gov. of our state acknowledged my work, (ii) various presentation to our Board / C-Suite and project managing org-wide initiatives, (iii) deeper involvement with the nonprofits I‚Äôm on the board of, and (iv) Alumni C-suite that I partnered with closely providing an additional letter of support. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closing Thoughts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been a crazy and emotionally draining process. I&amp;#39;m so happy that it&amp;#39;s over and Tuck is literally one of my favorite schools. The program was my top choice so it all worked out in the end! I absolutely fell in love with everything I learned about the school and location during my research phase! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly still believe that someone&amp;#39;s test score shouldn&amp;#39;t be indicative of their ability to be future leaders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just can&amp;#39;t help thinking that if I wasn&amp;#39;t given test waivers, I probably wouldn&amp;#39;t have been accepted anywhere. Like a school would value someone&amp;#39;s ability to find the area of a right triangle over a proven record in building coalitions across an industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am Indian and recognize that some cultures instills in their kids that test taking is all that matters, but I can&amp;#39;t help but think how flawed that is. Ultimately, I think it&amp;#39;s someone&amp;#39;s soft skills and critical thinking that helps them in the long run. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t help but think of all of the other people that were in an upward trajectory in their career, could have really made a difference in the world using an MBA as a launching pad, but were never given the opportunity because of a test score... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best of luck to all of the other low test score applicants out there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tl,dr:&lt;/strong&gt; I hate that this is true and wish I could have proven it wrong, but ultimately, your experience doesn&amp;#39;t matter if your test scores aren&amp;#39;t in the right range. I really wish I could have proven this wrong (like you have no idea how frustrated it makes me), but my anecdotal experience shows otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.s: if your initial reaction to this post is trying to justify that proven leadership skills are less important than someone&amp;#39;s test score, or that it would be &amp;quot;irresponsible&amp;quot; for the school to admit someone with a lower score, please see paragraph four in the closing thoughts.

,macbook,"My last laptop had to be returned to my company when I retired last year and since then I've been using a combination of my older Windows desktop and a 9th gen iPad for several months now. I have never used MacOS before, but I found the Walmart M1 Air deal this month was too tempting to resist and I wanted to try MacOS.  I'm quite pleased with the M1 Air 8/256 and MacOS in all respects so far.

I do a fair amount of photography, occasional video editing, and enjoy hobbyist programming. I also create docs/spreadsheets/presentations for myself and organizations I volunteer for.

Based on what I've seen, I'm going to stay with MacOS, but I'm looking at options because I'm still within the 30-day return window at Walmart:

1. keep the M1 Air until/unless I outgrow it. I currently use it with a new mac keyboard and my existing monitor when at home.
2. return the M1A and get a MBP M3 Pro 11/14 18/512 for $1699 at Apple refurb store (net $1000 more than I paid for the M1A.
3. keep the M1A and possibly get a Mac mini. For example the mini M2P 10/16 16/512 is $1099 on Apple refurb. So the total cost of my Air *and* the mini is only $100 more than the MBP refurb.

Since the cost is so similar between options 2 and 3, I'm wondering if any of you have insight into alternatives 2 and 3: comparing use of a higher-end laptop (option 2) vs the combination of a minimal laptop with a desktop (option 3).

,MBA,"Asking for my sister. She's worked for decades and is stuck at her current level. She's the 'top performer' in her large company but keeps getting passed over for positions she could do as she's only got a bachelor's. She is considering an MBA and the UNC KF program is literally at her back door. 

Should she:

do the program in person?

do it online?

keep  her current job while doing the program (she has a very flexible, WFH situation and has, in the past, held secret second jobs for months at a time without her main job knowing or caring)?

not do this as she's too old and the cost is $$$?

Realistically, could she make enough money with an MBA (at her age) to make it 'worth the work'?

Thoughts? I know most of this sub seems to be people in their 30s so maybe this is not relevant to any of you, but I thought I would ask for her.

I'm currently leaning towards UT Austin as it seems like the program has a reputation of being one of the few MSFs actually worth pursuing, they have a thorough employment report with detailed outcomes and breakdowns by industry compared to BC and Georgetown which are more vague, and their career services seems to be a lot stronger than BC and Georgetown which is the biggest priority for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never used a MAC before and I've always been a Windows user, but this is slowely changing especially after I got my first iPhone this year.

I was going to get a MBA M2, the concept of fanless design is very appealing to me because I've had enough of Windows laptops noise over the years. But the recent security fail affecting M chips changed my mind, so I guess no M chip for me for now..

I need your help please because I'm new to the whole Mac thing, I need the best non M chip MBP that I can get, but it should be extremely quiet and doesn't get too hot.

I mostly do coding, a little bit of Photoshop &amp; other normal stuff. I need a MB that can do that smoothly while staying very quiet &amp; cool.

,dating_advice,"IÔ∏è [24F]  met him [29M] on hinge originally in november but we didn‚Äôt decide to really talk or make plans until december. He told me he wasn‚Äôt sure what he was looking for since he was moving for residency in six months without knowing where he would ‚Äúmatch‚Äù. IÔ∏è told him IÔ∏è don‚Äôt really do casual relationships but IÔ∏è would possibly meet him because he seemed interesting.

From the get-go he was telling me how IÔ∏è looked better with my nails done through text. IÔ∏è kinda just let it go because he was begging to meet me and IÔ∏è thought one date was harmless. IÔ∏è would not really respond as IÔ∏è wasn‚Äôt really into texting with work and everything else going on. He told me he thought IÔ∏è was disinterested and IÔ∏è told him IÔ∏è wasnt. when IÔ∏è began texting him more he asked why and asked if he was entertaining‚Ä¶

Then IÔ∏è finally met him and he was a gentleman. He paid for our food, held the door, complimented me. When we kissed there were sparks. IÔ∏è was confused about his intentions though. IÔ∏è told him over text that IÔ∏è had a good time and that he seems really nice and he made a joke about it seeming like IÔ∏è would never want to see him again. he also told me that he got kicked out of his first medical school because he was arrested from public intoxication (?).

IÔ∏è decided to just keep seeing him because IÔ∏è was kind of hung up over someone that didn‚Äôt want anything serious. He kept being so sweet and when we would hug he would say that we fit perfectly together. It seemed like we had a lot in common and we got along well.

He lives in a hour away, and he‚Äôs in his last year of medical school so IÔ∏è invited him out with some friends since it was either IÔ∏è couldn‚Äôt see my friends or IÔ∏è couldn‚Äôt see him for two weeks. It was a mostly good time but one of my close girl friends was talking about how most of her first dates only last around a hour long and he made a comment saying that it must be her fault and they all must be bad dated due to her own wrongdoing. IÔ∏è passed it off as a joke. Then he later on asked my friends how long you have to date someone until you are in a relationship. 


The day after our third date my step father that raised me had a severe stroke . IÔ∏è did not reach out to him, but he saw my instagram story and asked what happened. IÔ∏è felt weird telling him at first since IÔ∏è was unsure of his intentions with me. IÔ∏è told him what happened and he told me that he wanted to be there for me because he really likes me and hasn‚Äôt had this much fun with someone in years. 

IÔ∏è tried to push him away at first, but he sent a journal to my home that was hours away and kept giving me emotional support so IÔ∏è thought IÔ∏è was doing the wrong thing and went against my gut. 

IÔ∏è continued to see him. in person things were great and he was really affectionate. he began opening up to me and telling me about his family trauma and he told me that his ex girlfriend was a person that ruined his life, threatened suicide, and would cheat on him at parties. He described her as narcissistic and IÔ∏è felt genuine compassion for him.  He would bring her up sometimes when we hung out and he told me how she did only fans and if IÔ∏è wanted to do that he would leave me.

Things were going pretty well until he was telling me how he feels jealousy and that he didn‚Äôt know if  he could come to a party with me because he was scared he would get jealous. IÔ∏è promised IÔ∏è would kiss him and hold his hand. prior to this party it was valentine‚Äôs day and he got me roses and would tell me that i‚Äôm his. 

Before the party IÔ∏è felt so anxious and even told my friend. he ended up coming after me asking him a few times. IÔ∏è asked him to play a game with me at the party and he ignored me to talk to this girl IÔ∏èm casually friends with for a while (they have quite a few things in common and she told me that she thinks he‚Äôs cute). 

IÔ∏è was drunk and was so scared that he was going to get jealous that IÔ∏è felt jealous. but, IÔ∏è just causally went up to him and so told him IÔ∏è was embarrassed by this feeling but that IÔ∏è really liked him and IÔ∏è kind of felt jealous because IÔ∏è wanted to play the game with him. He held me and kissed me and said that in his and he‚Äôs mine.  

later that night (in front of my friends), he told me that he fell for a girl a year and a half ago and that she didn‚Äôt want anything serious bc she was in love with her ex and he said i‚Äôm probably doing the same thing. IÔ∏è told him IÔ∏è wasn‚Äôt and that IÔ∏è liked him a lot.

He got super drunk and ended up puking in my garbage can. IÔ∏è took care of him and made him cookies that he didn‚Äôt eat. he told me he was in love with a girl with a black bicycle, but IÔ∏è suspected it was just drunk nonsense.

That morning we made plans to hang out the next day. IÔ∏è followed up with him in the evening to confirm because my friends were trying to see me if he didn‚Äôt want to hang out and he didn‚Äôt answer until 11pm. he cancelled our plans and didn‚Äôt ask to reschedule.

so IÔ∏è told him IÔ∏è was kind of hurt because IÔ∏è was excited to see him and IÔ∏è wanted to talk about what happened at the party to have healthy communication. he ended up calling me and saying he didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big deal he cancelled and IÔ∏è explained how it just hurt and that IÔ∏è would like more notice next time so IÔ∏è can make other plans. it was a mostly normal conversation with him being defensive most of the time. 

the next day IÔ∏è saw my friends since he cancelled plans and IÔ∏è wore a dress and did my makeup. IÔ∏è always dress in this manner when IÔ∏è go out and IÔ∏è usually post a selfie on my story. 

IÔ∏è was harassed by an older gay man while IÔ∏è  was out. He even told me IÔ∏è was a hooker because my personality was too nice. he told me he wanted to experiment with me and he wouldn‚Äôt take no for an answer. He kept trying to offer me money as well.  

IÔ∏è texted my nex and was telling him how a group of guys and the gay guy was harassing me. IÔ∏è believe IÔ∏è was drugged because IÔ∏è only had two drinks and the room was spinning. IÔ∏è lost my friends. my head was pounding. and IÔ∏è fell on the ground and threw up three times. 

IÔ∏è don‚Äôt remember much about that night but apparently IÔ∏è called him on the phone when IÔ∏è got home and he said IÔ∏è was just repeating myself over and over and that i kept telling him all the things the guys were saying while harassing me. 

The next day, IÔ∏è woke up and IÔ∏è was crying and IÔ∏è tried to call him since we had plans to see each other as well. he declined my call and was very cold to me. he told me IÔ∏è was annoying and that he already heard the story 15 times. IÔ∏è told him that was very hurtful since IÔ∏è just went through a traumatic experience. 

he didn‚Äôt talk to me all day. he eventually ended up calling me after fighting with me over text message. he made me tell him the story again and he said he thought IÔ∏è just did all of that and made it up to get back at ik for cancelling our plans. he also told me i‚Äôm a smart girl and should know better then to wear a dress out. he then told me how i‚Äôm basically not as smart as him since im a phd student and he‚Äôs a med student. and he was saying how my friends are immature and not as up to par as him since they‚Äôre mba students.

IÔ∏è was very hurt and confused because he has been providing me so much love and support with my step father being in a coma.

IÔ∏è decided to stay. he apologized the next day and said that he is very vengeful when he feels wronged and that he likes to provoke people but he knows it‚Äôs wrong and he‚Äôs sorry. 

he then offered to take me on a trip and IÔ∏è said no at first. he kept asking and asking. IÔ∏è eventually said yes because his love bombing was in full force . he kept sending me sweet good morning texts and future faking.

he kept telling me how he was scared that his residency program may be far away from me and was asking me what we should do if so.

on the trip we didn‚Äôt have cell service and we bonded heavily. it was a great time and IÔ∏è ended up sick and he took care of me so well. he again brought up the future and how he really cares for me and has grown to have real feelings for me.

The following week, he kept texting me about how he was scared to find out where he will go to residency (he found out on March 15th). IÔ∏è offered him a lot of emotional support and called him.

The day he matched, he matched in a region that IÔ∏è am trying to relocate to since the biotech industry has a lot of jobs there. How serendipitous! 

He decided to go out and celebrate with his medical school friends and their partners. IÔ∏è was pretty sad IÔ∏è wasn‚Äôt invited since he‚Äôs met all my friends and co-workers. He even texted me that day asking me to move with him.


Around 3am he got home and asked to talk to me on the phone. IÔ∏è  told him IÔ∏è was kind of sad and didn‚Äôt want to ruin his night and we could talk in the morning. He insisted we should talk and IÔ∏è told him how IÔ∏è was kind of sad IÔ∏è was not invited to the party but IÔ∏è also understood that it was a big night for him. He immediately got defensive and said we never talked about me going, that he believes IÔ∏è wouldn‚Äôt like to be around all his friends etc etc.. 

IÔ∏è then told him IÔ∏è have a yeast infection and he told me how that‚Äôs so disgusting and how he doesn‚Äôt want to know about it. He went off about how vaginas can be so disgusting in general too.

IÔ∏è then told him that IÔ∏è was embarrassed of this behavior but IÔ∏è accidentally found out that his ex-gf (that he says he hates) liked his future residency‚Äôs programs post about him matching there. IÔ∏è said IÔ∏è thought it was odd they followed each other as well since he says she ruined his life.

she immediately got defensive and said that he doesn‚Äôt want to fuck her, he doesn‚Äôt subscribe to her only fans. IÔ∏è told him IÔ∏è didn‚Äôt ask that and was just confused why he followed her since he said she‚Äôs crazy and abused him. he eventually admitted that they saw each other two years ago. he then kept making fun of me for even bringing it up.

The next day IÔ∏è saw him to celebrate his residency match. I also found out that my aunt died. IÔ∏è made him a steak dinner. he was so taken back and asked me why IÔ∏è did that all for him. IÔ∏è told him because IÔ∏è really cared about him and then he asked if IÔ∏è long to be cared about ?

Later that night we were cutting cheesecake and he stated that he doesn‚Äôt know if he will ever get married. IÔ∏è try to comfort him and he would just get upset. he has said this a few different times. 

The day before my aunts funeral IÔ∏è decided to see him and he basically told me that i‚Äôll never make it in boston and that IÔ∏è will never like any job IÔ∏è have. IÔ∏è told him my friends like their jobs and he told me their jobs are ‚Äúfake‚Äù. he also kept telling me that if i‚Äôm so smart IÔ∏è should just become a doctor.

after sex, he then told me that if he got a girl pregnant, but ‚Äúnot me‚Äù, he would run away to mexico so she can‚Äôt have any of his money. he brought up again how vaginas are disgusting. he talked about his exes fake boobs. he told me how he would get plastic surgery so people think he‚Äôs a better doctor.  how a lot of gay men have asked him out etc‚Ä¶

The following morning IÔ∏è was then talking to him about the beach and IÔ∏è told him how IÔ∏è would love for him to come to my home town one day so IÔ∏è can show him what beach IÔ∏è worked out. He told me that‚Äôs not his place. IÔ∏è was confused and asked him to elaborate and he basically said he never wants to meet my family.

IÔ∏è started crying . he grabbed me and told me that he could feel my heart breaking. he told me not to tell my friends that he won‚Äôt commit. he told me that he really likes me and wants to be with me, but he thinks IÔ∏è like him because of my step fathers coma. 

IÔ∏è tried to leave but he just kept grasping at straws. he told me to shower with him and he grabbed my face and said he likes looking into my eyes, even now, when he sees pain in them. he then kept touching me. he told me IÔ∏è didn‚Äôt have to have wed with him but IÔ∏è just turned around and let him.

he kept telling me not to tell my friends and to not break up with him after my aunts funeral. IÔ∏è then drove six hours home while crying.

Everyone is saying that he emotionally abused me but IÔ∏è genuinely don‚Äôt feel any anger towards him and IÔ∏è miss him so much. We were talking for around 3-4 months.

IÔ∏è ended up going home and my friends made me break it off with him. he was cruel over text message. he told me he could never be in a relationship with me because my family seems crazy and it‚Äôs just ‚Äúself preservation‚Äù. he told me how IÔ∏è care too much about my family and my step fathers coma/stroke that has devastated me. 


some things that stick in my head: him telling me he hasn‚Äôt liked anyone like this in years, asking me if IÔ∏è  ever had my belly button pierced (his ex has hers), saying he hasn‚Äôt had sex like this in years, how i‚Äôm his, how we fit together, how im perfect 

tl;dr a few friends have told me this guy seems like a narcissist. IÔ∏è genuinely miss him and feel like i‚Äôm in the wrong for asking for a relationship ",t2_fcmvzcnci,False,,0.0,False,How to get over a toxic situationship ,[],r/dating_advice,False,6.0,,0.0,,,False,t3_1bp91ea,False,dark,1.0,,public,1.0,0.0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1.0,,False,False,nsfw,False,,[],{},,True,,1711563957.0,text,6.0,,,text,self.dating_advice,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;IÔ∏è [24F]  met him [29M] on hinge originally in november but we didn‚Äôt decide to really talk or make plans until december. He told me he wasn‚Äôt sure what he was looking for since he was moving for residency in six months without knowing where he would ‚Äúmatch‚Äù. IÔ∏è told him IÔ∏è don‚Äôt really do casual relationships but IÔ∏è would possibly meet him because he seemed interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the get-go he was telling me how IÔ∏è looked better with my nails done through text. IÔ∏è kinda just let it go because he was begging to meet me and IÔ∏è thought one date was harmless. IÔ∏è would not really respond as IÔ∏è wasn‚Äôt really into texting with work and everything else going on. He told me he thought IÔ∏è was disinterested and IÔ∏è told him IÔ∏è wasnt. when IÔ∏è began texting him more he asked why and asked if he was entertaining‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then IÔ∏è finally met him and he was a gentleman. He paid for our food, held the door, complimented me. When we kissed there were sparks. IÔ∏è was confused about his intentions though. IÔ∏è told him over text that IÔ∏è had a good time and that he seems really nice and he made a joke about it seeming like IÔ∏è would never want to see him again. he also told me that he got kicked out of his first medical school because he was arrested from public intoxication (?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IÔ∏è decided to just keep seeing him because IÔ∏è was kind of hung up over someone that didn‚Äôt want anything serious. He kept being so sweet and when we would hug he would say that we fit perfectly together. It seemed like we had a lot in common and we got along well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He lives in a hour away, and he‚Äôs in his last year of medical school so IÔ∏è invited him out with some friends since it was either IÔ∏è couldn‚Äôt see my friends or IÔ∏è couldn‚Äôt see him for two weeks. It was a mostly good time but one of my close girl friends was talking about how most of her first dates only last around a hour long and he made a comment saying that it must be her fault and they all must be bad dated due to her own wrongdoing. IÔ∏è passed it off as a joke. Then he later on asked my friends how long you have to date someone until you are in a relationship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day after our third date my step father that raised me had a severe stroke . IÔ∏è did not reach out to him, but he saw my instagram story and asked what happened. IÔ∏è felt weird telling him at first since IÔ∏è was unsure of his intentions with me. IÔ∏è told him what happened and he told me that he wanted to be there for me because he really likes me and hasn‚Äôt had this much fun with someone in years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IÔ∏è tried to push him away at first, but he sent a journal to my home that was hours away and kept giving me emotional support so IÔ∏è thought IÔ∏è was doing the wrong thing and went against my gut. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IÔ∏è continued to see him. in person things were great and he was really affectionate. he began opening up to me and telling me about his family trauma and he told me that his ex girlfriend was a person that ruined his life, threatened suicide, and would cheat on him at parties. He described her as narcissistic and IÔ∏è felt genuine compassion for him.  He would bring her up sometimes when we hung out and he told me how she did only fans and if IÔ∏è wanted to do that he would leave me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things were going pretty well until he was telling me how he feels jealousy and that he didn‚Äôt know if  he could come to a party with me because he was scared he would get jealous. IÔ∏è promised IÔ∏è would kiss him and hold his hand. prior to this party it was valentine‚Äôs day and he got me roses and would tell me that i‚Äôm his. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the party IÔ∏è felt so anxious and even told my friend. he ended up coming after me asking him a few times. IÔ∏è asked him to play a game with me at the party and he ignored me to talk to this girl IÔ∏èm casually friends with for a while (they have quite a few things in common and she told me that she thinks he‚Äôs cute). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IÔ∏è was drunk and was so scared that he was going to get jealous that IÔ∏è felt jealous. but, IÔ∏è just causally went up to him and so told him IÔ∏è was embarrassed by this feeling but that IÔ∏è really liked him and IÔ∏è kind of felt jealous because IÔ∏è wanted to play the game with him. He held me and kissed me and said that in his and he‚Äôs mine.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;later that night (in front of my friends), he told me that he fell for a girl a year and a half ago and that she didn‚Äôt want anything serious bc she was in love with her ex and he said i‚Äôm probably doing the same thing. IÔ∏è told him IÔ∏è wasn‚Äôt and that IÔ∏è liked him a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He got super drunk and ended up puking in my garbage can. IÔ∏è took care of him and made him cookies that he didn‚Äôt eat. he told me he was in love with a girl with a black bicycle, but IÔ∏è suspected it was just drunk nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That morning we made plans to hang out the next day. IÔ∏è followed up with him in the evening to confirm because my friends were trying to see me if he didn‚Äôt want to hang out and he didn‚Äôt answer until 11pm. he cancelled our plans and didn‚Äôt ask to reschedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so IÔ∏è told him IÔ∏è was kind of hurt because IÔ∏è was excited to see him and IÔ∏è wanted to talk about what happened at the party to have healthy communication. he ended up calling me and saying he didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big deal he cancelled and IÔ∏è explained how it just hurt and that IÔ∏è would like more notice next time so IÔ∏è can make other plans. it was a mostly normal conversation with him being defensive most of the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the next day IÔ∏è saw my friends since he cancelled plans and IÔ∏è wore a dress and did my makeup. IÔ∏è always dress in this manner when IÔ∏è go out and IÔ∏è usually post a selfie on my story. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IÔ∏è was harassed by an older gay man while IÔ∏è  was out. He even told me IÔ∏è was a hooker because my personality was too nice. he told me he wanted to experiment with me and he wouldn‚Äôt take no for an answer. He kept trying to offer me money as well.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IÔ∏è texted my nex and was telling him how a group of guys and the gay guy was harassing me. IÔ∏è believe IÔ∏è was drugged because IÔ∏è only had two drinks and the room was spinning. IÔ∏è lost my friends. my head was pounding. and IÔ∏è fell on the ground and threw up three times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IÔ∏è don‚Äôt remember much about that night but apparently IÔ∏è called him on the phone when IÔ∏è got home and he said IÔ∏è was just repeating myself over and over and that i kept telling him all the things the guys were saying while harassing me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, IÔ∏è woke up and IÔ∏è was crying and IÔ∏è tried to call him since we had plans to see each other as well. he declined my call and was very cold to me. he told me IÔ∏è was annoying and that he already heard the story 15 times. IÔ∏è told him that was very hurtful since IÔ∏è just went through a traumatic experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;he didn‚Äôt talk to me all day. he eventually ended up calling me after fighting with me over text message. he made me tell him the story again and he said he thought IÔ∏è just did all of that and made it up to get back at ik for cancelling our plans. he also told me i‚Äôm a smart girl and should know better then to wear a dress out. he then told me how i‚Äôm basically not as smart as him since im a phd student and he‚Äôs a med student. and he was saying how my friends are immature and not as up to par as him since they‚Äôre mba students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IÔ∏è was very hurt and confused because he has been providing me so much love and support with my step father being in a coma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IÔ∏è decided to stay. he apologized the next day and said that he is very vengeful when he feels wronged and that he likes to provoke people but he knows it‚Äôs wrong and he‚Äôs sorry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;he then offered to take me on a trip and IÔ∏è said no at first. he kept asking and asking. IÔ∏è eventually said yes because his love bombing was in full force . he kept sending me sweet good morning texts and future faking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;he kept telling me how he was scared that his residency program may be far away from me and was asking me what we should do if so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on the trip we didn‚Äôt have cell service and we bonded heavily. it was a great time and IÔ∏è ended up sick and he took care of me so well. he again brought up the future and how he really cares for me and has grown to have real feelings for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following week, he kept texting me about how he was scared to find out where he will go to residency (he found out on March 15th). IÔ∏è offered him a lot of emotional support and called him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day he matched, he matched in a region that IÔ∏è am trying to relocate to since the biotech industry has a lot of jobs there. How serendipitous! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He decided to go out and celebrate with his medical school friends and their partners. IÔ∏è was pretty sad IÔ∏è wasn‚Äôt invited since he‚Äôs met all my friends and co-workers. He even texted me that day asking me to move with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 3am he got home and asked to talk to me on the phone. IÔ∏è  told him IÔ∏è was kind of sad and didn‚Äôt want to ruin his night and we could talk in the morning. He insisted we should talk and IÔ∏è told him how IÔ∏è was kind of sad IÔ∏è was not invited to the party but IÔ∏è also understood that it was a big night for him. He immediately got defensive and said we never talked about me going, that he believes IÔ∏è wouldn‚Äôt like to be around all his friends etc etc.. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IÔ∏è then told him IÔ∏è have a yeast infection and he told me how that‚Äôs so disgusting and how he doesn‚Äôt want to know about it. He went off about how vaginas can be so disgusting in general too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IÔ∏è then told him that IÔ∏è was embarrassed of this behavior but IÔ∏è accidentally found out that his ex-gf (that he says he hates) liked his future residency‚Äôs programs post about him matching there. IÔ∏è said IÔ∏è thought it was odd they followed each other as well since he says she ruined his life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;she immediately got defensive and said that he doesn‚Äôt want to fuck her, he doesn‚Äôt subscribe to her only fans. IÔ∏è told him IÔ∏è didn‚Äôt ask that and was just confused why he followed her since he said she‚Äôs crazy and abused him. he eventually admitted that they saw each other two years ago. he then kept making fun of me for even bringing it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day IÔ∏è saw him to celebrate his residency match. I also found out that my aunt died. IÔ∏è made him a steak dinner. he was so taken back and asked me why IÔ∏è did that all for him. IÔ∏è told him because IÔ∏è really cared about him and then he asked if IÔ∏è long to be cared about ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that night we were cutting cheesecake and he stated that he doesn‚Äôt know if he will ever get married. IÔ∏è try to comfort him and he would just get upset. he has said this a few different times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day before my aunts funeral IÔ∏è decided to see him and he basically told me that i‚Äôll never make it in boston and that IÔ∏è will never like any job IÔ∏è have. IÔ∏è told him my friends like their jobs and he told me their jobs are ‚Äúfake‚Äù. he also kept telling me that if i‚Äôm so smart IÔ∏è should just become a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;after sex, he then told me that if he got a girl pregnant, but ‚Äúnot me‚Äù, he would run away to mexico so she can‚Äôt have any of his money. he brought up again how vaginas are disgusting. he talked about his exes fake boobs. he told me how he would get plastic surgery so people think he‚Äôs a better doctor.  how a lot of gay men have asked him out etc‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning IÔ∏è was then talking to him about the beach and IÔ∏è told him how IÔ∏è would love for him to come to my home town one day so IÔ∏è can show him what beach IÔ∏è worked out. He told me that‚Äôs not his place. IÔ∏è was confused and asked him to elaborate and he basically said he never wants to meet my family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IÔ∏è started crying . he grabbed me and told me that he could feel my heart breaking. he told me not to tell my friends that he won‚Äôt commit. he told me that he really likes me and wants to be with me, but he thinks IÔ∏è like him because of my step fathers coma. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IÔ∏è tried to leave but he just kept grasping at straws. he told me to shower with him and he grabbed my face and said he likes looking into my eyes, even now, when he sees pain in them. he then kept touching me. he told me IÔ∏è didn‚Äôt have to have wed with him but IÔ∏è just turned around and let him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;he kept telling me not to tell my friends and to not break up with him after my aunts funeral. IÔ∏è then drove six hours home while crying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone is saying that he emotionally abused me but IÔ∏è genuinely don‚Äôt feel any anger towards him and IÔ∏è miss him so much. We were talking for around 3-4 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IÔ∏è ended up going home and my friends made me break it off with him. he was cruel over text message. he told me he could never be in a relationship with me because my family seems crazy and it‚Äôs just ‚Äúself preservation‚Äù. he told me how IÔ∏è care too much about my family and my step fathers coma/stroke that has devastated me. &lt;/p&gt;

**March 27, 2024**

**BRONX** \- New York City Mayor Eric Adams and NYC Health + Hospitals announced plans to open an $8 million health and substance use disorder clinic for pregnant and postpartum women and their families. 

The clinic will offer pregnant and parenting individuals living with substance use disorder ‚Äî a dependence on alcohol, tobacco and other drugs ‚Äî a safe and supportive place to access prenatal and postnatal care, addiction medicine, and behavioral health care. As the city aims to reduce Black maternal mortality by 10 percent and reduce opioid deaths by 25 percent by 2030, this clinic will support healthy birth outcomes, reduce the likelihood and impact of postpartum relapse, and address the needs of older children living in these families. Funded with an investment through ‚ÄúWomen Forward NYC: An Action Plan for Gender Equity‚Äù ‚Äî the Adams administration‚Äôs $43 million plan with the ambitious goal of making New York City the most woman-forward city in the country ‚Äî the clinic will build on the city‚Äôs cross-sector work to improve the health and well-being of all women.  

The 6,500 square foot space, expected to open in 2026, will serve approximately 200 families per year and will be located at NYC Health + Hospitals/Lincoln in the Bronx ‚Äî the borough with the highest rate of opioid overdose death in New York City. In addition to substance use support, patients will also be able to access connections to community-based organizations for other critical services supporting recovery, such as housing, food, and employment. Care teams will be comprised of medical and behavioral health providers, including social workers, community health workers, and certified peer counselors with lived experience of substance use disorder. Robin Hood provided a planning grant of $404,000 to design a treatment model for pregnant women diagnosed with substance use disorder.

""This is a critical moment for women's health in New York City and across the country,"" said Mayor Adams. ""Addiction and substance use disorder doesn't discriminate, and overdoses are a leading cause of deaths in pregnant and postpartum women in New York City, affecting not only the new parent, but also their family and loved ones. Our administration has taken action to boost birth equity and support new families ‚Äî expanding the doula program citywide, signing a package of bills to strengthen maternal health, and setting the ambitious goal of reducing Black maternal mortality by 10 percent by 2030 ‚Äî and today‚Äôs announcement of the Family Substance Use Disorder clinic coming to NYC Health + Hospitals/Lincoln is a continuation of that critical work. Our children are our most precious resource and by investing in them and their families from the start, we'll build a safer and healthier city for generations to come.""

‚ÄúToday‚Äôs $8 million investment, part of ‚ÄòWomen Forward NYC,‚Äô shows concrete steps the administration is taking to build lasting structures to support families before and after welcoming a child,‚Äù said Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Anne Williams-Isom. ‚ÄúWe also know that the opioid crisis has touched so many families, and this new clinic will be a place for support, connection, and assistance as practitioners walk with new and expecting parents on their journey to better health. Finally, this new clinic is part of a broader strategy to reduce Black maternal mortality by 10 percent by 2030 and to reduce opioid overdose deaths by 25 percent by 2030. Thank you to the specialized teams doing this work to help us tackle these issues that affect so many families in the Bronx and beyond.‚Äù

‚ÄúSubstance use disorder is not only detrimental to the user, but also impacts the pregnancy and family ‚Äî nuclear as well as extended,‚Äù said NYC Health + Hospitals Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer Machelle Allen, MD. ‚ÄúPregnancy is a time when motivation for behavior change is high. It is our aim to leverage this personal motivation, coupled with peer support, professional guidance, and whole family engagement, to achieve a clean and sober intact family unit within which the child and his or her siblings thrive.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnfortunately, substance use disorder does not discriminate for pregnancy, and overdoses are a leading cause of deaths in pregnant and postpartum women in New York City,‚Äù said NYC Health + Hospitals Chief Women‚Äôs Health Service Officer Wendy Wilcox, MD, MPH, MBA, FACOG. ‚ÄúThere is a critical and harmful intersectionality between maternal health and substance use disorder, which may lead to disastrous consequences for both pregnant and postpartum people and their children. For this reason, I am thrilled NYC Health + Hospitals is launching a holistic program to treat pregnant and postpartum people who have substance use disorder with their families. This is a crucial step to lower maternal mortality and morbidity and save lives!‚Äù

‚ÄúSupporting our pregnant and postpartum women through this clinic fills a crucial gap in our system,‚Äù said NYC Health + Hospitals Deputy Chief Medical Officer and System Chief of Behavioral Health Omar Fattal, MD, MPH. ‚ÄúWe hope this new clinic will be a beacon for pregnant women and new mothers to ensure support is available across the spectrum of medical, behavioral health, and social services. We are excited to develop new ways to address the great need for specialized substance use services in the Bronx.‚Äù

‚ÄúAn integrated service setting like this changes the treatment landscape for families challenged by addiction,‚Äù said NYC Health + Hospitals Director of Child and Adolescent Behavioral Health Growth and Strategy Jennifer Havens, MD. ‚ÄúBringing the whole family into comprehensive non-judgmental care holds the most promise for parents‚Äô and children‚Äôs well-being.‚Äù

‚ÄúWith overdose a leading cause of Black maternal deaths, and the tragic ripple effects, stigma-free access to substance use disorder and mental health treatment for expecting families is a must,"" said New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan. ""We celebrate the opening of NYC Health + Hospital‚Äôs first family substance use disorder clinic and hope it will lead to healthier, stronger families and communities.‚Äù

NYC Health + Hospitals is the largest provider of behavioral health care in New York City. The system provides almost 60 percent of behavioral health services citywide, serving over 75,000 patients annually across emergency, inpatient, and outpatient care. It offers a spectrum of services that treat substance use disorders, including several outpatient substance use clinics, four opioid treatment programs, buprenorphine treatment in person or via a telehealth visit through [Virtual ExpressCare](https://expresscare.nyc/), and treatment for withdrawal from alcohol and opioid use at five of its substance use clinics on a walk-in basis. 

NYC Health + Hospitals‚Äô wide range of obstetric and gynecologic services includes primary care, family planning, abortion care, prenatal through delivery care, midwifery and referrals for doula services, postpartum care, breastfeeding and lactation services, breast exams, nutrition, behavioral health referrals, preventive care, and vaccinations. Nearly 16,000 children are born at NYC Health + Hospitals each year. Gynecology services include menopause and fibroid treatments, as well as specialty practices for gynecologic cancers, pelvic pain, and endometriosis. Patients wishing to make an appointment can call 844-NYC-4NYC.

In January 2024, following his [State of the City address](https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/067-24/mayor-adams-lays-out-future-focused-vision-working-class-new-yorkers-third-state-the-city), Mayor Adams announced ‚ÄúWomen Forward NYC.‚Äù Supported through city dollars, private and public partnerships, academic institutions, and federal grant funding, the action plan addresses gender disparities by connecting women to professional development and higher-paying jobs; dismantling barriers to sexual, reproductive, and chronic health care; reducing gender-based violence against women; and providing holistic housing services, including for formerly incarcerated women and domestic and gender-based violence survivors.

‚ÄúSubstance abuse and addiction do not only affect individuals; children are particularly vulnerable to the secondary effects,"" said New York State Senator Jos√© M. Serrano. ""The services that this clinic aims to provide will help address the wide-ranging impacts of substance-use disorder on both mothers and children, helping families break free from the grip of substance abuse.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs the daughter of doctors who worked in drug addiction medicine, I have seen firsthand how escaping substance abuse saves lives,"" said New York State Assemblymember Jenifer Rajkumar. ‚ÄúA new perinatal substance use disorder clinic in the Bronx, the borough with the highest overdose death rate, marks a revolutionary step forward in maternal health. Pregnancy is meant to be a time of joy for families, and substance use treatment for expecting parents will keep addiction from casting a shadow over such a beautiful occasion. This clinic will also help us reach our dual goals of reducing maternal mortality and opioid deaths. Today we bring this gift to thousands of parents in the Bronx.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe substance use disorder clinic at NYC Health + Hospitals/Lincoln will address the dual crisis of the opioid epidemic and maternal mortality and morbidity,"" said New York State Assemblymember Yudelka Tapia. ""The Bronx has been uniquely impacted by these crises with the highest opioid overdose of any borough and a maternal mortality rate that is double the citywide rate. Creating a safe and supportive place is critical in ensuring pregnant and postpartum individuals can access health care services and community-based supports.‚Äù

‚ÄúFostering healthy, stable families lays the foundation for a better Bronx,‚Äù said Bronx District Attorney Darcel D. Clark. ‚ÄúThis program which will operate in Lincoln Hospital in the center of high opioid overdose rates will help women and their babies thrive and give children a robust start in life.

,MBA,"like many of us - got dinged by Wharton ystd so I'm revisiting my prospects a bit

bit of a ramble but here goes:

Only applied to 5 schools in R2 (time crunch I know, didn't start studying for the GMAT and this whole process until way too late last year)

Didn't really use any consulting help or outside help at all throughout this process so went to into it super blind, don't know anyone with an MBA from a top school or anything at all so kinda just rawdogging this whole thing.

Also didn't know much about my odds were until I talked to someone for the TBD.

H - ding (duh; went a bit wild on the essay so that was probably it + scores)

W - ding after interview (guessing it was the scores that pulled it down)

C - ding no interview

Johnson - Interviewed/Waiting

Stern - Interviewed/Waiting

End goal : pivot into Finance (IB is the easy route but long term into IM would be nice)

Background:

28/29 M

720 gmat (verbal heavy)

UG: non 4.0 gpa scale, kinda mid but rocketed up by final year, top 3 Canadian econ school

* Published final paper/thesis in faculty reviewed journal, received undergrad prize upon graduation
* President of Quant club

WE: 5 years by matriculation as an economist + some RE lending exp early in my career

* Duties include: building time series forecasting models, econometric models, writing public reports, quantitative research with large datasets etc.
* They also roll me out to kiss babies sometimes (speak at conferences/media and shake hands with politicians)

EC: Director of Music working for National Defence for 9 years, part of that as a volunteer, but mostly paid at same level as a commissioned officer. (think college marching bands but military)

* Also organized military ceremonies/parades etc
* Taught and wrote custom orchestrations

CFA charterholder

,CATpreparation,"finally made a reddit acc after years of telling myself i would never do that, but here goes nothing. (long post ahead, sorry :/)

currently a final year economics student in du. 95/95/77 GNEF profile (77% in college till sem 4). appeared for cat23, scored 98.6 overall, fucked up quant hence missed a lot of colleges due to sectional cut off. VARC has been my strong foot since the beginning, hit 98+ sectional percentile in cat too. gave nmat and snap, score 99+ there as well, but didn't give interviews bec they were calling to their campus and i didn't want to go there anyway. 99+ in xat too.

only good calls i got were IIMK, XLRI, MDI. by good i mean the colleges that i was targeting, don't mean to belittle any institution at all. would've got SPJ call and probably could've converted too, but missed their form deadline. IIMA was my dream college (surprise surprise) but on the day of cat i knew that i wouldn't even get a watpi call. since ABC were out of the question, i spent the next 4 months (dec-march) dreaming of FMS. having been a delhi person all my life, i guess FMS would've worked out for me. i come from a little bit of a toxic family but im also insanely attached to them, and i guess i was dreaming of taking a hostel/pg near north campus, living the college student life (not clubbing partying daaru sutta etc, but just, little bit of independence), and also dropping by at home on the weekends. but as fate would have it, of course i missed fms cutoff too.

now little bit about the family, without wasting anybody's time, to sum them up in one word - controlling. my parents are extremely possessive of me (eldest daughter curse), and have never ever let me live my life. they've made all my decisions for me - 11th grade stream, grad subject, tbh even mba was their decision, i've just rolled with their preferences. but they've also never imposed anything on me, they just make it impossible for me to decide stuff for myself, they're very manipulative (e.g. we just fought a lot and my dad just came up to me and pat my back and said they only yell at me because im their daughter blabla). i know they're very toxic, they're a product of their own experiences, it's fine, have broken this down in therapy a lot hehe. 

in the past couple of months i have realised that i would really love to go to FMS. i don't know which specialisation i want to choose yet (and i think that's fine im 20 for gods sake ykwim), so i think going for a general mba, then choosing a specialisation in my second year would've been fine. also the pg/hostel arrangement would've been cool. also even though there's no financial problems as such, i know i come from a middle class family, and hence FMS also fits in that sense with its low fees. 

but since i've missed FMS this year, i really want to reappear for cat. 2023 was a very bad year for me mentally and emotionally and physically, TW!!SU!C!DE!! i almost unalived myself multiple times, but looking back, even with everything else going on in my life, i managed to score a 98 percentile in cat. i know i didn't prepare with everything i had, i know i didn't study as well and as much as i am capable of. also on the day of cat, i panicked. i know more now about how i should've prepared than i did when i was actually preparing. if nothing goes disastrously wrong over the next year, i know i can manage to score a higher percentile, and also fix my grad percentage. 

but the problem is my family. living with them is genuinely hell everyday. they make sure i know that they don't like having me around. if i take a drop this year, i will most probably ask my mom to get me a job in her company, and that's just, dreadful. also obviously the fact that there's no guarantee i will actually perform better next year, there's always the thought that i will fall terribly ill a week before cat (overthinking max). 

now from the calls i have, i do not want to consider MDI (again, only a personal preference). between XLRI and IIMK i would want to do the PGP at IIMK. but with 0 workex and &lt;99 percentile, my watpi call was already borderline i think, and on top of that my interview didn't go very well (stress interview i think, or the interviewer was just a meanie). so chances that i'll convert are low. XLRI on the other hand i think i will convert the PGDMHRM call. but i don't know if i want to go because i don't know if i want to do HR. also fees is relatively high and placements not that great.

(long post ahead, sorry :/)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;currently a final year economics student in du. 95/95/77 GNEF profile (77% in college till sem 4). appeared for cat23, scored 98.6 overall, fucked up quant hence missed a lot of colleges due to sectional cut off. VARC has been my strong foot since the beginning, hit 98+ sectional percentile in cat too. gave nmat and snap, score 99+ there as well, but didn&amp;#39;t give interviews bec they were calling to their campus and i didn&amp;#39;t want to go there anyway. 99+ in xat too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;only good calls i got were IIMK, XLRI, MDI. by good i mean the colleges that i was targeting, don&amp;#39;t mean to belittle any institution at all. would&amp;#39;ve got SPJ call and probably could&amp;#39;ve converted too, but missed their form deadline. IIMA was my dream college (surprise surprise) but on the day of cat i knew that i wouldn&amp;#39;t even get a watpi call. since ABC were out of the question, i spent the next 4 months (dec-march) dreaming of FMS. having been a delhi person all my life, i guess FMS would&amp;#39;ve worked out for me. i come from a little bit of a toxic family but im also insanely attached to them, and i guess i was dreaming of taking a hostel/pg near north campus, living the college student life (not clubbing partying daaru sutta etc, but just, little bit of independence), and also dropping by at home on the weekends. but as fate would have it, of course i missed fms cutoff too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now little bit about the family, without wasting anybody&amp;#39;s time, to sum them up in one word - controlling. my parents are extremely possessive of me (eldest daughter curse), and have never ever let me live my life. they&amp;#39;ve made all my decisions for me - 11th grade stream, grad subject, tbh even mba was their decision, i&amp;#39;ve just rolled with their preferences. but they&amp;#39;ve also never imposed anything on me, they just make it impossible for me to decide stuff for myself, they&amp;#39;re very manipulative (e.g. we just fought a lot and my dad just came up to me and pat my back and said they only yell at me because im their daughter blabla). i know they&amp;#39;re very toxic, they&amp;#39;re a product of their own experiences, it&amp;#39;s fine, have broken this down in therapy a lot hehe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in the past couple of months i have realised that i would really love to go to FMS. i don&amp;#39;t know which specialisation i want to choose yet (and i think that&amp;#39;s fine im 20 for gods sake ykwim), so i think going for a general mba, then choosing a specialisation in my second year would&amp;#39;ve been fine. also the pg/hostel arrangement would&amp;#39;ve been cool. also even though there&amp;#39;s no financial problems as such, i know i come from a middle class family, and hence FMS also fits in that sense with its low fees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but since i&amp;#39;ve missed FMS this year, i really want to reappear for cat. 2023 was a very bad year for me mentally and emotionally and physically, TW!!SU!C!DE!! i almost unalived myself multiple times, but looking back, even with everything else going on in my life, i managed to score a 98 percentile in cat. i know i didn&amp;#39;t prepare with everything i had, i know i didn&amp;#39;t study as well and as much as i am capable of. also on the day of cat, i panicked. i know more now about how i should&amp;#39;ve prepared than i did when i was actually preparing. if nothing goes disastrously wrong over the next year, i know i can manage to score a higher percentile, and also fix my grad percentage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but the problem is my family. living with them is genuinely hell everyday. they make sure i know that they don&amp;#39;t like having me around. if i take a drop this year, i will most probably ask my mom to get me a job in her company, and that&amp;#39;s just, dreadful. also obviously the fact that there&amp;#39;s no guarantee i will actually perform better next year, there&amp;#39;s always the thought that i will fall terribly ill a week before cat (overthinking max). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now from the calls i have, i do not want to consider MDI (again, only a personal preference). between XLRI and IIMK i would want to do the PGP at IIMK. but with 0 workex and &amp;lt;99 percentile, my watpi call was already borderline i think, and on top of that my interview didn&amp;#39;t go very well (stress interview i think, or the interviewer was just a meanie). so chances that i&amp;#39;ll convert are low. XLRI on the other hand i think i will convert the PGDMHRM call. but i don&amp;#39;t know if i want to go because i don&amp;#39;t know if i want to do HR. also fees is relatively high and placements not that great. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;personally for me, my first preference is taking a gap and reappearing next year. but with everything else in the picture, i don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s the best idea. my parents want an answer by tomorrow morning if i want to go to XLRI in case i don&amp;#39;t get the IIMK shortlist. i don&amp;#39;t even know how to tell them i might not go for IIMK this year either. super super stressed, would really love some advice on this. &lt;/p&gt;

,Veterans,"I left the military in June 2022. I spent 3 months unemployed. Finally hired into a good company with upward mobility.

Kellogg is M7, but thinking that Yale brand might pull more in Europe long-term. Also got into Tuck but am not thinking I'd go.

,FinancialCareers,"Hi! I am looking to transition into the finance industry. I think Corporate FP&amp;A will be the best fit as I am looking for a 40-50/hour a week position with good benefits and somewhat of a work/life balance. I currently work at a Big 3 Automotive OEM in Michigan as a Buyer. This position came to me during my MBA internship prior to graduation. 

My current company has recently done a TON of layoffs the past year which we anticipate more to come as everything is moving towards lower cost of labor countries. 

Previous to the current company I worked for, I experienced a voluntary layoff (buyout) from the largest Mortgage lender as an underwriter and was a loan officer prior to that. I don‚Äôt have any desire to work in sales again. I took the buyout because I was highest paid in my position with no upwards growth (a promotion would have given me  a pay cut with more hours). I was paid about $102,000 in this position. 40 hours, full benefits, standard PTO. I took the risk because I was 1/2 way through my MBA which my goal was to go into Finance hence why my concentration was in Finance.

,Bangkok,"Posted it as comment earlier but I wanted to show my appreciation to the larger group. 

The first time I visited Bangkok was right after completing my MBA, accompanied by a group of friends. Like many first-timers, our initial perception of the city was skewed towards its reputation for sex tourism, seeking avenues of ‚Äúdebauchery‚Äù that some foreigners glorify and exaggerate. As a group of guys, our focus leaned more towards alcohol, drugs, and partying rather than exploring other aspects of the country. However, Krabi and its neighboring islands left a lasting impression on me during this trip, and as I stood in the immigration line at Suvarnabhumi on my way back to the chaos of Mumbai, I knew I would return.

The second visit was a different story, guided by my wife, who possesses a knack for uncovering hidden gems. She insisted that we explore Bangkok, Krabi, Phuket, and beyond as we would explore our own country. It was during this trip that Thailand truly opened up to me in ways I had never experienced before.

Focusing solely on Bangkok, I have nothing but amazing things to say, although my admiration extends to the rest of Thailand as well.

1.	‚Å†The BTS/MRT connectivity is a marvel. Coming from India, where public infrastructure is severely lacking, I deeply appreciate how easy it is to navigate Bangkok using the BTS/MRT network. With the addition of new lines like the yellow line, it continues to improve. Moreover, the attention to detail in some of the metro stations, such as direct entrances to malls, stations disguised as art houses, and the presence of supermarkets and boutique bakeries, showcases a level of variety that I have yet to encounter elsewhere in the world.
2.	‚Å†The hospitality and affordability of Thailand are exceptional. For just INR 4500 ($55), we could book a suite at the Siam Heritage Hotel during the off-season, situated beautifully in the heart of the Silom district. Every visit to shopping destinations like Chatuchak and MBK fills us with the excitement of children in a candy store.
3.	‚Å†Thai cuisine is simply delightful! Pad Krapao Moo holds the title of my favorite Thai dish, and I‚Äôve attempted to replicate it multiple times at home. Thai street food alone could sustain me for a lifetime.
4.	‚Å†The culture of night markets, especially those on the outskirts like Srinakarin Train Night Market and Owl Market, was a foreign concept to me initially. However, I now deeply appreciate how Thais embrace outdoor gatherings with family and friends for shopping, dining, and entertainment. There‚Äôs an inherent positivity in the way night markets serve as hubs for local communities to come together.
5.	‚Å†7/11s are gradually becoming our favorite hangout spots post-2am. My wife and I occasionally embark on ‚ÄúToastie runs,‚Äù aiming to sample as many different toasties as we can from various 7/11s across the city.
6.	‚Å†Areas like Phranakorn and Talad Noi, situated just outside downtown and Chinatown, serve as reminders to slow down, take a deep breath, and appreciate the art and architecture of a Bangkok that remains rooted in its heritage.

All in all, what I think I love the most is that the Thais have managed to figure out a way of life where they didn‚Äôt have to completely change to pander to farangs and their needs, instead it is the farangs that have had the privilege to come here and be allowed to seamlessly integrate themselves in the way that Thais live.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I visited Bangkok was right after completing my MBA, accompanied by a group of friends.

As a group of guys, our focus leaned more towards alcohol, drugs, and partying rather than exploring other aspects of the country.

,Accounting,"Hi everyone, 

I just joined because I had a career question. I graduated with a BBA in finance, but want to pursue a BBA in accounting. I just recently landed a job with a company as a Junior Accountant and I feel I need more education under my belt.

I always wanted to study accounting but gave up too early and folded to getting a degree in finance instead which in hindsight wasn‚Äôt the best choice. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I don‚Äôt regret it one bit, but I‚Äôm seeing how a degree in accounting would have been far more beneficial.

What would my next steps be? Would some of my credits transfer and it would mean less class to get the degree? Should I consider just going for an MBA and getting accounting certifications? 

I would like to at some point start working on getting a CPA.

,Advice,"Hello everyone, i am M(29) working in Delhi in one of the multi national banks in india. 

I have completed MBA in finance and marketing in 2019. Then i worked in IT company for about a year and then shifted to banking industry. 

I have successfully completed 3 years in banking industry. 

I have realised getting into banking industry was my biggest mistake. I am convinced i am not born to sales. I have always been good in technical stuff and always wanted to pursue something in it.  

Now i am finding it really hard to enter into corporate as the skill set required are not enough as i am from banking industry. 

Many a times my resume got rejected saying i am from banking industry. 

I am really confused at this age as I don‚Äôt have stability at all. 

I am getting bad feeling from my boss as i could not perform well w.r.t sales target in jan feb mar (jfm) 

I have been thinking to pursue what i am good at. 

I have been always interested in data science field and find myself suitable for it. 

I am soon going to start course and will be spending 8-10 months on the course. 

In the meanwhile I don‚Äôt want to stick to the company I am currently working in. 

Corporates are not accepting interviews and banks are welcoming me but again it‚Äôs the sales job only. 

Plus i have been to myself since few months deep thinking and not sharing anything with parents as i feel they will be burdened by my miseries. 

I feel alone, clueless and helpless at this point of time. 

Can somebody help and streamline thoughts for me ?

Please be gentle on your thoughts as i am already overwhelmed with situation right now.

,Optionmillionaires,"Many are still trying to make sense of the disaster that struck Baltimore early on Tuesday, when the 1.6-mile-long Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed in the middle of the night. The 95,000-ton container ship Dali, chartered by Maersk (OTCPK:AMKBY), collided with one of the support columns following a last-minute distress call, sending eight workers atop the bridge into the water (two were rescued and six are presumed dead). Responding to the catastrophe, President Biden has called for the federal government to pick up the tab for the reconstruction of the Key Bridge, though that could take years and will require Congressional approval.

What happened? An investigation is ongoing, but videos show the cargo ship's lights turning off - and then on again - shortly before it struck the bridge. Power to the Dali was said to have gone out shortly after it left the Port of Baltimore, including to the ship's engines, possibly due to a failure of machinery aboard the vessel (black smoke?). While emergency generators eventually kicked the lights on, the renewed power likely didn't impact the ship's propulsion or steering gear. An inspection in Chile last June even identified a problem with the Dali's ""propulsion and auxiliary machinery,"" but the most recent examination conducted by the U.S. Coast Guard in September didn't find any deficiencies.

The supply chain is the most talked-about consequence for the economy, with shipping traffic suspended until further notice. Baltimore is one of the busiest ports on the U.S. East Coast, and the rerouting of cargo will create delays and raise costs at a time when consumers and policymakers alike are sensitive to inflation. It will also add to the recent disruptions on the high seas, including increased congestion in the Panama Canal and attacks in the Red Sea that have forced traffic around the tip of Africa.

Immediate impacts: Coal exporter Consol Energy (CEIX) slid 7% yesterday in response to the indefinite shuttering of the Port of Baltimore. The company's operations are said to be highly connected to its Marine Terminal at the port, which represents over a quarter of all U.S. seaborne coal exports. Recent data also indicates that 850K cars and light trucks pass through Baltimore each year, more than at any other U.S. port, prompting Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) to comment on the possible impacts facing the American auto industry.

Paper into cash?
Following a stellar market debut, Trump Media &amp; Technology (DJT) is still rallying on Wednesday, although the firm's near $8B valuation seems excessive as it has never turned a profit. There are also risks of its biggest shareholder, Donald Trump, cashing in on the paper gains despite a six-month lock-up period. While his 60% stake is valued at around $5B, the former president is facing some big legal bills and his son and former officials of his administration sit on the company board. Trump could also seek to use his DJT stake as collateral to get a loan, although chances of securing funds this way are likely low. (17 comments)

Retirement crisis
As people live longer lives, BlackRock (BLK) Chairman Larry Fink is warning that the world is at risk of facing a retirement crisis. ""What if the government and the private sector treated 60+ year-olds as late-career workers with much to offer rather than people who should retire?"" he asked in his annual letter to investors. Fink also called on policymakers and investment firms to make retirement investing ""more automatic"" for workers, noting that building savings has never been more urgent. ""When people are regularly living past 90, what should the average retirement age be?"" (5 comments)

The ban that wasn't
Raising questions about the fate of similar efforts, the city of Berkeley, California, has agreed to drop the first-ever U.S. natural gas ban following a settlement deal with the California Restaurant Association. ""Climate change must be addressed, but piecemeal policies at the local level, which are preempted by federal energy laws, are not the answer,"" said CRA President Jot Condie. Environmental advocates say the court decision and Berkeley's repeal only mark the end of a chapter, and may open the door for more durable strategies to phase out fossil fuels. (47 comments)

,careeradvice,"I (19)am a final year student. My majors is in economics and minors in psychology and environmental science. Recently I have come to know that economics is not something I want to continue further. So Last year, I decided to do an MBA bcz I didn't know what exactly I want to do in my life. In India, there are a few exams one has to clarify for MBA, so I started preparing for it. I started studying since my maths is very weak. 

But around 2 weeks ago, one of my professors advised me to do pursue masters in my field then do an MBA. So I thought about going further with psychology and work for a few years and then do an MBA. I studied 2-3 chapters of it and found it somewhat interesting. I have filled forms for entrance exams of the top 2 universities which offer masters in psychology.  

I thought that if I won't clear entrance exams, I will do the data analytics course and will do a part-time job. 

Today, my other professor said to me that if after a few years, I will do MBA then I should do it now rather than changing my field or waste a few years. 

One of my friends keep telling me how everyone's jobs will be taken away by AI and automation. It makes me so stressed.

Now I am very confused. Tbh, I don't know what to do exactly with my life. What field I should get in. I don't know if I can clear entrance exams of psychology or should I study for CAT.

I am leaning more towards core company as it's offering good CTC , WFH and the learning curve. I tried the counter offer with BIG 4 but they are not budging on the pay and RTO is hybrid.

My question here is does it affect my chances getting into an good MBA program if I choose Core Company over the BIG 4? I already worked in one of the Big 4's, feel like one is enough.

,Daytrading,"**ANALYSIS:**

* Yesterday we saw SPX trading extremely rangebound all day, from 5225 to 5234, until the end of the day, when in the last 45 minutes, we saw 3 big red candlesticks, and SPX suddenly closed at 5203.
* We see that here below:
* [https://imgur.com/a/gsG42U8](https://imgur.com/a/gsG42U8) 
* Now the short of it, is that NVDA sold off from 950 to 925 at the end of the day yesterday, which dragged the market with it. However, that's not really the full explanation. Why did NVDA sell off like that and what was the market mechanism behind it?
* To understand that, let's fully understand what we mean when we talk about skew. Skew tracks the ratio of the IV of Calls to the IV of Puts to give us an indication of trader sentiment. It's a very useful indicator.
* What does it mean when skew is lowering, as we see happening in NVDA over last few days:
* [https://imgur.com/a/i1V6Ghm](https://imgur.com/a/i1V6Ghm) 
* When Skew is lowering, it means that either the IV of calls is decreasing, or the IV in puts is increasing.
* Because IV in calls was reducing in this case, it implied some short term downward pressure as it means that traders are lowering their exposure to the stock. In this case, because IV in call options OTM was lowering, but traders remain short vol, This meant market makers removed liquidity at the end of the day to hedge, once NVDA started dropping. When market makers remove liquidity, thats when we see downward movement.
* This is what accelerated the sell off EOD to being a bit of a flush out.
* Now is it a problem?
* Not really. Traders remain very short vol. We saw vix jump, but it has now since sold off the gains pretty much. Because VIX remained low and is being shorted the shit out of, once it started to drop, market makers bought the dip again, and we see that in premarket we are back to 5225.
* [https://imgur.com/a/OSVWwj6](https://imgur.com/a/OSVWwj6) 
* Regarding NVDA, positioning overall is bullish. But we do see IV in call options continue to lwoer as we see traders selling calls. This we can attribute to profit taking as not seeing massive OTM put gamma.
* Gamma wall at 900 is still the support, and one at 920 before that and 950 has v high Delta on it so that's the wall to break to move higher towards 1000. Target in med term is still 1000 as positioning still bullish but with skew pointing lower towards profit taking we can see bit of volatility in the low 900 range.
* Oil we saw headed lower as skew was pointing lwoer as was the crack spreads, but it holds the 80 level. Staying above 80 WTI is key as it will maintain the bullishness and liquidity. Below this we can see further volatility increase.
* Gold positioning extremely bullish. 
* Markets are still v bullish. Not much signs of stress in the market. Just look at the European markets. GER40 is flying, every day just keeps increasing. This is a clear sign that markets are seeing low stress. 
* Traders continue to be very short volatility. This means that any VIX spikes we do get are likely to be sold off quickly as market makers will increase liquidity. This makes it much more likely for dips to be bought quickly.
* I don‚Äôt see much cause for concern on PCE, yes we can see dollar increase from FX side, but traders in equity market are pricing hotter inflation in near term before it levels out in the longer term. That‚Äôs probably what we will see. 
* Chinese market looks volatile, that‚Äôs the only thing, but has strong support at 16k. 

**DATA LEDE:**

* 01:30 Australia CPI index: Came in line with last month, slightly below the expectations for it to tick up slightly from 3.4% to 3.5%
* Came in at 3.4% YOY
* Spain inflation rate preliminary reading for March:
* YOY at 3.2% in line with expectations, slightly higher than 2.8% last month
* MOM comes slightly hot at 0.8%, vs forecast of 0.6%  
 
* Note core came in lower than expected. 
* This isn‚Äôt really surprising. Forward inflation swaps in US is already pricing in a hot CPI next month for US, so we expect similar in Europe. 
* 10:00 Eurozone Economic Sentiment (Mar)
* Comes in line with expectations at 96.3. Improved economic sentiment vs last month, as hopes of ECB rate cut rise. 
* 11:00 US MBA Mortgage Apps
* 23:50 BOJ Summary of Opinions from BOJ meeting - expect more dovishness after their first hike in a decade was v dovish. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

**MARKETS:**

* SPX: Recovered after yesterdays little end of day sell off, which took us to 5203. Almost imemdiate recovery as VIX got crushed again, and fuelled further by European session.

* DJI: Trading at 39500. Pushing up slightly in premarket. 
* GER40: Approaches 18500, up 0.6% again today. 
* Hong Kong market down 1%, trading at 16400. Has been unable to recover the uptrend which it dropped out of since this week. Trading quite flat. Support is at 16000. Skew points more negative so can see more pressure. 
* CHINA50: consolidating around the 12k level. Very sideways movement this month. Also down, but less so than HKG
* JPN225 was higher initially as yen fell but then lowered as we saw Yen recover on FX intervention talks.
* OIL: Lower, back at near 80. Holds this level and pushes slightly higher. 
* GOLD: Higher again, up 0.95% back to 2200. Bullishness on gold remains very strong in the positioning data.

* Yen now at 151.2
* Dollar flat to slightly higher.

 EURUSD holds the 1.08 level.

&lt;li&gt;Markets are still v bullish. Not much signs of stress in the market. Just look at the European markets. GER40 is flying, every day just keeps increasing. This is a clear sign that markets are seeing low stress. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traders continue to be very short volatility. This means that any VIX spikes we do get are likely to be sold off quickly as market makers will increase liquidity. This makes it much more likely for dips to be bought quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don‚Äôt see much cause for concern on PCE, yes we can see dollar increase from FX side, but traders in equity market are pricing hotter inflation in near term before it levels out in the longer term. That‚Äôs probably what we will see. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chinese market looks volatile, that‚Äôs the only thing, but has strong support at 16k. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DATA LEDE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;01:30 Australia CPI index: Came in line with last month, slightly below the expectations for it to tick up slightly from 3.4% to 3.5%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Came in at 3.4% YOY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spain inflation rate preliminary reading for March:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YOY at 3.2% in line with expectations, slightly higher than 2.8% last month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOM comes slightly hot at 0.8%, vs forecast of 0.6%  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note core came in lower than expected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn‚Äôt really surprising. Forward inflation swaps in US is already pricing in a hot CPI next month for US, so we expect similar in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;10:00 Eurozone Economic Sentiment (Mar)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comes in line with expectations at 96.3. Improved economic sentiment vs last month, as hopes of ECB rate cut rise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

**ANALYSIS:**

* I‚Äôll start with the post I made on what happened end of day yesterday and what it means for NVDA which led the sell off yesterday. I incldue more commentary on other things below this:‚Äù 
* Yesterday we saw SPX trading extremely rangebound all day, from 5225 to 5234, until the end of the day, when in the last 45 minutes, we saw 3 big red candlesticks, and SPX suddenly closed at 5203.
* We see that here below:
* [https://imgur.com/a/gsG42U8](https://imgur.com/a/gsG42U8) 
* Now the short of it, is that NVDA sold off from 950 to 925 at the end of the day yesterday, which dragged the market with it. However, that's not really the full explanation. Why did NVDA sell off like that and what was the market mechanism behind it?
* To understand that, let's fully understand what we mean when we talk about skew, which I talk about a lot on this channel. Skew tracks the ratio of the IV of Calls to the IV of Puts to give us an indication of trader sentiment. It's a very useful indicator.
* What does it mean when skew is lowering, as we see happening in NVDA over last few days:
* [https://imgur.com/a/i1V6Ghm](https://imgur.com/a/i1V6Ghm) 
* When Skew is lowering, it means that either the IV of calls is decreasing, or the IV in puts is increasing.
* Because IV in calls was reducing in this case, it implied some short term downward pressure as it means that traders are lowering their exposure to the stock. In this case, because IV in call options OTM was lowering, but traders remain short vol, This meant market makers removed liquidity at the end of the day to hedge, once NVDA started dropping. When market makers remove liquidity, thats when we see downward movement.
* This is what accelerated the sell off EOD to being a bit of a flush out.
* We had mentioned in our post on the subreddit a few days ago that it did look like there could be some profit taking in NVDA because the skew was pointing lower. This is basically what we saw. 950 is a bit delta wall, so it makes sense it got rejected from there.
* [https://imgur.com/a/u40uy5D](https://imgur.com/a/u40uy5D)
* Now is it a problem?
* Not really. Traders remain very short vol. We saw vix jump, but it has now since sold off the gains pretty much. Because VIX remained low and is being shorted the shit out of, once it started to drop, market makers bought the dip again, and we see that in premarket we are back to 5225.
* [https://imgur.com/a/OSVWwj6](https://imgur.com/a/OSVWwj6) 
* Regarding NVDA, as mentioned in the last post, positioning overall is bullish. But we do see IV in call options continue to lwoer as we see traders selling calls. This we can attribute to profit taking as not seeing massive OTM put gamma.
* Gamma wall at 900 is still the support, and one at 920 before that and 950 has v high Delta on it so that's the wall to break to move higher towards 1000. Target in med term is still 1000 as positioning still bullish but with skew pointing lower towards profit taking we can see bit of volatility in the low 900 range.
* Oil we saw headed lower as skew was pointing lwoer as was the crack spreads, but it holds the 80 level. Staying above 80 WTI is key as it will maintain the bullishness and liquidity. Below this we can see further volatility increase.
* Gold positioning extremely bullish. 
* Markets are still v bullish. Not much signs of stress in the market. Just look at the European markets. GER40 is flying, every day just keeps increasing. This is a clear sign that markets are seeing low stress. 
* Traders continue to be very short volatility. This means that any VIX spikes we do get are likely to be sold off quickly as market makers will increase liquidity. This makes it much more likely for dips to be bought quickly.
* I don‚Äôt see much cause for concern on PCE, yes we can see dollar increase from FX side, but traders in equity market are pricing hotter inflation in near term before it levels out in the longer term. That‚Äôs probably what we will see. 
* Chinese market looks volatile, that‚Äôs the only thing, but has strong support at 16k.

&lt;li&gt;I‚Äôll start with the post I made on what happened end of day yesterday and what it means for NVDA which led the sell off yesterday. I incldue more commentary on other things below this:‚Äù &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yesterday we saw SPX trading extremely rangebound all day, from 5225 to 5234, until the end of the day, when in the last 45 minutes, we saw 3 big red candlesticks, and SPX suddenly closed at 5203.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We see that here below:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/gsG42U8""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/gsG42U8&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now the short of it, is that NVDA sold off from 950 to 925 at the end of the day yesterday, which dragged the market with it. However, that&amp;#39;s not really the full explanation. Why did NVDA sell off like that and what was the market mechanism behind it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To understand that, let&amp;#39;s fully understand what we mean when we talk about skew, which I talk about a lot on this channel. Skew tracks the ratio of the IV of Calls to the IV of Puts to give us an indication of trader sentiment. It&amp;#39;s a very useful indicator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does it mean when skew is lowering, as we see happening in NVDA over last few days:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/i1V6Ghm""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/i1V6Ghm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Skew is lowering, it means that either the IV of calls is decreasing, or the IV in puts is increasing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because IV in calls was reducing in this case, it implied some short term downward pressure as it means that traders are lowering their exposure to the stock. In this case, because IV in call options OTM was lowering, but traders remain short vol, This meant market makers removed liquidity at the end of the day to hedge, once NVDA started dropping. When market makers remove liquidity, thats when we see downward movement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is what accelerated the sell off EOD to being a bit of a flush out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had mentioned in our post on the subreddit a few days ago that it did look like there could be some profit taking in NVDA because the skew was pointing lower. This is basically what we saw. 950 is a bit delta wall, so it makes sense it got rejected from there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/u40uy5D""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/u40uy5D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now is it a problem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not really. Traders remain very short vol. We saw vix jump, but it has now since sold off the gains pretty much. Because VIX remained low and is being shorted the shit out of, once it started to drop, market makers bought the dip again, and we see that in premarket we are back to 5225.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/OSVWwj6""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/OSVWwj6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regarding NVDA, as mentioned in the last post, positioning overall is bullish. But we do see IV in call options continue to lwoer as we see traders selling calls. This we can attribute to profit taking as not seeing massive OTM put gamma.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gamma wall at 900 is still the support, and one at 920 before that and 950 has v high Delta on it so that&amp;#39;s the wall to break to move higher towards 1000. Target in med term is still 1000 as positioning still bullish but with skew pointing lower towards profit taking we can see bit of volatility in the low 900 range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oil we saw headed lower as skew was pointing lwoer as was the crack spreads, but it holds the 80 level. Staying above 80 WTI is key as it will maintain the bullishness and liquidity. Below this we can see further volatility increase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gold positioning extremely bullish. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Markets are still v bullish. Not much signs of stress in the market. Just look at the European markets. GER40 is flying, every day just keeps increasing. This is a clear sign that markets are seeing low stress. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traders continue to be very short volatility. This means that any VIX spikes we do get are likely to be sold off quickly as market makers will increase liquidity. This makes it much more likely for dips to be bought quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don‚Äôt see much cause for concern on PCE, yes we can see dollar increase from FX side, but traders in equity market are pricing hotter inflation in near term before it levels out in the longer term. That‚Äôs probably what we will see. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chinese market looks volatile, that‚Äôs the only thing, but has strong support at 16k. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DATA LEDE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;01:30 Australia CPI index: Came in line with last month, slightly below the expectations for it to tick up slightly from 3.4% to 3.5%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Came in at 3.4% YOY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spain inflation rate preliminary reading for March:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YOY at 3.2% in line with expectations, slightly higher than 2.8% last month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOM comes slightly hot at 0.8%, vs forecast of 0.6%  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note core came in lower than expected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn‚Äôt really surprising. Forward inflation swaps in US is already pricing in a hot CPI next month for US, so we expect similar in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;10:00 Eurozone Economic Sentiment (Mar)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comes in line with expectations at 96.3. Improved economic sentiment vs last month, as hopes of ECB rate cut rise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;11:00 US MBA Mortgage Apps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;23:50 BOJ Summary of Opinions from BOJ meeting - expect more dovishness after their first hike in a decade was v dovish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARKETS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SPX: Recovered after yesterdays little end of day sell off, which took us to 5203. Almost imemdiate recovery as VIX got crushed again, and fuelled further by European session. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NDX: Similar picture, dropped to 18200 yesterday, but now recovered back to 18,308&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DJI: Trading at 39500. Pushing up slightly in premarket. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GER40: Approaches 18500, up 0.6% again today. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hong Kong market down 1%, trading at 16400. Has been unable to recover the uptrend which it dropped out of since this week. Trading quite flat. Support is at 16000. Skew points more negative so can see more pressure. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CHINA50: consolidating around the 12k level. Very sideways movement this month. Also down, but less so than HKG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JPN225 was higher initially as yen fell but then lowered as we saw Yen recover on FX intervention talks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OIL: Lower, back at near 80. Holds this level and pushes slightly higher. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GOLD: Higher again, up 0.95% back to 2200. Bullishness on gold remains very strong in the positioning data. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INSTITUTIONAL:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It‚Äôs quarter end and pensions funds may need to sell roughly $22 billion in global stocks and buy $17 billion of fixed income in order to return to prior asset allocation levels, according to an earlier estimate from Morgan Stanley.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FX:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swiss franc lower despite positive survey data from the ZEW survey. Showed that Swiss investors are optimistic about the economic outlook. Increase in sentiment for 2nd month in a row. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yen jumps after hitting all time low at 151.97 as increased speculation of FX intervention. This is the key FX news. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yen now at 151.2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dollar flat to slightly higher. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AUDUSD lower as China session sell off. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CHFUSD approaches 1.10&lt;br/&gt;
EURUSD holds the 1.08 level. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GBPUSD pushes higher to 1.264&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

**ANALYSIS:**

* I‚Äôll start with the post I made on what happened end of day yesterday and what it means for NVDA which led the sell off yesterday. I incldue more commentary on other things below this:‚Äù 
* Yesterday we saw SPX trading extremely rangebound all day, from 5225 to 5234, until the end of the day, when in the last 45 minutes, we saw 3 big red candlesticks, and SPX suddenly closed at 5203.
* We see that here below:
* [https://imgur.com/a/gsG42U8](https://imgur.com/a/gsG42U8) 
* Now the short of it, is that NVDA sold off from 950 to 925 at the end of the day yesterday, which dragged the market with it. However, that's not really the full explanation. Why did NVDA sell off like that and what was the market mechanism behind it?
* To understand that, let's fully understand what we mean when we talk about skew, which I talk about a lot on this channel. Skew tracks the ratio of the IV of Calls to the IV of Puts to give us an indication of trader sentiment. It's a very useful indicator.
* What does it mean when skew is lowering, as we see happening in NVDA over last few days:
* [https://imgur.com/a/i1V6Ghm](https://imgur.com/a/i1V6Ghm) 
* When Skew is lowering, it means that either the IV of calls is decreasing, or the IV in puts is increasing.
* Because IV in calls was reducing in this case, it implied some short term downward pressure as it means that traders are lowering their exposure to the stock. In this case, because IV in call options OTM was lowering, but traders remain short vol, This meant market makers removed liquidity at the end of the day to hedge, once NVDA started dropping. When market makers remove liquidity, thats when we see downward movement.
* This is what accelerated the sell off EOD to being a bit of a flush out.
* We had mentioned in our post on the subreddit a few days ago that it did look like there could be some profit taking in NVDA because the skew was pointing lower. This is basically what we saw. 950 is a bit delta wall, so it makes sense it got rejected from there.
* [https://imgur.com/a/u40uy5D](https://imgur.com/a/u40uy5D)
* Now is it a problem?
* Not really. Traders remain very short vol. We saw vix jump, but it has now since sold off the gains pretty much. Because VIX remained low and is being shorted the shit out of, once it started to drop, market makers bought the dip again, and we see that in premarket we are back to 5225.
* [https://imgur.com/a/OSVWwj6](https://imgur.com/a/OSVWwj6) 
* Regarding NVDA, as mentioned in the last post, positioning overall is bullish. But we do see IV in call options continue to lwoer as we see traders selling calls. This we can attribute to profit taking as not seeing massive OTM put gamma.
* Gamma wall at 900 is still the support, and one at 920 before that and 950 has v high Delta on it so that's the wall to break to move higher towards 1000. Target in med term is still 1000 as positioning still bullish but with skew pointing lower towards profit taking we can see bit of volatility in the low 900 range.
* Oil we saw headed lower as skew was pointing lwoer as was the crack spreads, but it holds the 80 level. Staying above 80 WTI is key as it will maintain the bullishness and liquidity. Below this we can see further volatility increase.
* Gold positioning extremely bullish. 
* Markets are still v bullish. Not much signs of stress in the market. Just look at the European markets. GER40 is flying, every day just keeps increasing. This is a clear sign that markets are seeing low stress. 
* Traders continue to be very short volatility. This means that any VIX spikes we do get are likely to be sold off quickly as market makers will increase liquidity. This makes it much more likely for dips to be bought quickly.
* I don‚Äôt see much cause for concern on PCE, yes we can see dollar increase from FX side, but traders in equity market are pricing hotter inflation in near term before it levels out in the longer term. That‚Äôs probably what we will see. 
* Chinese market looks volatile, that‚Äôs the only thing, but has strong support at 16k. 

**DATA LEDE:**

* 01:30 Australia CPI index: Came in line with last month, slightly below the expectations for it to tick up slightly from 3.4% to 3.5%
* Came in at 3.4% YOY
* Spain inflation rate preliminary reading for March:
* YOY at 3.2% in line with expectations, slightly higher than 2.8% last month
* MOM comes slightly hot at 0.8%, vs forecast of 0.6%  
 
* Note core came in lower than expected. 
* This isn‚Äôt really surprising. Forward inflation swaps in US is already pricing in a hot CPI next month for US, so we expect similar in Europe. 
* 10:00 Eurozone Economic Sentiment (Mar)
* Comes in line with expectations at 96.3. Improved economic sentiment vs last month, as hopes of ECB rate cut rise. 
* 11:00 US MBA Mortgage Apps
* 23:50 BOJ Summary of Opinions from BOJ meeting - expect more dovishness after their first hike in a decade was v dovish.

,TradingEdge,"**ANALYSIS:**

* I‚Äôll start with the post I made on what happened end of day yesterday and what it means for NVDA which led the sell off yesterday. I incldue more commentary on other things below this:‚Äù 
* Yesterday we saw SPX trading extremely rangebound all day, from 5225 to 5234, until the end of the day, when in the last 45 minutes, we saw 3 big red candlesticks, and SPX suddenly closed at 5203.
* We see that here below:
* [https://imgur.com/a/gsG42U8](https://imgur.com/a/gsG42U8) 
* Now the short of it, is that NVDA sold off from 950 to 925 at the end of the day yesterday, which dragged the market with it. However, that's not really the full explanation. Why did NVDA sell off like that and what was the market mechanism behind it?
* To understand that, let's fully understand what we mean when we talk about skew, which I talk about a lot on this channel. Skew tracks the ratio of the IV of Calls to the IV of Puts to give us an indication of trader sentiment. It's a very useful indicator.
* What does it mean when skew is lowering, as we see happening in NVDA over last few days:
* [https://imgur.com/a/i1V6Ghm](https://imgur.com/a/i1V6Ghm) 
* When Skew is lowering, it means that either the IV of calls is decreasing, or the IV in puts is increasing.
* Because IV in calls was reducing in this case, it implied some short term downward pressure as it means that traders are lowering their exposure to the stock. In this case, because IV in call options OTM was lowering, but traders remain short vol, This meant market makers removed liquidity at the end of the day to hedge, once NVDA started dropping. When market makers remove liquidity, thats when we see downward movement.
* This is what accelerated the sell off EOD to being a bit of a flush out.
* We had mentioned in our post on the subreddit a few days ago that it did look like there could be some profit taking in NVDA because the skew was pointing lower. This is basically what we saw. 950 is a bit delta wall, so it makes sense it got rejected from there.
* [https://imgur.com/a/u40uy5D](https://imgur.com/a/u40uy5D)
* Now is it a problem?
* Not really. Traders remain very short vol. We saw vix jump, but it has now since sold off the gains pretty much. Because VIX remained low and is being shorted the shit out of, once it started to drop, market makers bought the dip again, and we see that in premarket we are back to 5225.
* [https://imgur.com/a/OSVWwj6](https://imgur.com/a/OSVWwj6) 
* Regarding NVDA, as mentioned in the last post, positioning overall is bullish. But we do see IV in call options continue to lwoer as we see traders selling calls. This we can attribute to profit taking as not seeing massive OTM put gamma.
* Gamma wall at 900 is still the support, and one at 920 before that and 950 has v high Delta on it so that's the wall to break to move higher towards 1000. Target in med term is still 1000 as positioning still bullish but with skew pointing lower towards profit taking we can see bit of volatility in the low 900 range.
* Oil we saw headed lower as skew was pointing lwoer as was the crack spreads, but it holds the 80 level. Staying above 80 WTI is key as it will maintain the bullishness and liquidity. Below this we can see further volatility increase.
* Gold positioning extremely bullish. 
* Markets are still v bullish. Not much signs of stress in the market. Just look at the European markets. GER40 is flying, every day just keeps increasing. This is a clear sign that markets are seeing low stress. 
* Traders continue to be very short volatility. This means that any VIX spikes we do get are likely to be sold off quickly as market makers will increase liquidity. This makes it much more likely for dips to be bought quickly.
* I don‚Äôt see much cause for concern on PCE, yes we can see dollar increase from FX side, but traders in equity market are pricing hotter inflation in near term before it levels out in the longer term. That‚Äôs probably what we will see. 
* Chinese market looks volatile, that‚Äôs the only thing, but has strong support at 16k. 

**DATA LEDE:**

* 01:30 Australia CPI index: Came in line with last month, slightly below the expectations for it to tick up slightly from 3.4% to 3.5%

* Spain inflation rate preliminary reading for March:
* YOY at 3.2% in line with expectations, slightly higher than 2.8% last month
* MOM comes slightly hot at 0.8%, vs forecast of 0.6%  
 
* Note core came in lower than expected. 
* This isn‚Äôt really surprising. Forward inflation swaps in US is already pricing in a hot CPI next month for US, so we expect similar in Europe. 
* 10:00 Eurozone Economic Sentiment (Mar)
* Comes in line with expectations at 96.3. Improved economic sentiment vs last month, as hopes of ECB rate cut rise. 
* 11:00 US MBA Mortgage Apps
* 23:50 BOJ Summary of Opinions from BOJ meeting - expect more dovishness after their first hike in a decade was v dovish.

At my present company I'm working directly with the AVP and the CEO and I got told that should i choose to stay, i can take up marketing and brand building for the HR department, something they want to do already. My current company also has an amazing work culture. Moreover, i want to pursue MBA in the next year and my boss already knows that. He even mentioned should i choose to stay, he as well as the CEO and other business leaders can provide me with stellar recommendation letters as they are all from top tier universities themselves.

For pursuing a career in healthcare management or related fields like healthcare administration, you may consider institutions that offer programs such as Master of Hospital Administration (MHA), Master of Healthcare Administration (MHA), or Master of Business Administration (MBA) with a focus on healthcare management.

In Bangalore, there are several reputed institutions and universities offering such programs, including Indian Institute of Management Bangalore (IIMB), Symbiosis Institute of Health Sciences (SIHS), Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE), [International Institute of Business Studies(IIBS)](https://www.iibs.edu.in/) and others.

I would really appreciate any heads-up, warnings, advices or stuff this MBA community can offer.

Is UK a good option? Are there universities that I should stay away from? What would be the recruitment situation like owing to my background? What are the pros and cons like? What is the career culture like?

Over the past year or so, I have been mulling over doing a course abroad, specifically a sports MBA in Germany(open to other countries as well, just that the tuition was less there, open to other suggestions if any) I have been very much interested to explore that side of things as I have always been passionate about football. But I have great qualms about switching from a good high paying tech job to something that is completely a different path, is it a risk worth taking? Switching from an IT background to something specific in Sports is definitely a big career switch and it looks scary, and I heard Visa approval would be difficult as you tend to age.

,MacbookAirM2,"**MBA M2, 13'', 8 GB, Sonoma**

Recently I am having the following issue: I work with an external monitor and everything is fine. But from time to time I have to disconnect it and move somewhere else in my apartment to work only on my laptop without any external device connected to it. Every time I disconnect the external monitor and use ""Mission Control"" to switch between apps, the apps windows are extremely small and almost not visible.

This issue is persistent, just the size of the icons varies. Two days ago I had the issue that the windows of the opened applications were disappearing completely in the background with Mission Control, as if I had an empty desktop.

Here is an example: [https://ibb.co/FWqmgpb](https://ibb.co/FWqmgpb)

I googled everywhere but couldn't find any solution. Does someone know why this happens and how to fix it?

Restarting my MacbookAir solves the issue, but this is not a real long term solution.

,careerguidance,"Hi I'm currently a final year Bachelor Landscape Architecture student at RMIT. I'm trying to work out what would be the best pathway for me to choose after I finish my undergrad. 

In terms of career focuses and what I type of work I would like to do in the future, mainly revolves around Masterplanning and Urban Design, I enjoy both the design and policy side of the work but if I had to choose I would pick the design side. Essentially a position/career that revolves around developing masterplans is something I work towards.

I came up with the options below:

1. Masters Landscape Architecture (any accredited degree) study full time, find part time industry related work, and work two years after graduating to become a registered landscape architect.
2. Masters Urban/Town Planning (any accredited degree) study full time along side part time work + two years full time work to become a registered planner.
3. Double Masters Landscape &amp; Urban Planning (offered only at Unimelb and University of South Australia) + part time work + additional 4 years (2 yrs landscape and 2yrs planning) become registered planner and landscape architect.
4. Any of the above but instead study part time and work full time until I'm registered.
5. A different degree such as Project Managment or MBA? (I've seen a few people do this) and become registered after 8yrs full time work experience.
6. Dont do a post grad degree and just work.

So you've taken the plunge (and conquered the GMAT!) ‚Äì congrats on embarking on your MBA journey! An MBA is a springboard for career advancement, opening doors to leadership roles and equipping you with a coveted toolkit for the business world. But with all the demands and an investment to match, it's natural to wonder how to maximize your return. Fear not, fellow MBA aspirant! Here's a game plan to help you absolutely crush your program and set yourself up for success:

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Chart Your Course: Goals and Strategy**

Before diving headfirst, take a beat to solidify your ""why."" What are your long-term career aspirations? Do you crave the thrill of launching your own venture, or envision yourself at the helm of a corporate division?  Understanding your goals will guide your course selection and extracurricular involvement.

**Actionable Tip:** Chat with alumni from your program (many schools have dedicated alumni networks) or industry professionals you admire. Their insights can be invaluable in shaping your vision.

&amp;#x200B;

**2.  MBA as a Buffet: Savoring the Full Spread**

Sure, the core curriculum is essential, but an MBA offers a smorgasbord of learning beyond textbooks. Here are some delicious bites not to miss:

&amp;#x200B;

* **Elective Courses:**  Pursue subjects that pique your interest and align with your goals.  Think marketing analytics if you're tech-savvy, or delve into negotiations if you want to hone your deal-making skills.  
 
* **Guest Speaker Events:**  These talks by industry titans are pure gold. Attend, network, and ask insightful questions ‚Äì you might just land a coveted internship or mentorship opportunity.  
 
* **Case Competitions:** Put your business acumen to the test!  Working in a team to tackle real-world business challenges is a fantastic way to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.  
 

**3. The Power of Networking: Building Your Bridge to Success**

Your classmates are a treasure trove of talent and potential collaborators.  Don't just be a classmate, be a connector!

&amp;#x200B;

* **Class Discussions:**  Actively participate in discussions, share your unique perspective, and build rapport with your peers.  
 
* **Study Groups:**  Forming study groups allows you to learn from each other, test your knowledge, and build strong working relationships.  
 
* **Social Events:**  Attend alumni events, club meetings, or casual gatherings. These are prime opportunities to connect with professionals and expand your network.  
 

**Pro Tip:**  Leverage online platforms like LinkedIn to connect with classmates, alumni, and industry professionals.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Embrace the (Calculated) Risk: Stepping Outside Your Comfort Zone**

An MBA is a time for exploration. Don't be afraid to take a course outside your comfort zone, volunteer for a leadership role in a club, or participate in a case competition focusing on an unfamiliar industry. You might discover a hidden passion or develop new skills you never knew you had. Remember, growth often happens just outside your comfort zone.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. The Art of Balance: Prioritization and Time Management**

An MBA program is a marathon, not a sprint.  Succeeding requires exceptional time management skills.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Master Your Calendar:**  Schedule dedicated study blocks, class time, networking events, and personal time. Utilize time management apps or planners to keep yourself organized.  
 
* **Prioritize ruthlessly:**  Learn to say no to commitments that drain your time and energy. Focus on the activities that align with your long-term goals.  
 
* **Maintain a Healthy Lifestyle:**  Getting enough sleep, eating nutritious meals, and exercising regularly will boost your focus, energy levels, and overall well-being ‚Äì crucial for tackling a demanding academic program.  
 

**Bonus Tip:** Don't be afraid to ask for help!  Professors, advisors, and career services are there to support your success. Utilize their expertise and guidance whenever needed.

&amp;#x200B;

**Remember:** Your MBA journey is an investment in yourself. By strategically planning your course of action, actively engaging with your peers and professors, and prioritizing your well-being, you'll be well on your way to not just surviving, but thriving in your program, and propelling yourself towards a truly fulfilling career.

,careerguidance,"Sorry in advance for kind of a long ramble, might be a little repetitive but I keep thinking about this and I'm really trying to sort things out in my head.  
  
This is something that I never really thought I'd be considering, I had posted a little while back, but didn't get much input, but essentially, I'm thinking about leaving IT  
as a career entirely.  
  
I love tech, I live, breathe and think it, I massively enjoy most aspects of it, love seeing what's coming down the tree from enterprise server hardware or new things being developed, I have a 42 rack with multiple servers, 10 gig fiber networking, I do fdm and sla printing,  
custom electronics including a little board design, a splash of programming, soldering, basically a shotgun spread of everything that a loner with no social life as a kid would have found to get into while nobody else found it interesting.   
  
Some opportunities for certificates have come up, but always at bad timing, I also don't really  
like comptia as an organization for a couple reasons, and I also don't know what I'd want to specialize in, if anything.  
  
I'm going to turn 30 in April, and have been working pretty much right since 20, doing nothing else, I guess I kind of fell for the ""grind and you'll make it"" mindset which means my 20s have been completely fucking wasted.   
  
I still basically have nothing to show, can't picture my future or owning a house, not that I ever could, and I feel like I'm just spinning my wheels.  
  
The highest I've made is a little under $24 an hour US after conversion, and I had to take another job $2 an hour under that. I've done multiple years of field service, maintenance on atms, point of sale systems, self checkouts, random installs including full store setups, as well as some MSP work in a couple tier 1 support/analyst/deployment tech roles with a mix of helpdesk, and onsite/in person support. (but it does seem like every company kind of makes up their own tiering system).   
  
The problem is, at each of these, I've wanted to do more but have been locked down by either the level I was at, the scope of the job shifted from a lot of hardware and setup stuff, to slewing through spreadsheets of software and asset lists and things slowing down massively, and consistently the most interesting, stimulating stuff  I've encountered  
has been out of work.  
  
This last job also seems like it's got an.. ok amount of hands on stuff, but is currently sitting on ass a lot doing nothing, and helpdesk tickets. Now granted this is a company that hasn't had local IT for years, so they need to get used to having someone available, but I'm not sure how much there will be, and I don't see any large scale projects, big deployments or new site setups really being a thing that will happen.  
  
Meanwhile, a buddy of mine who's a fair bit younger is a millwright or something, doing rotating maintenance shifts that sound like pretty damn basic labor, with lots of downtime, one week at night one during the day, making $8 or $9 an hour more than me. What's more, he already has picked up two shifts of overtime and has basically made what I would after taxes in two fuckin days. Guy bought a condo, has a significantly newer car, just seems to have everything going a lot more his way while I traditionally have the worst possible fuckin luck whenever possible.   
He's about six years into working regularly,so a fair bit less than me.  
  
I'm just feeling, idk, lost and hopeless right now. The pay isn't bad, don't get me wrong, but it still just doesn't feel like I could live comfortably, or have the budget for projects I want to do in my spare time to keep myself stimulated enough.  
  
 I live in a pretty small area with about 300k people, and supposedly the tech scene here is great, booming, so much opportunity, except it's either programmers, which I enjoy some but not enough to just stare at a screen all day, helpdesk entry level jobs, or management positions where you need decades of experience, an MBA, and yeah you can make 100k a year+ , even after currency conversion.  
  
But I can't just get a decade of managerial experience, and student loan debt for the rest of my life would be yet another stress I can't deal with. My Mother offered to talk about paying for education and that sort of thing, she has a lot, for years, but I don't want to put that shit on her, she herself has student loan debts, was a single parent, so I've always turned her down and basically went right into work after a year of post secondary in automotive service tech, after finding out I'd need several thousands of dollars in tools to even be considered anywhere, and the EV industry here, which is what I'd be interested in, is basically nonexistent.  
  
I love being hands on, doing different diverse things, learning new things, and seeing how bits of the world that people never even think about work, I love sinking my teeth into a big project like working with contractors and management to plan out locations for things, coordinate wiring, all that sort of stuff, helpdesk stuff isn't bad but it' just not... engaging. I love setting up racks of equipment, or fixing up old, shitty messy wiring, dealing with enterprise gear at all, that sort of thing because it's hands on, I get to see and learn new things, etc.  
  
Problem is I worked for three years+ doing field service, 1pm to midnight, and yeah I enjoyed that a lot but pay was shit, my boss was shitty, and my wrists are fucked up from that, not sure if it's RSI or carpal tunnel, but got pretty rough at that job and they gave zero fucks, having to unscrew an assload of ridiculously tight fasteners in shitty threading by hand in awkward angles took it's toll,  
and that means that a lot of that now would be problematic. Four or five hours of sleep a day followed by sleeping the entire weekend also didn't help me in having zero social or romantic life, but I'm basically on that same sort of sleep amount/cycle now since it's so hardwired in, waking up at 7, working till 4:30, sleeping at 2 or 3 in the morning...  
  
I never was able to sort of have a mental picture in my head of a future, a family any of that shit, but even like that, things haven't turned out anywhere near what I hoped they would, at this trajectory, it would take me another five or six years to make another $10 an hour it feels like? If that's even possible in this area.  
It seriously has me thinking about looking into other lines of work, machining seems fun, interesting and rewarding, I enjoy board level and low voltage electronics, maybe an electrician, I'd love to get into automation and robotics but this area is kind shit for that too. Welding is also something I really enjoyed at school, but haven't had the sort of project to justify buying a welder to get good. And how long before those jobs become unbearably boring to me and I lose all interest?  
  
I've wasted years, and feels like I'm massively behind everyone else I see talking about work and income, in the IT industry, or otherwise. So many conversations with higher ups who have kids, or know people making absolute insane amounts of money at their leisure leading amazing sounding lives, and I'm halfway through mine with a bank account balance that's sub four digits after a period of taking time off between jobs.  
  
I was going to give it some more time to think things through, but I decided to accept this one just so I had more to do in the day and some money coming in. It would feel shitty in a few months to say ""hey, thanks but this isn't for me"", but I just don't know what to do right now.

My Mother offered to talk about paying for education and that sort of thing, she has a lot, for years, but I don&amp;#39;t want to put that shit on her, she herself has student loan debts, was a single parent, so I&amp;#39;ve always turned her down and basically went right into work after a year of post secondary in automotive service tech, after finding out I&amp;#39;d need several thousands of dollars in tools to even be considered anywhere, and the EV industry here, which is what I&amp;#39;d be interested in, is basically nonexistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love being hands on, doing different diverse things, learning new things, and seeing how bits of the world that people never even think about work, I love sinking my teeth into a big project like working with contractors and management to plan out locations for things, coordinate wiring, all that sort of stuff, helpdesk stuff isn&amp;#39;t bad but it&amp;#39; just not... engaging. I love setting up racks of equipment, or fixing up old, shitty messy wiring, dealing with enterprise gear at all, that sort of thing because it&amp;#39;s hands on, I get to see and learn new things, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem is I worked for three years+ doing field service, 1pm to midnight, and yeah I enjoyed that a lot but pay was shit, my boss was shitty, and my wrists are fucked up from that, not sure if it&amp;#39;s RSI or carpal tunnel, but got pretty rough at that job and they gave zero fucks, having to unscrew an assload of ridiculously tight fasteners in shitty threading by hand in awkward angles took it&amp;#39;s toll,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and that means that a lot of that now would be problematic. Four or five hours of sleep a day followed by sleeping the entire weekend also didn&amp;#39;t help me in having zero social or romantic life, but I&amp;#39;m basically on that same sort of sleep amount/cycle now since it&amp;#39;s so hardwired in, waking up at 7, working till 4:30, sleeping at 2 or 3 in the morning...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never was able to sort of have a mental picture in my head of a future, a family any of that shit, but even like that, things haven&amp;#39;t turned out anywhere near what I hoped they would, at this trajectory, it would take me another five or six years to make another $10 an hour it feels like? If that&amp;#39;s even possible in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seriously has me thinking about looking into other lines of work, machining seems fun, interesting and rewarding, I enjoy board level and low voltage electronics, maybe an electrician, I&amp;#39;d love to get into automation and robotics but this area is kind shit for that too. Welding is also something I really enjoyed at school, but haven&amp;#39;t had the sort of project to justify buying a welder to get good. And how long before those jobs become unbearably boring to me and I lose all interest?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve wasted years, and feels like I&amp;#39;m massively behind everyone else I see talking about work and income, in the IT industry, or otherwise.

,skilledtrades,"  

Sorry in advance for kind of a long ramble, might be a little repetitive but I keep thinking about this and I'm really trying to sort things out in my head.

This is something that I never really thought I'd be considering, I had posted a little while back, but didn't get much input, but essentially, I'm thinking about leaving IT

as a career entirely.

I love tech, I live, breathe and think it, I massively enjoy most aspects of it, love seeing what's coming down the tree from enterprise server hardware or new things being developed, I have a 42 rack with multiple servers, 10 gig fiber networking, I do fdm and sla printing,

custom electronics including a little board design, a splash of programming, soldering, basically a shotgun spread of everything that a loner with no social life as a kid would have found to get into while nobody else found it interesting. 

Some opportunities for certificates have come up, but always at bad timing, I also don't really

like comptia as an organization for a couple reasons, and I also don't know what I'd want to specialize in, if anything.

I'm going to turn 30 in April, and have been working pretty much right since 20, doing nothing else, I guess I kind of fell for the ""grind and you'll make it"" mindset which means my 20s have been completely fucking wasted. 

I still basically have nothing to show, can't picture my future or owning a house, not that I ever could, and I feel like I'm just spinning my wheels.

The highest I've made is a little under $24 an hour US after conversion, and I had to take another job $2 an hour under that. I've done multiple years of field service, maintenance on atms, point of sale systems, self checkouts, random installs including full store setups, as well as some MSP work in a couple tier 1 support/analyst/deployment tech roles with a mix of helpdesk, and onsite/in person support. (but it does seem like every company kind of makes up their own tiering system). 

The problem is, at each of these, I've wanted to do more but have been locked down by either the level I was at, the scope of the job shifted from a lot of hardware and setup stuff, to slewing through spreadsheets of software and asset lists and things slowing down massively, and consistently the most interesting, stimulating stuff  I've encountered has been out of work.

This last job also seems like it's got an.. ok amount of hands on stuff, but is currently sitting on ass a lot doing nothing, and helpdesk tickets. Now granted this is a company that hasn't had local IT for years, so they need to get used to having someone available, but I'm not sure how much there will be, and I don't see any large scale projects, big deployments or new site setups really being a thing that will happen.

Meanwhile, a buddy of mine who's a fair bit younger is a millwright or something, doing rotating maintenance shifts that sound like pretty damn basic labor, with lots of downtime, one week at night one during the day, making $8 or $9 an hour more than me. What's more, he already has picked up two shifts of overtime and has basically made what I would after taxes in two fuckin days. Guy bought a condo, has a significantly newer car, just seems to have everything going a lot more his way while I traditionally have the worst possible fuckin luck whenever possible. 

He's about six years into working regularly,so a fair bit less than me.

I'm just feeling, idk, lost and hopeless right now. The pay isn't bad, don't get me wrong, but it still just doesn't feel like I could live comfortably, or have the budget for projects I want to do in my spare time to keep myself stimulated enough.

I live in a pretty small area with about 300k people, and supposedly the tech scene here is great, booming, so much opportunity, except it's either programmers, which I enjoy some but not enough to just stare at a screen all day, helpdesk entry level jobs, or management positions where you need decades of experience, an MBA, and yeah you can make 100k a year+ , even after currency conversion.

But I can't just get a decade of managerial experience, and student loan debt for the rest of my life would be yet another stress I can't deal with. My Mother offered to talk about paying for education and that sort of thing, she has a lot, for years, but I don't want to put that shit on her, she herself has student loan debts, was a single parent, so I've always turned her down and basically went right into work after a year of post secondary in automotive service tech, after finding out I'd need several thousands of dollars in tools to even be considered anywhere, and the EV industry here, which is what I'd be interested in, is basically nonexistent.

I love being hands on, doing different diverse things, learning new things, and seeing how bits of the world that people never even think about work, I love sinking my teeth into a big project like working with contractors and management to plan out locations for things, coordinate wiring, all that sort of stuff, helpdesk stuff isn't bad but it' just not... engaging.

Guy bought a condo, has a siginificantly newer car, just seems to have everything going a lot more his way while I traditionally have the worst possible fuckin luck. He's about six years into working regularly,  
so a fair bit less than me.   
  
I'm just feeling, idk, lost and hopeless right now. The pay isn't bad, don't get me wrong, but it still just doesn't feel like I could live comfortably, or have the budget for projects I want to do in my spare time to keep myself stimulated enough. I live in a pretty small area with about 300k people, and supposedly  
the tech scene here is great, booming, so much opportunity, except it's either programmers, which I enjoy some but not enough to just stare at a screen all day, helpdesk entry level jobs, or management positions where you need decades of experience, an MBA, and yeah you can make 100k a year+ , even after currency conversion.  
  
But I can't just get a decade of managerial experience, and student loan debt for the rest of my life would be yet another stress I can't deal with. My Mother offered to talk about paying for education and that sort of thing, she has a lot, for years, but I don't want to put that shit on her, she herself has student loan debts, was a   
single parent, so I've always turned her down and basically went right into work after a year of post secondary in automotive service tech, after finding out I'd need several thousands of dollars in tools to even be considered anywhere, and the EV industry here, which is what I'd be interested in, is basically nonexistent.  
  
  
  
I love being hands on, doing different diverse things, learning new things, and seeing how bits of the world that people never even think about work, I love sinking my teeth into a big project like working with contractors and management to plan out locations for things, coordinate wiring, all that sort of stuff, helpdesk stuff isn't bad but it' just not... engaging.I love setting up racks of equipment,   
or fixing up old, shitty wiring, dealing with enterprise gear at all, that sort of thing because it's hands on, I get to see and learn new things, et.  
  
Problem is I worked for three years+ doing field service, 1pm to midnight, and yeah I enjoyed that a lot but pay was shit, my boss was shitty, and my wrists are fucked up from that, not sure if it's RSI or carpal tunnel, but got pretty rough at that job and they gave zero fucks, having to unscrew an assload of ridiculolusly tight fasteners in shitty threading by hand in akward angles took it's toll,  
and that means that a lot of that now would be problematic. Four or five hours of sleep a day followed by sleeping the entire weekend also didn't help me in having zero social or romantic life, but I'm basically on that same sort of sleep amnount/cycle now since it's so hardwared in, waking up at 7, working till 4:30, sleeping at 2 or 3 in the morning...  
  
  
  
I never was able to sort of have a mental picture in my head of a future, a family any of that shit, but even like that, things haven't turned out anywhere near what I hoped they would, at this trajectory, it would take me another five or six years to make another $10 an hour it feels like? If that's even possible in this area.  
  
It seriously has me thinking about looking into other lines of work, machining seems fun, interesting and rewarding, I enjoy board level and low voltage electronics, maybe an electrician, I'd love to get into autmation and robotics but this area is kind shit for that too. And how long before those jobs become unbearably boring to me and I lose all interest?   
  
  
I've wasted years, and feels like I'm massively behind everyone else I see talking about work and income, in the IT industry, or otherwise. So many conversations with higher ups who have kids, or know people making absolute insane amounts of money at their leisure leading amazing sounding lives, and I'm halfway through mine with a bank account balance that's sub four digits after a period of taking time off between jobs.   
I was going to give it some more time to think things through, but I decided to accept this one just so I had more to do in the day and some money coming in. It would feel shitty in a few months to say ""hey, thanks but this isn't for me"", but I just don't know what to do right now.

&lt;p&gt;This is something that I never really thought I&amp;#39;d be considering, I had posted a little while back, but didn&amp;#39;t get much input, but essentially, I&amp;#39;m thinking about leaving IT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as a career entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love tech, I live, breathe and think it, I massively enjoy most aspects of it, love seeing what&amp;#39;s coming down the tree from enterprise server hardware or new things being developed, I have a 42 rack with multiple servers, 10 gig fiber networking, I do fdm and sla printing, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;custom electronics including a little board design, a splash of programming, soldering, basically a shotgun spread of everything that a loner with no social life as a kid would have found to get into while nobody else found it interesting. Some opportunities for certificates have come up, but always at bad timing, I also don&amp;#39;t really&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;like comptia as an organization for a couple reasons, and I also don&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;d want to specialize in, if anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to turn 30 in April, and have been working pretty much right since 20, doing nothing else, I guess I kind of fell for the &amp;quot;grind and you&amp;#39;ll make it&amp;quot; mindset which means my 20s have been completely fucking wasted. I still basically have nothing to show, can&amp;#39;t picture&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my future or owning a house, not that I ever could, and I feel like I&amp;#39;m just spinning my wheels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highest I&amp;#39;ve made is a little under $24 an hour US after conversion, and I had to take another job $2 an hour under that. I&amp;#39;ve done multiple years of field service, maintenance on atms, point of sale systems, self checkouts, random installs including full store&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;setups, as well as some MSP work in a couple tier 1 support/analyst/deployment tech roles with a mix of helpdesk, and onsite/in person support. (but it does seem like every company kind of makes up their own tiering system). The problem is, at each of these, I&amp;#39;ve wanted to do more&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but have been locked down by either the level I was at, the scope of the job shifted from a lot of hardware and setup stuff, to slewing through spreadheets of software and asset lists and things slowing down massively, and consistently the most interesting, stimulating stuff I&amp;#39;ve encountered&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;has been out of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last job also seems like it&amp;#39;s got an.. ok amount of hands on stuff, but is currently sitting on ass a lot doing nothing, and helpdesk tickets. Now granted this is a company that hasn&amp;#39;t had local IT for years, so they need to get used to having someone available, but I&amp;#39;m not sure&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;how much there will be, and I don&amp;#39;t see any large scale projects, big deployments or new site setups really being a thing that will happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a buddy of mine who&amp;#39;s a fair bit younger is a millwright or something, doing rotating maintenance shifts that sound like pretty damn basic labor, with lots of downtime, one week at night one during the day, making $8 or $9 an hour more than me. What&amp;#39;s more, he already has picked up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so a fair bit less than me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just feeling, idk, lost and hopeless right now. The pay isn&amp;#39;t bad, don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, but it still just doesn&amp;#39;t feel like I could live comfortably, or have the budget for projects I want to do in my spare time to keep myself stimulated enough.

,ITCareerQuestions,"36 years old. Last contract position as a Network Engineer ended in December. Frustrated at how hard it has been to find a new job. I‚Äôve been considering enlisting in the Air Force for a change of pace and to reap the benefits. I have no mortgage, partner, or kids so it‚Äôd be easy to move wherever they station me. 

The issue is, due to my past, my recruiter has said it‚Äôs unlikely I could get a security clearance right now. Without the security clearance, I would only qualify for the ‚Äúclient systems specialist‚Äù job which from what I‚Äôve read is basically a help desk role. I‚Äôve made decent progress in my IT career and I am thinking this would leave me SOL once I get out. I assume I‚Äôd have no relevant work experience and probably forget most of what I know now. I feel like I could work on getting certificates or a MBA but again, I‚Äôd have no networking work experience for about 4 years. 

Wondering if anyone has any personal experience with a situation like this? Or just some general advice?

SCMHRD posted yesterday that they have completed final as well as summer internship placements.
The truth is very opposite and in reality, most of us are suffering. I did not want the truth about SCMHRD to come out because it will eventually affect our future opportunities but with a loan on my head, I am writing this so that none of you suffer like us. I am from final year mba core with a good profile, good academics and case competition wins, and am placed in a mediocre role and package. Many of my friends are still unplaced and only a few in the batch have got good placements out of which most of them are from the core committees CRT APR ART due to internal politics. I would have got better packages at a Tier-2 college than here after suffering from so much of mental agony, toxic environment and what not. My Business Analytics and Infrastructure Development Management IDM batchmates' condition is worse than this. Many are unplaced and many have been forced to sign out of placements. Posting the screenshots shared by a IDM batch friend on instagram who is not placed and suffering from severe mental trauma. Think a thousand times before wasting your time and money here, especially if you are taking a loan.

Answering a few questions from the comments on previous post :
Our 2024-26 batch does not have much international students. We do have quota students. Still this is the condition. The 2023-25 batch has a lot of international and quota students and their condition is worse and from here on, it‚Äôs only going to get worse for next batches.
The market conditions are not to blame.

,Rants,"I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in May 2021 and right after graduating, I decided to go straight into grad school in August 2021 at the same school I got my bachelor's in, a decision I regret making but oh well, you live and you learn. I was set on getting a Master's degree back when I started undergrad but I thought I would've at least waited a year or two before doing it. I was told it would be hard to get back in the groove of school after not being in school for a while and since it was around COVID, like a lot of schools, my school took out the GRE test score component for the time-being so I thought it was the perfect opportunity to pursue a Master's degree. I applied and got accepted within a few months and I also found a WFH job which was similar to what I was wanting to pursue so it all felt perfect. I had financial aid pay for my bachelor's degree so I didn't have debt and I was able to pay along with my parents for the first year of grad school but I decided to take out a $12,000 loan for my last year. In the summer of my first year, I ended up getting fired from that job, which I was kind of hurt at, but I was looking for another opportunities since the job was very demanding for very low pay. But luckily, I ended up finding another job within two weeks for higher pay and less demanding work. Within 6 months, a bunch of people got laid off and I was apart of those group of people. This happened at about 2 months before I graduated with my MBA so I decided to look for jobs. I was also saving money for a trip to East Africa in August, so I was looking for a seasonal job until then. By mid-May, I was able to find a seasonal job until then and by mid-August, I was done and about to leave the country to see some family I haven't seen in a long time.  
While I was enjoying my time with my family, I also looked for jobs when I had the time to. I would get rejections but they didn't do anything to me, since I told myself it's part of the process and some people have taken multiple months before finding a job in the field they graduated in. Plus, I was with family and having fun so it was easy for me to not get too depressed about it. Once I got back from my trip in mid-October, reality started to kick in. Feelings of worthlessness, depression, and uncertainty kick in. And I would tell myself making myself feel bad about my current circumstances won't change anything, so I did things outside of applying to jobs all day like working out, hanging out with friends, and starting a painting hobby I haven't been able to do in a while due to me being so busy with both school and work. Those would help until people asking me if I have a job yet or if emails from my loan servicer came and I would go into a depressive spiral again. I have a pretty religious mom, whom I love, and she always tells me about people in my family who've taken 6-9 months finding a job after graduating and they didn't give up on the way. While those helped for the time-being, it didn't help me when looking for jobs. I even tried applying to places like Walmart and they would still decline me, even though they always say they need people desperately. As you can tell, I was desperate. I've done everything from making 100 copies of my r√©sum√© tailored to the job description, emailing recruiters, and connecting with people that work at the companies on LinkedIn that I've applied to, but nothing would help my chances of not getting a rejection email. Honestly, I thank God for my parents because I have no idea what I would do without them. During the last week of 2023, one of my best friends since high school got married, and while I couldn't be more happy for her, I started comparing my own life to hers and even though she was also unemployed, at least her life was moving forward and I was only going downhill. Whenever those thoughts would start to come, I would tell myself it's selfish to think about that in the moment so I would just push those thoughts down and tell myself I can start feeling bad about myself after her wedding weekend.  
Of course, after that, I would get into depressive states again. After praying, I would feel better, getting that wave of encouragement and that things will change for the better sooner or later. Now into February, I got an opportunity to help manage an community clinic when it does open, but I'm currently in the committee that's working on it, which is a volunteer position until the clinic does open, which is TBD, due to a lot of circumstances of medical licensing, state funding, etc. I thank God for the opportunity since it is something I've been wanting to get into, but it sucks not having a job outside of it since everybody in the committee is either a doctor, pharmacist, or a director at a hospital. I've networked with them outside our committee meetings and applied to the places they currently work at, but I've had no luck so far. Now into March, almost April, I am in the same boat of getting rejection emails and regretting all my life choices. I've gotten a few interviews but I've had no luck with those, as they either ghost be right after the interview or tell me the job position has already been filled. It seems like nothing I could do will ever work and I'm just destined to be a low life who worked way too hard to get nothing in return. I'm tired of pretending like I'm OK with my current circumstances and everything happens for a reason, I'm just tired of life and I'm tired of putting in the work and praying for everything to get better while everyone else gets to do the things they worked hard for.

,MaliciousCompliance,"I‚Äôd been reminded of this incident recently when I happened to run into one of my former bosses.   
And this is a story of Malicious Compliance.  
Many times, I‚Äôd mentioned during other conversations with them that I‚Äôd previously come from the private sector and was not used to how things were run ‚Äì even after several years - in local government; and definitely that those ways would never, ever fly in private sector. Especially when it came to money.  I had been tasked with being the liaison for returning money and personal property to people that were either the victim‚Äôs or the perpetrator‚Äôs ‚Äì laws didn‚Äôt allow us to know which category individuals fell under. But if a judge said ‚Äúgive their property back to them,‚Äù that‚Äôs what I did. With the correct paperwork. Period.  
Of course there were procedures, proper paper work had to be filled out and a valid/current state identification or driver‚Äôs license, a court order, and an evidence voucher was needed. Everything had to ‚Äòmatch‚Äô on all of the paper work. Their full name. Address. City and State. And a property receipt from the Police Department. If they came to me with a receipt that said John Q. Doe; then their identification had to say the same. Not Jack Doe, not J. Q. Doe‚Ä¶ you get it. It was supposed to be a sure fire way to make sure that the right person claimed the property (and 99.99% of the time it was money/U.S. dollars).  And our department was entrusted to follow the rules.  Well, the supervisor and the department head; let‚Äôs call them TD and TL, were both in rare form this particular day during our routine morning meeting when they both had attitudes about everything. It probably had something to do with the fact that they were being applauded for running a tight ship and getting things done. Yeah, right, all they had to do was sign their names to things: the staff did all of the hard work! And yet, contradicting everything said between one and the other. And walking around with their chests out like they were God‚Äôs gifts. And in not so many words both professing ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the boss. I want it done this way. Or that way. If I say something, that‚Äôs the way I want it. Do it, and don‚Äôt question me.‚Äù Okay, I thought‚Ä¶ and  I‚Äôve asked before at other jobs; ‚ÄúAre you sure? Really sure? Because I was taught to do just that ‚Äì give you exactly what you want. And usually people end up not liking it.‚Äù They both were so nasty in their response that I just smiled at my friend/coworker across the table who shook her head and did a face palm. Why? Because she knows me.  
Ok. It‚Äôs on. I‚Äôm going to do it ‚Äúyour way, without question, because you two are the boss.‚Äù  
At around 11am I get a call from the security desk that a visitor had arrived with a property receipt etc. and wanted to know if I would come and collect them to get the process started. ‚ÄúSure, I‚Äôll be down in about 10-15 minutes‚Äù I told them; as I was in the process of counting money and needed to focus. As on any given day there was around $100,000 in cash on my desk and I didn‚Äôt want to put the money back in the safe and start all over.  When I finally finished counting the money and went downstairs to collect the visitor, the visitor was clearly agitated. Was I bothered? Kind of. But I was secure enough knowing that there were 400 or so officers with guns in the building. So, I led the visitor up to my office, had them seated, took their information and began the process. Except 1. The voucher looked old, 2. The name on the voucher didn‚Äôt match the receipt, 3. The receipt nor the voucher matched the court order, and 4. Their I.D. was expired. ALERT! ALERT! Giant red flags waving in the breeze! Everything Everything that I‚Äôd been taught was screaming at me that this was bad and that it was going to end badly. I made the necessary copies for my records of all of the information like always, except this time ‚Äì two of everything - and actually circled all of the discrepancies in red marker. And then told the visitor that I needed to get the check book from another office, it would take a little while to get the signatures (and MINE) needed and release of funds required two other signatures.  
I first went to my immediate supervisor, TL, and explained the situation to her. I showed her every single, solitary piece of paper work. Pointed out all of what I‚Äôd circled. That the information didn‚Äôt match on any of forms in any way at all. She literally did a quick scan and said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. Do it.‚Äù I know that I stood there with my mouth opening and closing with no words coming out for a full two minutes, shaking my head, and in shock, before I said ‚ÄúWait, did you really look at what I‚Äôm showing you?? There‚Äôs something wrong with all of it. I think it‚Äôs forgery and fraud about to be committed!‚Äù Her words were: ‚ÄúI said do it,‚Äù while pushing all of the paperwork across her desk back to me. ‚ÄúAre you sure? Do you want to look at it again? You do realize that I‚Äôm supposed to cut a check for $97,000.00?????‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs fine, do it. So that you can get back to your other work.‚Äù I then told her that I was really uncomfortable completing the transaction and that I wanted to speak to TD about it. And so, I walked across the hall, tapped on TD‚Äôs door and asked if we could discuss the transaction. Now, mind you, TD is the department head ‚Äì one of the signatures needed to finalize the paperwork. The other person to sign would be the accounts payable department head. I spread both sets of copies of the papers across his desk and again explained in detail the situation and what was wrong with all of it. At least he took a few more minutes to pore over the paperwork, unlike TL. And so I thought, Ok! He‚Äôs paying attention. He‚Äôll see everything that‚Äôs wrong with this. He‚Äôll make a call downstairs and have a couple of officers up here in no time.‚Äù Nope. He literally said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all good. Do it.‚Äù ‚ÄúTD! It‚Äôs not all good! Please, please look at it all again!‚Äù I pleaded. Now‚Äôs a good time to tell everyone that I worked for lawyers for five years straight out of high school. And one of the best things that I‚Äôve ever learned was what definitely became my life-long motto: Cover-Your-Own-Ass and don‚Äôt take the fall for other people. And that mindset has been good to me.   
Again, I pleaded with TD to look closely at the paperwork. I pointed out all of the discrepancies again. The wrong name, the paper being the wrong color and looking old, the expired state I.D. Everything. And again he said ‚ÄúI said do it.‚Äù Ok, I thought. This is one of the times when you know for certain that this is going to come back and bite you in the ass. But, remember when I said that I worked for lawyers for five years in my earlier career? Well, I remembered them always saying ‚ÄúSignatures are everything.‚Äù Now, normally the only time I would need signatures are when the checks are actually cut. But this time, I was definitely going to take it oh-so-much-further. Back out to the copier I went, for one more copy of all of the paperwork. First stop was the supervisor, TL‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúTL, I need your signature to finish this transaction. Sign and date here, here, here, here, here, and here.‚Äù Yes, everywhere I‚Äôd made a notation in red marker. ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù and off I went back to TD to get his signature. ‚ÄúSorry to bother you TD, but I need your signature and date here, here, here, here, here, here, and here.‚Äù All the while thinking ‚ÄúYou two won‚Äôt be having me accused and arrested for conspiring with a total stranger!!!!‚Äù With that done, I asked TD one more time ‚ÄúAre you sure that you want me to complete this transaction, after everything that I‚Äôve pointed out, cut a check and send the visitor on his way?‚Äù TD never looked up from what he was reading and said ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

  
So, that‚Äôs what I did. Completed the steps necessary to cut the $90,000 check and send the visitor on his merry way.  
Three weeks later all hell broke loose!  
‚ÄúO.P! My office now!!!!!‚Äù  
My head has never whipped back and forth so fast in my entire life as they both talked at the same time. TD beet red and TL wringing her hands in frustration. ‚ÄúShut the door!‚Äù TL said. And then I could barely understand what was being said, but eventually figured out that it was about the transaction and check that I‚Äôd written prior.  Yup. We (and I say we very, very loosely) handed over close to 100K to the wrong person! They handed me a record of everything that was currently happening because of that transaction. The commissioner‚Äôs memo. The judge‚Äôs orders. The investigation procedures. The assigned case number and detectives. The names of the bank representatives. I was told that there was an ongoing investigation and I‚Äôd be contacted by the bank and detectives shortly. And lastly that I might be fired. ‚ÄúWhat do you have to say for yourself?‚Äù TD asked forcefully, while slapping the top of his desk, to which I replied ‚ÄúI did what I was supposed to do. I did what I was told to do. Don‚Äôt you remember signing off on it all?‚Äù I said matter of factly.  They both spluttered something to the effect of ‚ÄúI would never‚Ä¶.I have an MBA and‚Ä¶. I‚Äôve been doing this for 30 years‚Ä¶.No, this is your mistake‚Ä¶This is not going to end well for you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.etc.‚Äù I almost burst out laughing because it very much sounded like the teacher from the Charlie Brown cartoons. You know ‚ÄúWah, wanh, wanh ‚Äìwanh.‚Äù But I was in no way worried. I calmly got up out of the chair that I‚Äôd been perched on the edge of, excused myself, walked to my office, picked up my purse and got my desk key out, opened the drawer and pulled out the folder that I had made of THAT ONE PARTICULAR transaction. I had purposely kept it separate from the other copies. Just in case those papers somehow ‚Äòmagically disappeared.‚Äô Since, TL was commonly and routinely famous for going through our desks.  I walked back to TD‚Äôs office and sat the folder on his desk in front of him and waited. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù TD asked me. ‚ÄúJust open it,‚Äù I said. He spent more time going through those papers than he had when he should have been paying a hell of a lot more attention three weeks ago!! He finally looked across his desk at me with wide eyes and I just blinked back at him not saying a word. TL asked, ‚ÄúWell, what is it??‚Äù And so he hands her the file but never takes his eyes off of me. I swear that in that moment I could hear her ‚Äògulp‚Äô loudly. For me, it was an ‚ÄòOh, so you two think that I‚Äôm going to take the fall for this one?‚Äô moment. No. Nope. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not next month. Not ever.  
And then I waited some more. You could definitely hear a feather drop - the room had gotten so quiet.  
‚ÄúAs I said, I did what I was supposed to do. Just like you two told me. Anything else you need me to clear up?‚Äù I asked. TD and TL couldn‚Äôt speak. Neither could find their voices in the moment so I just quietly left the office, shut the door behind me and smiled all the way back to my office.  
What happened with the ongoing investigation I‚Äôll never know.  The subject was never brought up again.   
Hell, I did just what they both told me to do‚Ä¶. They‚Äôre the bosses right?

At around 11am I get a call from the security desk that a visitor had arrived with a property receipt etc. and wanted to know if I would come and collect them to get the process started. ‚ÄúSure, I‚Äôll be down in about 10-15 minutes‚Äù I told them; as I was in the process of counting money and needed to focus. As on any given day there was around $100,000 in cash on my desk and I didn‚Äôt want to put the money back in the safe and start all over.  When I finally finished counting the money and went downstairs to collect the visitor, the visitor was clearly agitated. Was I bothered? Kind of. But I was secure enough knowing that there were 400 or so officers with guns in the building. So, I led the visitor up to my office, had them seated, took their information and began the process. Except 1. The voucher looked old, 2. The name on the voucher didn‚Äôt match the receipt, 3. The receipt nor the voucher matched the court order, and 4. Their I.D. was expired. ALERT! ALERT! Giant red flags waving in the breeze! Everything Everything that I‚Äôd been taught was screaming at me that this was bad and that it was going to end badly. I made the necessary copies for my records of all of the information like always, except this time ‚Äì two of everything - and actually circled all of the discrepancies in red marker. And then told the visitor that I needed to get the check book from another office, it would take a little while to get the signatures (and MINE) needed and release of funds required two other signatures.&lt;br/&gt;
I first went to my immediate supervisor, TL, and explained the situation to her. I showed her every single, solitary piece of paper work. Pointed out all of what I‚Äôd circled. That the information didn‚Äôt match on any of forms in any way at all. She literally did a quick scan and said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. Do it.‚Äù I know that I stood there with my mouth opening and closing with no words coming out for a full two minutes, shaking my head, and in shock, before I said ‚ÄúWait, did you really look at what I‚Äôm showing you?? There‚Äôs something wrong with all of it. I think it‚Äôs forgery and fraud about to be committed!‚Äù Her words were: ‚ÄúI said do it,‚Äù while pushing all of the paperwork across her desk back to me. ‚ÄúAre you sure? Do you want to look at it again? You do realize that I‚Äôm supposed to cut a check for $97,000.00?????‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs fine, do it. So that you can get back to your other work.‚Äù I then told her that I was really uncomfortable completing the transaction and that I wanted to speak to TD about it. And so, I walked across the hall, tapped on TD‚Äôs door and asked if we could discuss the transaction. Now, mind you, TD is the department head ‚Äì one of the signatures needed to finalize the paperwork. The other person to sign would be the accounts payable department head. I spread both sets of copies of the papers across his desk and again explained in detail the situation and what was wrong with all of it. At least he took a few more minutes to pore over the paperwork, unlike TL. And so I thought, Ok! He‚Äôs paying attention. He‚Äôll see everything that‚Äôs wrong with this. He‚Äôll make a call downstairs and have a couple of officers up here in no time.‚Äù Nope. He literally said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all good. Do it.‚Äù ‚ÄúTD! It‚Äôs not all good! Please, please look at it all again!‚Äù I pleaded. Now‚Äôs a good time to tell everyone that I worked for lawyers for five years straight out of high school. And one of the best things that I‚Äôve ever learned was what definitely became my life-long motto: Cover-Your-Own-Ass and don‚Äôt take the fall for other people. And that mindset has been good to me.&lt;br/&gt;
Again, I pleaded with TD to look closely at the paperwork. I pointed out all of the discrepancies again. The wrong name, the paper being the wrong color and looking old, the expired state I.D. Everything. And again he said ‚ÄúI said do it.‚Äù Ok, I thought. This is one of the times when you know for certain that this is going to come back and bite you in the ass. But, remember when I said that I worked for lawyers for five years in my earlier career? Well, I remembered them always saying ‚ÄúSignatures are everything.‚Äù Now, normally the only time I would need signatures are when the checks are actually cut. But this time, I was definitely going to take it oh-so-much-further. Back out to the copier I went, for one more copy of all of the paperwork. First stop was the supervisor, TL‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúTL, I need your signature to finish this transaction. Sign and date here, here, here, here, here, and here.‚Äù Yes, everywhere I‚Äôd made a notation in red marker. ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù and off I went back to TD to get his signature. ‚ÄúSorry to bother you TD, but I need your signature and date here, here, here, here, here, here, and here.‚Äù All the while thinking ‚ÄúYou two won‚Äôt be having me accused and arrested for conspiring with a total stranger!!!!‚Äù With that done, I asked TD one more time ‚ÄúAre you sure that you want me to complete this transaction, after everything that I‚Äôve pointed out, cut a check and send the visitor on his way?‚Äù TD never looked up from what he was reading and said ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that‚Äôs what I did. Completed the steps necessary to cut the $90,000 check and send the visitor on his merry way.&lt;br/&gt;
Three weeks later all hell broke loose!&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúO.P! My office now!!!!!‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
My head has never whipped back and forth so fast in my entire life as they both talked at the same time. TD beet red and TL wringing her hands in frustration. ‚ÄúShut the door!‚Äù TL said. And then I could barely understand what was being said, but eventually figured out that it was about the transaction and check that I‚Äôd written prior.  Yup. We (and I say we very, very loosely) handed over close to 100K to the wrong person! They handed me a record of everything that was currently happening because of that transaction. The commissioner‚Äôs memo. The judge‚Äôs orders. The investigation procedures. The assigned case number and detectives. The names of the bank representatives. I was told that there was an ongoing investigation and I‚Äôd be contacted by the bank and detectives shortly. And lastly that I might be fired. ‚ÄúWhat do you have to say for yourself?‚Äù TD asked forcefully, while slapping the top of his desk, to which I replied ‚ÄúI did what I was supposed to do. I did what I was told to do. Don‚Äôt you remember signing off on it all?‚Äù I said matter of factly.  They both spluttered something to the effect of ‚ÄúI would never‚Ä¶.I have an MBA and‚Ä¶. I‚Äôve been doing this for 30 years‚Ä¶.No, this is your mistake‚Ä¶This is not going to end well for you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.etc.‚Äù I almost burst out laughing because it very much sounded like the teacher from the Charlie Brown cartoons. You know ‚ÄúWah, wanh, wanh ‚Äìwanh.‚Äù But I was in no way worried. I calmly got up out of the chair that I‚Äôd been perched on the edge of, excused myself, walked to my office, picked up my purse and got my desk key out, opened the drawer and pulled out the folder that I had made of THAT ONE PARTICULAR transaction. I had purposely kept it separate from the other copies. Just in case those papers somehow ‚Äòmagically disappeared.‚Äô Since, TL was commonly and routinely famous for going through our desks.  I walked back to TD‚Äôs office and sat the folder on his desk in front of him and waited. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù TD asked me. ‚ÄúJust open it,‚Äù I said. He spent more time going through those papers than he had when he should have been paying a hell of a lot more attention three weeks ago!! He finally looked across his desk at me with wide eyes and I just blinked back at him not saying a word. TL asked, ‚ÄúWell, what is it??‚Äù And so he hands her the file but never takes his eyes off of me. I swear that in that moment I could hear her ‚Äògulp‚Äô loudly. For me, it was an ‚ÄòOh, so you two think that I‚Äôm going to take the fall for this one?‚Äô moment. No. Nope. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not next month. Not ever.&lt;br/&gt;
And then I waited some more. You could definitely hear a feather drop - the room had gotten so quiet.&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúAs I said, I did what I was supposed to do. Just like you two told me. Anything else you need me to clear up?‚Äù I asked. TD and TL couldn‚Äôt speak. Neither could find their voices in the moment so I just quietly left the office, shut the door behind me and smiled all the way back to my office.&lt;br/&gt;
What happened with the ongoing investigation I‚Äôll never know.  The subject was never brought up again.&lt;br/&gt;
Hell, I did just what they both told me to do‚Ä¶. They‚Äôre the bosses right?  &lt;/p&gt;

,resumes," 

Title pretty much says it all. Got my MBA with a focus on supply chain management back in 2022 and have had two inventory/procurement related positions since then. I'm looking to return to remote work, ideally something related to my field of study and most recent work experience. I've applied to roughly 100 positions so far on Indeed and LinkedIn without much luck minus the occasional recruiter call that ultimately goes nowhere, so any brutal levels of honesty on what I could improve on my resume to land an interview or two finally would be appreciated.

I know my two recent positions I've not been in very long (roughly 8 months in my current one, and 8 months in my prior one) so that may be a red flag to recruiters, but I feel as if there has to be more to it than just that. Thanks in advance for any pointers.

,circlejerk,"I noticed some of my posts and comments on Reddit will get negative points. This leads me to believe there's clearly a mistake somewhere in this dog (not a error) forsaken website causing this issue. 

I have a MBA in mass communication and journalism. I know what the kids like. I am hip. I listen to rap music and watch YouTube shorts. When I post, I know what is going to be W (win) and is going to be a L (loss). 

I feel like i started stroking the wrong egos and now Reddit has it out for me. This is a true challenge to me. They didn't teach me about this in school. How do I confront these evil corporations trying to silence the little guy. I wasnt aware I was going to have to face off and be on the front line in this battle against facisim. 

Ever since I got in a fight with my wife last week over a stupid joke it feels like my reddit has been going to down hill. If you check my post history you can refresh yourself on the story. 

Basically the tldr is; I showed my wife my Reddit during our fight to try and explain how the points mean people like me and think I am a funny comedian and writer but she didn't understand and actually mocked me. She said that none of this matters and I am wasting time I could be looking for a real job. She doesn't understand that Reddit Creator program will pay me good money for my posts but that will never come to fruition if I am shadow banned. 

Point is, I think that she may have reported my account to the Mods and now my account is being shadow banned. All because my wife wants me to think my jokes ""childish"" and ""immature"" and the one that really stabbed the knife through my chest is ""not funny"". 

I also think she is conspiring against me with the mods of my favorite sub reddit r/hiphopcirclejerk. Right after we had our right barely even 2 days later this user on the sub ""Automoderator"" started his harassment campaign against me again. He has been a constant pain in my side responding to my post derailing my jokes and stepping on the punchlines.

Now you see, Auto and I had our history in the past (I doxxed him after multiple warnings to stop commenting below my comments) but he hadn't harassed me for a few weeks but the SUDDENLY he comes back right after me and wife get in a fight? A little suspicious don't you think, reddit? 

My wife, (borat voice) she doesn't know funny, she doesn't even like the show Friends. How would she know what funny is if she can't even laugh at Phoebe having a sister that looks exactly like her and Joey getting confused at which ones is which?

 I think you now see my point...

ANOTHER EXAMPLE: Just the other day my video was removed from the Little Wayne subreddit for being ""low effort"" DOES 30 MINUTES IN CAPCUT SOUND LOW EFFORT TO YOU REDDIT? It's freaking disgusting how quickly they try and shut you down when you go against their grain. 

110k in student loans but my post history is worth 1 million bucks. Maybe I'll leave and go to X. I just know I can't go back to Instagram after they said that the face swap video I posted of Jackie Kennedy's face on JonTrons body from that video of his stance on immigration violates the terms of service. 

So now that I can't go back I'm stuck trying to make these posts work, just trying to survive and make enough gold to cash out for another night at the extended stay. My wife initially went to her parents for a long weekend after our spat but she said it's best if I am not at the house when she returns so I have been staying at the Siegel Suites.

It now feels like the powers at be don't want me to survive, they are trying to silence me. They know my posts don't conform to their idea of ""normal"". My humor is to advanced for the normies. I feel like I am going to have to take drastic measures if things do not turn around soon. I can't fight the Reddit echo chamber on my own. Not now at least.

I just need some advice from others that have been silenced on this fascist website. 

Please don't comment telling me I am not funny because that is objectively not true. Even in high school all of the popular kids would come to me at the lunch table and would ask me to tell my jokes. Sometimes they would dare me to eat gross stuff and I would do it and they were always cracking up and laughing so it's clear that I do have a history of being funny.

EDIT: THIS WAS ORIGINALLY MEANT TO BE POSTED IN THE R/CIRCLEJERK SUB BUT IT WAS AUTOMATICALLY REMOVED AS SOON AS 8 POSTED IT. THIS FURTHER PROVES MY POINT THERE IS A CONSPIRACY AGAINST ME. MY WIFE, AUTO, AND CLEARLY REDDIT ARE TRYING TO SILENCE ME. 

Edit 2: I am now attempting to post this again in the sub its intended to be posted in. I posted this my profile after it was AUTOMATICALLY deleted but seems I have not been able to reach anyone with my cry for help.

Silenced before I could even speak, alas I am back to try again and speak up against the injustices being committed on this website. Please do not be compliant with these slights against my character. Please updoot this post.

&lt;p&gt;Now you see, Auto and I had our history in the past (I doxxed him after multiple warnings to stop commenting below my comments) but he hadn&amp;#39;t harassed me for a few weeks but the SUDDENLY he comes back right after me and wife get in a fight? A little suspicious don&amp;#39;t you think, reddit? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife, (borat voice) she doesn&amp;#39;t know funny, she doesn&amp;#39;t even like the show Friends. How would she know what funny is if she can&amp;#39;t even laugh at Phoebe having a sister that looks exactly like her and Joey getting confused at which ones is which?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you now see my point...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANOTHER EXAMPLE: Just the other day my video was removed from the Little Wayne subreddit for being &amp;quot;low effort&amp;quot; DOES 30 MINUTES IN CAPCUT SOUND LOW EFFORT TO YOU REDDIT? It&amp;#39;s freaking disgusting how quickly they try and shut you down when you go against their grain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;110k in student loans but my post history is worth 1 million bucks. Maybe I&amp;#39;ll leave and go to X. I just know I can&amp;#39;t go back to Instagram after they said that the face swap video I posted of Jackie Kennedy&amp;#39;s face on JonTrons body from that video of his stance on immigration violates the terms of service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now that I can&amp;#39;t go back I&amp;#39;m stuck trying to make these posts work, just trying to survive and make enough gold to cash out for another night at the extended stay. My wife initially went to her parents for a long weekend after our spat but she said it&amp;#39;s best if I am not at the house when she returns so I have been staying at the Siegel Suites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It now feels like the powers at be don&amp;#39;t want me to survive, they are trying to silence me. They know my posts don&amp;#39;t conform to their idea of &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot;. My humor is to advanced for the normies. I feel like I am going to have to take drastic measures if things do not turn around soon. I can&amp;#39;t fight the Reddit echo chamber on my own. Not now at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just need some advice from others that have been silenced on this fascist website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please don&amp;#39;t comment telling me I am not funny because that is objectively not true. Even in high school all of the popular kids would come to me at the lunch table and would ask me to tell my jokes. Sometimes they would dare me to eat gross stuff and I would do it and they were always cracking up and laughing so it&amp;#39;s clear that I do have a history of being funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: THIS WAS ORIGINALLY MEANT TO BE POSTED IN THE R/CIRCLEJERK SUB BUT IT WAS AUTOMATICALLY REMOVED AS SOON AS 8 POSTED IT. THIS FURTHER PROVES MY POINT THERE IS A CONSPIRACY AGAINST ME. MY WIFE, AUTO, AND CLEARLY REDDIT ARE TRYING TO SILENCE ME. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: I am now attempting to post this again in the sub its intended to be posted in. I posted this my profile after it was AUTOMATICALLY deleted but seems I have not been able to reach anyone with my cry for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silenced before I could even speak, alas I am back to try again and speak up against the injustices being committed on this website. Please do not be compliant with these slights against my character. Please updoot this post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After researching a lot of schools, and seeing what they require, I realize that a lot of schools will not accept online science prerequisite courses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I am doing the basic biology and chemistry courses online through a community college, but I will be taking the organics and bios through a university in class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is, how many of you have taken online prerequisites and found that it may have hindered on your application or MCAT score? had it come up in an interview?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks guys.&lt;/p&gt;

Like many other people right now, I was finally diagnosed with ADHD which gave me a lot of clarity as to why I love learning and business but struggled so hard in school. I now feel ready to get my MBA, a lifelong dream that didn't seem possible. 

Now that I am applying for school I require my bachelor's diploma from the Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale. I graduated in 2007 and the school closed in 2019. I have exhausted all resources in trying to find it and no one knows anything about where my records could be. Here is a list of the institutions and people I have contacted. 

1. Parchment: they don't have the record and can see many other requests with the same issue
2. Florida Dept of Education:	Susan Hood is the contact and they say that they have never held nor do they know who holds the records for these institutions
3. Database of Accredited Postsecondary Institutions and Programs: sent me back to Parchment and has no other answers federal government doesn't require any specific actions for schools to follow nor do they hold records
4. US Student Aid Offices: no answer despite numerous calls
5. National Student Clearinghouse: They have my transcript records but I haven't been able to get them on the phone since they are always closed.
6. Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools: Closed
7. Database of Accredited Postsecondary Institutions and Programs: sent me back to Parchment and has no other asnwers
8. Closed School Monthly Report:	Andrew Lawrence is the contact on that document but the number goes straight to voicemail with no return calls yet.
9. Dream Center Education Holdings: They don't have a contact number or website anymore. I have started sending messages to any old employees I can find.

,MBA,"Hi everyone! Wanted to ask your thoughts for some of the best admission consultants for Havard / Stanford MBA? Really only want to try for this two as the opportunity cost for attending an MBA won‚Äôt make sense for other schools. For background - female in traditional tech IB + PE and don‚Äôt necessarily need MBA for promotion. But since there are way too many traditional IB + PE background, want to have an admission consultant to help me get into H / S. 

Some of the info I have gathered: most people recommend using applicant lab as it has a lot of useful resources. 

If people have previous experience working with below consultants, will really appreciate you share your honest feedback! 

Consultants:
Katy Lewis - MBA Admission - heard people spoke highly of her especially for people only want to H / S / W 
Menlo Coaching - pretty famous in the IB / PE world. Heard David white is famous but I heard if you sign package with them you might not able to work with him but might be assigned to other consultants? 
Dawn Clare - Currently have her own firm SPISE BLISS and previously working at Stacy Black Consulting

Others:
- heard Maxx Associates are good for application materials?
- also people have recommended Leland as there are lots of more reason Havard / Stanford MBA who have more reasonable pricing; can find some MBA with similar background that might be helpful

- when looking for the consultant, what are some of the things I should look at and questions I should ask to maximize my chance? Want to have an idea what questions / things I should know before schedule a free consultation call with them.

,mac,"**MBA 2020 M1, 13'', 8 GB, Sonoma**

Recently I am having the following issue: I work with an external monitor and everything is fine. But from time to time I have to disconnect it and move somewhere else in my apartment to work only on my laptop without any external device connected to it. Every time I disconnect the external monitor and use ""Mission Control"" to switch between apps, the apps windows are extremely small and almost not visible.

This issue is persistent, just the size of the icons varies. Two days ago I had the issue that the windows of the opened applications were disappearing completely in the background with Mission Control, as if I had an empty desktop. 

Here is an example: [https://ibb.co/FWqmgpb](https://ibb.co/FWqmgpb)

I googled everywhere but couldn't find any solution. Does someone know why this happens and how to fix it?

Restarting my MacbookAir solves the issue, but this is not a real long term solution.

,MBA,"Hi all. I'm an incoming M7 full time student on the high functioning autism spectrum. I can ""mask"" pretty well to the point most people cannot explicitly ""tell"" that I am autistic. People usually think I'm just nerdy or weird. 

Growing up I had poor eye contact, inability to understand sarcasm, a monotone &amp; robotic voice, poor timing in group conversations, poor hand-eye coordination and clumsiness, inability to understand fashion sense, taking people's comments literally, executive dysfunction, and inability to read the room and drone on about niche special interests I have. I also have trouble with facial expressions, body postures, and gestures. 

I spend a lot of time and effort having to learn these things to survive in the corporate world, so now I am good at ""masking"" and being able to fake them. I can speak social skills with an accent now. But occasionally, my quirks do come out and it is nice being able to have moments to be my fully authentic awkward and nerdy self. 

I realize the M7 MBA experience is heavily social. So I wanted to ask your guyses advice if it's better to keep my autism hidden, or if I should casually mention it to people so they're aware and understand my symptoms. 

Unfortunately, there still is a ""stigma"" when people hear the word autism, and when I disclosed I had it in the past at work, I noticed people alternatively avoiding me or infantilizing me. There is a lot of stigma and misinformation around ""high functioning autism."" I know MBA programs are being on DEI, so hopefully the environment is more accepting, but you don't know. 

At my second job, I didn't disclose, and people just thought I was a weird nerdy guy. That did get me in some trouble when I took things a bit too literally or misinterpreted social cues like when someone was finished with a convo but got annoyed that I kept the convo going.

,arbeitsleben,"Guten Abend zusammen,

ich w√ºrde mich ausgesprochen freuen, wenn Ihr (insbesondere die Personaler unter euch) mir zur nachfolgenden Thematik eure Meinungen mitteilen w√ºrdet.

Anfang diesen Jahres habe ich meinen Fachwirt absolvieren k√∂nnen, sodass ich durch den Fachwirt endlich die Hochschulzugangsberechtigung erlangt habe.

Nun m√∂chte ich diese M√∂glichkeit wahrnehmen und im Wintersemester diesen Jahres mit einem berufsbegleitenden Studium beginnen.

Im Zuge der Auswahl des Studiengangs und der Universit√§t habe ich herausgefunden, dass ich die M√∂glichkeit habe an einigen wenigen Hochschulen ein MBA Fernstudium anzugehen (z.B Graduate School Rhein-Neckar - MBA Logistics).

Alternativ w√ºrde ich gerne meinen Bachelor an der Frankfurt school oder FOM ( in Business Administration) absolvieren. Aufgrund des Fachwirtes werden mir hier einige Leistungen angerechnet, sodass ich lediglich 3-4 Semester studieren muss.

Nun die Frage an euch: Was findet Ihr ist sinnvoller?

Wie kommt die Absolvierung eines MBAs auf unkonventionelle weise (ohne Abitur &amp; ohne Bachelor) im HR Bereich an? 

Ist ein MBA an einer derart unbekannten Hochschule √ºberhaupt etwas Wert?

Faktisch gesehen w√ºrde ich mit dem MBA Studium einen h√∂heren Abschluss besitzen. Fraglich ist ob dies auch so wahrgenommen wird.

Falls es eine Rolle spielt - Beruflich bin ich Regionaler Supply Chain Analyst bei einem IGM Unternehmen. Ich bin 25 Jahre alt und hab neben einer Ausbildung (Logistik) einige Weiterbildungen im Bereich der Buchhaltung absolviert.

(Durch das Studium erhoffe ich mir einen gr√∂√üeren Schritt in der Beruflichen Karriere zu machen (Head of Supply Chain Management, Supply Chain Manager in einem Dax-Unternehmen, gr√∂√üere Beratungsfirma o.√§.))

Ich freue mich auf eure Antworten :-)!

,consulting,"

Have you ever come across those self-proclaimed ""consulting gurus"" who boast about their brief stint at a prestigious consulting firm ( MBBs) only to turn around and sell overpriced courses promising to unveil the secrets of landing a job at top-tier firms? Unfortunately, this trend has become all too common, and it's time to shed light on the truth behind these exploitative practices.

Many individuals who spend a year or two at firms like McKinsey, Bain, or BCG as analysts or associates often emerge with an inflated sense of expertise. They may have worked long hours and gained valuable experience, but the notion that such a short tenure equates to mastery is misleading at best and disingenuous at worst.

What's even more concerning is how these individuals leverage their limited experience to market themselves as authorities in the consulting industry. Suddenly, they're launching social media channels, peddling courses, and establishing their so-called ""consulting academies."" They claim to possess insider knowledge that can only be obtained through their channels, effectively rendering other reputable MBA programs obsolete in their narrative. 

According to them MBAs are worthless bcz they are overpriced and only if you get into Harvard/ GSB it is worth investing for the degree.

Let's be clear: while their experiences may hold some value, they do not warrant the exorbitant prices they charge for their courses or coaching services. Moreover, the idea that only their connections and insights can secure a coveted position at MBB firms is not only misleading but also detrimental to aspiring consultants.

It's time to call out these opportunistic practices for what they are: exploitation of aspirants who are eager to break into the consulting industry. The glamorous facade they present, highlighting the perks of the consultant lifestyle while conveniently omitting the grueling hours and demanding workload, is a disservice to those who invest their time and money in hopes of realizing their career aspirations.

Instead of falling prey to these schemes, aspiring consultants should focus on reputable resource and networking opportunities that provide genuine insights and guidance.

,Advice,"I'm 22M, I live in India, I graduated last year with a degree in commerce.  
I got myself a job right after college through some personal links and joined the startup as a sales and marketing guy( I basically did everything they wanted me to do Tele-calling, distributing pamphlets, getting cigs for my bosses, you name it I did it) although I never complained on anything and thought this is what I need to go through but eventually I got exhausted as I wasn't getting anywhere and I left the startup.

,MBA,"I am 24, 3 years out of college currently making $125k doing Technical BA/PM work at a bank in NYC. My undergrad GPA was 3.0 from a decent state school. Given my mediocre undergrad GPA and my passion for technology and business (which I didn't have until I started working), I'm eager to challenge myself with a part-time MBA from an ivy while continuing to work full time. I would likely want to specialize in Tech Operations &amp; Management / Business Analytics. My career goals are roles such as Product Manager, Direct of IT Management, Technical Program Manager, Director of Data Analytics, etc... as far as industries, I am open to staying in the IT side of Financial Services or pivoting to Tech.  

The problem I'm facing is cost and future ROI. My employer will only sponsor up to $10k a year, which will be around like \~15% of the total tuition assuming I take around 3 years to complete.

That's around $150k I'll have to pay out of pocket with loans. I guess I'm wondering if my salary will actually increase more if I do the MBA vs. if I just stayed at my job and got more experience. My salary progression out of undergrad is already pretty great - (50k --&gt; 80k --&gt; 125k in less than 3 years).

I believe I can do a lot better right now, in terms of role responsibility and salary, but I could just be impatient. My thought process is an MBA will help me break the barrier and will help me stand out to more competitive firms.

Despite matching at my #1 program with an in-house fellowship, they matched other candidates. Research opportunities and mentorship have been hard to come by as well. My app I thought was decent with around 20 abstracts and case reports (generally low-quality tbh).

I was initially resolved to re-apply and I have an external PGY-4 Chief Resident position lined up which I am somewhat excited about, and I hope the Chief status will make a difference in having more eyes view my app. I am also thinking of dual-applying to Cards and PCCM perhaps this upcoming year because I think trying to match into something versus not matching again (and maybe going to do an HF year or some other CV builder for a few more years) I don‚Äôt think I could stomach any further delay in completing my training.

Law school cost comparison and additional masters 

Hello,
I need to decide on law school or taking a gap year next year. I am quite lost right now to be honest.
I got into my target law school in my home state of Idaho. This is where my family and friends are and I want to live in the state long term. I can live at home my dad said and get free rent and most free food. I also have a car here too which is nice!
The price of law school is about $25k a year and they said that they would throw in a graduate degree either an MBA or a masters in accounting for $10k a year and finish both in three years. 
Is there a benefit to either the MBA or Masters in accounting?
Is it possible to get a job with a law degree and make good money? I don‚Äôt want to be broke my entire life lol.
I am in undergrad and am finishing with 0 debt cause I worked like three jobs but in law school I will have to take out a loan and could be $100k in the hole.
Just worried and want some advice.
Should I take a gap year and try and get my LSAT up to get kore scholarship money. I don‚Äôt really want to do this but I just wanted some advice about it all
Is $25k a lot for law school?
Thanks you all!

,MBA,"Hello all,

Looking for some perspective - this is a new account &amp; my first post on Reddit.

I was admitted to an M7 through a deferred-enrollment program a couple of years ago and will be attending this fall. I‚Äôve spent the past two years in coverage investment banking &amp; enjoyed working under the apprenticeship of our best MD. My favorite parts of the job have been working with smart, resourceful founder-owners, coming up with creative solutions for their asks within the industry, and presenting these conclusions in a concise and data-driven manner. I understand that I am young to be beginning an MBA but I feel ready to get a jump-start on the rest of my career.

My question is - what next? I would definitely consider coming back to IB as an MBA associate, but I‚Äôve never tried anything else and don‚Äôt want to pigeon-hole myself too early. I did some light recruiting for PE but found its granular and highly-technical nature to be tiring. I am most interested in VC or entrepreneurship (perhaps with a cohort from my MBA class) but I worry that it wouldn‚Äôt pay well enough to cover the cost of going back to school. 

I appreciate that I am privileged to be in this position, and I want to make sure that I don‚Äôt waste this opportunity to explore exciting paths and set myself up for meaningful success. My goal in ~10 years would be to have a successful career that I can balance with starting a young family and a house on a lake. How would you recommend that I use my next two years in grad school to get there?

,MBA,"I am sharing my experience with the application process to encourage others who do not have amazing GPA or test scores to shoot their shot. It IS possible to get an admit to a top program without amazing stats. But know that the odds are stacked against you.

I started my journey at the end of 2022 with the intention of commissioning in the Air Force as a Medical Services Corps officer. Coincidentally, the program also requires GMAT/GRE test scores. My professional background is in journalism so my math skills were not only atrophied from disuse but also weak from the get go.

I studied for six months with a total of some 250 hours of study before taking the GMAT and started from the ground up. A solid foundation in arithmetic, exponents, and number properties was necessary catch up before moving on to more advanced topics, so that is where I focused my time.

My first try at the GMAT I scored a 28Q 39V, even after study. With such a dismal test score I still had a long road ahead of me.

I continued to study and put in another 200 hours between TTP and Gregmat and switched to the GRE because the math portion is easier. By April 2023 I scored a 156Q 164V. Still not amazing but it passes the bar. I decided to also apply to MBA programs in case I wasn't selected for an Air Force commission. I continued to study until December and took the GRE two more times over that period but wasn't able to meaningfully improve my score.

Rejected without interview: Harvard, Stanford, Booth, Sloan, Columbia, Stern  
Interview Waived, TBD: Kellogg  
Admitted: Wharton ($$$)

Background: Worked at a no-name tech startup in the UK as a project manager. Was later dispatched to India to start a 10-person outsourcing office. Then worked as a journalist at a small publication covering crypto and was eventually promoted to editor-in-chief. Went on to become the editor-in-chief and then CEO of another crypto publication. Grew the company to 20 employees with a few million in annual revenue. ORM (Asian/White) 3.6 GPA in accounting from a state school.

I attribute my admit to Wharton as a combination of luck and a novel background. Working as a professional writer helped me write unique essays that helped me stand out. Even so, I was dinged without interview for most of the programs I applied to. I imagine my low stats meant that I was filtered out early on in the application process for many schools. If you have low scores expect your ding rate to be much higher. But if you're okay with that, know there is still hope!

For those who were dinged from Wharton, know that it does not reflect your value as a person or competency as a professional. If you did your best and were still dinged that is not a reflection on you. The entire process has affirmed my suspicion that selection is largely arbitrary. Even without an MBA, everyone who is deranged enough to fixate on this subreddit likely has the drive (and neuroticism lol) to have a successful career.",t2_9igvm00p,False,,0.0,False,Wharton Admit 320 GRE - Thoughts on 'Holistic' Application Process,[],r/MBA,False,6.0,,0.0,,,True,t3_1bofqdy,False,light,1.0,,public,1.0,0.0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Admissions,False,1.0,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1711479182.0,text,6.0,,,text,self.MBA,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am sharing my experience with the application process to encourage others who do not have amazing GPA or test scores to shoot their shot.

,MBA,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm in the process of deciding what program to attend. I‚Äôm an international student (currently at BCG). Want to explore entrepreneurship while pursuing an MBA. My backup plan is going back to consulting post MBA.

Some questions:

- Is it really worth paying $200k for Wharton vs $100k at CBS? My sense is one can recover the $100k over a few years but the current economic situation is concerning )
(to say the least)
- Does Wharton negotiate (given I have scholarships at 2 colleges already)?

,MBA,"Very appreciative in advance for your thoughts. I'm in the process of exploring online MBA programs and would like genuine thoughts on my info provided, comments on programs I'm looking into and recommendations of other programs, and any adivce or suggestions on how to succeed in admissions or anything related. (Bonus points for comments if you are an alumni of any programs listed.)

Me: 34M, located in South East US, married with no kids

Undergrad: Bachelor of Chem Eng. from SEC university

GPA: Low...under 2.25 low

Experience: 8 years in automotive manufacturing as a Process Engineer. Currently Process Engineer of 3 years at one of Big 3 automotive companies. Manages teams of 4-10 union technicians depending on job function. 

No GMAT/GRE scores

Financial assistance: $8000/calendar yr from current employer

Why MBA:

1. Immediate term - Provides me with new, different perspective to solving problems (financial, statistical, qualitative) in current position. Will also help broaden business knowledge. 

2. Short/medium term - I've been told technical mind + business sense = optics of ""well-rounded"" engineer and employee. Gives competitive edge over counterparts and applicants for potential promotions/job changes, and opens doors to senior-level/management opportunities

3. Long term - Management opportunities within current industry, as well as opportunities outside of manufacturing or automotive industry altogether

On list of interest - Online programs from Kansas, Auburn, OK State, Nebraska, both Umass Lowell and Amherst, Arizona, AZ State, Utah, Illinois (thanks to this sub's positive comments on the program), USF, Louisville, and Ball State

Also considering - Vanderbilt exec. MBA (about an hour from hometown. While presitgious, it is expensive, and weekend courses would be difficult with current work shift rotations.) MBA from local university (close to home and decent network locally and regionally; not as presigious as others.)

Not considering - Indiana (acceptance rate is low, so I'm not bothering to apply); UNC (too expensive); programs requiring residency, unless close to home

Also open to other suggestions or approaches, online or otherwise.

I love what I do, but would also love a position in the future where I'm not on the manufacturing floor and rotating shifts full time. What that looks like in or outside of my current industry, I have no idea but am willing to explore those down the road. Would also really like to avoid a stint in Michigan and stay in the South. Do I absolutely need an MBA to achieve all of these goals? Not necessarily. But attaining an MBA definitely does not hurt in trying to achieve them, as well as continued success in my current role, even allowing me to excel if an opportunity arises. I'm just fortunate to be in a positive financial and professional spot where I can possibly attain an MBA to help me move forward and upward in my career or even out of an exhaustive industry.",t2_7zryfp8d,False,,0.0,False,Engineer look for MBA?,[],r/MBA,False,6.0,,0.0,,,True,t3_1bofhz5,False,light,1.0,,public,1.0,0.0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Profile Review,False,1.0,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1711478611.0,text,6.0,,,text,self.MBA,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very appreciative in advance for your thoughts.

Seller said it needs OS install, and there are two keys missing from the keyboard. Also said something vague about something internal needing replacement but he couldn‚Äôt remember what it was, just that it was causing the MacBook to run very slowly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway before I go putting any money into this I wanted to see if I could at least get macOS installed onto it. Tried internet recovery a few times but it just hangs and won‚Äôt progress. Except for one time, when it gave me an error code -2003F. Couldn‚Äôt find much on this on google. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Abandoning the internet recovery idea, I made a Sonoma USB installer last night on my own MBP. Tried it on the MBA this morning with the help of a USB-C hub, and as you can see in the first picture the laptop can see the installer and I can select it. The following pictures show what happens though, it seems to want to force itself into internet recovery for some reason. I log into my WiFi, but it just sits there like I‚Äôve shown in the third picture. So I‚Äôm stuck.

,MBA,"I am sharing my experience with the application process to encourage others who may not have the best GPA or test scores. It IS possible to get an admit to a top program without amazing stats. But know that the odds are stacked against you (see [https://www.mba-stats.com/](https://www.mba-stats.com/)).

I started my journey at the end of 2022 with the intention of commissioning in the Air Force as a Medical Services Corps officer. Coincidentally, the program also requires GMAT/GRE test scores. My professional background is in journalism, so my math skills were not only atrophied from disuse but also weak from the get go.

I studied for six months with a total of some 250 hours of study before taking the GMAT and started from the ground up. I knew a solid foundation in arithmetic, exponents, and number properties was necessary catch up before moving on to more advanced topics, so that is where I focused my time.

My first try at the GMAT I scored a 28Q 39V, even after study. With such a dismal test score I still had a long road ahead of me.

I continued to study and put in another 200 hours between Target Test Prep and Gregmat and switched to the GRE because the math portion is easier. By April 2023 I scored a 156Q 164V. Still not amazing but it passes the bar. I decided to also apply to MBA programs in case I wasn't selected for an Air Force commission. I continued to study until December and took the GRE two more times over that period but wasn't able to meaningfully improve my score.

Rejected without interview: Harvard, Stanford, Booth, Sloan, Columbia, Stern  
Interview Waived, TBD: Kellogg  
Admitted: Wharton ($$$)

Background: Worked at a no-name tech startup in the UK as a project manager. Was later dispatched to India to start an 10-person outsourcing office. Then worked as a journalist at a small publication covering crypto and was eventually promoted to editor-in-chief. Went on to become the editor-in-chief and then CEO of another crypto publication. Grew the company to 20 employees with a few million in annual revenue. ORM (Asian/White), 3.6 undergrad GPA in accounting from a state school.

I attribute my admit to Wharton as a combination of luck and a novel background. Working as a professional writer helped me write unique essays that helped me stand out. Even so, I was dinged without interview for most of the programs I applied to. I imagine my low stats meant that I was filtered out early on in the application process for many schools. If you have low scores expect your ding rate to be much higher. But if you're okay with that, know there is still hope!

For those who were dinged from Wharton, know that it does not reflect your value as a person or competency as a professional. If you did your best and were still dinged that is not a reflection on you. The entire process has affirmed my suspicion that selection is largely arbitrary.

Asking on behalf of a friend who's currently facing a tough decision regarding her MBA admission. She's been accepted into several colleges including BITSOM, GLIM Chennai, IMI, and SDA Bocconi Asia Center (all through GMAT)

She's seeking some advice on which school might be the best fit for her given her background of around 4 years of Software Development Engineer (SDE) experience in an MNC with a CS BTech.

Hello,
I need to decide on law school or taking a gap year next year. I am quite lost right now to be honest.
I got into my target law school in my home state of Idaho. This is where my family and friends are and I want to live in the state long term. I can live at home my dad said and get free rent and most free food. I also have a car here too which is nice!
The price of law school is about $25k a year and they said that they would throw in a graduate degree either an MBA or a masters in accounting for $10k a year and finish both in three years. 
Is there a benefit to either the MBA or Masters in accounting?
Is it possible to get a job with a law degree and make good money? I don‚Äôt want to be broke my entire life lol.
I am in undergrad and am finishing with 0 debt cause I worked like three jobs but in law school I will have to take out a loan and could be $100k in the hole.
Just worried and want some advice.
Should I take a gap year and try and get my LSAT up to get kore scholarship money. I don‚Äôt really want to do this but I just wanted some advice about it all

&lt;p&gt;Hello,
I need to decide on law school or taking a gap year next year. I am quite lost right now to be honest.
I got into my target law school in my home state of Idaho. This is where my family and friends are and I want to live in the state long term. I can live at home my dad said and get free rent and most free food. I also have a car here too which is nice!
The price of law school is about $25k a year and they said that they would throw in a graduate degree either an MBA or a masters in accounting for $10k a year and finish both in three years. 
Is there a benefit to either the MBA or Masters in accounting?
Is it possible to get a job with a law degree and make good money? I don‚Äôt want to be broke my entire life lol.
I am in undergrad and am finishing with 0 debt cause I worked like three jobs but in law school I will have to take out a loan and could be $100k in the hole.
Just worried and want some advice.
Should I take a gap year and try and get my LSAT up to get kore scholarship money. I don‚Äôt really want to do this but I just wanted some advice about it all
Is $25k a lot for law school?
Thanks you all! &lt;/p&gt;

I've been out of school for about a year and currently work a position that is not in scm, it is on the financial side of Healthcare Operations.

My main concern is that if I get the MS, then I'm stuck in supply chain after that and can't change careers if I ever want to for whatever reason. 

Pros of the MBA are that it's more general so I can look for other jobs not just in supply chain, and an MBA does allow for a lot of opportunities. However the costs are significantly higher than the MS.

,india,"Hello everybody, I hope you all  are doing good. I really needed some career advice because I feel stuck in my current scenario and I'm not sure how to proceed from here

To give some context about myself, I'm 27, pursued B.Tech in undergrad in I.T. and graduated in 2019. Got into a company through campus placements, a regular I.T. job which I pursued till March 2022. 

Ever since I started working, I developed a strong interest in what the HR team does through various activities that the HR team conducts and I felt I had an interest in this, and I felt I would enjoy doing something 'for' the people- I wasn't great at coding either so I didn't see a future for myself in I.T. very honestly. An opportunity  came by where they were looking to hire someone in HR internally, and I gladly made the switch. 

One reason why I also wanted to switch to HR was that I always wanted to pursue masters and because of my growing interest in HR, I was sort of  clear in my head that I would eventually go ahead for an MBA in HR after gaining some hands on experience in HR.  Now, 2 years down the line from 2022 to 2024, I've tried writing multiple entrances for masters, but unfortunately ,Ive not succeeded in getting a tier 1 college for HR. I really feel I don't want to settle in for a tier 2 college now, particularly because  I've a good amount of work experience, hitting close to 5 years,  plus the ROI from a tier 2 college will not make sense at that this stage of my career. 

My current company doesn't give any sort of increments if you make an internal switch like I did, hence monetary wise, I've not gained anything because of switching the way I did. 

Even though I like my work more than what I  was doing earlier in tech, I am nowhere close to be earning as much as people my age in HR are earning. Hence, In order to grow my career, just like everybody else, I tried applying for jobs outside but I've not recieved a positive reply from anywhere. I'm guessing this may be because I'm not a masters holder and probably they reject me because of that. Also, the domain that I got selected  for in HR ( compensations but not entirely C&amp;B), Is I believe a niche skill for which the companies outside look for someone who's highly experienced and a God from Tier 1 MBA college, which I feel could be another reason why I'm not getting any calls from anywhere
 
Now, I don't really understand what to do because   neither am I getting calls from outside and neither could I make it to top HR mba colleges like SCMHRD or XLRI.  With age not on my side (sort of) , I'm really worried about how do I progress from here. One thing I know for sure is that I want to continue in HR itself. So jumping to some other department doesn't really excite me. 

So if there's anybody who can relate to this and got out of this- I'd be really thankful if you could give me some career advice on what should I do from here and how can I grow, because at this stage I honestly feel very helpess. 

Thank you for taking the time out to read such a big post. Wishing you all the luck and lots of love.

,IndianFootball,"After today's loss, I'm sure all of us are pretty embarrassed. Today's game was nothing but a misery, with the players lacking the passion to play for the badge and the coach failing to own up to his shortcomings.

For me, it's a heartbreaking scene as I once aspired to play for this nation (could only make it to my state's second division though). I have since completed my BBA and I'm looking to do an MBA in Sports Management whilst obtaining my D-License coaching certification as well.

I don't know if this is the right place to ask this but I want to know how can one individual try and turn things from the better. I'd love to one day manage the Indian National Team because I can't stomach a failed coach to do it for us. 

I'm going to be giving CAT and entrances abroad for the MBA and I'm looking to get into the coaching aspect as well by working for some local teams in my state. Do you feel it's achievable or is it just a pipe dream?

&lt;p&gt;For me, it&amp;#39;s a heartbreaking scene as I once aspired to play for this nation (could only make it to my state&amp;#39;s second division though).

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if this is the right place to ask this but I want to know how can one individual try and turn things from the better. I&amp;#39;d love to one day manage the Indian National Team because I can&amp;#39;t stomach a failed coach to do it for us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to be giving CAT and entrances abroad for the MBA and I&amp;#39;m looking to get into the coaching aspect as well by working for some local teams in my state. Do you feel it&amp;#39;s achievable or is it just a pipe dream?&lt;/p&gt;

,u_appledispatch,"I've seen a number of questions and posts from users wondering whether to get one of the new M3 Airs or the M3 MacBook Pro 14-inch. 

One of the most important considerations is making sure whatever model you choose has enough RAM and SSD capacity. The real ""baseline"" should probably be 16GB (18GB for M3 Pro chip), and 512SSD for most users. Video editors should definitely be considering the MBP 14"" with the better ProMotion display and fans for prolonged CPU usage. Since the MBP has been out longer, you can find good deals around at various retailers like Costco, which puts the MBP 14"" close in price to a similarly configured MBA 15"".

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important considerations is making sure whatever model you choose has enough RAM and SSD capacity. The real &amp;quot;baseline&amp;quot; should probably be 16GB (18GB for M3 Pro chip), and 512SSD for most users. Video editors should definitely be considering the MBP 14&amp;quot; with the better ProMotion display and fans for prolonged CPU usage. Since the MBP has been out longer, you can find good deals around at various retailers like Costco, which puts the MBP 14&amp;quot; close in price to a similarly configured MBA 15&amp;quot;. The 13-inch Air offers a great balance between capability, portability and price if you are not doing heavy video editing.&lt;/p&gt;

,macbookair,"I‚Äôm about to purchase a business and will be taking over the bookkeeping duties for at least a year using quickbooks online. 

My only experiences with Macs (other than my iPhone) was with a 13inch MBP for about a year with my old job. Circa 2021 and I really liked it so I want to get a MBA for this company going forward. 

Will a MBA 13 be okay? Or should I flex to the 15? Anyone use quickbooks online with their Air? When I‚Äôm at the home office I‚Äôll be hooked up to a 27inch HP monitor while using my MacBook as a second monitor. 

I hesitate with the 15inch because my current work machine is a 15inch Dell and I loath the size of it. The MBA 15 is smaller than this Dell. But I don‚Äôt feel like the extra screen size is worth the loss in portability. I‚Äôll be working from my truck or a job site maybe 10-15% of the time.

,Entrepreneur,"10 months ago, I worked shop floor at Zara and had ZERO knowledge of what it takes to start, let alone operate a business. Today, I hit my 100th customer and $10k MRR and I'm on cloud 9. Having a mentor in my industry has been invaluable and at least for me, was absolutely the best thing I could've done for myself.

[Puppy Tax](https://imgur.com/undefined) 

Not suggesting this is a miracle cure but just sharing my experience with [Oneday MBA](http://oneday.io) incase it can be helpful to anyone. 

For context, Oneday is an 18 month programme where you build your business idea 1 on 1 with a mentor that you are matched with, who's already built a successful business in the same industry you're interested in.  You are also part of a cohort of around 8 other students working with your mentor so you have group sessions too. Over the 18 month period, you work through a syllabus (practically hands on learning only, no essays/coursework/exams) and at the end, you hopefully have a successful revenue generating business and an accredited MBA. In my case I wasn't eligible for the MBA since I haven't got a BA but it does mean the programme is held to high standards. It's also part time (about 6 hours/week) so you don't have to commit full time to it.   
I came across them through an IG Ad for a free webinar to join to find out more. Their website is really good but I was super sceptical about anything to do with 'programme' or 'accelerator' - this ad was filmed with an entrepreneur who's well known in the UK called Levi Roots so I bought into it a little more. At the time, working in retail I was drained and wanted to quit and joined one of the webinars thinking I've got nothing to lose. There was a guy leading the webinar who was one of the mentors (not mine) - his name was Mike. He was friendly, engaging and seemed to know what he was talking about. I feel bad now but I was super standoffish on that call üòÇ I was honestly on full alert if it was scam.  
The call was good, the curriculum made sense and the concept was straightforward - they had good case studies and the mentors Mike introduced seemed really good. Their academic board was also super impressive with people from Stanford, Howard, Brown etc. Also with it being a Ltd Company, I felt comfortable that I'd at least have some route of protection if anything goes wrong. I looked up a bunch of their employees on LinkedIn and they looked like they had solid backgrounds (Tesla, Uber, Gymshark, Deliveroo etc).  
At the end of the call, they offered a 1 on 1 opportunity to talk to Mike about your business idea. Again since it was free, i thought fck it and signed up for that. At this point, I didn't actually have a business idea. I just knew that if I was going to start something, I wanted it to be e-com.  
I joined the call with Mike a few days later who challenged me on why e-com.

The call ended and it genuinely just got me thinking about what I wanted to do.  
Fast forward a week and I decided to just go through the application process and see what happens. I will say that their sales team at the time were probably not as good as they are now. I had two different people emailing me at the same time which felt a little unprofessional but maybe it's because I signed up in two different places (webinar and website). I had a few calls with the admissions team, who eventually sent me a proposal that would partner me with an e-com specialist mentor (they decide who you are partnered with although I think you can change if you really want to). It came to the point of discussing payment options and the best plan for me was a monthly payment of around 220/month. I spent another week deciding what to do but eventually signed up.  
It was the best decision I made.  
My mentor, Greg is a god send. He founded a company called Milk Room and also helped raise $70m in VC capital for small businesses. More than any of that, he's the best person at holding me accountable for my growth as an entrepreneur. I meet with him every single week. He's never missed a week, never even been a second late to our calls. He's full of energy, he's very direct and we get a lot covered. He is genuinely passionate about my idea and has helped me so much without ever making me feel like I'm being stupid or asking basic questions. He's helped me actually generate revenue in my business, he's helped me build a really good website and build a great user experience. All things that I literally had no idea or would take me years to learn myself. I'm running my first influencer marketing campaign next week and he's set that up with me. I actually understand the theory behind everything.  
My squad is also awesome. There are 8 of us all being mentored by Greg so we regularly speak and have class sessions together outside of our 1-1s. We challenge each others ideas and help each other in areas where we're not so strong. One of my classmates actually helped my get a manufacturer in her homeland of Philippines.

Today, I hit my 100th customer and $10k MRR and I&amp;#39;m on cloud 9. Having a mentor in my industry has been invaluable and at least for me, was absolutely the best thing I could&amp;#39;ve done for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/undefined""&gt;Puppy Tax&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not suggesting this is a miracle cure but just sharing my experience with &lt;a href=""http://oneday.io""&gt;Oneday MBA&lt;/a&gt; incase it can be helpful to anyone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For context, Oneday is an 18 month programme where you build your business idea 1 on 1 with a mentor that you are matched with, who&amp;#39;s already built a successful business in the same industry you&amp;#39;re interested in.  You are also part of a cohort of around 8 other students working with your mentor so you have group sessions too. Over the 18 month period, you work through a syllabus (practically hands on learning only, no essays/coursework/exams) and at the end, you hopefully have a successful revenue generating business and an accredited MBA. In my case I wasn&amp;#39;t eligible for the MBA since I haven&amp;#39;t got a BA but it does mean the programme is held to high standards. It&amp;#39;s also part time (about 6 hours/week) so you don&amp;#39;t have to commit full time to it.&lt;br/&gt;
I came across them through an IG Ad for a free webinar to join to find out more. Their website is really good but I was super sceptical about anything to do with &amp;#39;programme&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;accelerator&amp;#39; - this ad was filmed with an entrepreneur who&amp;#39;s well known in the UK called Levi Roots so I bought into it a little more. At the time, working in retail I was drained and wanted to quit and joined one of the webinars thinking I&amp;#39;ve got nothing to lose. There was a guy leading the webinar who was one of the mentors (not mine) - his name was Mike. He was friendly, engaging and seemed to know what he was talking about. I feel bad now but I was super standoffish on that call üòÇ I was honestly on full alert if it was scam.&lt;br/&gt;
The call was good, the curriculum made sense and the concept was straightforward - they had good case studies and the mentors Mike introduced seemed really good. Their academic board was also super impressive with people from Stanford, Howard, Brown etc. Also with it being a Ltd Company, I felt comfortable that I&amp;#39;d at least have some route of protection if anything goes wrong. I looked up a bunch of their employees on LinkedIn and they looked like they had solid backgrounds (Tesla, Uber, Gymshark, Deliveroo etc).&lt;br/&gt;
At the end of the call, they offered a 1 on 1 opportunity to talk to Mike about your business idea. Again since it was free, i thought fck it and signed up for that. At this point, I didn&amp;#39;t actually have a business idea. I just knew that if I was going to start something, I wanted it to be e-com.&lt;br/&gt;
I joined the call with Mike a few days later who challenged me on why e-com. I explained for the lifestyle and freedom to work remotely etc - he asked me what I&amp;#39;m passionate about and we started narrowing down on a field I could think about for my business idea - but he also explained that an idea is worthless if there isn&amp;#39;t validated demand for the product, and actually the first module at Oneday takes you throguh demand validation even if you already have an idea.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been a long time user of the 2016 MBP 13&amp;quot; and am now deciding between the 13&amp;quot; vs 15&amp;quot; MBA, as I will be starting law school soon. I&amp;#39;m inclined to get the 15&amp;quot; for the larger screen, as I am anticipating lots of reading and writing, and potentially split-screen working (i.e. documents on one side and notes on the other). A larger screen also seems beneficial for note taking / exams. However, the weight and portability of the 13&amp;quot; is unmatched (I&amp;#39;ve seen both in store briefly). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This laptop will be my primary device used for both school and leisure (mostly just for content consumption), and I will have an external monitor in my room for work outside of the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My question is: has anyone tried the 13&amp;quot; screen with the &amp;quot;More Space&amp;quot; display setting? How does that screen real estate compare to the &amp;quot;Default&amp;quot; display setting on the 15&amp;quot;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

*I am Jonathan from Chennai. 26 years old and a working professional. I am looking for a couple who are in the cuckold lifestyle or wanting to explore the lifestyle in the city.* 

I am moving to Bangalore from next month for my work and want to form a meaningful connection.

*I am not someone who is in a hurry to do things and I know how much commitment and understanding this lifestyle takes. I am not looking for just sex but rather the companionship and friendship of the husband and wife, where we talk about sports, news, how our day was or just enjoy each others company.*

*I feel for any relationship there are 2 key things. Trust and Communication*

***Trust:*** *I totally understand how big of a decision this is and all the problems present especially in the society. I know that trust is earned and it takes time. But i am willing to put in the effort and time needed for that as long as you too are looking for someone good, decent and genuine.*

***Communication:*** *Whatever it is I prefer to speak up and ask. Even while talking I would prefer the three of us to be transparent with each other and this in turn will solve lot of unwanted issues and make the bond stronger.  I prefer we become friends first and understand each other.*

Thank you for reading so far and its only right if i tell about myself.

*I finished my UG here in engineering and worked for 2 years in Bangalore and Hyderabad. After that came back, did my MBA and working in my favorite field.

*Beaches and Pools are my favorites places to relax and unwind. I am a foodie and enjoy trying new dishes and also cook. I try to stay active and hit the gym regularly. I love watching movies and series based on history and also a sucker for good sit-coms. The Office is my go-to.*

,MBA,"For people looking to apply for MBA in the US this year.  
From a current applicant to M7 schools who has, honestly, great professional stories, social impact experience, teaching experience, etc.

Don't fall for admissions saying they want you to be yourself or that the process is holistic, it is not holistic at all and yes, they want you to be yourself but that has nothing to do with raising your chances of getting in.

I'm going to state the OBVIOUS but I was naive enough to believe Admissions on that.

You should pay attention to the essentials:

* GMAT and University GPA
* Years of Full-Time Experience and how well known your employer is

If you have a low gmat (for example, 700, which in general is the lower limit of the 80% of the class) you need to make it up in years of experience (average is 5 years).

In my case in particular I have a 710 classic GMAT and less than 4 years of experience by September. My leadership stories are honestly excellent, I come from a tough STEM graduate program, I managed teams in high impact projects in Tech/Finance industry, worked on social impact with international organizations, taught classes at University and played sports.

I got 1 interview &amp; rejection and 2 waitlists. I think I did well in the interview but it could be that I fucked up there.

TLDR; 

* Admissions isn't looking for true impact or true leadership stories, they want a pretty story, filled with shiny names and fancy projects (even if those projects had no impact). This is understandable since they have to go through thousands of applications each round.
* Don't expect the criteria for admissions to be ""authentic"", play their game or you are in for a rough experience.
* I would definitely hire a consultant but one with many years of experience (&gt; 15 years).

,r4rindia,"*Hi,*

*I am Jonathan from Chennai. 26 years old and a working professional. I am looking for a couple who are in the cuckold lifestyle or wanting to explore the lifestyle in the city.* 

I am moving to Bangalore from next month for my work and want to form a meaningful connection.

*I am not someone who is in a hurry to do things and I know how much commitment and understanding this lifestyle takes. I am not looking for just sex but rather the companionship and friendship of the husband and wife, where we talk about sports, news, how our day was or just enjoy each others company.*

*I feel for any relationship there are 2 key things. Trust and Communication*

***Trust:*** *I totally understand how big of a decision this is and all the problems present especially in the society. I know that trust is earned and it takes time. But i am willing to put in the effort and time needed for that as long as you too are looking for someone good, decent and genuine.*

***Communication:*** *Whatever it is I prefer to speak up and ask. Even while talking I would prefer the three of us to be transparent with each other and this in turn will solve lot of unwanted issues and make the bond stronger.  I prefer we become friends first and understand each other.*

Thank you for reading so far and its only right if i tell about myself.

*I finished my UG here in engineering and worked for 2 years in Bangalore and Hyderabad. After that came back, did my MBA and working in my favorite field. I enjoy speaking with people and understanding them. So much so that my work is also like that. I love reading fiction and anything that involves murder mystery.* 

*Beaches and Pools are my favorites places to relax and unwind. I am a foodie and enjoy trying new dishes and also cook. I try to stay active and hit the gym regularly. I love watching movies and series based on history and also a sucker for good sit-coms. The Office is my go-to.* 

*I am open to verifying myself and answer any questions you might have. My only preference is please be from Chennai or someone who travels regularly to Chennai.* 

*Hoping to connect with you and thank you for taking the time to read.*

So I thought it&amp;#39;d be fun to write it in a mock format just like a resume!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attractive Dutch Indian (a solid 6.5/10) with exceptional ability to create awkward situations out of anything. Possesses impeccable written and verbal communication skills. Energetic for 2 hours a day usually between the hours of 12 a.m. to 2 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experiences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Girl A: ~3 month in High School&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hugged me and said I was cute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assisted her with math homework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What I learned: I&amp;#39;m not gay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Girl B: ~1 year in University&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chemistry lab partner...we sure had a lot of chemistry (Actually physics lab partner that then I can&amp;#39;t make the joke)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disproved me gaming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What I learned: I probably can&amp;#39;t give up gaming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Girl C: ~ 2 weeks meet via Pure App&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only slightly disappointed her eyes isn&amp;#39;t purple irl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What I learned: BDSM is fun and I love being a dom!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Girl D: ~6 month reddit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skype is actually the worst software ever&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What I learned: r4r actually worked!?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;University Undergrad: Engineering 2010-2014&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found out I&amp;#39;m not nerdy enough to play CS but not cool enough to go clubbing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50% labs, 50% assignments, 100% confusing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went to one party then I got bored&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;University Professional degree: MBA Corporate Finance 2017-2019&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can make an excel sheet about everything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have given up hope on humanity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traveling: Been to 25 countries so far&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adventure sports: Bungee jumping, scuba, sky diving, you name it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hiking: Hiked in Switzerland, Scotland, Austria and India&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;ll pretend and add some generic ones&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Books: 50 shades of Stephen King&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercising: Whats really the point of running in one place or climbing a wall just to jump down again?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cooking: ...Fuzz...take out it is...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Runner up on &amp;quot;Best Son 2014 for not bringing shame to the family&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1st Place on &amp;quot;How the hell do you play so much video games and still pass&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Languages spoken&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;English: proficient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spanish: The first line in Despacito&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;French: Limited to Hello, My name is ____, where is the bathroom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mom: If he doesn&amp;#39;t get a GF soon, I will buy one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Best friend: Let&amp;#39;s make a gay pact at 33&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ex-Best friend: Let&amp;#39;s make a gay pact at 27&lt;/li&gt;

Mr. Chris Shields reports

RELIQ HEALTH TECHNOLOGIES, INC. ANNOUNCES ONBOARDING OF NEW MENTAL HEALTH PATIENTS AND MANAGEMENT CHANGES

Reliq Health Technologies Inc. is adding the first 500 patients to its expanded mental health service portfolio and expects to add an additional 10,000 patients by the end of 2024.

""We are very pleased to be adding the first 500 patients in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Florida and Nevada to our new expanded mental health care program,"" said Chris Shields, chief executive officer at Reliq. ""Providing cognitive assessments through iUGO Care will allow clinicians to identify and treat patients with previously undiagnosed mental health needs. Eligible patients will be provided with ongoing behavioural health or collaborative care management services, for which their physician will pay Reliq's standard monthly subscription fees. In addition, patients will receive cognitive assessments twice per year for which their physician will pay Reliq a one-time fee per assessment. The company expects to generate an average revenue of $576 per patient per year or $48 per patient per month for these patients at 70-per-cent gross margin, and expects to add a further 10,000 new patients to our expanded mental health care program by the end of 2024. The high demand for our new expanded mental health care services further demonstrates our products' unique ability to address existing unmet needs in the Medicare patient population. Our clients have consistently expressed high levels of satisfaction with the usability and efficacy of our products and with the cost savings and new revenue streams they realize by offering new services through our iUGO Care platform.""

The company also wishes to announce that it has accepted the resignation of its chief financial officer, Michael Frankel. Following the resignation of Mr. Frankel, the board of directors has appointed Kevin Cornish as the company's chief financial officer.

""We are also delighted to announce the addition of Kevin Cornish to the Reliq management team as the company's chief financial officer,"" continued Mr. Shields. ""Mr. Cornish possesses the critical skills and experience that will enable Reliq to continue to grow its business in size and complexity. Mr. Cornish is an accomplished public company CFO with over 17 years of international leadership experience in finance, strategy and operations. He has worked with multiple start-ups and led successful turnarounds at a diverse group of companies in both Canada and the United States. His experience with public company audits and cross-border businesses will be a tremendous asset to Reliq going forward. Mr. Cornish holds an MBA and a CPA designation.""

,GMAT,"I gave my exam today. Scored 615 (Q84, V78,  DI79). Percentiles were roughly Q84, V42, DI don't remember correctly. Overall percentile was 80. I am sharing this because I received a lot of important insights from reddit and GMAT Club and even if 1 person finds someththing helpful in this post or has any questions, please feel free to ask and I will answer them to the best of my knowledge.

1. Preparation Time - I decided on giving GMAT around 2 months ago but prepared seriously only for the last 1 month. Quant was my strength since beginning, Verbal has always been my weakness and DI somewhere in between (my scores aptly reflect this)
2. Preparation Material - OG books 2023. I solved Quant OG first. My approach was always to learn by solving. If I couldn't solve a problem, only then I would search its formula and try to read a little about that topic. This worked for me because I had past experience of preparing for the Indian MBA entrance exam for which I had taken paid coaching and I remember most of the things from that time (around 2017). Anyway, apart from OG, I used GMAT Club a LOT, I paid 19$ for 1 month use of GMAT Forum Quiz which was really helpful because I could filter and solve questions depending on my needs. For DI- again used GMAT Club questions. After giving 2 official mocks, I realized my weakness is speed, therefore I used Forum Quiz and would filter 20 questions (2 MSR, 5 DS, 5 T&amp;G, 5 TPA) and try to solve them under time pressure, this really helped me understand what to skip for example in my case I was never really good with non math related questions questions would guess them early on to save time and focus on easy questions. My main idea was to finish this section and try to answer all 20 questions. For Verbal- I solved the OG book and then used GMAT Club questions. I really need to improve in this section and any suggestions would be helpful. 
3. Test Experience - I gave my exam in a test centre and my overall experience was good. No major issues to highlight. My approach was Quant, DI break and then Verbal. The overall level of questions was similar to official mocks. Verbal threw me off a little because I always came across 3 RC's and remaining CR questions but my exam had 4 RC's, nothing serious but I was just taken aback a little. DI is really tricky, the time pressure is immense in this section. I wasted 5 minutes for first 2 questions and wasn't sure of getting either correct. I paused for a second, regained my composure, bookmarked these 2 and moved ahead. I'm pretty sure this would happen to a lot of people but it is important to not loose the composure because the pace of this section is too much. I remember reading last week reading another person's experience on this new type of DS questions and yes, I got lengthy, verbose DS questions which present a scenario, followed by the question and then the 2 inputs. It was only because of reading that person's experience that these questions didn't threw me off, 1st of these questions was too damn lengthy, I quickly guessed and moved on. 
4. The break is supposed to be 10 minutes long but trust me it feels way too short in reality because as soon as break begins you have to leave the room and provide palm vein scan and again do this scan before entering (I don't know if this is applicable in all countries, but in my location this takes up a lot of time). Anyway, what I'm trying to say is don't think of break as 10 minutes LONG, more like leave quickly, take a deep breath, drink water, use washroom and be back ASAP. 
5. Mocks - My scores were (all official mocks in mba.com)
Mock 1 - 555
Mock 2 - 535
Mock 3 - 525
Mock 1 retake - 605
Mock 2 retake - 615
I tried to change the sequence of the sections and see how it would affect my performance. Basically I tried to start with Verbal (my weakness) but that affected me a lot because I would keep thinking of my Verbal performance in Quant and DI as well. So, scrapped the idea and went ahead with Quant (my strength), followed by DI, break and end with Verbal.
6. I was aiming for 645 but I fell short, need to see when I can take this exam again and aim for 645.
7. I wish everyone who's planning to take GMAT all the best and hope you all achieve your target scores in the 1st attempt :-)

Scored 615 (Q84, V78,  DI79). Percentiles were roughly Q84, V42, DI don&amp;#39;t remember correctly. Overall percentile was 80. I am sharing this because I received a lot of important insights from reddit and GMAT Club and even if 1 person finds someththing helpful in this post or has any questions, please feel free to ask and I will answer them to the best of my knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preparation Time - I decided on giving GMAT around 2 months ago but prepared seriously only for the last 1 month. Quant was my strength since beginning, Verbal has always been my weakness and DI somewhere in between (my scores aptly reflect this)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preparation Material - OG books 2023. I solved Quant OG first. My approach was always to learn by solving. If I couldn&amp;#39;t solve a problem, only then I would search its formula and try to read a little about that topic. This worked for me because I had past experience of preparing for the Indian MBA entrance exam for which I had taken paid coaching and I remember most of the things from that time (around 2017). Anyway, apart from OG, I used GMAT Club a LOT, I paid 19$ for 1 month use of GMAT Forum Quiz which was really helpful because I could filter and solve questions depending on my needs. For DI- again used GMAT Club questions. After giving 2 official mocks, I realized my weakness is speed, therefore I used Forum Quiz and would filter 20 questions (2 MSR, 5 DS, 5 T&amp;amp;G, 5 TPA) and try to solve them under time pressure, this really helped me understand what to skip for example in my case I was never really good with non math related questions questions would guess them early on to save time and focus on easy questions. My main idea was to finish this section and try to answer all 20 questions. For Verbal- I solved the OG book and then used GMAT Club questions. I really need to improve in this section and any suggestions would be helpful. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test Experience - I gave my exam in a test centre and my overall experience was good. No major issues to highlight. My approach was Quant, DI break and then Verbal. The overall level of questions was similar to official mocks. Verbal threw me off a little because I always came across 3 RC&amp;#39;s and remaining CR questions but my exam had 4 RC&amp;#39;s, nothing serious but I was just taken aback a little. DI is really tricky, the time pressure is immense in this section. I wasted 5 minutes for first 2 questions and wasn&amp;#39;t sure of getting either correct.

,MBA,"Me: 15 YOE between prior mil and Gov contracting as SWE/Team lead/Program Manager, TC $155k

One more semester left before completing bachelors at a no-name school. GPA will finish out at a 2.1\~. End goal is to attend Questrom or Gies for online MBA or local program in the DC area. Should I finish out at no name school or attempt to transfer to Georgetown's BA in Liberal Studies, WGU BA or a similar program?
