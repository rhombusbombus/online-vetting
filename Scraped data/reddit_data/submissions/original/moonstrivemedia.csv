moonstrive media,,musicmarketing,"Hey there I am wanting to put forward some money for an EP I made not too long ago. Didn’t really do a lot of promotions then but have been doing some research now.

Fyi the songs are sort of around folk and rock. They are similar to “Of Monsters and Men”.

I’ve been looking at submithub, groover, meta ads, moonstrive media and more. Any advice on the best way to spread the budget on this sort of stuff? Should I go evenly on all, put more into ads/playlists or go all in on either one and not do the other? Mainly want to focus on getting spotify algorithm to pick the songs up.

moonstrive media,,musicmarketing,"I, like many of you. Have been looking for ways to promote my music without gigging and using social media.

While I know that is the most reliable/best way to do it. I'm stubborn and I don't wanna play out and I fucking loathe social media.

With that said, I've been doing playlist placement with sites like Submithub etc...

As expected I'd get a few hundred streams and added to a handful or private playlists. 

Recently I tried moonstrive and they put me on some pretty big playlists.

I checked them out and it's what you'd expect. A huge spotify playlist that has little relevance to my music... I'm basically sandwiched between Elvis and The Beach Boys... and I'm not at all in those genres.

But here's where the interesting thing happened. 

I got about 2000 streams through that playlist but when I went to check it out the other day I had been added to about 8 other playlists that I didn't submit too or pay for and they're all relevant to my music. 

Does that mean that this is somewhat working??

I know it's never going to be as good as doing it the tried and true way (gigging and social) but in as much as this road CAN get you somewhere.....
