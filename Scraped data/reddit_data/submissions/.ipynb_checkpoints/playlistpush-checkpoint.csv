,WeAreTheMusicMakers,"I've been playing music my whole life, writing and recording for the past 8 years. This is my 6th studio album release as a self funded artist playing acoustic rock with very minimal commerical success. 

For my latest album, I recorded overseas in Austin, Texas and decided to put as much strategy as possible into marketing my latest single, an upbeat pop-punk, fast tune as best I could.

I've tried a number of different techniques: playing open mics, playing album releases, touring, submithub, playlistpush with limited success. I reached a max of 3,000 streams on Spotify and some isolated community radio plays.

I asked around and was advised to hire a PR company to try to ""break into radio."" Here in Australia we have only one station to promote new artists that aren't signed to a major label, and that is Triple J, a government funded station with a quota for a number of Australian artists they have to play each week. 

I approached a number of different agencies with minimal success, the only agency who took me seriously was Beehive PR, based in Manly, Sydney. I spent $1500 AUD (about a month's rent, approx $1000 USD) for ""Editorials and Radio Pitching."" They were a pleasure to deal with, very professional, slick and easy, but I 
- barely saw 1,000 streams on Spotify, 
- had a total of three write ups on small magazines, with no new followers on social media as a result
- and the same isolated community radio play I had without a PR company. 

I asked about larger radio stations, namely the pop-punk and heavy show short.fast.loud on Triple J and was told unfortunately they had ""passed"" on the track. 

At this point, I'm really lost. I don't know what to do. I think either
a) my music stinks
b) there's something I'm missing here, whether it's a paywall/labels in control of triple J/marketing/social media.
c) something else.

Playlist Push requires hundreds of dollars and you don’t get to see who you submit to until after you spend your money. It’s a huge gamble. You could find out after they take your money that half the playlists weren’t even a good fit in the first place 

Submithub lets you do research beforehand which is cool but they pay less. It’s a lot of work to be a quality curator/influencer and they deserve to get paid. It’s better for promoters to be somewhere like PlaylistPush because they get paid more, but this hurts artists

These mystery box playlist companies like PlayListPush have got to go, or be more transparent. And submithub should do a better job of amassing quality. I imagine that means increasing their prices a bit. The max is 4 credits? Folks on PlaylistPush can make like 10$ per submission.

Something’s gotta change because music promo is too expensive. You either have to be a TikTok fiend and post 5x a day or you have to spend 500$+ on mystery playlist promo and get ripped off. Or run ads but that’s also expensive and has a high learning curve

These mystery box playlist companies like PlayListPush have got to go, or be more transparent. And submithub should do a better job of amassing quality. I imagine that means increasing their prices a bit. The max is 4 credits? Folks on PlaylistPush can make like 10$ per submission.

At Boost Collective, we understand how important it is to get your music heard by as many people as possible. One way to do this is by getting your music featured on popular Spotify playlists. However, finding the right playlist curators and getting in touch with them can be a daunting task. That's why we've put together this comprehensive guide on how to find Spotify playlist curators and contact them effectively.

# Why are Spotify Playlists Important?

Spotify playlists are a powerful tool for promoting your music. They are a collection of songs curated by a playlist creator and can be found by millions of Spotify users worldwide. Getting your music on a popular playlist can increase your streams, gain you new fans, and ultimately help you grow your career as a musician.

How to Find Spotify Playlist Curators

### 1. Use Third-Party Curator Websites

There are many websites that list popular Spotify playlists and their curators. Some of the most popular ones include:

* Soundplate: This website has a large database of Spotify playlists and their curators, making it a great resource for finding the right playlists to target.
* SubmitHub: SubmitHub allows you to submit your music directly to playlist curators, as well as music bloggers and record labels.
* PlaylistPush: This website connects independent artists with Spotify playlist curators for a fee.

### 2. Use Spotify Search

You can also use Spotify's search function to find playlists related to your music genre. Simply search for a relevant keyword, such as ""indie rock,"" and select the ""Playlists"" tab. This will show you a list of playlists related to that keyword, along with their curators.

### 3. Use Social Media

Many playlist curators have a strong social media presence. You can use platforms like Twitter and Instagram to find and follow playlist curators in your music genre. Engage with their content and build a relationship with them before pitching your music.

## How to Contact Spotify Playlist Curators

### 1. Personalize Your Pitch

When contacting playlist curators, it's important to personalize your pitch. Show that you have taken the time to listen to their playlist and explain why your music would be a good fit.

### 2. Be Professional

Make sure your email is professional and well-written. Avoid using slang or overly casual language. You want to come across as a serious artist who is worth adding to their playlist.

### 3. Follow up

If you don't hear back from a playlist curator, don't be afraid to follow up. But be sure to give them enough time to listen to your music before doing so. A polite follow-up email can help you stand out from other artists and increase your chances of getting featured.

### Conclusion

Getting your music on popular Spotify playlists can be a game-changer for your career as a musician. By following the tips outlined in this guide, you can increase your chances of finding the right playlist curators and getting your music heard by a wider audience.

,WeAreTheMusicMakers,"Hi musicians,

An eternal question, isn't ? But Here's my turn and I think this could be helpful to new comers to this industry, simply musicians that don't know and maybe don't care about promotion...

&amp;#x200B;

A little context, my story.

I do music since a long time now, tried to put my music online 3 years ago but everything was awful as I didn't know... anythin, from mastering to promotion and marketing. 3 years after, I've released around 75 covers on Spotify, I know the mastering now, haha, but and more important I have the full support of a community (Outer Wilds 🙏) and this year I've reached 1 million streams.

\--&gt; A long way and a really good evolving 🤙

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I don't want to do covers anymore... The hype has passed and I have 2k streams a day (I was at 6-8k few months ago) So I'm producing my music and I want to do everything well.

&amp;#x200B;

For the promotion I'm a total mess and maybe a little idiot as I don't really understand how to do it.

I've plan to do promo with Instagram, Facebook, and maybe Tiktok, but I don't know about this last, if you have a good feedback for promoting on it. So I am currently working what could be effective and I'm lost.

I've kinda have the impression tha every adtool or marketingtool is a scam 🍌... Would would you or what did you do ? Invest on ads (in this case, more Instagram ?) or Tools to reach peoples (Groover / SH / Playlistpush)

&amp;#x200B;

I think that the most important thing is to have consistent listenners and so saves. I maybe have more than 1million streams but only 800 followers... That is incredibly low..  


So, any recommandations for newbies ?

,MusicPromotion,"Curators on this platform have their playlists active when they meet activity requirements which are:

&amp;#x200B;

* Minimum 30 Active Monthly Listeners per playlist
* Minimum 1% Active Monthly Listeners per playlist

It is written in their web that they calculate the active monthly listeners accessing to Spotify listening data. However, Spotify doesn't publish this data, and Playlistpush mainly calculates the active monthly listeners asking an screenshot of their spotify for artist to the people who has sent their tracks through the platform.

Musicians only can see the top 50 playlists that make more streams to the track, so the problem here is that if musicans have a lot of monthly listeners they won't have any data of small playlists. 

So, curators will only accept songs from musicians that have few streams, otherwise their playlists won't show up at their spotify for artist and playlistpush will lower curators' playlist score. 

If their minimum active listeners is 30, small curators won't accept any track with more than 1000-2000 monthly listeners, for example.

Responses, playlist adds, anything else: ???

I started with putting just a few dollars in Submithub, and got my first (and biggest) playlist add, gaining over 8000 streams in total from that playlist. It was removed from the playlist after one week. So I invested some more in Submithub and got a few placements. The placements were quite unimpressive for the most part. 

I heard from Groover trough reddit, and decided to try it out. I got a lot of placements, but they weren’t that high quality. 

Since I started getting a lot of streams from this one big playlist, I got excited and decided to splurge in a Playlist Push campaign, spending over 300 dollars. This campaign was by far the most dissapointing. I had very little control over the playlists it was getting pitched to, and most of the responses said: ”I love this track!! It sounds amazing!!! Unfortunately I don’t have a playlist this would fit in”. I thought I would get high quality feedback, since I spent so much money, but the feedback was as good as anywhere else. 

The Omari campaign was weird. It says you get a certain amount of streams and you do get it trough some odd playlist adds. But the streams seem to be quite low quality. 

Will I keep using it:
Submithub : yes

Groover : probably not

Omari : no

Responses were “great song love the hook but does not fit my playlist” and “I love the song sadly our users have other tastes”)

It’s not bad, but im bummed that a large majority of spotify curators seemingly liked the song in their reviews, but didn’t share it.

,musicmarketing," The current era of music consumption is heavily dominated by streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music. Music distribution has become easier and very efficient, and almost every song is available to everyone across the globe. Streaming is a process that, on paper, proves to be a win-win situation for everyone involved. The artist is paid more as their **Spotify streams** increase, while the listener can listen to any song without going through the hassle of downloading it beforehand. However, with the number of streams also acting as some sort of a status symbol, a lot of naive indie artists have been getting tempted to try it, and streaming fraud is becoming more and more commonplace in the industry. However, it can easily ruin the trajectory of an artist’s career. 

## What is Streaming Fraud?

Streaming fraud refers to illegal practices that can be used by artists to increase their **Spotify streams** or forge the statistics on a streaming platform like Spotify. In this, artists pay for streams that are registered by bots or even real people hired to stream tracks, also known as ‘artificial streams.’  This is a very common phrase in the music industry and is also often referred to as ‘streaming manipulation,’ ‘store-end fraud,’ and ‘abnormal streaming activity.’ The problem with streaming fraud runs even deeper than buying illegal music. In some cases, you might not even realize that you are partaking in streaming fraud. Several independent playlist curators claim to be legitimate but are actually using illegal methods to increase **Spotify streams** for its customers. You should always research a Spotify playlist curator before paying them for consideration to their playlists and use only reputable services like SubmitHub, PlaylistPush and StreamCatcher to pitch your music. Buying fake **Spotify streams** is becoming increasingly commonplace. There are a lot of popular third-party sites that offer to provide artists with a specific amount of streams and **Spotify playlist** placements in exchange for money. These parties, then, usually generate fake streams using bots. And even though it has become easier for people to manipulate streaming, Spotify has been working very hard to try and implement measures to control it and to be a safer space for genuine artists.    

## Why Streaming Fraud Isn’t Worth It  

### 1. You Can be Suspended or Removed

With cases of streaming frauds rising, streaming platforms have been taking measures to prevent and punish streaming frauds routinely. If it is ever found that your account has done any illegal activities to increase your streams, strict action can be taken against you. Once you have been caught, your account can be suspended for a long time or, in some cases, be deleted permanently. This will lead you to start the process of distributing music from scratch. If you’re any serious about having a long-term career as a musician, this just isn’t worth the risk.   

### 2. You Lose Your Reliability

A higher number of **Spotify streams** does not mean you are more talented or have a higher chance of becoming successful than other musicians, and fans usually pick up on that. In fact, it can often mean the opposite. If you send your music to a label and they find out that your streams are not real (it’s often obvious), you lose your credibility as an artist. This will hamper your future and might ruin your career. The label can also share this information with the industry making it almost impossible for you to gain footing again. Again, just not worth it.  

### 3. It is Illegal and There Are Safer Options Out There

At the end of the day, it boils down to the fact that you might just be wasting your time, effort, and money. You can instead use the time and money you'd be spending on these illegal payola sites in a better, more effective way to legally get more streams (and real fans) from your music! Again, make sure you always use a reputable Spotify curator. Other than that, you can research music marketing and learn how to engage more listeners and increase your audience. There will be several services on the internet that will claim that they can increase your streams by large margins, but taking shortcuts in the present can prove to be harmful in the long run.   

### 4. It Relies on Taking Revenue From Other Independent Artists

Lastly but very importantly, the artists on streaming platforms are paid according to the number of streams their music generates. But since the majority of streaming platforms work on a revenue system known as a ‘shared pool,’ getting fake streams also translates into stealing from the pockets of other, more deserving artists. If fake **Spotify streams** are muddling the numbers, the money won’t be given to the small independent artists who deserve it. Here are some other common and effective ways in which you can promote your music instead:

* Promoting your music on social media via TikToks, Reels and YouTube Shorts
* Promoting your music with the help of Facebook ads
* Pitching your songs to **Spotify editorial playlists** *(during the time of release)*
* Using Spotify For Artist' countless tools to promote your new releases
* Pitch your music to **user-generated** playlists

You might think that fake streams are very hard to trace, but that is not the case. Industry professionals can distinguish very easily between real and fraudulent **Spotify streams**. In the future, fake streams will just make it worse for you to get more exposure and growth. So when promoting music, choose what you do wisely and always go for the reliable and trustworthy option.

* Promoting your music with the help of Facebook ads
* Pitching your songs to **Spotify editorial playlists**  *(during the time of release)*
* Using Spotify For Artist' countless tools to promote your new releases
* Pitch your music to **user-generated** playlists

You might think that fake streams are very hard to trace, but that is not the case. Industry professionals can distinguish very easily between real and fraudulent **Spotify streams**. In the future, fake streams will just make it worse for you to get more exposure and growth. So when promoting music, choose what you do wisely and always go for the reliable and trustworthy option. Small mistakes can have long-term consequences, and there is no harm in being extra cautious.",t2_4225qdqi,,,0,,Manipulating Spotify Streams with Streaming Fraud: Here’s What Can Happen,[],r/MusicPromotion,False,6.0,,,,,False,t3_qi68q7,False,dark,1.0,,public,,0.0,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,,text,6.0,,,text,self.MusicPromotion,True,,,,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,,True,False,False,,[],,,,,t5_2si27,,,,,qi68q7,True,,iplaythelaptop,,2,True,all_ads,False,,False,,/r/MusicPromotion/comments/qi68q7/manipulating_spotify_streams_with_streaming_fraud/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/MusicPromotion/comments/qi68q7/manipulating_spotify_streams_with_streaming_fraud/,15814,1635487964.0,0,,False,,,,,1656114426.0,,,1561985035.0,1656114426.0,,,
,musicbusiness,"The current era of music consumption is heavily dominated by streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music. Music distribution has become easier and very efficient, and almost every song is available to everyone across the globe. Streaming is a process that, on paper, proves to be a win-win situation for everyone involved. The artist is paid more as their **Spotify streams** increase, while the listener can listen to any song without going through the hassle of downloading it beforehand. 

However, with the number of streams also acting as some sort of a status symbol, a lot of naive indie artists have been getting tempted to try it, and streaming fraud is becoming more and more commonplace in the industry. However, it can easily ruin the trajectory of an artist’s career. 

## What is Streaming Fraud?

Streaming fraud refers to illegal practices that can be used by artists to increase their **Spotify streams** or forge the statistics on a streaming platform like Spotify. In this, artists pay for streams that are registered by bots or even real people hired to stream tracks, also known as ‘artificial streams.’  This is a very common phrase in the music industry and is also often referred to as ‘streaming manipulation,’ ‘store-end fraud,’ and ‘abnormal streaming activity.’ 

The problem with streaming fraud runs even deeper than buying illegal music. In some cases, you might not even realize that you are partaking in streaming fraud. Several independent playlist curators claim to be legitimate but are actually using illegal methods to increase **Spotify streams** for its customers. You should always research a Spotify playlist curator before paying them for consideration to their playlists and use only reputable services like SubmitHub, PlaylistPush and StreamCatcher to pitch your music.

Buying fake **Spotify streams** is becoming increasingly commonplace. There are a lot of popular third-party sites that offer to provide artists with a specific amount of streams and **Spotify playlist** placements in exchange for money. These parties, then, usually generate fake streams using bots. And even though it has become easier for people to manipulate streaming, Spotify has been working very hard to try and implement measures to control it and to be a safer space for genuine artists.  

## Why Streaming Fraud Isn’t Worth It

## 1. You Can be Suspended or Removed

With cases of streaming frauds rising, streaming platforms have been taking measures to prevent and punish streaming frauds routinely. If it is ever found that your account has done any illegal activities to increase your streams, strict action can be taken against you. Once you have been caught, your account can be suspended for a long time or, in some cases, be deleted permanently. This will lead you to start the process of distributing music from scratch. If you’re any serious about having a long-term career as a musician, this just isn’t worth the risk. 

## 2. You Lose Your Reliability

A higher number of **Spotify streams** does not mean you are more talented or have a higher chance of becoming successful than other musicians, and fans usually pick up on that. In fact, it can often mean the opposite. If you send your music to a label and they find out that your streams are not real (it’s often obvious), you lose your credibility as an artist. This will hamper your future and might ruin your career. The label can also share this information with the industry making it almost impossible for you to gain footing again. Again, just not worth it.

## 3. It is Illegal and There Are Safer Options Out There

At the end of the day, it boils down to the fact that you might just be wasting your time, effort, and money. You can instead use the time and money you'd be spending on these illegal payola sites in a better, more effective way to legally get more streams (and real fans) from your music! Again, make sure you always use a reputable Spotify curator. 

Other than that, you can research music marketing and learn how to engage more listeners and increase your audience. There will be several services on the internet that will claim that they can increase your streams by large margins, but taking shortcuts in the present can prove to be harmful in the long run. 

## 4. It Relies on Taking Revenue From Other Independent Artists

Lastly but very importantly, the artists on streaming platforms are paid according to the number of streams their music generates. But since the majority of streaming platforms work on a revenue system known as a ‘shared pool,’ getting fake streams also translates into stealing from the pockets of other, more deserving artists. If fake **Spotify streams** are muddling the numbers, the money won’t be given to the small independent artists who deserve it. 

Here are some other common and effective ways in which you can promote your music instead:

* Promoting your music on social media via TikToks, Reels and YouTube Shorts
* Promoting your music with the help of Facebook ads
* Pitching your songs to **Spotify editorial playlists**  *(during the time of release)*
* Using Spotify For Artist' countless tools to promote your new releases
* Pitch your music to **user-generated** playlists

You might think that fake streams are very hard to trace, but that is not the case. Industry professionals can distinguish very easily between real and fraudulent **Spotify streams**. In the future, fake streams will just make it worse for you to get more exposure and growth. So when promoting music, choose what you do wisely and always go for the reliable and trustworthy option.

,MusicPromotion,"In my 5/6 years career, I have never come across such a joke in this industry.

For those who don't know, PlaylistPush markets itself as the **ultimate tool for playlist submission**.  Having hundreds if not a thousand of curators, they assure you that  your song will be sent to the right pair of ears - something that was  too pretty to be true.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*""We send your music to a targeted group of playlist curators, they review your song for playlist consideration""*

and

&gt;*""We have the most active network of Spotify curators and measure data from each campaign for maximum effectiveness""*

are  both quotes taken from the home page of the website - doesn't it sound  like the best way to reach new fans by using their highly advanced  service?

&amp;#x200B;

This is how you usually submit a song:

1. the song has to be approved by PlaylistPush moderators before being able to set up a campaign
2. once  approved, you can set up your campaign by choosing your budget (minimum  $300), and by specifying the multiple genres of your song - **""pop, alt pop, electronic pop"" were mine**
3. next,  you only have to pay them and schedule your campaign. The song will  then be sent to a certain number of curators in the genres you specified  and they will have 14 days to either add you to their playlist or  simply tell you why they wouldn't - the more you pay, the more curators  you will reach ;)

&amp;#x200B;

I personally paid $300 for my campaign, which is equivalent to 44 curators reached according to the website.

My results after 5 days out of 14: 1 playlist add out of 8

not  so bad would you say? The only playlist that added me, not only had 3K  likes but is also almost inactive due to the non existent traffic I got  off it.

Now, time for the reviews  of the playlists that did not accept me. I would like to remind you that  the genres I specified were pop, alt pop and electronic pop - **lots of pop, if not only pop**.

So  far, I feel like I have been abused by the PlaylistPush service - not  only their reviews are similar to the ones you get on SubmitHub (another  great tool for musicians am I right ;) ) but you also **pay ten times more for them to write you that!!!!!!!!**

They are LITERALLY a scam, nothing more.

And  if my song was so trash, why did the PlaylistPush staff even accept it?  Sent me multiple reminder emails that my ""campaign is waiting"" and  offered me a discount code?

,spotifyplaylist,"I have a friend who is an up and coming artist releasing their first few  tracks and the amount of scams/snakes (obviously not everybody) on  Spotify curator sites like Submithub or Playlistpush where the curator just basically asks for money for a placement, what happened to the  actual quality of the music?

We  are going to have a strict no-payment for placement policy regardless of  how much they would hypothetically offer. We want to give the artists  at least some power to get heard and **organically grow through the playlists**.

The main concept is we have a four playlists setup with the following guidelines:

A. songs with under 1,000 streams

B. songs with 1,000-9,999 streams

C. songs with 10,000-99,999 streams

D. songs with 100,000-999,999 streams

As  the artist grows, they tier up, they can grow up to the top of the  playlist, it can form a community of up and comers, collaborations, and  an opportunity for hip hop and music lovers to discover and be a part of potentially the next big thing (which can be an incredible feeling!). We will follow the metrics closely and continuously update the playlists  and can provide an incredible organic experience when they ""level up"" to the next tier of the playlist!

Let  me know what you guys think of the concept and if you have any artists  in mind that are looking for opportunities to actually grow through Spotify playlists without all the bots bullshit or shelling out money to BS agencies, feel free to share with them and would love to hear their  feedback as well. Feel free to DM here or if you prefer email, you can  catch me at [submissions@roarkrecords.com](mailto:submissions@roarkrecords.com)

,WeAreTheMusicMakers,"Hey guys,

Just released a single about a month ago, I used PlaylistPush for the third time , results werent bad whatsoever but thats a whole other story... I’ve heard about using Chartmetric and just working the manual way to contact Playlisters , does anyone have any tips or tricks for this method ? Seems like the only Playlists I see for artists similar to me are the Editorial playlists. Ive heard of Playlist Supply as well.  There are plenty of IG pages that mention a playlist in their page but then they charge to get onto their playlists. I did this a while back and i should have known they were fake likes, so now I just want to learn to get onto real , organic playlists the best way. Any advice or experiences you guys could lend to me ? Willing to learn, put in the work, just PlaylistPush and Submithub are draining.",t2_cumlrcj,,,0,,Using ChartMetric...

If  you message these people they will send you a bunch of screen shots  from satisfied customers, some will be small time artists, some will be  huge with 200k + followers.

Some might be successful, but most will only have 'bot clout.'

It's really hard to tell when someone's Spotify is just bots if you don't know what to look for - here is what to look for.

Monthly  listeners to total plays - If they have 50k plays on their top song,  and 40k monthly listeners, they recently bought all of those plays.  Because if they really had that kind of listener base MONTHLY, their  total plays would be way higher.

Monthly  listeners to followers - If they have 40k monthly listeners and 300  followers, no one really fucks with them, they paid for the plays.

Where  people are listening - If you see cities like, Los Angeles, Dallas,  Phoenix, Kansas City, Buffalo, London GB, Frankfurt, etc.. these cities  are big data centers where botters can buy a whole bunch of IP addresses  to do fake shit. No one gets above 10% of their listeners from Dallas  unless they are a local act. So getting above 10% from multiple large  cities is simply impossible.

Before  you go checking every spotify playlist promotion to see which ones give  'real' results and which ones are fake... let me spoil it for you. They  are all fake.

Here are the things  that are difficult to do, expensive, still full of bullshit, but can  potentially work (that I'm aware of) submithub, playlistpush and good  old emailing/messaging individual playlist owners

Also,  if you're thinking, meh, I'll do it anyway for the clout, it'll make  other people listen and follow because I'll seem successful. Be the fuck  ware. Because Spotify has come down on bot plays and will again. You do  not want their visible or invisible ban hammer to come down upon you.

Hi, i’m here to share my experience on SubmitHub, hoping to be usefull for someone.

I’ve  used this service for a couple of song, and since it’s a long post, i  want to start with the most faq i’ve read on reddit about this.

Yes  this website is legit, and it’s a great idea, should you use it? It’s  all about lucky, i probably won’t use it anymore, not because of the  service, that does what it should and the founder it’s always on the  chat to help and talk with people, but because curators, at least in my  experience, they are not open minded to listen something that try to  bring something different on the scene, there is a reason why we are  artists and not someone who clean a window, if i wanted to copy somone  else i whould chose another job.

With  the premium credits you will receive the feedback from curators, but  are not really helpfull, because someone could say your vocal is awesome  but the instrumental suck, and another one the opposite. My last song  was declined for sharing by all curators i’ve submitted, i want to copy  here all the feedback, because i think it worth reading to have an idea,  ofc i wont write who they are, but just the feedback.

**Feadback (all declined)**

Great  tune, loved the vocal as well as the bubbling house vibes on the  baseline. The drop is quite fresh and well produced and overall the  track sounds really fresh. Unfortunately, it's a bit too relaxing and  deep for us, sorry

""Fearless""  offers a very accessible and energetic Progressive House sound, the  melodic arrangements are impressive and super uplifting, the track has a  great deep invigorating energy and nice enigmatic ambiance, however,  although it is a quality production, it unfortunately wasn't quite  compelling enough for a blog feature, I'm sorry

Thanks  for submitting! I like the very nostalgic and sweet melodies of the  song but the drop is not as energetic as I expected, the kick is a  little too thin and flat and the bass not deep.

Hey  there, Cool instrumental and very vibey sound design &amp; chords !  We're not caught by the vocals on this one though. Thanks for sending

Good  production enjoyable beat and vocal arrangements unfortunately not  convinced on the melody so let's try your next thanks for submitting

Hey,  the intro and the vocals soudns really great of course but actually  dont really like the beat drop. Next time you should work a bit more on  it in my opinion.

Hey there, thanks for the submission. Instrumental is fine but vocal is not what we are looking for qualitywise. Sorry!

thanks  for submitting Fearless. Been so pumped with teh vocal, sadly the drop  turned out a bit too different than we expected. Hoped for a big  epxlisive one! :(

Hey, good track,  good production. I like the instrumental. Unfortunately I am not a fan  of the vocals. They sound too standard to me. Unfortunately they don't  kick me. Therefore, in this case I must decline. Nevertheless I wish you  a lot of success with this song! I'm sure it will find its fans. Thanks  for sending!

Nice instrumental. We don't feel the vocals enough. Thanks for submitting it to us

This  started of pretty good, really nice pads and great pluck. The vocal was  ok, it didnt sound great at times which didnt really let me enjoy the  song much. The production was quite clean but I didn't really enjoy the  drop much - it was missing alot of elements to keep it interesting.  Great concept though just needs a bit more work - Thanks for sending

the  song sounded quite good. This was definitely some high quality  production - The mix was dope and the elements used were good. The  melodies were catchy! Good job! Sadly here, i wasn't hooked by the vocal  topline (lyrics and melodies). Indeed, i felt like it was a bit  repetitive and linear for my personal tastes. I didn't feel like it was  professional enough.. :/ I know most people will love the song, but it  didn't convince me enough for me to support in my list this time. But  thank you for your submission. Have a good day and stay safe!

Even  though the song is not suitable for my playlist, cause I find it too  chill and not that commercial, I want to highlight the originality of  the instrumental

Hey, the mix and  master sounds really clean but actually dont really like the break  melody. Next time you should work more on it.

Hey  Frankie, thanks for reaching out. The idea is cool and it has  potential, but I'm afraid the mixing quality and the sound desing here  still sounds quite weak and messy, there's no contrast betweent the  different sections of the song.. not really meeting our quality  standards for a feature this time, I'm sorry. Wish you good luck with  your song release!

It's a  wonderful summer melody and music production is well done, but we  expected more developed progression..Anyway, keep creating

The  energy in the song is nice here. So not bad. But also a bit too beat  driven I would say as I was missing a more melodic production here to  make the song stand out enough for me. So not all the way this time.

I appreciate the songwriting, but I wasn't into the final mix of Fearless nor the vocal performance.

what we didn't enjoy here is unoriginal melodies, keep on, your voice is amazing

not a fan of the drop here but just my taste

Thanks  for submitting but I'm going to pass. The song has solid production  that sets a nice tone but vocally I feel the song could be stronger to  my personal ear. Best of luck to you

Congrats  on the single. Lovely dance. That ending wasn't what the beginning of  the song was teasing. Was hoping for a huge ending. But that's just us  FT. Nice house, indeed. Keep on kickin' as you do. Sorry couldn't pull  the trigger. Enjoy the accolades.

Cool  vibe on the soundscape and vocals. There's definitely some talent  there. For me, I would like to hear a more defining hook that we can  sink our teeth into overall though. This one felt a little too one note  for placement.

Super impressive  but sadly did get a bit repetitive for me. Surely might circle back  around to this one though after giving it some time and will reach  out..!

Production is really dope  here. Vocals need a little development, sonically fell a little short  for us. Keep it up though, production is dope

The intro got me hooked! The drop was however very underwhelming. I'd try adding a lead to it so it can shine!

Good  production. The track feels, however, a little on the familiar side and  might benefit from adding fresher sound elements, twists and turns to  really take off and stand out that much more in this genre.

Great  tune, loved the vocal as well as the bubbling house vibes on the  baseline. The drop is quite fresh and well produced and overall the  track sounds really fresh. Unfortunately, it's a bit too relaxing and  deep for us, sorry

The highs of  this song sound a little bit strange. Would work on that to get a proper  final track because the melody has a really good potential!

La chanson sonne très ordinaire, standard selon nous, peut être une autre

I  struggled a bit to stay dialed in on the vocals enough to connect  lyrically. The build and production are there, but I never found my one  moment to land with this one.

**My final thought**

As  you can see the most complain is the drop that isn’t huge, and surprise  surprise, this is what i wanted, i don’t wanna copy niky romero or  other artists, i wanna share my personal vibes, and when i listen a song  i’m looking for a contact with the artist, trying to feel what he felt,  i'm not trying to think about what he was supposed to do, the song is  his world and if he made a different choice there is a reason, and as  listener i try to understand it.

Music  is art, or it should be, i just immagine someone like Picasso in our  era where a curators will write “Sorry but i’m not  expected something  less messy, try to paint like Raffaello”

I can’t post links, but if someone is curious to listen the song send me a DM i will drop you the link

I can’t post links, but if someone is curious to listen the song send me a DM i will drop you the link

,WeAreTheMusicMakers,"What do you think is wrong or could be improved up on with the popular music submission / promotion services?

I personally think that playlistpush is too expensive for what you get for the money. The 250 EUR+ minimum is a huge barrier of entry for artists on a budget.

While submit hub is a lot better with having a low minimum starting price it can also get quite expensive really fast. The only guarantee on both services being a review from an independent curator.

The current popular submission services can also take a relatively long time to have all curators respond.

I know some other options that guarantee results  (which I think complies with Spotify's terms of service). They almost always yield a better cost-per-stream. But without any industry contacts it's hard to tell a fake service from a real one.

I am part of a few small time music promotion businesses. From what I know I can definitely say that submission services are the way forward but not the way they are being sold right now.

,WeAreTheMusicMakers,"**If you're lazy, just read the TL:DR section.** So I recently pushed a track hard for the first time, spending quite a bit of money on it. Thought I'd share my experience so far with these popular platforms. Please note these are my opinions and not facts; platforms are also changing over time, for example both submithub &amp; playlistpush has changed quite a bit since they started (both of them seem to be getting better). This is of May 2020.

.

**Facebook ads (with Spotify link):**

Very difficult to get any streams this way. Facebook is good if you want to reach out with information (ie, ""I'm playing live this summer!"") but not for getting streams. Also, you MUST be very specific about your target audience. The FB algorithms seemingly show your ad primarily to people who usually randomly like &amp; click stuff. This is probably not what you want... a 30 sec preview clip with Spotify API will also not count as a stream. I tried several campains over a few weeks to different countries &amp; target audiences, and my conclusion is that it's a tricky platform to use to get Spotify streams specifically.

.

**TL:DR: Facebook ads are good for specific things (reaching out with information), but very expensive if you count it per stream with a Spotify link. I've had better results with YouTube videos in the past though; unfortunately a shiny Spotify preview 30 sec clip will not count as a stream.**

.

**Submithub:**

While the authors claim to be taking playlist curators seriously and having quality control, this is simply not  true. I've seen banned Spotify playlists that, even a week later, still remained on Submithub &amp; people sending +20 daily premium submissions. (Ie, someone makes money to listen to music and their fake bot playlist doesn't even exist anymore...) If you look at these curators including ""really good bloggers"" as they call them, some have an FB account with +100k likes but almost no likes or interaction on posts. I'd say too many of curators on submithub are shady in the sense that it's not useful to you as an artist to get reposted to bot playlist &amp; some random ""big"" influencer that has a bunch of fake likes/streams or they brag with a +1 million subs youtube channel, but there's only famous artists on there (you won't get reposted there). Or a big Spotify playlist but you'll never end up on the good ones, just their ""dumpster"" playlist for reposts from Submithub so their stats will look good &amp; they can keep making money by ""listening"" to people's music.

.

**TL:DR:** **While the above sounded very negative, Submithub is decent if you do your research. Just be aware that it takes a LOT of time and effort to find out the good curators (don't be fooled by shiny stats; you have to dig deep). After you use the service, I recommend creating a list of curators were your sort out good ones and also a blacklist (yes, a blacklist). You do NOT want to end up on fake playlists; make sure to post to curators with a high premium following on Spotify.**

.

**Playlist Push:**

I was sceptical because of the combo of lack of settings when you submit a song &amp; the price you pay, everything is pretty much automated. What happens now? I like to have more control. Well, I was  pleased to find that all curators you get posted to write (often quite extensive) reviews of your song that clearly show they've listened to the song (regardless if they accept/reject). I also saw a curator that got banned during my campaign because he didn't live up to the quality standards, so that was a nice touch, they seemingly work actively to maintain serious curators. I got several reposts from here to big playlists with +100k followers and most of them seem to be the real deal (even though you'll likely end up far down in the playlists themselves, just the big artists at the top; altough I did end up on 9th place on a very big playlist among world-famous artists, woohoo!)

.

**TL:DR: Overall, I'm impressed with the Playlist Push experience and this will likely be my go-to promotion service for upcoming songs. Hopefully they will introduce more filters in the future, but you will get REAL curators and playlists to look at your song; they work activly to sort out the BS. (And no, I don't work for them).**

SubmitHub is harder to get approved.

PlaylistPush you will get something for sure.

It all depends on the songs, if the song is good it will have a good reaction.

(I have 25 years of producing experience, plus collaborated with an audio engineer, so hopefully my songs are 'on a level')

What you gain : Streams , followers and saves/add to library... What's the best of these, it's definitively 'saves' ... I got a huge percent of plays from 'listener's own playlist and library' which is coming from the saves. Second best is followers, more followers you have easier to get into the algorithms. Plus release radar is a huge thing.I get followers from playlists but also ask people I know to follow me , one by one.

Biggest rejection reason is : Wrong genre or 'not our audience' , so be extra careful not to tag genres that aren't relevant.

My campaigns haven't ended so I might get even more adds.

I paid around 300 + 280 + 14 = 594$.

If I would spend this on instagram, facebook or youtube ads, I would gain ZERO and the money would be gone.

,WeAreTheMusicMakers,"Hi All,

So I've just released a new track as part of my ambient project. I normally use Submithub and use the premium credits; I've had a good response rate (about 20 submissions and 6/7 accepted), managed to get on some biggish playlists, around 3k, or 4k followers.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I'm looking for new sites to push to playlists? I tried PlaylistPush (I don't want to spend $300+)! But, then I found a few sites like SoundPlate that ask you to follow certain people and playlists for a free submission.  


But! They ask for a huge access into your spotify? This feels very uncomfortable to me. But its asking for:

 **Take actions in Spotify on your behalf**    

* Add and remove items in Your Library                     
* Create, edit, and follow playlists                     
* Manage who you follow on Spotify

&amp;#x200B;

# SubmitHub

**How it works**

You buy premium credits which cost roughly $1 per credit. There are different packages but basically the more you buy the more discount you get. You can then use these credits to submit your song to blogs/playlist curators/labels to listen and they will decide whether to share it or not. Typically it will cost 1 credit per submission, with a few blogs/curators that charge up to 2 or 3 credits because they are of higher quality (this can mean a variety of different things but typically it's because their reach/audience is higher or they provide better feedback etc). Your credit is spent whether or not they share the song, but they are required to give you feedback if your song is rejected. There is a lot of info on the site about the bloggers you can submit to, including but not limited to their approval rate, their audience count and sources, the songs that they recently shared, etc. It should be noted that there is a free credit system where you receive 2 credits per day (can not be accumulated) I believe. Some blogs take free credits but IMO any blog worth submitting to usually would only take premium credits.

**My experience**

When I first discovered SubmitHub I was ecstatic that this platform existed to directly connect artists with curators/bloggers. I explored the site and everything seemed straight forward enough. So I purchased a bunch of credits, filtered the blogs based on the genre of my newly released track and started submitting away. I did this for a couple days and the results started coming in. I think I submitted to over 100 curators (combination of premium and free credits but mostly premium) and of the ones that responded not one wanted to share my song. That's right - 100 rejections.

At this point I was quite discouraged to say the least and was tempted to give up. Perhaps my music wasn't good enough or my genre of music just wasn't a big hit on the site. Ultimately though I decided to take this as a learning experience rather than surrendering. I did some more research, reading some SubmitHub success stories and tips (the site has its own resource link for tips). I took in all the feedback with an accepting mentality and aimed to improve my own craft based on the criticism. I realized that the average approval rate of the site is quite low at 11%. My own 0% approval was even lower,  but knowing that it's a tough field to begin with was actually encouraging to me, since there is more of a chance it's not my music that completely sucks. Most importantly, I learned that I didn't do enough research on the curators I submitted to.

As mentioned above, there is a lot of info about the curators that I completely overlooked. I only filtered out the genres and started submitting. Here's the thing about genres - there is a ton on the site for you to choose from and I find that a lot of times they are interpretive. For example ""Commercial"" music can mean one thing to someone and something else to another. What I started to do was go through the list of curators one by one. I listened to their recently shared tracks. I listened to more songs on their actual playlists. I also took into account their approval rate. There are curators that actually approve 100% of their submissions, which are ones you might want to avoid because the quality of their lists/listeners may be questionable. And then there are curators that have below 1% approval rate, reflecting how tough their standards are. I filtered the curators down to the ones with around 15% - 30% approval rate because I wanted my song submitted to quality lists but at the same time have a fighting chance. The priority though is making sure my song is a good fit with that of the curator's list. After many hours of research, my shortlist of curators was at around 20. And so I launched a submission campaign with this more fine tuned list. After a couple days all my results came in. Of the 20 submissions, 15 responded, and 8 approved my track to be shared/added on their playlist. 5 credits refunded to me. I was stoked. That's over 50% that approved my track, which is actually higher than the overall average and miles ahead of my original campaign. Now the range of quality of the shares was quite broad. Most were quite good, adding my song to lists with hundreds of listeners and some cases thousands. There was a curator though that added my song to a playlist with 2 listeners. Whatever. Coming from 100 rejections I took every approval/share as a big win. Also kept in mind that any playlist add is good for the Spotify algorithm and helps with chances of getting your song added to an editorial playlist which in my mind is the ultimate goal.

&amp;#x200B;

# PlaylistPush

**How it Works**

You launch a campaign by first submitting your already released Spotify track to see if it qualifies. I think it takes at most one day for them to get back to you. Once they approve your track you can get started (I imagine it is very rare that they will reject your track for a campaign). You start by typing in some similar artists to yourself and some genres will be assigned to your song. You can modify these genres (subtracting what they assigned or adding some that they missed). Once you are happy with classifying your song into the genres, the next step is selecting the budget for your song. 3 options are offered: ""Precise"", ""Accurate"", ""Broad"". Here is a screenshot of what it looks like.

&amp;#x200B;

[PlaylistPush campaign packages](https://preview.redd.it/pq3jx9bae3m31.jpg?width=795&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=665da86cf41af5e8a93e2289eab997ce1c70c474)

The pricing is dependent on the genre of your song. Some genres are more expensive than others depending on how many curators they have. You're looking at this right - it's quite pricey. From the PlaylistPush site itself, ""The average campaign cost is around $450. However, pricing can range from as low as $250 to $1,000+ depending on which genres and matching you select."" After all is done and finalized you just wait 2 weeks for all your results to come in.

**My Experience**

You will see in the image that there is a small button at the bottom ""More Price Options."" From there I was able to select the cheapest campaign possible at $202.50 (everyone's budget is different, but I just don't have several hundred dollars to easily spare). For that price my song was submitted to 19 playlists. After I finalized the campaign there was nothing else to do but wait for the results. You have no control over which curators your song goes to and there is no info about the curators and their playlists. You just have to trust the site's algorithm to send your song the right curators in terms of genre matching. The whole process has a much more ""automated"" feel. If you do the math, that's approximately $10.65 per submission which is 10 times more expensive than SubmitHub. Now if you go with the more expensive packages, the price per submission does goes down. But nevertheless still not very cheap to say the least. The important question is if it's worth it. These were my results: 10 curators added my song while 9 rejected it. All came back with some brief feedback as that's what's required. All the playlist adds were on decent lists with at least several hundred followers. Results will definitely vary from song to song but 10 out of 19 was something I was quite happy with.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion

One thing I want to clarify is that this isn't a ""versus"" type comparison review where I choose a winner among the two. I think both platforms have its merits. If you only look at my results though, you will see that I was able to spend $15 on SubmitHub to get 8 playlist adds (not counting the first $100 I spent not knowing how to properly utilize the site), and on PlaylistPush I spent $202.50 for 10 playlist adds. So does SubmitHub have way more value? Not necessarily. Keep in mind that along with the $15, I spent hours and hours researching curators to come up with my shortlist to submit to. One hour can be worth a lot depending on who you talk to. Moreover, every hour doing something else (like researching curators) is one less hour for you to work on creating music. For PlaylistPush I just filled out a digital form and hit ""go"". So even though you can say PlaylistPush is way more pricey, I believe the extra premium is for the convenience, time saved, and more of a guarantee on the playlist quality. I would say that PlaylistPush has a higher bar for their pool of curators and playlists in terms of number of followers and active listeners. SubmitHub on the other hand is all over the place with that. You might get scenarios where some curators are actually primarily music bloggers that happen to have a playlist with a few followers. To be fair though SubmitHub is very transparent with that and provides sufficient data for you to make an informed decision. Honestly, I think that for all the data and info you can obtain from SubmitHub, $1 per submission is dirt cheap. It is up to you to assess all that data though.

So if you have a limited budget and lots of time and energy to spare, I'd say give SubmitHub a shot. If you have a higher marketing budget and don't have much free time, PlaylistPush can be a good tool for you. How long your track stays on the approved playlists is entirely up to the curator but I believe the minimum is one week. How rewarding these campaigns are will vary case by case. You will definitely see a spike in monthly listeners if you get a few playlist adds but when your song eventually gets taken down it's hard to say if you can maintain that momentum. During this time of exposure gaining new followers and track saves will be key stats to look out for IMO. For me it worked out quite well as my track got saved a few hundred times and that's a lot for me.

&amp;#x200B;

# Why they are not a scam

I've seen the words ""scam"" and ""payola"" thrown around a lot. Usually from people who have had a bad experience with the sites or from people who don't really know the basic concept of the platforms. Based on the definition of payola, the fact that there are so many rejections among both sites is already an indication they are not that. As for the label ""scam"", this is mostly from people who used the sites and didn't get the results they wanted (ie. got rejected a lot). If you read through the documentation and FAQs on the sites, they are very upfront with what to expect if you use the platform. SubmitHub clearly states that the average approval rate is quite low (at 11%). Some people say the feedback quality is poor and some say they feel generic. Some say that they got good things said about their song but was rejected so that makes no sense. I'll be honest that I didn't care too much about that part because I was mainly focused on getting playlist shares. Here's the thing. These curators probably listen to hundreds or thousands of songs in a month. There's only so many ways to reject you or tell you that your song is not a good fit for their list and not necessarily because they don't like it. They have probably dealt with their fair share of artists with fragile egos and have learnt to be polite (maybe overly so) when giving you bad news. Hey I get it. I'm an artist too and it doesn't feel great when others tell you that your music is not good enough. It's very easy to fall into the trap of being defensive and projecting the blame on everything else but your own music. For me a scam is when there is an intent to cheat you somehow. When these sites are upfront and clear what you are walking into, I think everything is fair game.

&amp;#x200B;

That's all. I see that this has become quite a long post. I hope it helps those of you looking for more case studies of these platforms.

,WeAreTheMusicMakers,"I rap if you're wondering what genre I make and I don't really have a fanbase right now, this is my first time really putting my music on more platforms than YouTube and Soundcloud and really trying to promote it a lot, I've tried to push songs and submitted some to blogs before but they weren't that great and I wasn't trying that hard (though I did get posted on one). So I want to really take a crack at gaining a fanbase and doing this fulltime. I've made a 5 song ep I'm gonna release at the end of August, I have another 5 song ep coming up in October and a mixtape with 2 songs from each ep and 6 or 7 new songs I'm releasing in December. 

The only project out of the 3 I have finished is the first ep, I've had it professionally mixed and mastered (also mastered for streaming/radio), right now my plan is to upload a single from it (as well as the whole project) to Distrokid and submit the single to Spotify's curated playlists a month in advance, I'm also gonna contact blogs and other playlists a month in advance as well as radio stations and blogs for press and venues close enough to me to potentially perform at if they have open mics or something. I don't know if I'll wait until release or not for playlistpush and submit hub but I'm gonna use them too.

I plan on doing this for every release, I'm wondering if you think this is a good plan and if I should do anything else?

,edmproduction,"Hello everyone.

Is anyone had positive experience with PlaylistPush? I founded some blogs and reviews in internet and kind a lot of people had great success with popular genres setting up  campaigns. How about campaigns for Deep House music? Is anyone tried to get in some popular playlist?

Also, is there any tricks how to save money on campaigns?  Average  campaign around 500usd. It is expensive I would say as guy from Lithuania (I can pay 2 month rent with this kind of money). As I understand I need target small niche playlists to make my campaign cheaper?

If playlist curators didnt approve your song to be shared are you getting refund?

They  don't pay too much but if you can manage to work for multiple websites then you can gather a few bucks by the end of the month.

Here are some brief details about these sites:

* **Research.fm**:  It is a Music research company that pays you to listen to music and  fill out surveys. You can redeem your earnings with Amazon Gift cards.
* **HitPredictor.com:** Another music research company that pays users to listen to music and  rate it. You get 3 points (equal to $1) for every song you listen. You  can exchange points for Amazon gift cards and prizes.

,WeAreTheMusicMakers,"My music is of an older style (think Jim Croce, James Taylor, Brazil 66), and I believe it could get a lot of traction on playlists that feature this style of music. Unfortunately, the playlist pitching services like SubmitHub and PlaylistPush seem to focus more on more current styles of music, so I want to try and pitch directly to playlist curators. I would like to start small with playlists that have 500 to 1000 or so followers, but I don't know how to find these playlists. When I open the Spotify app and search for ""bossa nova"" playlists, for example, only the huge ones with half a million followers come up. Does anyone have any idea how to find these smaller curated playlists? Thanks!

,Blackops4,"I wanted to type this up to see how other CoD enthusiast opinions would match up.

There is no doubt that Call of Duty has been on the decline over the past couple of years and I think there are a lot of things that CoD has strayed from that once made the game one of the top FPS in the world. These are some things that I remember from early days of CoD that made them so much fun and made people and content creators want to grind the game. Sorry for the long post, But I would love to hear other people's opinions and what they think will help this series. I will also ad a scale of 1-5 on how strong I think an issue should be pushed and if it would be a great help to the game.

1. Cod Community. 5

One of the greatest things (IMO) that made CoD such a fun game to grind was having such a great community. Before you rush down to the comments to say how the CoD community is a toxic and nasty place to talk to people, some great friendships and clans were built on this idea. During MW3 (the highest selling CoD of all time), Call of Duty Elite was introduced bringing clans to a whole new level. People were able to meet new friends online more easily and start building their own community of friends with ease. Whether these clans were competitive, sniping, casual, or anything in between, everyone found a ""home"". With all the events happening in game such as most kills in TDM in 4 hours or most captures in Dom in 2 hours, it brought so many people together. This idea of clans continued on till AW where the developers of it got lazy and it never felt the same and after AW died out. Bringing this back would make the game so much more enjoyable to play and give people the freedom to easily find new players to play with and make new friendships.

2) Force Game Chat. 2

This one kind of correlates with the last idea but it is something that my buddies and I have thought would add some nostalgia back to the game. Force Game Chat. Now this has been an on and off thing over the past couple of CoDs but I think a little iteration of it, maybe a separate playlist for just forced game chat would be fun. It would be just for people who want to meet new people and maybe have a little fun trash talking. After all that's that a fun aspect of CoD. A lot of people want to be the best in the lobby and when they are you wanna show it off whether being a respectable opponent or a cocky winner.

3) Equal Rewards for all. 3

While obviously having a large community of players means a lot of different players, try hards or casual players, Call of Duty used to do a great job at making it fun for all kind of players. But, more recently it seems to only be for the true fans and that also has to do in the decline of the actual game play and casual players leaving. I believe there needs to be some system in place that still rewards both. Easy challenges that unlock some cool camos and other aesthetics in the game. However, there needs to be something that rewards the grinders and the better players. As an almost always try hard player I feel as if I don't get rewarded enough for putting the effort that I do into the game. With BO3's and other CoDs system of crates and drops I feel I always see other players, much lower ranks, getting items that I could only wish for (or put 100 dollars in and pray for it). Some sort of system, and if still based on crates, where better players can get more tokens or unlocakables based on how they play. In BO3 if another player and myself played a game from start to end we would both get the same amount of tokens maybe with a little to barely noticeable difference. Even if i go 40-9 and he goes 18-19. I believe better players should be rewarded better for playing well, which sort of contradicts what I just said above, I know. A hard challenge to tackle but a system where both casual and grinders both get equal payoffs that make both groups happy.

4) League Play. 4.5

One of the greatest modes (IMO) that CoD added was league play. Back in BO2 league play was introduced at its fullest in order to really promote the eSports side of CoD. Since BO2, any itteration of league play has never felt the same or as balanced. In BO2 you were rewarded on wins and losses. Stats really didn't matter, if you got the win you at least got some positive points in the standings bronze-Master, 200-1. Sure the games were weird sometimes when you would play 3v4 from the start and have no support and still lose 250 points in standings even though you had no chance and if you manage to win a 3v4 sometimes only getting 20 points. The points rewarded or taken at the end didn't always make sense, but how the system was set up was perfect. In later CoDs the ""league play"" felt like a public match most of the time. Your rank didn't matter, you could be, in BO3 for example, a level 14 in ranked and play a team of all lower than rank 4. While in BO2 you played people that were very close to your rank, masters played masters, silvers played silvers and etc. I would love to see an iteration of this in BO4 however since it has been 6 YEARS since this and still haven't found a good way to bring this back I won't be keeping my fingers crossed again, its getting tiring.

5) Complicated Simplicity. 3

Yes, the title of this section is a little weird let me explain fast then go into detail. One thing that made CoD amazing was having the simplicity of classes and characters with still come customization and ability to make it different each game. The greatest CoDs to use for this example are MW2 and BO2. MW2 was still a very simple game at the beginning of its life, but you started to see some come complexity come into the game, such as more kills streaks, more guns, Pro Perks (better version of that perk). While looking at it now the game seems overly simple this is what made it fun and easy to get into. Now with games, the devs are trying to hard to make it more and more complicated with way to many things added in and way to many variations when typically 90% of players are going to use pretty much the same class. The focus should be to make a good balanced game with some customization but a lot of focus on the mechanics of the game to make it flow smoothly and easy to get into.

6) Maps. 5

The maps that have been the greatest of all time in CoDs history have been, again simple, and based on the 3 lane setup. I have linked at the bottom of this section an imgur with some maps over the CoDs from MW2 to AW. In order, Bio Lab AW, Favela MW2, Nuketown BO, Resistance MW3, Standoff BO2, Strikezone Ghost. All these maps had some common features that made them great maps. The first thing, like I said earlier, 3 lane setup. All these map have some sort of base 3 lane setup with some connections from one lane to the next. That is key to have only a few connections from one lane to the next. No connections and its only long range fights that are hard to push. To many connections and it becomes a mosh pit that are impossible to navigate through. The second thing is to keep the maps small, but not all of them. While people have fallen in love with the close range maps such as Rust, Dome, Shipment, Nuketown, etc, there needs to be variation of bigger maps like standoff. However, that should be about as long as a map gets. Still easy to sub, but also to snipe. Maps like Stonehaven from Ghost are just far to big and have such a low rate of engagements that the games become boring and people will often leave once connected to the match. Lastly, another very unnoticed thing that makes a good map is the variation in height. Maps with only one level become very repetitive and give no advantage to anybody except the one person on a head glitch. The variation in height gives teams the ability to maneuver effectively and to break down holds on points with more ease and keep the game flowing. These 3 concepts I believe are the most important in order to have good and fun maps that everyone will like. I'm sure there is more to a map that I cannot think of, please let me know.

7) Fast Paced

Kind of going back to how the map is set up CoD feels so much better when it is fast paced and you are constantly in the game. Now I don't mean with this making every map in CoD small so its fast but finding a good balance between how the game plays with the speed of the characters and the map design. If you have bigger maps you need faster movement like in AW, slower movement smaller maps like SOME of the maps in Ghost. Others were way to big and made the game way to slow paced.

**Tell us a bit about Harlequin’s style?**

We don’t have a particular style except that we play everything in terms of music, if the customer has a request then the answer is always yes. We’re playing a Russian wedding in a few weeks so I’ve four songs learned in Russian and on Thursday night I’ve an alternative wedding where all they want is Brit Pop. We play every hit that was ever a hit right up until this week. And we can take requests on the night because of our extensive repertoire – Harlequin have over 3800 songs that we could play then and there. We spend a lot of time on attention to detail for our customers – what we do is an exclusive product, that we feel is unique. And we’ve had some lovely feedback, somebody put a complaint a long time ago on **weddingsonline** about the band – the complaint was ‘her feet were still sore two days on’ which was great.

**How far in advance should couples book a band?**

In the pecking order couples look for a ring, then they go shopping for a venue and the band. They should book band and venue at the same time to try and get the one they really want. Food and fun coincide – if you can lock in a venue and band at the same time early on, that’s the way to do it. It will take the pressure off as entertainment is a huge part of the day. The choice becomes limited very quickly once you get closer to the date. We have bookings in 2017 which is two and a half years away.

**Have you any advice when it comes to doing research for a band?**

Some people don’t realise the importance of an experienced party or dance band, they think that a band that do good music in a pub will do because they’re getting them for €800 or €1000 but it doesn’t work like that. And then on the other side, there are bands that are quite expensive that just don’t do a good job at a wedding. It’s really a case of being careful, buyer beware – do your homework, find out who’s good out there and invest time in researching this, and not just money. And do it at a very early stage of your planning.

*Harlequin Wedding Band*

**How long does a band typically play for?**

A lot of bands in Ireland play for 2 hours but Harlequin play for 3 hours.

**Is there a trend for all day packages that include the likes of ceremony, drink’s reception and evening entertainment?**

It’s half and half. About half of the people that work with us enquire about full day service and half of the people like to use separate suppliers because they think it gives them different textures and quality. One of the concerns we come across is that the voice will have fatigue having played for 12 or 14 hours, it doesn’t happen in our case but I have heard of it happening. And then there are couples that are especially confident with the supplier, so they want to get everything from them.

**What advice have you for couples when it comes to picking their playlist?**

I don’t provide couples with a list and the reason is that I don’t want to pre-empt their own personal ideas, so what I suggest is to take a little bit of time coming up with ideas. I then sit down with all of my couples and have a consultation – we’ll spend an hour going through ideas and hone in what they’re interested in and go from there.

**What advice would you give couples trying to choose their first dance song?**

I say to couples, is this song very important to you? About one third say “it is”, one third say “it’s critical” and one third say “not really, yeah, it’s grand”. I always say to people this is the only five minutes that are wholly yours in the day, this is five minutes where you can look in to each others eyes and just enjoy it. Shut the world out, it’s your first dance ever with your wife or your husband as a married couple, because whether or not this is *the* song coming into this moment, it’s your song going out of it! I do think it’s important to spend time on it and it’s important for me to sing something that’s important to them.  And even if they don’t have a song, we can help them find something they really love.

**What first dance songs have been popular over the past year?**

Every year there is one or two slow songs that that are a big hit, last year there were three; Ed Sheeran – Thinking Out Loud, John Legend – All of Me and How Long Will I Love You by Ellie Goulding. But I really love finding a couple that have their song; something off the wall or that wasn’t even a commercial hit. It doesn’t have to be a slow song either. Upbeat songs are the best ones!

**What makes for a packed dance floor?**

Fun. No matter how good the band are – it’s fun. We go out to have fun and if the bride and groom are having fun the guests celebrate with them. The only way you can really do that is by getting to know the bride and groom – who they are. And also who can we poke fun at? Who’s having a baby, who just had a baby, who’s engaged, who’s up next – little things like that. We spend time with the bride and groom up to the wedding getting to know them. By the time the wedding comes round they know what it’s all about, we know mammy, aunty Peggy, we know her aunt is a nun in Kenya and she loves the Kings of Leon. The only way you can find the real gold like that is by getting to know people, and it’s only that stuff that makes it personal and special.

**Any other tips or advice for couples booking a band?**

I always say couples should push their band to deliver what they want for their wedding. A wedding band should be flexible, they should be able to play country if country is required and shouldn’t exclude any one demographic in the room. It doesn’t mean you can’t play AC/DC, but you can’t play AC/DC all night if there are guests there who want a waltz. Get a band who will play something for everybody and that ticks all the boxes for you as well. The other thing I say is to get a band who really want to be there, who look like they want to be there. Deal with suppliers who have a clear agenda of delivering a great night or day and if you’re not getting that from them, move on to the next supplier.",t2_1lg3kf9e,,,0,,Wedding Band Galway,[],u/weddingsonline,False,,,,,,False,,False,dark,,,user,,,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},,False,1,,,,self,False,,[],,,True,,,text,,,,text,self.weddingsonline,,,,qa,,,False,True,True,False,False,,,False,,True,False,False,,,,,,,t5_kl82d,,,,,97rh0z,,,weddingsonline,,0,True,,False,,,,/r/u_weddingsonline/comments/97rh0z/wedding_band_galway/,,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_weddingsonline/comments/97rh0z/wedding_band_galway/,0,1534418974.0,0,,False,,,,,,,,1529328569.0,1536763279.0,,,
,NoFap,"I've lost a lot of time and energy on masturbating. I've been viewing porn since I was five when I came across my fathers VHS collection. Slowly my addiction has gotten worse in both how it effects my life, and the escalation of the type of porn I've watched. For the past year I haven't even been enjoying myself. I find myself in the verge of tears every time I've finished recently. I've wasted three hours going through entire playlists trying to find a video. I've been 300 pages into a category on pornhub. The past two months I've been on and off of trying to relieve myself of this addiction. About a hour ago I relapsed again and decided I needed proactive help. I started doing research and found this subreddit. I don't even use reddit but, I've created a account to participate in this great movement.

,BabyBumps,"Edit: I wrote this almost a year ago, posted it for a couple days, then chickened out and deleted. Not sure what I was afraid of. 

My son was due 6/26. I felt HUGE and uncomfortable during those last weeks, but had a very easy pregnancy otherwise with zero complications. On the morning of 6/22, I woke up to my 6 am alarm and remember thinking ""Wow, I didn't get up to pee last night,"" which was shocking because I was used to at least 2-3 pee breaks per night. As I got up to pee, I felt water gush. I was sure I peed myself. It seemed to stop once I got on the toilet, so it didn't occur to me that it was anything other than pee (my wet underwear smelled like nothing). I got back in bed and my husband and I had a good laugh over my incontinence. He went off to work, and I sat down in the kitchen to eat my breakfast. Then I coughed. More fluid. Hmm... After some obsessive redditing, I laid down for 30 mins. (I read that if it's amniotic fluid, it will pool and gush when you stand up). Sure enough, that's what happened. I called my dr, who told me to come in and get checked. My husband raced home from work (he'd just gotten there) and after a quick exam at the dr, we were on the way to the hospital. I remember the OB saying ""you'll be meeting your baby within 24 hours!"" He was almost right...

 

This part is long, so I'll do bullet points:

 

Labor and Delivery

 

-Water broke at 6 am. I was feeling absolutely no contractions when we checked into the hospital around 10am. My doctor was in no rush and wanted to give me time to get things started on my own, so he suggested walking the halls, bouncing on the ball, etc. to start labor. He didn't mention Pitocin, but one of the nurses said something about how he likes to wait 24 hours to see if things progress on their own.

 

-My husband and I spent a boring ass day in the hospital. Lots of pacing, watching The Sopranos on the yoga ball. Still nothing. By bedtime, I was exhausted but still feeling nothing beyond the very mild BH I had been having for weeks.

 

-The nurse suggested I take an Ambien to get some sleep, since we would likely be starting Pit in the morning. I obliged, but woke up around midnight with some serious contractions (they were super mild in hindsight, but enough to wake me up). I didn't want to wake my husband, so I worked through them quietly in bed while listening to my labor playlist. It was actually kind of peaceful. I remember looking out the window, which had a strangely beautiful view of our city, and thinking about how my life was about to change forever.

 

-By 7 am, the dr checked me and said I was 3 cm dilated and something like 80-90% effaced. It was time to start Pit since it had been over 24 hours. That's when shit got serious. The contractions amped up like crazy. I started in bed, squeezing my husband's hand, then moved to the ball, begging him for counter pressure every time I felt a contraction. They were 2-3 mins apart, for about 1 minute long. The nurse kept coming in to check and saying stuff like ""now let's talk about pain relief options."" I turned everything down, not because I'm a tough chick, but I was too afraid that an epidural would slow labor down. I had been in the hospital for an entire day and night at this point, and I just wanted to meet my baby. I remember hearing babies cry in nearby rooms, and crying through my contractions saying ""I just want my baby. I just want my baby."" It seemed like I had waited long enough.

 

-After 3 hours of contractions, I told the nurse I felt like pushing. She kind of didn’t believe me, but I felt like I was about to take a giant poop. I got on the bed, and sure enough, I was about 9 cm dilated. I was HURTING, but my mom had told me that pushing was the easiest, quickest part for her, so I felt hopeful and excited.

 

-I had a lip of cervix, and the nurse had told me to push before I was really ready. This caused the lip to swell, and when the dr came in, he advised me NOT to push and wait a few more contractions for the lip to move out of the way. Trying NOT to push was agony. Every ounce of my being wanted to PUSH. I made it through a few contractions this way, squeezing my husband’s hand and crying. In between contractions, I would just close my eyes and go silent and still. It felt like the only thing I could do. My husband told me later he thought I was dead each time.

 

-Long story short, I pushed for 3 hours. Baby would crown, and then go back in. I attribute this to my exhaustion. I had absolutely no energy after a day of pacing the hospital and barely any sleep. I couldn’t “hold” him in between contractions like the nurses wanted me to.

 

-This was the darkest part for me, emotionally. I told my mom later that it was my “dark night of the soul.” Every part of me was saying “You can’t do this. You can’t do it.” I remember one of the nurses saying “It seems impossible but you’re going to do it.” It was that lowest, most scared I have ever felt. But minutes later, a few big pushes (which were excruciating and felt so… wrong. I was tearing and felt every bit of it), my baby was here. His wet, warm body was on my chest and the pain was instantly gone. I just kept saying “My baby boy, my baby boy.” It was unlike anything I had ever felt in my life.

 

-One bright spot of going med-free: I was back to myself within minutes. I was joking and laughing and felt totally fine. Even the soreness down there didn’t set in until a couple hours later. I was fully present when I met my baby, just like I wanted.

 

The hospital stay:

 

-Baby arrived Friday afternoon and we didn’t leave the hospital until Sunday early evening. This was actually the worst part for me. I delivered in a baby-friendly hospital and wanted to breastfeed. This meant being woken up every 2 hours to try to feed baby. I found it absolutely impossible to relax. Being in a hospital setting, knowing a nurse would be popping in every two hours, trying to process what I had just been through…all of it made sleep impossible. I was delirious.

-Breastfeeding was tough. My nipples are flat, and I got conflicting advice from just about everyone who helped me in the hospital. Try the nipple shield, don’t use the nipple shield, pump colostrum and syringe feed. It was so confusing, and baby was having a hard time latching. I had taken a BF class, so I knew to wait for that wide-open mouth. I never saw him do that. He only latched successfully once or twice, with lots of help from an LC (she did some thing where she trickled water from a syringe on my boob to help him latch, if I recall). It was incredibly stressful. I was so afraid he was hungry and my body was just not cooperating.

 

-At discharge, he’d only lost 4% of his birthweight, so we were OK. But I was super scared to go home and breastfeed him on my own. I ended up having some success with the nipple shield, but he’d feed for over an hour each time and I was never really sure when he was done. He’d often fall asleep at the boob. It was really, really tough, but I stuck with it and tried to feed him every 2-3 hours. It was exhausting and incredibly stressful.

 

From breastfeeding to pumping/supplementing:

 

-At his 1 month pediatrician appointment, he had only gained 8 ounces. I was an emotional wreck. The ped suggested supplementing with formula; she said his long feeds probably meant he wasn’t getting enough milk, and he’d fall asleep because he didn’t have the energy to keep trying. It broke my heart. I was totally fine with using formula if it meant he’d start to grow and thrive. So I started pumping and he started taking bottles with 50/50 breastmilk to formula. The change was immediate. He was instantly a happier, more alert baby. Within two weeks, he gained two full pounds. Plus dad and the grandparents could help feed him, and now that he wasn’t spending 1 hour out of every 3 on the boob, everyone has had much more time to enjoy him. It was the best decision I made. (Pumping every three hours is tough though, especially when I’m home alone with the baby. I’m trying to hold on for another 3 weeks, because then I go back to work and I think it will actually be easier to shut my office door and pump for 20 minutes 3-4x a day.)

 

Now, 7 weeks out, things are still tough. His sleep isn’t super predictable, and some days are easier than others. But it’s the steepest learning curve ever. I have learned so much in just the past few weeks, and it gets better every day. Needless to say, I am consumed with love for the little guy. Sometimes I look at him and it’s like looking at the sun --- he’s so perfect and the love I feel is overwhelming.",t2_11tdxm,,,0,,"Unmedicated with pitocin, mostly positive birth story",[],r/BabyBumps,False,6.0,birth,,,,False,,False,dark,,,public,,,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},Birth info,False,57,,,,self,False,BOY,[],,,True,,,text,6.0,,,text,self.BabyBumps,,,,,,,False,False,True,False,False,,,False,1ac5e650-ebc4-11e1-a8f3-12313d14a568,True,False,False,Team Blue!

,DestinyTheGame,"Yes, capital T “Thoughts”

First, the two main bullet points of this entire post:

- the trip from 0-2100 was miserable and stressful and awful and the playlist needs some real work in numerous areas from matchmaking to scoring to incentives and to the game modes 

- the trip from 0-2100 was addicting once I started making real progress and getting the rarest gun in the game has made me feel incredibly accomplished and a step above most 

If those are contradictory, it’s cause competitive was both at once. It is something that saw a massive mid season shift that really mucked up matchmaking and drove people out and overall needs a lot of work but it had that competitive spirit I’ve been wanting for a real reward. 

Instead of pontificating though I should probably just list out my thoughts and places I see improvement is needed for the sake of brevity:

- game modes and length made the entire experience feel lengthy more than a fun experience should; a 15 minute match should *feel* like 10. Countdown once it hits 5-5 is exhausting, and Survival is a whole different beast that requires serious reworking as most teams that play to win will play to the timer either on purpose or by chance. Countdown as a mode IMO is mostly fine but Survival can be cheesed our so hard by teams that get kills and turtle up until time, and that does not feel competitive or a rewarding use of anyone’s time. 

- the jump from rank 2 to 3 can feel like a million years, it’s a very large gap and there is no sense of incremental jumps that can help players feel like they are making progress. Combined with a loss penalty that equals a win, a bad day of trading off can feel defeating as you spend hours for literally nothing. 

- with so few rewards and concurrent incentives there’s little reason for a proper ranked hierarchy to get set up, as of there is only one reward that’s out of reach for players and nothing being given to keep people coming back, the bottom and mid will eventually drop out instead of sticking with the season to see where they end up. There should be a weekly tangible economy based reward that can encourage players to play a minimum amount of matches per week, that can assist in their character progression. Planetary materials, a masterwork core pack, something. There needs to be a reason for players to stick around and see where they end up at the end of the season and not feel like time was wasted if they can’t get the ONE big reward. 

- glory based matchmaking is what the playlist needs, and will work better in S4 now that we are all starting at 0 and not getting sorted by two different systems that don’t mesh with each other.

-  Win and loss streaks should go and instead glory gain and loss should be based on a more traditional ELO style system; if you match against a team with a high glory average, you gain more points for beating them and lose less for losing, and Vice versa, matching a lower average team should net you a lower gain for stomping them and a higher negative for losing. 

- what started to become common closer to rank 3 were teams gaming the system to try and get that last push, by having solid players play on accounts with little to no glory in an effort to bring down their team average to get “easier” matchups. I feel MM should, when taking averages into account, ignore players under a certain threshold. For example, if a team has 3 1700 players and a 200, instead of averaging it to be 1325 the game would ignore the 200 and make the team average 1700 (as that is a massive gap in where matchmaking searches in terms of player skill. I’m not sure if this is how it works but I’m sure it’s probably a part of it). 

- Again please make Survival not as bad

- give players a more visible path of progress to entice people to stay; seeing your Glory go up a bit might be nice but seeing say, your global ranking jump up by a couple hundred spots might encourage a player who isn’t that great to put in some extra work. Give the top spots some recognition at the end of a season, hell host a stream for a mini tournament set up via private matches for the top players to give them some airtime and see which is the actual top team. Make competitive matter to everyone from bottom to the top, be it the aforementioned incremental rewards, weekly rewards, visible improvement, and something at the end of the season that can correspond with how you did to keep people around. I know me personally, seeing how few people had the Claymore lit a fire under my ass to get busy and get the thing. 

Anyway that’s what I got I hope someone reads this and is like “hey some of that sounds pretty good”. The Claymore is a ton of fun, and to me it’s a fitting trophy for coming back to an improved D2, i made some friends along the way and i gained a much higher understanding for my ability and the game (i even broke into the top 500 rank on DTR for survival for a night!) and I’m excited to do it again(and hopefully with less of the pain and frustration that stagnating between rank 2 and 3 included). I hope S4 continues this trend to a better place and I hope comp is reworked, along with the new weapon system, to keep me hooked for a run at rank 4 and 5. 

Edit: [have a bonus clip of me winning a round of countdown 1v4](https://twitter.com/petexnasty/status/1028565385895968768?s=21) 

Edit 2: now everyone gets one and Im left feeling like my greatest achievement in Destiny was cheapened to an Engram reward. Feels bad man.

,CruciblePlaybook,"So, the tl;dr: 1.2 kd player with elo sitting between silver and platinum depending on the playlist, playing on PS4 and looking for pointers to improve. Destiny tracker stats: [https://destinytracker.com/d2/profile/psn/JustTypeAnything](https://destinytracker.com/d2/profile/psn/JustTypeAnything) and [YouTube gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tq9Spf7NWks) (chose this video as there's both stupid and smart moments -- at least to me).

I'm mid-30s but pretty much started FPS PVP with Destiny (and even then started playing only halfway D1 year 3) and at some point I figured out being aggressive was much more exciting (you know, when you lose the ""*please don't hurt me*"" felling). I've incorporated things I've read/watched into my gameplay (or at least think I have...) like crouch/strafing, using vertical space, sliding into and out of cover, into rooms, etc, but I still feel I could be doing better.

I'm running arcstrider with stompees, 10 mobility, 1 resilience, 5 recovery; kinetic is one of Antiope, Better Devils, Midnight Coup or Huckleberry; energy either GL or Darkest Before; heavy mostly Main Ingredient.

My mindset is pretty much ""push behind cover trying to find angles while avoid getting pinched; disengage as soon as I realize I'm not winning the gun fight to reposition"". I feel I'm much more reckless than aggressive and I can get away against less skilled players but get wrecked by better players.  Some of the play styles I really like and try to mimic are [Gamer (aka TheGamerguy)](https://www.twitch.tv/gamer), [TrueVanguard](https://www.twitch.tv/thetruevanguard) and [Aztecross](https://www.twitch.tv/aztecross)

Anyways, enough of me talking, just tried to give an overall idea of how I see the game.

Very interested in getting some feedback and suggestions. Thanks in advance! :)

,Stims,"Since I just experienced very first meth bellringer! 

TL;DR very detailed tweaked out description of a methamphetamine bellringer, from experience.

Quite a bit more intense than coke, but by far not as euphoric. I don't know if that's because I've been using a point a day for the last two-three days, or if cocaine just has a more euphoric bellringer.

When I put the needle in my arm, I literally immediately registered. It was perfect. I even pushed and pulled the rig a bit to make sure I wasn't going to pull out of the vein and miss a huge painful shot in my arm, especially of meth with its high chance to abcess. 

Okay, so I slowly pushed down on the plunger. No taste in my mouth. I figured, oh, alright, this wasn't as strong as I was expecting (I was shooting for a bellringer and the shard I used was a good cm in length maybe like 3mm in width. It was a big shard for someone with absolutely no tolerance. I figured I had reached a point in my bag where all the weaker crystal was at the bottom. So anyway, I finish the shot and pull out. Now, my hands are shaking so bad at this point I thought I was going to tear the rig right out of my arm. I thought, hm, weird. No taste but shaky hands.

And then it fucking hit me like a goddamn train. The meth taste all of a sudden in the back of my mouth. I had to suppress the urge to gag. My first ever meth induced cough! Yay!

Then I had to sit the fuck down because my legs were wobbling so bad. Then the ""audio"" portion came. I took a deep breath and it sounded like my voice was a piece of metal scraping against more metal, along with my sharp sounding breathing and slight deafness in the ears (favorite parts). Then my muscles started fucking vibrating. It was so crazy. I've never felt anything like that in my life.

And then the stupid fucking sweat came, and my face flushed cause it's 70 degrees outside and meth doesn't agree with warm temperatures. Down to my underwear I go. I thought my pupils were huge this morning when I woke myself up with a shot? Fuck no. Nothing compared to this. You literally can just barely see a sliver of the iris. A good twenty minutes later and the audio effect has been subdued for the most part and nothing sounds metallic anymore except for my mouth breathing, which is vaguely metallic sounding.

More bucketloads of sweat and slight hallucination effect going on. I can hear my mom saying stuff she isn't saying but that's the extent of it. ~~I have a song stuck in my head that sounds as clear as if I were playing it off YouTube or something.~~ (I'm stupid. My phone is actually playing that song, I guess it never paused my spotify Playlist when I unplugged my headphones.

Anyway, the visual effects. I am nearsighted and have a severe astigmatism, so my vision without glasses is already pretty questionable, but now instead of having fuzzy borders where I can't distinguish anything, there are clearly squiggly line borders. They move when I move my eyes. In addition, everything is significantly brighter. I am seeing slight movements (hallucinating) from clothes hanging on hooks, and I've seen a few flies that weren't really there. 

Peripheral effects: My throat is very dry, unfortunately. Moreso than before. I am shifting my weight on my legs because I feel stimmy. I'm constipated (sorry TMI) and feel quite light headed but euphoric. Just not as good as coke. Horny as hell per usual. My BPM is ~135, and it normally is in the high 70s, but like I said I'm shifting all around and mouth breathing instead of deep breathing. Chest is a little tight but sitting down, relaxing, and deep breathing is helping that. My thought patterns are a little fucked up, not gonna lie. I'm trying to sift through the words that actually make sense in this description, and it's hard instead of effortless like it should be. Limbs still shaking, especially hands. That tends to wear off after the comedown is over but alas, tis meth. I was so flushed and hot I had to take a cold shower, so if there are any meaning obscuring typos or anything, it's from the shower water splashing on my phone.

10/10 would do every day.


Edit: changed rating to 9/10 because I'm so fucking sweaty.

,postpsychotic,"I had a psychotic episode in the month of November. Soon I was taken to a psychiatrist and started on risperidone and amisulpride.

Meds hit me hard. For next month I will sleep for 14 hours a day. Delusions had stopped. I felt incredible anxiety. I had great heights to go to before the episode. I was super smart. I urged my father to let me go to the Institute once the delusions were gone. But he won't send me. Eventually I had to drop out of the Institute.

I have very little recollection of what happened in December and January. In December, I remember glimpses of me asking my father to let me continue management studies and him frustratingly telling me no. He told me to decide for myself. And each time I would decide to continue, he will get visibly frustated and tell me to think for the best of me. Eventually I succumbed. I had my birthday on 25th December, which I have no memory of. I went to celebrate New year with my friends, I recall enjoying a little. I still had desire to travel, I still enjoyed music. Though I knew not that this will be last time, I would enjoy anything.

2018 began, I was unsure about the future. Barring walking an hour in the evening, I wouldn't do anything all day. I had no motivation, no will to live. I barely moved, I had no taste for food. I began my day with meditation, I still had anxiety, which was greatly relieved by clonazepam. In the night, when I went to sleep I would get running thoughts. And If I didn't sleep within one hour of taking the meds at night, I wouldn't sleep. I had to go to university to collect my stuff, I was pretty anxious to be there, how would I face the people.
Again my brother planned a trip, and I would accompany him, I didn't enjoy the trip. We did paragliding which is supposed to be fun, but it was a big meh for me. I remember I was in Darjeeling and next day we were to go to uni, I was so anxious that I couldn't sleep, I took two pills, and slept. Next day I went to college, met old friends, they welcomed me, but the old environment brought back the paranoia. I started having racing thoughts. I thought psychosis would come back. This time I had an advantage, I had insight. I took two pills that day and slept. Next day, I got the paperwork done and left. I felt a chapter of life close, a heavy burden had lifted. A ghost had left me. The girl I was fond of was coincidentally the first and last person I saw on the trip. 
I came back home. The delusions were gone. I wanted to build back my life. I had been meditating for 2 months prior to this. I contacted some friends and asked for recommendations for job. Although I didn't know if I would be able to hold on to a job. I fixed up a routine and tried to follow it. I rarely followed the routine. Each day I would wake up and think yet another dead day. Then I would think it's just one day let it pass. In the afternoon, I would lay at the sofa and not do anything. And at 5 in the evening I would start feeling better as I have successfully survived one more day. I had bit more energy in the evening's.
March came, I was recommended a song which I got addicted to, I found my old playlist and almost enjoyed the songs. I would put headphones and study 2 hours a day. For first 2 weeks I strictly followed the routine.I wrote an exam and did fairly well. This was followed by the worse depression I know. I just couldn't do anything. I stayed all day on sofa. I had no emotion, no arousal, no enthusiasm, no motivation, no pleasure. I just stayed on the sofa. I also discovered that the antipsychotic drugs that I was taking were some of the worst meds ever for side effects. I was just flat. I felt dead with no emotions, no feelings. I have very little memory of that period because I did nothing. I recall March now, I joined a coaching institute, which gave me routine, I met two persons, meeting them made me realize that I have become socially awkward. I can't connect with normal people. I forcibly laughed at their jokes even if not finding any humor. Before the episode I had a great sense of humor and I made people laugh repeatedly. I sensed that my wit, creativity and sense of humor was wiped out. I had become very naive.
Then came April. My contacts came through and I was offered a full time job. Although despite my parents protests I was the one to initiate the process, I was reluctant to apply though as I thought if I ever got in, how would I manage the job with the belittling effects of disease and medications. How would I communicate?   I couldn't muster up the courage to fill out the form. My daddy and friends kept pushing me to fill out the form. Their logic was sound. As joining would take one to two month, and with the experience we know that the time heals everything, I would be in a better shape to continue than I am in right now. What would be the worst thing that could happen, I could be fired. But it would give us valuable time. If you can't see light at the end of the tunnel doesn't mean it's not there. It means you may have to venture more in the dark. Silver lining to this was My job location was near my brother's place and I could be provided care, I will be watched. I will have my nephew to play with. My brother made it sound like it was destined. And I filled the form. April was also hard. I had total anhedonia. Even food didn't have any taste. I was more aware of the situation, and med side effects were causing a lot of stress. I would complain to my parents daily how miserable I was , how meds were not helping but propagating it. And they would not agree, they said if it were not for meds I wouldn't be in the position to attack meds. They were partially right. I saw no signs of improvement. I saw no point in living life like a zombie. The thought that I would have to live my whole life like this put me in a dread. Yet I would live, hoping for a miracle, taking each day as a challenge.
May arrived, I was pretty miserable but I observed that things had improved. The March depression bacame a reference point to me. And however miserable I was I compared it to the March depression and how much better I am from that time. But the thought of living the whole life in that state put me in feeling of dread. I could not enjoy my old hobbies, music was just a noise to me, news, sports were all plain, dull and boring. I had no motivation to do anything. Despite all this, there were some days where I more than just survived. In this month, I was called up by the manager that I had to join soon. It was too early I thought. I am not ready I thought. Yet the iron was hot and hammer had to strike. I agreed.

I'm a 20 year old Middle-eastern guy who's very figgity, impulsive and really only thinks about the short term benefits of everything. I used to be addicted to Gaming, but ever since i became 18 years old i decided to leave that part of me behind. I live in a lower-class home, we live off of welfare and I've had the fortune of being born with an above average-IQ which has led to me being able to go to university with a loan.

Last year 2017 December 17th I quit university, broke up with my girlfriend (whom i lived with for 4 months), ditched all my junky friends and moved back to my hometown.

So this is what I'll be doing every single day.

1. Waking up in the morning at 7:30 AM
2. Meditate for 10 minutes
3. Practise a skill/craft in my case Programming for 2 hours
4. Walk for 2 hours per day
5. Do 50 Pushups + 180 Situps
6. Read a book (Currently : 4-Hour work week) for 2 Hours
7. Go cycling for 1 hour
8. Be hygienic
9. Eat clean and track the calories that i'm taking
10. No more Masturbation

Log of 14th of August 2018 - Current time 23:45 PM :

Hello dear redditers, i'm back once again ! And this time with some spicy news.I'm going to be quitting masturbation, yeah i'm joining the #nofap army, lets see if i can manage to do it.now that aside, lets talk about how my day went and if i made the whole list.

It's 7:30 AM i wake up and i feel super energetic at the start, I guess it has become part of my routine for real now.Per usual I go downstairs, eat my breakfast, go upstairs wash my teeth and go shower.Right after that little morning routine i begin meditating it's about 8:00 AM nobody is awake it's just me meditating whilst i'm laying on my bed.Today i learnt how to control my feelings when it comes to sleepiness and being tired.Rather then resisting it you accept it in and don't fight it, because if you fight it you'll become even more sleepy/tired.(weird I know).I noticed another spike of energy in me as i logged on my laptop and saw another 400$ added to my bank account.

After looking at all that cash i got motivated to program(idk why), so well i did that for about 2 hours 10 video's worth of tutorials and damn did I enjoy it. I love the current programming language that I'm learning it's called Javascript and it's adding so much functionality to my webpages, it's crazy.Today I learnt how to create a for-loop, while-loop and a do-while-loop. These are all loops and they come in different forms and sizes. A loop basically means something that repeats its self and it's pretty darn useful.I think i learnt a little more than that but i just can't remember, it was a heavy day today afterall packed with experiences.

BAM I go outside, start walking at only 13:00 PM feeling like i could shoot myself to the moon that's how much energy i had from the start of my walk. You could imagine that I was walking very fast as well because of the excitement, packed a 6km/hr during the whole walk which surprisingly enough lasted 3 hours. Now remember last time that i told you i got 880$ from my E-commerce business? and today i had another 400$? well....I decided to reward myself a little bit, half way through my 2 hour walk i walked through the city shops and i bought some goodies.I bought comfortable socks for walking, a watch so i can see the time as i'm doing the walk and a new perfume from Hugo Boss. (AMAZINGNESS)

Once I came back from my walk I went upstairs to check my E-mails as I had some orders that needed to be delivered for my business it took my about one hour to reply to customers and get my shit done...Diner time, it's 18:00 PM i'm eating with my family and honestly i'm not really feeling hungry even though i barely ate today.I promised my little brother to play Pokemon GO with him today, so i went for another slow walk with him catching them all !

20:00 PM in I go cycling and man I downloaded a new playlist and it's really doing me fineeee on the bike trip.I did about 25 Kilometre's worth of biking and burnt a shit TON of calories honestly.What i thought during the bike trip was this : Imagine a version of you is trapped inside a room chained up against the wall, you're fat, smell bad and look terrible all in all.You're not the only one there there's also a woman, she's terrifyingly HOT, and she's torturing you. This woman is society, she's torturing you as you're trying to escape but the only way to escape this room and make society bend for you is by working yourself till your bones are crushing your muscles are aching and this version of yourself will make it out with hard work. I envisioned myself becoming muscular stronger and I end up breaking the chains that hold me back, and make society My fucking bitch.That's deep shit but this is what is truely what i think when I'm biking and also i envision Atlas, the man that's carrying the planet which truely means responsibility.I Have the responsibility of my family weighing in on my shoulders and i'm carrying it like atlas is carrying our planet.

Alright so after cycling comes the push-ups and sit-ups, this time i decided to do more.I did about 60 pushups 15 per set and 240 Situps + 45 seconds planking.i'm becoming so good at this honestly, increasing rep ranges and the reps themselves are going by faster.I think I might need a break day soon since my muscles might not be able to keep up with all this pressure.Let alone my heart(who knows).

I got to reading a book but i only really read... 10 pages.. AGAINNNNN so tomorrow i will freaking start with reading from to get go so i get that shit done before i lose my shit for god sake, it's so annoying to not get shit done.I'm gonna read after this for another hour if i can but i gotta wake up early so idk if it's smart.Now guys i really hope you enjoyed reading !Leave some feedback, Ciao

I envisioned myself becoming muscular stronger and I end up breaking the chains that hold me back, and make society My fucking bitch.  
That's deep shit but this is what is truely what i think when I'm biking and also i envision Atlas, the man that's carrying the planet which truely means responsibility.  
I Have the responsibility of my family weighing in on my shoulders and i'm carrying it like atlas is carrying our planet.

Alright so after cycling comes the push-ups and sit-ups, this time i decided to do more.  
I did about 60 pushups 15 per set and 240 Situps + 45 seconds planking.  
i'm becoming so good at this honestly, increasing rep ranges and the reps themselves are going by faster.  
I think I might need a break day soon since my muscles might not be able to keep up with all this pressure.  
Let alone my heart(who knows).

I got to reading a book but i only really read... 10 pages.. AGAINNNNN so tomorrow i will freaking start with reading from to get go so i get that shit done before i lose my shit for god sake, it's so annoying to not get shit done.  
I'm gonna read after this for another hour if i can but i gotta wake up early so idk if it's smart.  
Now guys i really hope you enjoyed reading !

,destiny2,"I've recently played more competitive in D2 and I've come across some issues I'd like to discuss with the community.

Now I want to make sure you know, these are MY opinions and you're entitled to yours, the point of this post is to spark discussion and hear the thoughts of others. I'd also like you to remember these are thoughts focused on the competitive PvP side of Destiny2, not PvE related content.

My first issue is with Titanskating, not because it's ""op lmao git gud"" but because it's a mechanic no other class can consistently achieve (warlock) or even attempt (hunter). The fact is, skating is achieved through a macro or by swapping key binds and using a scroll wheel. No other class can do this at any time to receive a significant buff to any function of their abilities which is why I believe skating provides an unfair advantage.

While I feel it's a good mechanic, it just should not allow such quick speeds without necessarily sacrificing an exotic slot, while I'm aware that Lion Rampants take skating to a whole new level, that level is too high for the small maps of Destiny 2. In my opinion no-one should be able to cross an entire map within a few seconds, no matter the case, the insane amount of map and objective control this provides is unbalanced and should be looked at.

Could there be a fix for this that wouldn't upset every single titan main? Possibly.

\-Top speed achieved by air acceleration should be lowered and skating should REQUIRE the use of Lion Rampants?

\-Compensate lack of consistent, extremely high mobility for other classes instead of changing titan skating?

Before someone starts angrily typing either ""BUT WORMHUSK REE!"" or ""BUT WARLOCKS CAN SKATE TOO WHEN THEY USE SUPER!"" The healing received from husk is ONLY achieved when using that specific exotic and using your CLASS ABILITY and has nothing to do with extremely high mobility. A warlock can only skate properly when using the super ability.

Titan skating is achieved by changing key binds and using external hardware (mouse/scroll wheel) and CAN be done, (albeit less effectively) without a specific exotic equipped, meaning it's consistently available to be used which is where my problem arises from. (Yes I'm aware you're forced to use catapult lift/burst glide to skate but within a PvP environment that holds little difference.)

My second issue is with all new players having to complete two games of competitive to access their ""Call to Arms"" milestone. Forcing new players into a competitive environment can cause stress and make them less likely to find PvP enjoyable in the future. Pushing a newcomer to a matchmaking system where they are often placed in a game where they might be insulted for their lack of  skill, lack of understanding of the game modes or just for being there as a low level player is not a good way to go about introducing new things. This hurts both the existing competitive player base and the newcomer.

While I understand that Destiny is not an E-sports game in any way, this is still a poor design choice in my opinion. Even a short explanation video or a text box detailing the rules of competitive game modes, stakes and the importance of teamwork within the playlist could go a long way. (More detailed than what it currently is.)

Also introducing a power, valor or level requirement would allow for a much more enjoyable matchmaking. (One potential drawback with entry requirements could be an even smaller player pool which is something I'm concerned about.)

Again, before anyone bombs me with ""There is a balanced matchmaking!"" I'm aware of the matchmaking system attempting to search for balanced games, my issue is with how new players are introduced into the mode.

I may have forgotten some points but I'm happy to discuss the topics I mentioned and all things Destiny.

TL/DR: Salty hunter main with obnoxious superhealing helmet complains about THE FLASH ruining his PvP fun. Titanskating is a good mechanic, could use some tuning. New players forced into competitive to access basic milestone should be handled differently.

EDIT: I do play all 3 classes and I'm not calling for hate towards any of them.

,teenagers,"Save the music you listen to throughout high school. Make playlists of what you loved at the time and don’t delete them. Go back and listen a few years later, it’s like I’m reliving the best and worst parts of 10th grade right now which is a very surreal and interesting feeling. 

Don’t stress so much because high school is weird and good at times but bad at others. Enjoy it as much as you can. Be involved with people and activities that leave you feeling fulfilled. I didn’t find out til senior year that I loved drama and choir but by then i could only have that one year and I deeply regret it. Try things earlier and see what you like. 

Relationships are messy, the earlier in high school, the messier. Don’t expect it to be perfect. Don’t expect to always have your crush like you back. But just hold out cause everybody is worthy of love and you’ll find the person who was right for you eventually and it’ll have been worth all of the trouble and rejections and heartbreak when you find him/her. 

Don’t spend time with “friends” who are superficial. Cliques are awful and toxic. Find friends who genuinely care. This may sound selfish but don’t bend over backwards for a friend who you know wouldn’t be there if you really needed them. You deserve better. It’s always better to have 2-4 super close friends than a dozen mediocre ones. 

Take pictures and keep them. I didn’t do this a lot and I already regret it because some of my high school friends either already have moved or are moving way far away from where I’m going and I may never see some of them again. Don’t be one of those people filming entire concerts or posting everything they do on Instagram but document your interesting days somehow. I recommend this app called 5 Minute Journal that is very handy and you can very easily go through months and months of time and see what the good things that happened to you were. 

If you’re dealing with anxiety/depression, tell someone. I didn’t for a few years and those were my worst. Then I just told my doctor one day at a checkup because I was too afraid to tell my parents first. I got therapy and medication and it helped tremendously. Help is always there, you just have to ask. I always felt like I was the victim when I was depressed but I pushed my friends away and blamed them for things that were in my control. Be accountable and understand when you need to admit you have a problem. It makes things better for everyone. 

Have fun, stay in school, I don’t post here often but it’s a really nice community and I hope the best for you all in high school and beyond and I hope somebody gets something out of this.

,nosleep,"[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/9457l0/my_sisters_hair_part_1/)

It worked! Throwing the brush away worked…for about a week.

Everything was great and I thought I had taken care of the problem, until I came home to a mural of hair stuck on the bathroom shower again. It was after another long day of work, but instead of falling asleep in my makeup and hairspray, I forced myself to take a shower.

I remember wrapping myself in my fuzzy robe, relieving my legs and waist of my tight jeans and scratchy work shirt. The warm robe swallowed my body whole, covering my ears down to my ankles. I loosely tied the ties and went to open the shower curtain to start the water. The instant my eyes caught sight of the blackened tile wall, no amount of fuzz from my robe could have warmed my blood.

Each of Nicki’s hairs were neatly placed in their strategic spots, painting a morbid picture of…a woman? A creature? To this day, I still don’t know what to call it. It was thin and wiry, seeming to reach its spindly arms out. Bundles of hair were wadded up at the thing’s knuckles, outlining each finger as they splayed out over the tile. Its body was a robe of black, making my own skin itch under my once comforting fabric. The thing’s hair stuck up at all different angles, curling and flailing as if standing before a fan.

But above all that, it was the creatures face that has stuck with me the most. It was abstract and almost as if you had to look past it or beside it in order for it to come into focus. Its eyes were pointed and hollow, sloping into its sharp nose. Taking up the majority of the long face was its twisted smile. It stretched and pulled Nicki’s hairs as far as they would go, reaching up almost to the outer corners of its eyes.

I felt the own corners of my mouth drop as my muscles seemed to turn to jelly. My ears started ringing with what I thought was the rush of my own pumping blood. The longer I stared at the configured creature, the louder the ringing got. It went from a ring, to a whine, to a high-pitched hiss before I realized it wasn’t coming from inside my head. I flashed my eyes toward the lightbulbs over my mirror just in time to see the glass inflate and explode, sending shards of steaming bulb over me.

A yelp, that I didn’t know I had released, sounded throughout the room as I ducked to the floor, covering my head. The room was thrown into darkness, only a bit of light trickling in from the open crack of the door at the bottom. I could hear the exploded bulbs hiss as they cooled down, a current still trying to flow through them.

I tried taking a deep breath, my sputtering lungs fighting against my ribcage. My knees popped as I stood up slower than usual. Despite not being able to see, my eyes stayed locked forward, toward where the creature was drawn out. I knew the lights blew up because of her, I don’t know how I knew, but I could feel it.

I reached back to grab the door handle behind me when it was slammed into my knuckles. I let out another unknown yelp and involuntarily took a step away, the broken glass crunching under my bare feet.

“Are you okay?” I heard Dad’s voice, the outline of his body blocking out the hall light trying to flood into the dark bathroom.

“Yeah,” I hissed, trying to step around the glass, “the bulbs exploded.”

“All of them?” Dad asked, grabbing my arm to help me move around.

“I guess,” I mumbled, ripping a chunk of glass from my foot.

“Alright, well…we’ll fix it tomorrow. Come on, I’ll get you patched up,” Dad said, starting to lead me down the hall toward his and mom’s bathroom.

“I got it,” I insisted. “It’s late, you have work tomorrow.”

“You sure?” he asked, trying to hide a yawn.

“Positive,” I nodded, giving him a quick hug goodnight.

That was partially true, I knew he had work in the morning and it was already late. He didn’t need to stay up, I’m a big girl. But I also didn’t want my parents anywhere near my bathroom. I could have explained what was happening, if I actually *knew* what was happening, but what good would that have done? At that point, I was tired of being rational. I was tired of trying to *think* about what to do, so I tried *feeling* what to do.

My gut told me that the less people knew the better…the *safer*. I hobbled to my room and grabbed a camping flashlight from my junk drawer before heading back to the bathroom to grab some bandages. I shone the harsh white light around the bathroom, blinding myself momentarily when looking into the mirror. The bits of sparkling broken glass spat light back at me from over the floor and the counter. I shifted the flashlight up toward the exploded bulbs as I reached for the bandages in my sink cabinet.

I felt my brows furrow and heard the high-pitched intake of air hiss through my throat when I saw what the bulbs looked like. Little bits of steam rose from each one, leaving black plumes of soot on the ceiling. There were little nubs of glass connected to the wall where the actual bulb used to be, but it was the inside that I couldn’t take my eyes away from.

In place of where the filaments should have been were shriveled strands of black. The limp hair hung down from the inside of each bulb, the burnt ends still glowing red. It wasn’t until the stench of burnt hair reached my nose that everything seemed to click. My fingers fumbled with the edge of the cabinet, blindly searching for some bandages. The choking smell of hot asphalt and burnt popcorn, the only way I could come close to describing the way the burnt hair smelled, slipped down my nose and punched my lungs.

My fingers clung around something soft and, without looking, I grabbed it from the shelf, hoping it was a roll of bandages. I tore my eyes away from the bulbs and hobbled out of the bathroom. I didn’t look back and I didn’t stop until I was in my bedroom, taking a seat on the edge of my bed. My eyes flickered back toward the bathroom, this time landing on the door that was connecting it to my bedroom. I don’t know why, by my eyes kept going in and out of focus, turning the white painted door into a ghostly blob, then sharpening again and taking its normal shape.

I squinted my eyes shut and shook my head, looking down at my now blood-stained foot. I finally took a moment to look at what I had grabbed from the cabinet to see a roll of toilet paper. *Oh good*, I sighed, bending down to mop away the blood on my skin. *It’s not like I need an actual band aid or anything.*

I remember being confused, that much blood shouldn’t have spread around from one little cut. I pulled my foot into my lap to see a little nick in my skin where a sliver of glass had embedded itself. I gently pushed on my foot, watching a little droplet of blood ooze out and down the crevices of my skin.

I took a square of toilet paper and pressed it against my foot, watching bloody blotches of red sink into the white tissue. The red grew, creeping over the thin fabric, almost turning a deep brown at the source. My mouth had been hung open the entire time, growing dry the more I watched the blood. I shook my head again, ripping my eyes away from my foot, and took a hard swallow of the minimal saliva left in my mouth.

The thick spit stuck in my throat, leaving an odd taste in my mouth…something like pennies. It was a weird, heavy, metallic taste that almost seemed to activate the same sensations as after eating something sour. My throat constricted, my tongue almost burned, and my eyes watered at the corners, but all I could think about was trying to pin the taste in my mouth.

Metal?

Pennies?

Iron?

I suppressed an audible gag when I finally figured out the taste. “Blood,” I shuddered, spitting a wad of saliva on the ground.

I brought my hand up to my mouth, wiping at my lips and gums. A streak of red was painted across my palm followed by a sharp sting from my bottom lip. The tip of my finger automatically went to the pain, eliciting a hiss from the back of my throat. I fumbled with the dresser next to my bed, searching in my junk drawer for a mirror.

Bringing the little compact up to my face, I saw the split in my lip. My tongue idly played with the cut, a chuckle escaping from me as I breathed, “Alright, calm down.” I had gotten way too into my own head. It was just a cut. It was just blood. I was fine.

I took a deep breath and shook my head for the third time; that seemed to be the only thing able to shake whatever trance I kept getting sucked into. I wrapped my foot in a bundle of toilet paper, sealing it with a delicate bow. I tucked my legs up into my chest and scooted back against the headboard of my bed. I brought my laptop into my lap and turned on the gaming playlist I normally watch before going to bed.

Despite my better judgement, I turned my bedside lamp off, letting the white light of my laptop illuminate me from below. *It’s just a cut. Just blood. You’re fine*. I kept repeating those words while taking some much-needed deep breaths. Listening to the gamer’s voice sent me into a hushed daze, making me sink deeper against my headboard. Before I knew what happened, my eyes had slipped shut and I dozed off.

I was shocked awake from a barrage of gun shots. I jerked up, tucking my knees up under my chin as my fingers splayed across my face. Blinking the sleep from my eyes, I squinted into the light from my laptop, seeing the video had changed to a more violent game than I had started out with. The gamer’s voice shouted swears and insults over the explosions from the game. Audio screams and squelches of blood were emitted from my laptop speaker, making for one of the weirdest wakeup calls ever. I groaned and hit the red “X” in the corner of the screen, popping my laptop shut.

I cracked my stiff neck, regretting having fallen asleep with my chin tucked into my chest. I shimmied down into my mattress, too tired to remember why I had fallen asleep sitting up in the first place. My ears rang a bit from the sudden intrusion of quiet settling in my room.

*Shlick*

My body involuntarily jolted at the wet, slapping sound. I cracked open one eye, listening to the silence once again, waiting to hear the noise. *It’s just in your mind*, I thought, closing my eyes again.

*Shlick*

My eyes popped open again, fully this time around. The wall in front of me slowly came into focus the longer my eyes got used to the darkness. I kept my back turned to the noise, not wanting to see what was making it, but not wanting to ignore it either.

*Shlick*

The wet pop smacked against my hardwood floor. The sound lingered, making my stomach both tighten and drop at the same time. It sounded like a wet mop being flung through the air before meeting its sudden stop against my floor. Before the sickening sound happened again, I heard something else. A tearing sound, as if someone was trying to rip a piece of wet cotton fabric. There was a whine of restraint followed by muffled twangs, as if guitar strings were being plucked against a pillow. My ears tickled at the strange sound as it was quickly accompanied by the same *Shlick* as before.

It kept the same pace for a bit, making me want to gag the more I listened to it. Too afraid at this point to turn over, I reached down toward my legs, feeling for my laptop. The cool metal slipped under my fingers as I finally found it, dragging it over my blanket and up to my face. I ripped open the top and blinked into the white light of the screen.

*Shl-*

As soon as the light from my monitor shined over me, the sound stopped. The internal fan of my laptop whirred, being the only thing making noise other than the breath wheezing out from my nose. I inched my head to the side, gradually turning to face the open space of my room. My body casted a giant shadow, throwing bits of the floor and wall into blackness while everything else was bathed in harsh light.

Nothing was moved.

Nothing was out of place.

I sat up and looked around, scanning my walls for any marks or handprints, but mostly for strands of hair. I kicked my legs out from under my covers and swung them over my bed, going to reach for my lamp. My toes touched the ground, feeling the cold wood under my skin, but I quickly pulled my foot away when I felt something…wet.

I almost tipped my lamp over trying to turn it on, successfully sending a stack of loose lip glosses to the floor with a clatter. The light from my lamp threw everything into a sickly shade of yellow, further pushing me over the edge of nausea. I looked to where my foot had previously been to see a bundle of wet hair slopped over the floor, but it wasn’t water that was covering the strands this time. At the ends of each hair, were chunks of flesh, bloodied and seemingly ripped from the scalp of some unsuspecting person.

“What the fu-” I gagged, throwing my body across my bed.

I didn’t stop squirming until my back hit the wall my bed was pushed against. My blanket bunched up around me and to my horror, hunks of bloody hair were scattered underneath it, wrapped around my bedposts and sticking to my sheets.

I then scrambled to the opposite side, just wanting to get away. My blanket wrapped around my legs, trapping me in hair and blood, little bits of flesh squelching against my own skin. I felt like a fish out of water, flailing and flopping against my bed until I fell off the edge. My face thudded against the floor, a bundle of hair sticking to my cheek and smearing blood over my lips. I involuntarily gagged, slipping on more caked blood as I tried to push myself up. My feet skidded as I sprinted forward for my door.

My heart felt like it was going to rattle out of my ribcage and my head felt like a led balloon. I bounced off the wall as I stumbled forward, panic taking over my body. It wasn’t until I reached the door leading to my hallway that I started crying. Laced up and around my door handle were thick ropes of hair. It was braided and wound together, sprouting off into individual ropes across my door and disappearing into the doorframe.

I let out a sob and pushed my back against the opposite wall, quickly shuffling to the only other place I could get out; the bathroom. Shaking fingers reached around the metal door handle and I threw myself into the black room, slamming the door firmly shut behind me.

“Shit,” I cursed, immediately stepping on broken glass. “Shit, shit, shit,” I kept repeating, throwing my hands blindly ahead of me, trying to feel for the door to the hallway.

Broken glass ripped at my feet, crunching under my skin with each step. I bit my lip, reopening the split down the middle as I walked forward. With a sickening pop, the bulbs burst with light, raining sparks over me. I crouched down and screamed, shielding my body from the fireworks. I stayed huddled in a little ball, my lungs begging me to give them some space to fill up.

After a minute of silence, I finally tore open my eyes to see a clean, glass free floor under my bleeding feet. I straightened my spine and looked around, seeing nothing but a clean, organized bathroom. My eyes shot up to the bulbs, fresh ones in place of the ones once exploded. I fell back onto my butt, beginning to doubt myself.

*Was I dreaming? Did I make this up? Am I going crazy?*

I looked down at my legs and brought my unbandaged foot into my lap, seeing nicks and cuts etched into the sole of my skin. I squeezed a couple, earning streams of blood from each one.

“Fresh cuts,” I winced, “I’m not crazy.”

I quickly pulled my bandaged foot into my lap, ripping through the fragile toilet paper wrapped around it. With each layer I tore through, the darker the blood got. I crumpled up the used toilet paper and brushed it to the side of me, too confused to look at anything but my skin. In the middle of my foot lay an already scabbed over cut, no bigger than an inch.

Something made me reach forward and pick at the scab’s edge. Fresh blood pooled up and caked under my fingernails as I pulled and poked at my skin. As if I was pulling off a band aid, the scab came off in one, solid piece…except for a little sliver in the middle.

I squinted and dug my finger into the cut, hissing a bit at the harsh sting radiating up my foot, but it didn’t stop me from prodding further. I got hold of the tiny piece between my fingers, gently tugging it from my cut. The tiny black piece grew longer, gently snaking its way from beneath my skin. I could feel it unwinding under my flesh, little bumps from where it had gathered gently rolled and uncurled. My skin moved on its own the more I pulled the object from my body before finally coming to the end. The black hair was weighed down with my blood, sticking to my fingers and refusing to be shaken off.

I sobbed again, feeling violated in the strangest way I could never even begin to explain. My shoulders shook as I hung my head, folding into myself and wanting to melt into the floor. I was tired, so tired. Physically, emotionally, mentally, in general. I furiously wiped my tears away, making stars explode over my vision as I choked back my sobs.

*Drip*.

I held my breath, testing the air to see if the noise would come again.

*Drip*.

I whipped my head around to the noise, my eyes locking on the shower. The curtain was pulled shut, like it always is in typical horror movies.

*Drip*.

I heaved myself up, popping onto my feet as quickly as my fresh cuts would allow. I was not about to creep forward and slowly pull back the curtain, dragging the moment on for suspense. I wanted this to end. I *needed* this to end. I hobbled forward and grabbed a fist full of the shower curtain, almost ripping it off the rings.

“Son of a bitch!” I hissed, flinging the curtain away from me.

I stumbled back, all my previous anger draining from my face. The mural of hair remained in its same spot as before but with two differences. Its face was sharper, more pointed and defined than before. Its chin came to a harsh 30-degree angle, the corners of its eyes seeming to match it, but it was the creature’s mouth that disturbed me the most. Instead of the overstretched grin it previously wore, it now displayed a full array of spiked teeth, perfectly outlined with bits of my sister’s hair. Obnoxiously oversized, the thing’s mouth took up most of its face, threatening to swallow me whole.

At the end of its outstretched fingers were clumps of mangled flesh, speckled with blood and tangled with hair. Some of the blood had pooled at the ends of each clump, hanging down until it became too heavy to hold. One by one, droplets traveled through the air, landing against the tub in a steady *drip, drip, drip.*

I heard a familiar whine and hiss coming from over my shoulder. My eyes flicked toward the lightbulbs as they threatened to explode again. I backed away from the tub, returning my eyes to the creature’s mural. I blindly walked backward, the lights around my slowly dimming and brightening, hissing against the unnatural surges of electricity. Flashes danced around me, making me squint and blink uncontrollably. My eyes wanted to cross at the confusion, trying to stay focused on the creature and trying to balance out the different light sources.

The corner of the marble counter dug into my hip, send shooting stabs up into my side. I hissed and stumbled away, just wanting to escape. All at once, the lights went out, throwing me back into darkness with that thing. My breath wavered as I sunk to the ground, feeling my way toward the door. Bright flashes stung my eyes, the bulbs now pulsing. Each one flashed separately, going on and off, throwing strobes around the room. Everything looked choppy as I moved, the lights only allowing flash-images to be seen.

My head spun back toward the shower, seeing a clean tile wall. The creature was gone. I shuffled backward, sliding across the floor on my butt. I watched something gently creep over the tub’s edge. Sharpened points peeked over, looking like knife tips. They gently curled over the edge, revealing that they were fingertips of a hand. The gray flesh wrapped around the edge, snaking its way out. Another hand popped up on the other side, trying to pull the creature’s body up and over the tub.

“Stop,” I wept, saying the only thing I could think of. “Please, stop.”

My feet scuttled around me, trying to push my body across the floor as fast as I could. My back slammed against the door and I threw my hands up over my head, searching for the handle. I saw the creature’s spindly arms pop up over the tub, bony elbows sticking up awkwardly in the air. The arms were nothing but sinew and gray flesh, bits of loose, wet hair clinging to them.

My shaking fingers wrapped around the metal door handle and I swung the door into my back, trying to pull myself up and out at the same time. I lifted my own body into the air and crawled through the cracked open door, sliding down the hall for a bit before standing up and running down the stairs.

I ran past the living room, wanting to get as far away from the stairs as I could, and ended up in the kitchen. I sat at our island and turned on all the lights, wanting no part of my body to be covered by shadows. I hopped onto one of the bar stools and let my head collapse into my crossed arms. I could feel my blood pumping, as if there was not enough room in my veins for it all. The more I breathed, the more my adrenaline began to dissipate. Waves of pain hammered through my body, from the cuts on my feet, to the bruise on my hip, to pent up stress in my shoulders.

“Whoo,” I breathed, leaving an audible puff of air to fade around me.

My house was now still and quiet, the streetlights faintly glowing through the windows downstairs. It was as if I was the only one left in the world awake, a feeling I was used to having. Growing up, I had the worst time trying to sleep. I don’t know if it was stress from school or just the stress of growing up in general, but I remember laying in our room, feeling like I was awake in a world that had gone to bed. It was during those times that I would wake up Nicki.

She used to tell me that on the other side of the world, people were just waking up. That the sun might be set here, but for others it was rising. She would tell me that I was never alone, that there would always be people in the world awake with me, including her. She would wait until I fell asleep before she crawled back into her own bed.

“Nick,” I cried, “are you awake?” I felt odd speaking into the air, but it didn’t feel like I was talking to just the air.

It felt like I was talking to Nicki, as if she was just in the other room and could hear me. I sat up straight in the chair and looked out the kitchen window into our backyard. The stars twinkled, the dark suburban neighborhood allowing space to cast its own light down on us.

“Nick, you gotta help,” I pleaded, wiping my eyes. “I don’t know what to do.”

*Thunk, thunk, thunk.*

My eyes widened and my shoulders ate my ears as something clanged down the stairs. I slid off the stool and peeked around the corner, eyes locking directly on what had fallen down the steps.

“What the shit,” I groaned, looking at the tortoiseshell hairbrush laying perfectly at the end of the staircase. “Nicki? Is that you?”

I crept closer to the brush, something in my stomach telling me that it was okay. I pulled the familiar handle into my palm and back peddled into the kitchen. I took a moment to just sit and look at the thing, the very brush that I had thrown away was back in my possession. I would have expected it to look dirty, having been in with the other trash, but it looked good as new. Except for the worn handle from years of use and…

A small smile etched onto my lips as I pulled the one strand of chocolate hair from the bristles. It was not pitch black or covered in blood, and there were no chunks of flesh on it. It was Nicki.

“Thank you,” I smiled, racing from the kitchen to the living room.

I grabbed my mom’s laptop, not wanting to go upstairs and get my own, and brought it back into the lit kitchen. I pushed the brush aside and opened the computer, pulling up Google.

*What does hair symbolize?*

I spent the night trying to find any meaning or symbols to hair, blood, water, brushes, lights, anything that I had been experiencing. I found some things, but nothing that really made sense to what I was experiencing. Not until I stumbled upon one website. It had to have been on the 13th page of my google search and I don’t really remember what made me click on it.

The page itself was nothing special, there were no special colors, not animations or fancy fonts. It was just a plain white page with basic Arial, black text. For some reason, that made me feel like I was in the right spot. There were no gimmicks, no ads, nothing to distract me from the text I was reading. The post, however, didn’t seem so much like an informational post, but more of a warning. This is what it read:

*My wife had gotten sick in 2001. The doctors couldn’t really figure out what exactly was wrong with her,* *but she was in and out of the hospital for a couple of months. I don’t know if that weakened her and allowed the thing to attach or what, but everything started happening when my wife passed away a couple years later.*

*I’m not the biggest jewelry wearer, but one of the funeral directors who helped with my wife’s service gave me a locket. As one would suspect, I wasn’t taking her passing very well. The assistant director, I think his name was John, gave me the locket and told me it might help to take a piece of her with me. He said snip a bit of her hair and place it in the locket, that way she would always be close to my heart.*

*So, I did. I thought it was really helping me for a while. Any time I started missing her or feeling sad, I would hold the locket in my palm and would feel close to my wife again. After a while, I would find her hairs laying around the house. I knew it was hers because mine is dark brown and short, hers was long and blonde. I would find long blonde hairs stuck to my shirt at work, pulling them off from my car seat, in bed, the shower.*

*After a while, they started getting a darker color until they reached their final black shade. Now, I know the first thing you’re thinking and no, I wasn’t having any girls over and I live alone in mine and my wife’s house. It started concentrating itself in my bathrooms and around my sinks; big wads of black hair.*

*Needless to say, I didn’t really feel like wearing the locket anymore, being around any hair, let alone my dead wife’s, wasn’t feeling comforting anymore. I hung it up in my bedroom closet and the next morning I woke up to a puddle of water seeping from the bottom of the closet door. I thought maybe a pipe had burst until I actually opened the door.*

*Hanging in the middle of my closet was the locket that had my wife’s hair in it, but instead of seeing the neatly bundled blonde locks through the cage, stringy strands of black, wet hair hung from the locket. It tangled around the heart cage and dripped like a leaky faucet.*

*I’m not a superstitious man, but it wasn’t until I brought the locket home that these things started happening. I tried throwing it away, burying it, burning it, everything, but it kept showing back up in my closet. Eventually, the hair started falling in patterns. I don’t want to sound crazy, but it looked like faces. I don’t know. I finally took it to a pawn shop and sold it. That’s when everything stopped.*

*I don’t know who has the locket now, but I went to the pawn shop about a month later and saw that the building was boarded up with a for lease sign hanging on the door. I don’t know where this creature came from or what it wanted with me, but it hasn’t returned since I sold the locket.*

*I don’t know where else to turn, so I thought the internet could help. Honestly, any knowledge will help put my mind at ease.*

*Jarrod Pilanco*

*September 6, 2003*

I tried looking up his name, if I could get an email, phone number, address, anything, but nothing came up on Jarrod Pilanco. I wanted to talk to him and try to get some more information or to at least tell him that he’s not the only one this had happened too, but that came up a dead end. But, the next thing I googled was *nearest pawn shop*.

I found a 24 hour one 10 miles away and needed no other information to motivate me. I hopped off the barstool and went into the laundry room to grab some clothes. I wasn’t going to go back upstairs until this brush was out of the house, so I had to settle for some dirty sweatpants and a hoodie. I threw on my shoes, grabbed the keys and the brush, and left Mom and Dad a note.

*Went out for breakfast, be back soon.*

I hated lying to them, but I didn’t need to drag them into this. I threw the brush into the trunk and hopped into the car. My mind was racing and it took everything in my power to stay focused on where I was going, or even the fact that I was driving, which terrified me. It was about 10 minutes into the drive when I noticed a familiar sign.

Up ahead was the funeral home and cemetery where Nicki is buried. My eyes kept flicking from the road to the sign. My hands worked on their own and I ended up turning into the funeral home parking lot. I unbuckled my belt, popped my trunk, took the brush, and before I really knew what I was doing, I was at the gates to the cemetery.

I could see Nicki’s grave from the sidewalk, small and unassuming. I hadn’t visited her since the night she was buried and instantly felt guilty. Her flowers were wilted and browning, bits of grass growing over her headstone.

“Hello,” a voice chirped from behind me.

I jumped and spun around, coming face to face with a man in a black suit. I gripped the hair brush in my hand, thinking of using it as a weapon if I needed to, but quickly let out a breath. I remembered the man as one of the funeral directors.

“Hi,” I awkwardly laughed, “sorry.”

“Nothing to be sorry about,” he smiled, nodding to the cemetery. “Seems a bit early to be paying your respects?” he asked, eyes flicking toward the just rising sun.

“I know, I’m sorry,” I shook my head. “I wasn’t really supposed to end up here.”

“Well, if you think about it, none of us *really* expect to end up here,” he laughed at his morbid joke.

I gave a sad chuckle and nodded, “Sorry for intruding or-”

“No, no,” he brushed it off, leading me into the funeral parlor, “no intrusion at all. There must be a reason you came here.” I just nodded, looking down at the brush in my hands. “Would you like some coffee? I was just making some for the staff when they get here.”

“S-sure,” I hesitated, walking into the door he was holding open, “thank you.”

“Of course,” he smiled. “You’re not the first early morning visitor I’ve gotten in my time. Definitely not the creepiest.”

“Really?” I asked, the end of my question rising with my surprise.

He just chuckled and shook his head, pouring both of us a cup of coffee, “You wouldn’t believe some of the things I’ve seen.”

I sat down in a metal folding chair in the kitchen, looking beside me out the window. There was a perfect view of the cemetery, Nicki’s grave hogging the spotlight. I took the coffee with a quiet thank you as I listened to his brief stories.

“One morning I discovered someone had taken the liberty of breaking into the parlor and spending the night with their loved one in the coffin,” he began, making me almost choke on my coffee. “But, then again, I found one gentleman in the cemetery trying to dig up his loved one, so it could be worse.”

“I would have never guessed,” I mumbled. “Why do you still do it? If you don’t mind me asking,” I added, thinking my question seemed a bit insensitive.

The man shrugged, taking a sip of his coffee, “It’s just what I do. It’s what I’ve been called to do.” He took a moment and looked out the window, a shadow of something coming over his face, “It’s what feels right.”

His words would have been sweet, if it weren’t for the strange look on his face. It wasn’t one of pride or happiness, as cliché as those may seem, it was one of…love? Not love of something but *someone*. It was like he was staring at the love of his life, waiting for her to run into his arms, but he was just looking out at the cemetery.

A creepy shiver ran up my spine, making it extra difficult to swallow the gulp of coffee I was trying to get down. “That’s…really sweet,” I choked out, trying to break the silence. “Well, thank you for the coffee, but I-”

“So, what brings you here so early?” he interrupted, snapping his head back in my direction.

“I-I don’t know,” I shrugged, trying to smile.

“Something just calling you back?” he asked with a knowing nod. I saw his eyes flick to my lap where my hairbrush was laying.

“You could say that,” I swallowed.

“It’s good you listened to it,” he smiled, eyes flicking back to the brush. “Sometimes you just have to trust your…gut.”

“Yeah,” I muttered, the word practically falling from my mouth.

“Because, you know, there are things out there that know better than we do,” he explained, leaning forward on his elbows. “Before I knew that, I was lost. But now that I speak to her, she’s brought me to my true calling.” My body was glued to my chair, limbs feeling too heavy to move. “Everyone had told me ‘John, you’re going crazy’, ‘John, something’s not right’, but they were just jealous she didn’t choose them. They’re just mad that I get to usher in the new era.”

I went to push my chair away from him, but he gripped the metal sides, getting even closer to my face, “You should be honored.”

His eyes were muddy and wild at the same time, swirling with excitement. I brought my hand up and splashed the hot coffee over his face, covering myself in the scolding waterfall as well.

“AGGH!” he growled, falling back into his chair, knuckles pressing into his eyes.

I shot up and ran, throwing the cup over my shoulder and keeping the brush firmly in my grasp. I sprinted to my car, fumbling with my keys before opening my door and locking myself inside. I threw the brush into the seat next to me and slammed the key into the ignition.

“STOP!” he hissed, hands pressed up against my window.

I screamed and slammed my foot against the gas. I hadn’t even heard him run up to my car. His hands fumbled with the handle of my car, snapping the lever against my door, trying to break through the lock.

“YOU CANNOT DENY HER! SHE WILL BE RELEASED!”

I cut my wheel sharply to the right and sped off, leaving the man to be thrown to the ground behind me. Thank God hardly anyone was on the road because I definitely didn’t look before I pulled out of the parking lot. My eyes flicked to my rearview mirror, wanting to see if the man was running after me, but something stole my attention.

Behind the cemetery gate, wrapped in tangled, black hair, was my sister. Her scraped and bloodied hands were snarled around the gate bars, clinging to them as if the black hair was trying to pull her away. Twigs and mud were caked to her head as if she had just clawed her way up from her own grave.

I blinked my eyes away and pushed the gas pedal faster, white knuckles wrapped around my steering wheel. I pulled into the 24-hour pawn shop faster than I thought, and barely got my car into park before throwing myself out. I snatched up the brush and ran to the front door, rushing in a bit too fast.

The little bell on the door was knocked off, rolling behind the counter somewhere out of sight. The man behind the counter shot up from his chair, reaching under the table at something I couldn’t see but assumed was a firearm. The minute he saw my face, his shoulders relaxed and question clouded his features.

“Are you alright ma’am?” he asked, pulling at his tank top.

I huffed and walked the last couple steps toward the counter, slamming the brush down, “How much

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It’s been a while since I was at the pawn shop, or that funeral home and cemetery for that matter. Everything is back to normal; no more stray hairs, puddles of water, flashing lights, figures drawn on my shower wall. I’m still trying to find Jarrod Pilanco but there’s no luck yet. I’ll visit my sister’s grave eventually, but not alone and not early in the morning when that John guy is the only person there. As for the hairbrush, I sold it. I hate having it out there for someone else to buy, but I just couldn’t keep it.

,LetsTalkMusic,"In terms of UK music there's one genre most people can name: Grime. However after the last 2015-17 wave, this year Grime has died down and been replaced by /r/UKDrill and /r/AfroBashment - here's an introduction to the latter.

I'm by no means an ""expert"" but I figured this might be interesting to some, lmk what you think.

---

Unlike other UK dance genres which have traditionally been defined by the tempo and arrangement of the drums, Afrobeats/bashment is largely defined by melody; no matter what speed the track, the vocals will be delivered in an autotuned West African scale that's as sweet as it is mournful. It's hard to describe but unmistakable once heard. ([source](https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/xwddaq/why-this-is-such-an-exciting-time-for-the-afrobeats-scene-in-the-uk))

It comes under a lot of names, the most popular would be AfroBashment, Afroswing, Afrobeats and Afrowave. They all mostly describe the same sound, people just haven't picked a name yet because of how new it is.

What is it? Think dancehall, mixed in with *Afrobeat*, mixed in with Grime and a bit of UK Funky and you get Afrobashment. Chill, wavey summer type tunes.

What's interesting about Afrobashment is that the UK scene has always been dominated by Jamaican sounds, whereas African sounds were sorta pushed into the background. Whereas now you have [groups using their West African accents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moZI7CT29KU) without shame, and African influenced music making it in the charts.

##Important Artists/Songs/Albums

J Hus is by far the most important figure here that started this current wave of Afro-[] sounds in the UK. His first mixtape was called the [best of the year by NME](https://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/article/rjqwe8/j-hus-an-unsigned-rapper-from-newham-just-dropped-one-of-the-mixtapes-of-the-year) and his song [Dem Boy Paigon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6gttfNjIDg) is argbuably the most influential song in this list.

##History

[Here's a good article that goes over the history of AfroBashment](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/01/grime-afro-bashment-drill-how-black-british-music-became-more-fertile-than-ever). 

[This documentary is also a good watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyrpS2rZK6Q).

&gt;Take Afro bashment. Despite being an increasing presence in the UK – J Hus’s debut album, Common Sense, peaked in the charts at No 6 last month – it has a shifting brand identity, and is also known as Afro trap, Afro swing and Afro hop. Its origins lie at the point where grime was replaced in late 00s raves with the more upbeat, warm-weather sounds of funky house. With catchphrase choruses and choreographed dance routines, UK funky dominated the black club scene; even grime artists jumped onboard, such as Boy Better Know, with their riotous 2009 track Too Many Man.

&gt;It is also unapologetic about its African influence, with songs such as Donae’o’s [African Warrior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ5s11N-Sb0), Fr3e’s [Tribal Skank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxVXbQPOS1M), and [Jungle Skank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Jp_WqICwrk) by JP Tronik.

&gt;UK funky also gave way to another iteration of African-inspired music: UK Afrobeats, pioneered by the likes of Fuse ODG, Kwamz &amp; Flava and Mista Silva around 2011. A star of the Nigerian iteration, Wizkid, appeared on Drake’s One Dance last year – which sampled UK funky track Do You Mind by Kyla – and it felt seamless. “The scene was very static, but when we came with that sound it kind of brought life,” says Mista Silva. “It’s feelgood music – grime and hip-hop at the time was very dark, but this was bringing people together.”

&gt;Afro bashment was spawned off the back of these two genres; its defacto founder, the producer Timbo, says it was created as a less saccharine alternative to the Afrobeats music that had crossed over to the mainstream – such as the 2011 track [Oliver Twist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQP-etYU1ps) by Nigerian Afrobeats artist D’banj. “I didn’t want to do the Oliver Twist sound. I’m not that. I’m from the streets.”

&gt;But Afro bashment’s complexity is only one side of black British music. During grime’s lost years between the late 00s and 2014, another sound grew into prominence: road rap, headed by the likes of Young Spray, K Koke, Krept and Konan, and Giggs, who set the pace for the new generation in recent years of rappers such as Nines, Fredo and Mist. Drill, and the more American-influenced UK trap, then gained prominence in south London and has thrived due to its comparative grit. But there is crossover and hybridity even between this and the Afro bashment world, as music journalist Ciaran Thapar points out: “Belly Squad [a trio of Afro bashment artists] did a tune with drill rapper Headie One and he’s talking about being in prison and shotting [drug dealing],” he says. “On Forrest Gump, Loski is singing about stabbing someone, but it sounds like he’s singing about chirpsing [chatting up] a girl.”

##Afrobeats

As seen above, Afrobeats (Named as such by DJ Abrantee) is sort of the precursor to what would become AfroBashment. It is sometimes applied to *all* of AfroBashment, and also music that comes out of Africa - so it can be a bit confusing. Generally UK Afrobeats is best applied to music that sounds [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwb4CH1n7Bw), where the *Afrobeat* sound is much more evident.  A popular artist [would be Maleek Berry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TqLs0PoQbs) and [Fuse ODG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGdqF9udP1o).

https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jan/19/the-rise-of-afrobeats

&gt;As London ushered in its Olympic year at midnight on 31 December, the official fireworks playlist blaring out over the Thames moved predictably through Vangelis, Soft Cell, Shirley Bassey and Adele. But it was accompanied by one less obvious choice: D'Banj's [Oliver Twist](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY3kM3e9Gcg). It may have been the first time most of the 250,000 revellers heard the hit-in-waiting from the Nigerian rap star, but it probably won't be the last. 

&gt;At that moment, London DJ Abrantee, the man who gave the name ""Afrobeats"" to the hottest scene in the UK right now, was getting ready to fly to Egypt, where the very same song ""tore the place apart"" in front of a Cairo club crowd more used to house music. Most people are familiar with the Afrobeat styles of Fela Kuti – Afrobeats is something different; with the addition of the letter ""s"" comes a whole new chapter in global pop music.

&gt;Abrantee's neologism describes a new sound – a 21st-century melting pot of western rap influences, and contemporary Ghanaian and Nigerian pop music – but it didn't drop out of a clear blue sky. ""I've been playing this music to three or four thousand people at African events in the UK for years,"" he explains. ""Things like the Ghana Independence celebrations or the Hiplife festival at the O2 in London last year. Bringing it to the mainstream is a different ball game, though – D'Banj getting played on New Year's Eve at the Thames, that kind of certifies it now – this is serious! For years we've had amazing hiplife, highlife, Nigerbeats, juju music, and I thought: you know what, let's put it all back together as one thing again, and call it Afrobeats, as an umbrella term. Afrobeat, the 60s music, was more instrumental – this Afrobeats sound is different, it's intertwined with things like hip-hop and funky house, and there's more of a young feel to it.""

http://www.thegryphon.co.uk/2017/10/13/like-your-style-the-sounds-of-uk-afrobeats/

&gt;The rise of Afrobeats can be can be partly attributed to Fuse ODG (real name Nana Richard Abiona). Abiona took to the UK in 2012 Ghanaian influences of Afropop and Naija Beats, as well as the Azonto; a dance from Ghana he transformed into a viral hit that made its ways onto British mainstream radio. Fast-paced, high-energy tunes like Antenna and Million Pound Girl crept their way into the charts, and nightclubs soon followed suit. But the use of African styles was by no means a marketing strategy. The title of his 2014 album, T.I.N.A, stands for ‘This Is New Africa,’ and his website promotes initiatives to build schools in Ghana, stating, ‘his mission is re-programming the world’s mental image of Africa, it’s people and its diaspora’. This positive image promotion of ‘New’ Africa as modern, relevant and full of energy was, and still is, uplifting as well as progressive.

&gt;In the UK today, Afrobeats has changed into something different. Unlike the Fuse ODG era, the current sound is relaxed. West African elements are fused with grime and hip-hop, the result less energetic and somewhat more laid-back. J Hus, of Gambian descent, is the most relevant example of this. Vocals on his hooks are melodic and soft, challenging the hard exterior of a typical UK grime ego, and the tone is uplifting. Some elements of his debut album Common Sense, like ‘Did You See’, take on a lighthearted, cheeky tone, with others, like ‘Good Luck Chale’ tackling darker issues in youth culture. This, combined with classic Afrobeats digital sounds and percussion, as well as influences from The Streets, shows the mish-mash sound that UK Afrobeats can be. It’s a genre that allows for freedom.

##Afrobbean

Afrobbean is the name [Lotto Boyzz](https://crackmagazine.net/article/album-reviews/lotto-boyzz-afrobbean/) gives its sound, with [an album](https://song.link/album/gb/i/1277177521) of the same name that's meant to ""define"" it. Effectively it is the same as AfroBashment, just another name floating about.

http://www.okayafrica.com/lotto-boyzz-afrobbean-sound-interview/

&gt;Your EP, Afrobbean, reflects a blend of various sounds from across the globe. Why did you feel the need to create a genre of your own?

&gt;&gt;Ash: On the afro-side there was afrobeat but we felt like on the Caribbean side there was just bashment, which felt a bit narrow to us. Growing up, my mum (who's from Montserrat) used to play gospel in the house and whenever she'd leave I'd change the channel to MTV so that I could listen to R. Kelly and Usher. So we wanted to be more holistic and bring together a variety of sounds that influence us like reggae, dancehall, afrobeat and gospel.

##Afroswing / Afro Swing

One of the more popular terms out there, Afroswing was coined [by Kojo Funds to describe his sound](https://crackmagazine.net/article/long-reads/kojo-funds-king-afroswing/), although it has been adopted to describe the entire genre.

&gt;It’s a mix of different genres,” he tells me with purpose, in a baritone drawl, twiddling his fingers with as much ease as crafting his sound. “Dancehall, Afrobeats, you get a new jack swing vibe and RnB vibe mixed in as well. That’s the ‘swing’ part of it, and there’s no one else in the scene doing it except me. I’m not trying to be defined as an Afrobeats artist.”

&gt;Afroswing can be extracted from Kojo’s musical leanings. His breakout single, 2016’s Dun Talkin, has all the rhythms of conventional Afrobeats, but with drum sequences that can be found in dancehall. Such a diverse sound has transcended into recognition in the popular sphere, aided by collaborations with Wretch 32, Mabel, Chip and Liv Dawson, and over 10 million views of his songs on YouTube.

##Afrowave

Afrowave was coined by [Afro B](https://www.redbull.com/gb-en/afro-b-interview-UK-afrobeats) ([here's a song of his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHVFcHfTtI))

&gt;I call it Afrowave – it's a sort of fusion of hip-hop, dancehall and Afrobeat melodies, all in one. The lyrics make it a UK sound but the actual beat and the melodies expand out to Africa. I actually think African audiences enjoy the more rap-led thing more, because it's so different to what they're used to hearing. 

He's put out two albums to ""define"" the genre, [Afrowave](https://song.link/album/gb/i/1202938340) and [Afrowave 2](https://song.link/album/gb/i/1406392166).

,Blackops4,"**Beta – Week 2: Day 2 Recap - PC**

We’ve got 24 hours left in the Beta and we’re still hard at work making updates – here’s what you can expect today: 

§ **General Fixes (PC):** We did a first round of gameplay balancing based on early performance of weapons and attachments, purely on the PC. 

o **Sniper Rifles**

§ As it's easier to perform accurate shots on PC with a mouse, we have moved up locational damages for Paladin and Koshka by 1 unit up so it's now required to shoot a bit higher to obtain a one-shot kill.

§ Koshka + Laser Sight: In the same way, we also increased the Hip Spread when using Laser Sight on the Koshka since PC players can turn faster with great accuracy. It should make Hip Fire one-shot kills a bit harder to perform with Laser Sight.

§ Koshka: We adjusted both quickdraw attachments to make them just a bit slower when you ADS with the Koshka.

o **MOG 12**

§ Choked Barrel: We have reduced the damage gained per pellet at longer ranges and lowered the Hip Fire Spread bonus. This should make it harder to score one-shot kill outside of the shotgun optimal range without Aiming Down Sights.

There are a number of other items that have landed on our radar that we’re currently tracking. Here they are:

§ **Random Crashes**: Unfortunately, some players are still reporting various crashes.  We won't be able to address all these issues, but it's really helpful that you report them on Twitter @ATVIAssist and Reddit u/ATVIAssist.  Please provide as much as detail as you can, to help us find common trends.  One last tip, make sure you open the [Battle.net](http://battle.net/) app, click on Black Ops 4, Options, then Scan and Repair, some players mentioned it fixed their issues. 

§ **Weapon Balancing**: Since we integrated yesterday's fixes (GKS and ABR 223 cross-platform balancing tweaks) and our own, we'll take a good look at various analytics dashboards today to see how they impact the game.  We'll continue to monitor your games and comments, so keep playing!  Regarding the melee attack, our data analysis shows that the average melee kills registered per game is similar across each platform.  However, since we removed the aim assist on PC (which impacted the melee attack), we know it's harder to perform on PC.  We are working on a fix for this and it will be addressed for launch, thanks to your great feedback.

§ **Visual Bugs**: Some players are reporting that visual bugs are appearing at lower resolutions and with the lowest graphics settings (ex.: model quality and render resolution to low).  We are aware of these (notably those see-through glitches such as in the Hacienda map), and this is something we will address for launch. 

§ **Failed to Host Lobby Error**: This morning, we began seeing PC players encountering “failed to host lobby” errors. Players who encounter these errors are essentially locked out of MP with this error appearing each time they attempt to launch a new game. We’ve seen some success with players resetting their internet routers. @ATVIassist will continue working with players to resolve – in the meantime, we’ll continue to track the issue.

And here are some tips for the PC version:

§ You can use shortcuts to switch classes quickly. These shortcuts are rebindable and set to the numbers 1 to 6 of your Numeric Pad by default.

§ A great way to ensure a smooth experience is to set a custom limit to your framerate (Graphics – Display – Gameplay Framerate Limit) at something that your PC can sustain. Having over 120 FPS is nice, but having a constant framerate should feel even better.

§ You can press “O” (fully rebindable) to open the social menu to invite your *online* friends *to your party*!""

Right now, you’ve got 2XP and 2xWeaponXP to keep you busy, a new map to dominate (Hacienda), a new mode to master (Heist), and a Level Cap of 40 to hit. 

Regarding the level cap, you’ve got some work to do on that last one (you know who you are). And the reward for doing it? Players that achieve max rank during the Beta will earn one permanent unlock token, which unlocks any item from the Create-a-Class menu at launch. 

Treyarch &amp; Beenox

**APPENDIX:**

The following changes will be deployed across all platforms today:

· **General Fixes**

o General Stability and Performance Improvements

· **Scorestreaks:**

o General

§ Increased the delay at the start of a round before you can activate certain lethal Scorestreaks. 

o **Strike Team**

§ Doubled the health of each Strike Team squad member. This should help the Strike Team survive and react in situations where they are taking fire from several enemies at once. 

o **Mantis**

§ Fixed a text string on the Care Package containing the Mantis

· **Maps:**

o **Gridlock:**

§ Fixed an exploitable location near the bath house which allowed players to look across the map

Yesterday, PC players began digging into Black Ops 4 and the experience has been outstanding – thank you to everyone that has offered such constructive feedback. We’re loving how much everyone is playing and engaged in the conversation around the game! Remember, this weekend, the Beta is open, so if you’re not in – or if you haven’t invited your Battle.net friends to the party – now is the time to do it!

A quick housekeeping note: you’ll see another recap post floating around Reddit, which shouldn’t be confused with what’s happening here. In our updates to the PC community, we’ll make sure to identify what is being deployed for all Black Ops 4 players (global) and what is being deployed specifically for PC players (PC). 

Betas are all about helping to make for the best Day 1 experience possible, and you’ve certainly done your part to do that. So, taking that feedback, it’s time for us to get to work and do ours. . . here’s what you need to know: 

**Saturday Updates (Global)**

Here’s what you’ll see added to the game today: 

* Added Hacienda to all playlists
* Increased level cap to 40
* Activated 2XP and 2Weapon XP

**General Fixes (PC)**

· General stability and error messages in Settings and Heist menus

· Performance and usability of the Settings menu has been improved

· Fixed issue when removing a friend on the scoreboard

As we move forward, we will be integrating all the relevant fixes to the console version (see the PS4/XB1 release notes/Appendix for more information).

Also, NVIDIA released the GeForce  Hotfix Driver Version 398.98 yesterday, which resolved a stutter issue for some configurations.  Download it here: [https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a\_id/4694/\~/geforce-hotfix-driver-version-398.98](https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4694/~/geforce-hotfix-driver-version-398.98) 

There are a number of items that have landed on our radar that we’re currently tracking. If you encounter issues with any of these, please don’t hesitate to report them: 

· **Random Crashes:** What? That never happens in game development. But when it does…we’re investigating these cases, trying to reproduce them, and find common trends.  Some players were able to rectify issues on their own – most notably by disabling third-party programs running in the background, which can interfere with the game.   Follow the steps here to temporarily disable these programs and eliminate them as the source of the problem: [https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/23848](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/23848) 

· **Stuttering Issues:**  Besides updating your graphics drivers, as mentioned above, you could also monitor your GPU temperature (in the Settings menu, you can show this information in Interface – Telemetry). If it rises above \~85°, your GPU may try to protect itself from overheating by throttling.  You should try to do a few things then, such as cap the framerate (Settings Menu – Graphics – Display – Gameplay Framerate Limit), lower graphics options (ex.: post-processing), and make sure your PC is breathing properly (time to use those air cans!). As last resort, you could turn Vertical Sync on (Settings Menu – Graphics – Display).

· **Weapon Balancing:** We've been reading analytics data, watching streamers, monitoring the Black Ops 4 subreddit and we are planning to adjust the sniper guns on PC later today.  Our weapon data will start to diverge from the console data, as we start balancing the experience. Additionally, the melee attack is also a hot topic we're closely monitoring.  We have read reports that it's hard to earn kills with it.  We will be taking a good look at this today.

And here are some friendly tips for the PC version:

· There are menus shortcuts! For example, you can quickly access the Settings menu by pressing F3 (it can be rebound in Keybinds - Interface).

· In Create-a-Class, you can remove items using R or Middle Mouse (it can be rebound in Keybinds - Interface), or using the contextual menu with right-click, then remove.

· The ADS Mouse Sensitivity uses a new formula which helps players build muscle memory on all guns. If this is taking you by surprise, you can revert to how it was in previous Call of Duty titles by setting ""ADS Mouse Sensitivity"" to ""Legacy"". 

The teams at Treyarch and Beenox are fully dedicated to responding as quickly and actively as we can, which is why we pushed our first live update this morning. Today, everyone will get in on the action: the Beta is open and will roll through Monday at 10am/PT. If you haven’t done so already, invite your Battle.net friends!

As always, if you’re encountering problems, please reach out to player support on Twitter @ATVIAssist and Reddit u/ATVIAssist.

Thank you for your feedback and continue to enjoy the Beta – we’re looking forward to playing with you throughout the weekend!

**APPENDIX:** 

The following changes will be deployed across all platforms today: 

**Movement:**

* Jump - As we mentioned in our Day 3 Beta Update, we made some      modifications to jump mechanics to reduce bunny hopping. After reviewing      those changes yesterday and taking into consideration the feedback from      the community, we’ve relaxed some of that tuning by increasing the default      jump height back to where it was last weekend. We are still scaling down      jump height with each subsequent jump to prevent repeated jumping during      combat, but that initial jump is now 5 units higher again. This should      help with some of those more difficult mantles.
* Slide – Alongside our updates to jump, we also made some      slight reductions to slide speeds and distances for Weekend 2. Now that      we’ve had a chance to play with those changes internally and out in the      wild with you all, along with evaluating feedback, we’re slightly      increasing the default slide speed and distance. Our goal is to strike a      nice balance between Weekend 1 and the current tuning. We intend slide to      be used as a way to get to cover and perhaps surprise an enemy around a      corner. This is a delicate balancing act between achieving those      intentions while ensuring slide is not used as a primary means of traversal      and cannot be spammed repeatedly during combat. If you really want to get      your slide game on, check out the Dexterity Perk which will increase your      speed and distance while sliding! 

**Weapons:**

* GKS
   * Extended the damage range to compete better at mid-range.
* ABR 223
   * Increased 2nd shot recoil to make it harder to hit the 3rd       shot in the burst at longer distances.

**Specialists:**

* Recon

Reduced sensor dart duration 

* Torque
   * Reduced razor wire cooldown 

**Scorestreaks:**

* Mantis
   * Health buffed 

**Game Modes:**

* Heist 
   * Removed irrelevant items from the       Hellion Salvo’s upgrade path",t2_1dlnpggr,,,0,,Updates.

,sexstories,"The other day, I (M19) went on a date with a girl (F19) I thought was cute for almost eight years now. We knew of each other thanks to mutual friends and social media, but we never spoke to one another until we matched on Bumble Date (I was so happy she swiped right on me! &lt;3). During our initial talking phase, she asked me about what I liked during sex. I told her a little bit about my kinky fetishes which included handcuffs, being tied down, and forcing it onto each other, to which she responded by opening her flood gate; by the sound of it, she was even kinkier than me! She was into biting, scratching, being forceful, choking, roleplay, being tied down, and more! I knew I found someone special in this cute girl.  Anyway, for our first date, we went to a thrift shop to look around. She had been telling me how she wanted to find a pair of overalls for her and for me because she has a little kink for them. Afterwards, we went to a local burger joint and just enjoyed each other’s company. I just couldn’t stop staring at her. She was just that beautiful! Soon, she started writing cute little notes on the napkins. Nothing out of the ordinary, just things like drawings, cursive, and restating that she likes me (&lt;3). Eventually, she grew braver and wrote “I want to fuck you!”. Reading this was a pretty big turn on for me, so I responded in a similar fashion. Soon after, we were going to go bowling nearby, but then she decided she wanted to go lie down in the car. In the car, we were just sitting there until I asked, “Can I kiss you?”, to which she responded by saying, “Yes”. We shared our first kiss while facing the line of cars on the interstate access road. We stopped so we could go find a place where we could fool around. Before taking off though, she pulled me in a kissed me aggressive. It was such a turn on to see her be so aggressive and want me so bad, not to mention how unexpected that was! I was pretty turned on at that point, but there were too many people nearby, so we drove about 20 minutes to a park near my house that people often go to for car sex. Along the way, she kept teasing my by grabbing my dick and pushing my hands away when I wanted to get a little touchy feely down south and on her tits.  Eventually, we arrived at the park at around 8:45pm. We waited a little while for the 2 cars to leave. After that, we moved to the backseat and just started going wild. We were making out while her Spotify playlist was on in the background, which really set the mood for us. She took off my shirt and soon after I took off hers and her bra. I was on top of her making out with her while slowly making my way down her neck, which really turned her on. I made my way to her perfect tits, where I used my tongue, fingers, and teeth to get her a little more excited. Eventually, I made my way down her chest to her belly, and finally to her pussy, which was still hidden by her jeans. We took her jeans off and there it was! She was already so wet. I proceeded to start licking her, then nibbling and sucking a little bit. She tasted so good! I wanted it all! I kept going and she became more and more twitchy. I could feel her legs reacting to my mouth pleasing her, which I found to be very hot. She kept moaning and moaning my name, which was so sexy to me to know that I was getting her off.  Eventually, she went down on me in the backseat of my car. I loved hearing her sucking on my dick, along with me pushing her head farther down. We repositioned ourselves to where I could see her face while sucking. I loved the eye contact we maintained during, it was such a turn on! I never actually put my dick inside her pussy, although she certainly begged for it, even begging for it raw. We went about 6 rounds and spent about 4.5 hours fooling around in the car, implementing handcuffs, forced oral, and forced kissing. Then, at around 2:45am, we saw a bright light behind us followed by red and blue lights flashing. I got so scared, but she seemed so cool, calm, and collected. The cop came over to my window and shined his light inside. We were in out underwear and shirts, so thankfully he didn’t see anything. I lowered the window and he told us to step out of the car and hand him our IDs. We stood there on the wet pavement parking lot for what felt like an eternity. I was scared still, but she seemed so calm, which was really cool! The cop came back and told us that he could take us both to jail for doing what we did in the park. But thankfully, he just told us to leave and get a room! I got into the driver’s seat while she stayed in the backseat, and we drove away, with the cop following us until we got on the highway. Despite our little run in with the park police, we had a pretty fun time together. We both look forward to the next time we can fool around together, but at my house next time! Car sex was great and all, but it was pretty scary getting caught by the police!",t2_1jciv760,,,0,,"True story: Car sex interrupted by a cop (Not a writer, sorry if y’all think my recollection and writing are trash!)",[],r/sexstories,False,1.0,,,,,False,,False,dark,,,public,,,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},,False,17,,,,self,False,,[],,,True,,,text,1.0,,,text,self.sexstories,,,,,,,False,False,True,False,False,,,False,,True,False,False,,,,,,,t5_2qt19,,,,,96q2et,,,redwarhawk02,,2,True,house_only,False,,,,/r/sexstories/comments/96q2et/true_story_car_sex_interrupted_by_a_cop_not_a/,house_only,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexstories/comments/96q2et/true_story_car_sex_interrupted_by_a_cop_not_a/,35937,1534089816.0,0,,False,,,,,,,,1528524833.0,1536745587.0,,,
,RocketLeague,"I have been playing a lot lately. I have realized some things and I would like to share it with you guys. Don't hate me for it, I just wanna help you. I am not a native english speaker. If you don't wanna read all this, skip all the way down.

I used to have a big problem with ranking up in Doubles since I was stuck on Diamond 3 like a half year ago. I was desperate to get Champion. I know many people experienced the same thing. You know the moment when you get Division 4 and all you need to rank up is one win, but then you get a retarded teammate who leaves the match early and since that moment, you start falling down to Division 1. Then you climb up again and when you're about to rank up, your ping goes up and you lose. And your day is completely ruined. Well, I have come up with this new theory. It is not my teammates fault, it is not the server, it is not the ping, it is not the opponent, it is not a bad luck. IT'S ME.

My main problem was I kept winning ---&gt; losing ---&gt; winning ----&gt; losing and it was driving me crazy. I realized I was not consistent at all. Every new match I started doing some weird ass shit I haven't done before. On every kickoff, I tried a different jump or different hit. Then of course, we conceded. I didn't rotate properly. At all. I was trying to hit every fucking ball that got even a bit close to the opponent's net. It was so stupid from me. I was losing match by match, 1:4, 0:3, 0:2, 2:5, one by one. I was trying new aerials (even tho I have no clue how to hit them). I was missing open nets, I was getting dribbled on all the time. 

I changed the playlist then. Because, of course, I BLAMED THE DOUBLES. Let's play 3s now, I will get lucky here for sure!

No. The same shit. 

I tried 1v1, BIG MISTAKE. xD If you know what I mean.

I got back to 2v2 with my friend. He was, give or take, the same level as me. Not really consistent, one match he was playing like a GOD, the next match he dragged us down. Same as me. 

Few weeks ago, I played Rocket League and I found a friend in 2s. Great guy from England. We befriended on Steam and played together. We haven't lost a match that night. We have won like 17 matches in a row, and it got me boosted to Champ 2 or 3, where I am until today.

I thought I have found a Rocket League soulmate, we really understand each other in the game. But again, I was wrong. It was again not the teammate who was responsible for the wins/losses. It was me and my attitude.

SKIPPED? READ HERE. SKIPPED? READ HERE. SKIPPED? READ HERE.

Most of the time, when you lose, it is your fault. I would say 90%. 5% it is connection problem and 5% of the time, you lose because the opponents literally crush you.

Now think about it. You minimize your mistakes and your chance to win gets higher. Simple as that. If you follow all these steps and your opponents does not, you are more likely to win.

1. Don't do stupid kickoffs. Do the same consistent kickoff all the time. Doesn't have to be a bad ass kickoff, just a regular, normal kickoff to start the gameplay. If your teammate goes for kickoff, be ready for what happens next, you can easily score right away but also, you can easily concede. Try to have maximum boost for a possible counter-attack. On lower ranks, you can easily score free kickoff goals. It really pays off sometimes, but it is always a bit of a risk.

2. Watch where your teammate is. Don't be scared to let your teammate do his thing. Don't necesarilly try to help him all the time. Don't go help him in the corner. It's a death sentence. Don't do aerials everytime he passes the ball. Don't go forward until you see he is rotating. Stay close to him all the time, but be ready to save the goal. It really pays off.

3. Don't clear the ball to the area in front of your own net. Always to the sides. When you defend, try to get as much boost as possible to a possible counterattack. Use boostpads, they're underrated. 

4. Be aware of how much boost your teammate has. And the opponents too. It's pointless when you have 100 and pass your teammate who has 12 because of you. 

5. Don't hesitate. I can see this all the time when my friends play. Think about it, you can't win by doing nothing. You can't win by hesitating. The guy who hesitates always loses. I would say it's better to ball chase in this case. Never hesitate to go for something. Just go. IMMEDIATELY.

6. Just be patient. This is the most important step. Start pressuring your opponent as much as you can. Don't try to score if you can clearly see the ball can't go inside. Just wait. There will be a better chance to score few seconds later. They will eventually do a mistake. IT WORKS!!!

7. Improve your boost management. Boost is a fundamental thing in this game. If you use it at right time, and you're not overusing it, you become more dangerous for the opponent. 

8. Leading 2:0? Why would you attack? If you really go for the win, just play smart. Don't lose your lead. Time is your friend.

9. Don't blame anyone else. Don't be toxic. I know, sometimes it can be hard. But it is necessary if you want to rank up. Rocket League is a psychological game. If your teammate screws up, encourage him to keep playing. It's all ok. We can win this. No problem mate. It's just one game. No WOW, No OKAY, No FF, No toxic shit what so ever. You are hurting his rank and yours too by doing this. 

10. Don't be a pussy. 0:2 and 4:20 left? Forfeiting? Why? You are literally giving your rank away for FREE. You are letting the other guys winning the match for nothing. Just because you are lazy to come back from 0:2 to 3:2? The win feels so much better then. I was losing 0:5 yesterday and won 6:5 in OT. That feeling!!!

11. Don't panic. Have you ever seen the GC videos on Youtube? They keep calm most of the time. That's what got them to the higher ranks. They know when to shoot, they know if their position is good for a shot, they know how the opponent will most likely react. You don't need to master this if you're gold, platinum, diamond or whatever. You just need to realize this. Don't be scared of the opponent just because he drives towards you. Don't panic, just chill and think how to get the ball behind him. It helped me a lot. 

12. Use the walls to pass. The walls are not just for the fancy air dribbles. I started using walls to pass myself/teammate and confuse the opponent.  You just need to learn the right angles and it works like a charm. I love it. 

13. If you keep losing, just quit the game. Don't push it. Quit the game, go play CS:GO or whatever, go outside, go get a shower. You can play later. 

14. Don't overcommit. You hit the backboard and basically give a free goal to the other guys. It is the most common way to concede. Sometimes it happens, you can't really get rid of this, but you can minimize it. 

15. Don't follow the scoreboard. It can be a HUGE lie. Just because you have 400 points and your teammates has 80 points doesn't really mean he wasn't useful. Imagine you scoring an aerial but if you missed, he is the guy who covers your back on the ground. He gets no points for your goal tho. He might start a play which ends up with you scoring, but he gets no assist. The points don't matter. At all. Don't read the scoreboard. Easiest way to get toxic.

16. Don't play all day long. I'm not sure if this works for you too, but I have noticed my brain does not work that well when I wake up and play. I usually lose many games in the mornings. However, 12 hours later, I dominate.

17. Watch the pro's. Try to copy/imitate what they did. I don't mean the fancy air dribbling, I mean their rotation. Their offense/defense. I think it helped me a lot. 

18. Demolitions. They are there for a reason. Don't get angry when you get demoed. Don't go for a demo if you don't keep track of the ball location. You can easily miss the demo and get scored on. It can be a very useful tool in this game when you master it, but don't rely on it. It's not what will take you to a higher rank. 

19. Don't try to master some JHZER-like freestyle nonsense. If you want to rank up, you don't need this. Freestyle is great if you just want to enjoy the game in casual, but this post is for those who are trying to rank up. DO. NOT. FREESTYLE. Unless you're JHZER. 

20. Sometimes you attack so much you realize you missed a shot and you're in the opponents net, and your net is open wide. You have 0 boost and your opponents already have the ball in their possession. It's exactly the moment you realize you fucked up. There is no way to make it back on time. You get angry. You get super tilted. But it's all your fault. You should have not come there with not enough boost to come back. Maybe you should have not taken the shot at all. Too late. Always have enough boost to go back faster than the opponent. I obey this rule and I concede less than I used to.


UGHHH I'm exhausted. That's it. You can add your tips in the comments. This helped me so much I wanted to share it with you. Just remember, don't take the game too seriously. It's just car football.

,jmodtracker,"Whilst playing it fully depends on what I am doing but more often than not you'll find me listening to a Alan Watts chillstep mix; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-tPRhFmSqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-tPRhFmSqY)

Here is a little twist as I can approach from the angle of RS development, obviously we don't sit and listen to RS music all day whilst developing...

When i'm working on or writing a project with a narrative I tend to listen to something that will help me put my head into that character, for example when I was creating and writing Merethiel I'd listen to music I felt matched her theme and backstory but also faster paced so I could get into a good rhythm of writing and storytelling. Here is an example [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5g3gixP1bM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5g3gixP1bM)

For Solak development it was more a mix of themes I felt webbed well together for the project as an overall, so there would be songs that fit Solak, Merethiel, the grove environment and story's main emotional arcs. I put together a playlist with all the songs and sent it around to everyone working on the project so they could really get a feeling of what kind of a story I wanted to come through in not only the writing, but the art.

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/c8K3bLa) is a little shot of that playlist:

I did the same sort of thing whilst doing Nex dev, but I found myself listening to people doing voice acting for certain characters. Voice acting is SUPER interesting to listen to as the actors are able to transform themselves into a whole new character with a range of depth and emotions.

Voice acting is easily one of the best tools for helping tell a story without pushing the player to read a whole load of text as it's able to get them emotionally invested in what is going on simply by using their ears.

Day three since MC joined the music club at school, Sayori dragged him in at first but he seemed to be liking it so far. At first he thought it was kinda strange, a buncha people analyzing music like wine tasters analyze flavors in fine wine, but eventually he got accustomed to it and did the same, himself!

Sayori was walking with MC in the hall to the club room, which was held in the band hall, together and MC wasn’t nearly as talkative as Sayori was today.

S: “-so that’s what makes a song catchy!”

MC: “Sorry, I was daydreaming for part of your lecture…”

S: “D’aww! Wasting my breath here, MC!”

MC: “Well I think it’s best suited to discuss with the club, anyways.”

S: “That’s true… But I still don’t like it when you don’t listen!”

MC: “Come on, let it go Sayori! Sometimes I can’t help daydreaming…”

S: *sigh* “Alright…”

MC: “Because I’d like to hear how songs are catchy, how it works with the brain and stuff, but maybe the others would like to hear too!”

Sayori looked sad.

S: “...”

MC: “Everything alright?

S: “Oh, yeah, yeah! Don’t worry about me, I’m just fine! Worry about yourself, I’m ok, ehehe!”

MC: “... Whatever you say.”

MC held the door for Sayori and headed in behind her.

MC: “Oh, looks like we’re the last ones in!”

Monika: “Oh hey guys, welcome back!”

Natsuki: “‘sup?”

Yuri: “Oh, hi there.”

Mo: “We were just discussing song writers in movies, video games, and TV shows and where they come from!”

N: “Yeah I was about to say, the creator of the hit indie game Undertale composed music for other things before he made the game?”

S: “You mean like *Sand Undertale???* Bahahaha!”

N: “Hey shut up!”

Y: “Your sense of humor is so strange…”

S: “I love the memes!!”

Yuri looked perplexed in response, memes weren’t really her ‘cup of tea’ per se.

MC made a silly face and replied: “*Sand and also Paper from Unnertall!*”

S: “See? He likes them too!”

Y: “Mmh… Ok…”

MC: “So what are we doing today?”

Mo: “Well let’s see, first we’re going to share songs, and I wanna play something on the piano for you, then it’s pretty much a blur after that, but I suppose we can make conversation.”

S: “Ooh! Remind me later, I want to tell you some music science I learned recently.”

MC: “She was telling me some about it earlier in the hall, it sounds pretty interesting.”

Y: “I’ve… Also looked into music science before, it’s quite a captivating topic I have to say.”

N: “Are we going to share our songs soon?”

Mo: “Ah, right! Everybody, have you guys found a song online you would like to share?”

S: “Oh, totally!

MC: “Yeah…”

N: “Sure thing!”

Y: “M-hm.”

Mo: “Great! Would anybody like to go first?”

S: “I ca-“

Natsuki’s hand shot up as she shouted, “Ooh, me! Me!”

Mo: “Well then! Looks like you’re pretty eager to share, just connect your phone to the speaker over here and play it through!”

S: “Buh-“

N: “This looks like a new speaker… What is it?”

Mo: “It’s a Sony SRS-HG1, I got it because it can cover the full human hearing range and also plays HiFi audio.”

N: “Well that’s not gonna do much good, my song is from the LoFi genre!”

Y: “You have quite the affinity for LoFi/ Hip Hop…”

N: “My favorite genre~ Anyways, this one’s called, [“her” by eery.](https://youtu.be/ipXVck-QW1c)”

The song started to play and as it got to the main melody, Natsuki started to tap her foot a little, she was getting into the groove.

N: “I guess- I guess when I listen to this, it reminds me of my last boyfriend, and maybe my longing to be in a relationship again. It’s wonderful, it almost feels like it was written for me, but I can dream. So comforting...”

Monika lightly snapped her fingers along with the beat.

Everyone was silent until the song ended.

Mo: “That was a nice song, what did you all think?”

Y: “The mixture of staccato beats and soothing piano creates a very unique sound, somewhat exciting and calming at the same time.”

S: “I recognize that song… Oh right! Someone [made a meme](https://youtu.be/MxO3i69N_60) out of it!”

N: ”Of course someone did…”

MC: “I never expected that much bass from a LoFi song… Me likey.”

N: “Glad you guys liked it!

Mo: “Awesome! Would anybody else like to go next?”

Sayori’s face brightened and she gleefully exclaimed, “I’ll go!”

Mo: “Ok, it’s Sayori’s turn!”

S: “It has a funny name but I assure you, the song isn’t funny! It’s about taking a break from work every once in a while and being with your friends to have fun.”

N: “Ah, carefree Sayori. How do you do it, girl?”

Mo: “So I surmise you like uplifting songs? You’re always listening to pretty happy music!”

S: “Oh definitely, I listen to it mostly because I don’t like sad songs. I’m fine with any genre as long as it sounds happy!”

Mo: “Right! That reminds me, everyone, I was going to ask, what is your favorite genre? Mine has to be classic rock or alternative.”

Y: “I tend to stay in and around orchestra music and piano music, but I pretty much feel happy with whatever’s playing, I have never come across a genre that I don’t like.”

N: “I already said my favorite is Lo-Fi/Hip Hop so…”

MC: “The name sounds edgy but I swear it’s not bad, my favorite is probably deathstep, followed up closely by hardstyle and drum n’ bass. I also listen to blues from time to time…”

Mo: “So, Sayori… What’s the song that you want to play called?”

S: “Badunkadunk!”

N: “pffFF BAHAHAHA!”

Sayori looked confused and asked, “What!?”

N: **snort** “THAT’S- that’s just a really funny word!”

MC was also laughing, over at his desk.

S: “Hmpf! Anyways, it’s hard to say what genre it is, it’s kinda obscure! I’d say it’s some cross between pop and disco maybe?”

Sayori seemed to be having difficulty with the speaker, but Natsuki had finally calmed down a little.

S: “How do I-“

Mo: “You gotta…”

Monika awkwardly motioned to the Bluetooth pairing button, and Sayori followed suit. 

S: “Ah there we go! Thanks! Anyways, here’s [Badunkadunk by BLV.](https://youtu.be/Tvz-eD2EXnw)”

Sayori started playing the song over the speaker and grinned. The club members looked back and forth at each other, trying to listen and enjoy the music. Meanwhile, Sayori was wiggling around in her seat, dancing to the music.

Partway through, Natsuki piped up. “Are- are you sure this song is about taking breaks from work?”

S: “Well… I thought so?”

Monika looked a little uncomfortable, MC was blushing and hiding his face, and Yuri looked like she was daydreaming. She might not have been but it sure looked like it.

The song finished, so Sayori got up and asked eagerly, “What did you guys think? Did you like it? I liked it a lot!”

Both Natsuki and Monika couldn’t hold back a snicker.

Mo: “I gotta agree with Natsuki, that DEFINITELY wasn’t about what you thought it was, Sayori.”

S: “Whaaaaaaaaa?”

N: “I think- I think you’re half right, it was about being off work with a friend, but specifically to get freaky!”

Sayori looked taken back. “No way! Why do you think that?”

N: “Especially that one line, “that badunkadunk need some fire”, you know what they mean by fire, right?”

S: “Yeah, it means the so called ‘burn’ you feel when exercising, right?”

N: “Heck no! It means she wants to get some action!”

Y: “Sayori you innocent little girl…”

“Innocent? I’ll have you know, I saw a dirty scene in a TV show recently and I didn’t change the channel this time, I just covered my eyes!” Sayori joked. All the club members burst into laughter at the joke, she was known for ironic humor sometimes.

Mo: “Aha! But seriously, you didn’t figure it out?”

S: “Weeeelllllll… I did just discover it a few days ago so I haven’t had much time to think about the lyrics…”

Mo: “Well thank you anyways for bringing it to class, it sounds like a nice exercise song.”

S: “What a coincidence! She’s exercising in the video, too!”

Mo: “Oh no way!”

S: “Yes way, look it up when you get home!”

Mo: “I’ll keep a mental note of that!”

MC: “It was pretty good. A pop song but not the annoying, squeaky voice of a pubescent boy.”

Y: “Oh, nonono you’re thinking of K-Pop, not American pop.”

MC: “This song is from America?”

Y: “I assumed so, as it’s written in English, and her accent suggests so.”

MC: “Well… Makes sense.”

Mo: “Who wants to share theirs now?”

Y: “I- I suppose I’ll go…”

Mo: “Awesome! Whaddaya got today?”

Y: “It’s a classical piece over from the United States, made in the 1920’s. [Rhapsody In Blue by Gershwin](https://youtu.be/ynEOo28lsbc) is a beautiful fusion of jazz and orchestra, he composed a famous song that’s been heard far and wide, capturing the ears of millions and being used in numerous settings. It not only appeals to my ears but as I listen, it resounds within my soul and-”

Natsuki finally had enough, and with a slight laugh in her voice, told her, “Just play the song, Yuri!”

Y: “Ahehe sorryIgotcarriedawayagain…”

Yuri connected her phone to the bluetooth speaker and commented, “It’s kind of long, but I hope you enjoy it anyways…”

S: “Ah, don’t worry! The longer a song is, the more time you have to enjoy it!”

Y: “R-right…”

Yuri started to play the song and once it was playing, she seemed more relaxed rather than nervous as she looked around at everyone and noticed their calm expressions.

A little of the way in, MC piped up, “Ohhhh I recognize this song now!”

Y: “Y-you do?”

MC: “Yepperoo, a while back I tried to learn this song on the piano, but it was a little too much for my little fingers to handle.”

Y: “Oh, that’s adorable!”

MC: “That was only three years ago, Yuri…”

Yuri started to blush profusely. “W-well why’d you say it was a while back!?”

MC: “Isn’t three years a long time?”

Yuri simply hid behind her hair as a response.

Monika gave Yuri a reassuring hug to calm her down a little.

MC: “Aww so sweet-“

The song continued, and as it did, the club members gave their full attention to the song, it really was a beautiful one. Whimsical notes floated throughout the room, creating very powerful feelings within each one of them.

N: “It’s so… so pretty…”

Y: “Mom used to play the piano part with me…”

As the song ended, everybody stretched as if they just saw a really long movie.

Mo: “So? What did you guys think?”

MC: “I loved it… Especially that one piano solo about halfway in.”

N: “It was really beautiful, I felt tears trying to push their ways past at some parts, but I’m a strong girl! Strong girls don’t cry!”

Mo: “Ahaha! It’s ok to be moved by a song, we won’t criticize.”

N: “Yeah but, at home… Well... nevermind.”

Sayori spoke up, in an expression that could only be described as a mixture of shock and bewilderment, “That… Evoked some emotions I haven’t felt in a long time.”

Mo: “Good ones or bad ones?”

S: “I’m… I’m not sure…”

Mo: “Classical music really is something, isn’t it?”

S: “Yeah…”

Mo: “It was an amazing song, I’d love to hear it in concert some time!”

Y: “Th-thank you everyone, I wasn’t sure if you’d like it since it’s so long…”

Mo: “Well just remember what Sayori said, the longer the better!”

S: “Right. The longer the better!”

Mo: “Hey MC? Do you think I could go last?”

MC: “Share your music last? Uhh sure… You’re the President after all, you make the choices.”

Mo: “Awesome! So, it’s your turn, then, MC!”

MC: “O-oh, give me a second to find it.”

MC searched through his music playlist on phone. It was taking a while to find the song, so it was obvious he hadn’t picked one out yet.

MC: “Ah! Here it is. It’s called, [“Machine’s Revenge” by SKUM and PFISTA.](https://youtu.be/bqq09SKm-bw)”

MC started up the song. Natsuki didn’t look too amused.

Mo: “Ooh, very ominous, I like the choir…”

MC: “Just wait it gets better.”

As the beat dropped for the first time, Natsuki’s expression went from unamused to straight out disgust. “Oh godamnit I knew it was gonna be another dubstep song!”

Y: “Shh…”

N: “Hmpf!”

As the song played through, Monika and Sayori had a somewhat confused face, Natsuki was fuming, Yuri had her eyes closed and was tapping her foot, and MC had an expression that showed the epitome of awkwardness.

As the song ended, Monika immediately jumped in to end the awkward silence. “Alright everyone! So, what did you think of MC’s song?”

S: “Well, the dark tones really didn’t agree with me, but it was somewhat exciting! The beginning sounded disorganized but got more organized later. It kind of made me feel like I was in a mech suit or something?”

N: “^(Terrible taste in music…)”

Mo: “What did you say, Natsuki?”

N: “I said! … nothing…”

Mo: “Remember what I said about taste in music?”

Natsuki groaned and repeated in an annoyed tone, “There is no such thing as a bad taste in music, you just don’t agree with theirs.”

Mo: “Great! It’s all subjective. Now, I guess that means you didn’t like it…”

N: “Well what am I supposed to say!? The harsh metal clanking and erratic saw sounds are a delightful treat to my ears!? I don’t think so, it’s trash!” Natsuki snapped.

Mo: “Ok moving on!”

Y: “I… I very much enjoyed the song and would listen to it again… The calm lead up to the beat drop sets up a sense of alertness that catches you off guard, plus the machinery noises throughout add to the intense vibe over the song, I could feel my heart rate increase. It would go well for a score of a science-fiction or horror film.”

Mo: “Well… I’d like to say something nice about it but really, the lack of melody during the song just sorta confused me. It was all percussive sounds, and some of the parts didn’t even follow the 4 repetition pattern. Sorry, MC.”

MC: “N-no need to apologize, if anybody here needs to apologize, it’s me, for picking out a song you guys might not have agreed with.”

Mo: “Hey, well as they say, you live you learn. There’s little to no initial way to know how people are going to react to something like that. Remember, it was only today that we shared our favorite genres!”

MC: “Thanks, Monika.”

Mo: “Any time! I’m here to help keep the club running smoothly!”

MC blushed a little at her being so nice.

Mo: “Ok is that all you guys have to say?”

All of the club members answered with skeptical variations of “yes”.

Mo: “Awesome! I saved the best for last- I mean- forget I said that!” Monika looked really embarrassed after she had made the remark.

N: “Well, continue!”

Mo: “Right! Uhh, this is a classic… And it’s really fun to dance to! It’s been played by numerous bands before, but I’ll play the cover by Electric Light Orchestra. It’s called, [“Roll Over Beethoven”!](https://youtu.be/CxXl4oS9wss) 

Monika started playing the song. As it got to the violins, Yuri immediately perked up.

Y: “Is… Is this a cover of Beethoven’s 5th symphony?”

Mo: “I guess you could say that! Just wait until they get to the guitar~”

Y: “The guitar??”

Right around that time is when the song turned from classical to rock and roll. It caught everybody by surprise and sent a shiver down their spine, a good shiver - like when you get really excited about something.

MC: “Ohhh that song! I’ve been looking for it for so long! I heard it in a shop a while back but never found out the name!”

Yuri suddenly got a grin as she listened to the song. She started tapping her foot to the beat, and as soon as that happened, Natsuki got up and started dancing! Then Monika! Yuri followed suit after.

MC: “Ah this is a really nice song, look at how happy they are…” MC said to Sayori.

S: “Yeah! Wanna get up and dance?”

MC: “T-together?”

S: “Come on, it’ll be fun!”

Sayori abruptly took MC’s hand and spun him like a ballerina.

MC: “gAH! Oh wow, Sayori!”

They danced together to the song, everyone was really getting into the groove. Apparently Yuri was getting a little *too* into the groove, as she abruptly approached Monika and swung her into a dip dance move, then back up!

Mo: “Whoah, Yuri! Slow down! You’re gonna fluster me if you do that…”

Y: “Ahehe, come on, they’re dancing together, dance with me!”

Monika, not questioning the sudden lack of shyness, let Yuri take her by the hand, and they danced together for most of the remainder of the song. As for Natsuki, she was just enjoying the music herself, she wasn’t even disappointed she didn’t have a dance partner because the music was too good!

Later, the song ended and everybody seemed out of breath, overall leaving them in a good mood.

N: “Ahe… Phew, that was a fun song!”

MC: “Sayori this is the first time I’ve danced with you since that party back in the fourth grade!”

S: “Well, you’re… a really good dance partner…” Sayori blushed a little.

Y: “That has to be one of my new favorite songs, I anticipated Beethoven’s 5th symphony and instead I got a high energy song that made me get up and dance like an absolute buffoon, and I loved it!”

Mo: “You… You really caught me off guard when you swung me around but, that was fun! Thanks for dancing with me!”

Yuri then madly blushed and played with a strand of hair, chuckling.

Mo: “Ah thank you everybody! It’s so fun getting to share songs with you all!”

S: “Yeah I love discovering new music~”

Y: “Agreed…”

MC: “Yup!”

N: “It’s a nice break from the rest of life, cause life can be painful sometimes, but if you just let the music take you away, like you’re surrendering to the sound, it’s like some sort of miracle medicine to all your woes.”

MC: “When you look at it that way, yeah…”

S: “That’s why I put my headphones in on buses. The crowded, loud buses make me a little anxious but the music soothes me.”

Mo: “Oh! What type of headphones do you have?”

S: “They’re not much, I got them more for style than listening since I have a good speaker system at home…”

Mo: “Are you not comfortable with showing them to us?”

S: “Nah! No. I dunno, I just felt I’d be criticized if I showed them to you. Especially after Natsuki’s response to MC’s song choice.”

N: “D’aww don’t keep them away just because of me! I want to see, too!”

S: “Well alrighty then…” Sayori looked a little nervous but dug in her small purse and found them. “Ah here they are!”

N: “Style? It’s just blue…”

S: “Hold on, hold on! Let me plug it into my phone and play some music.”

Y: “Oh! Is it some of those novelty light up headphones?”

S: “You guessed it!”

Y: “What brand?”

S: “Theeese… I think… Oh right! They’re by [Lightingcool.](https://www.amazon.com/Lightingcool-Visible-Earphone-Headphones-Flashing/dp/B071LGPVV9/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1532142586&amp;sr=8-6)”

Mo: “Shouldn’t those two words be separate? You didn’t put a space in between them”

S: “Well it’s the name of the company so it doesn’t have to follow gramma- Hey! What are you talking about with spaces and all?”

Mo: “N-nothing! Nothing…”

Sayori was confused as to why Monika said that, and why she suddenly looked so nervous.

S: “Eh, whatever. Here, I found a song!”

As Sayori started to play her song, all the club members looked on in awe, as the headphone wires glowed and pulsed to the music.

N: “Ooooh pretty!”

S: “I get looks everywhere I go, especially in the dark!”

MC: “I hate to break it to you, but some of those looks are bad looks, your headphones kind of distract people when we’re in public.”

S: “Oh, stop being so cynical! They’re just jealous is all!”

Mo: “I wonder how much power it takes to light the wires up, wouldn’t that decrease the volume by quite a bit?”

S: “Not that I can tell, The light part is powered by a battery.”

Mo: “Oh! well that’s handy I guess.”

Y: “I can see the appeal, the flashy design of the headphones parallels your bright personality. Very pleasant.”

S: “Aww shucks, thanks Yuri!”

Yuri smiled a little after the nice comment.

Y: “I was able to customize my headphones to have my own color choice online…”

S: “Ooh, fancy! What’s your color scheme?”

Y: “A pleasing glossy black, with purple highlights. Purple is my favorite color… Well, more orchid on a color palette. [Would you like to see?](https://s.bose.com/YKsDgyr)”

S: “Sure!”

Yuri looked in her book bag and quickly found her headphones. She handled them delicately, as they were very expensive headphones.

S: “Whoah.”

Mo: “Ah so that’s the Bose Quietcomfort model?”

Y: “Wow you really know your headphones well! Yes, these are the Bose Quietcomfort 35 wireless headphones.”

Mo: “Ahaha! I do my research~”

N: “Yeah but how expensive? They look pretty high class.”

Y: “Uhh… A little over ¥50,000?”

N: “Holy cow that’s expensive!”

Y: “Y-yeah it is… Especially because the customizable version is much more money than the standard version.”

Mo: “Amazing, that doesn’t even touch the price of my headphones, and they’re built for HiFi!”

N: “All about the HiFi for you, isn’t it?”

Mo: “Oh definitely, I guess I just appreciate the subtle tones of each instrument, it’s so satisfying when it sounds like the band is in the room with you!”

N: “I guess I can see that.”

MC: “So… What are your headphones?”

Mo: “Oh! They’re also by Sony, they’re the [MDR-1AM2](https://www.sony.com/electronics/headband-headphones/mdr-1am2) model.”

MC: “Whoah, those look beast. What’s the price tag?”

Mo: “Around ¥33,400.”

N: “Still, that’s expensive, too!”

Mo: “Totally worth it, no regrets! At least it’s not as expensive as their [MDR-Z1R](https://www.sony.com/electronics/headband-headphones/mdr-z1r) model, those headphones are ¥255,270!”

N: “Holy shit why would anybody pay that much for headphones!?” Natsuki said, laughing a little.

Mo: “I think, I think it’s partly because of their special plug that they use, it’s 4.4 millimeters wide instead of 3.5. All of it’s been engineered to sound amazing and whatnot…”

MC: “That’s way too much, even for a set of headphones. I want to know what the markup is!”

Mo: “No wait, it gets better! They also have a ¥355,120 music player literally plated with gold!”

Y: “Preposterous!”

Mo: “Actually no it’s not too preposterous, it has something to do with decreasing static noise or acoustics or something. They also have a plug for the 4.4 millimeter thing I mentioned a second ago.”

MC: “I’ve heard of gold being used on Astronaut helmets to prevent damage from sun rays but on a little music player? Wow.”

Y: “Why would anyone need something that high quality for such a small difference? Does somebody want to take the studio with them?”

Mo: “I dunno, it can only play up to 24 bit songs, not even studio quality!”

N: “Still, my headphones are nothing compared to yours price wise, here let me get them out…”

S: “D’aww, [cat ear headphones!](https://www.brookstone.com/pd/wireless-cat-earbuds-with-removable-ears/323530p.html?rrec=true) Too cute!”

N: “Well, cute wasn’t really what I was aiming for, but I guess so.”

S: “It just adds to the fact that you’re a little cutie patootie!”

N: “I’m not cute!!!”

MC: “Just take the compliment, silly!”

N: “Hmpf!”

Mo: “You said yours are nothing compared to mine, how expensive were they?”

N: “About ¥3,900.”

Mo: “That’s a good deal for something so compact and trendy looking.”

N: “Right? I just *had* to get them!”

MC: “Heh heh, this all makes me kind of embarrassed because I only spent ¥2,200 on headphones…”

Mo: “Well the sound is really what headphones are all about, how is the sound on yours?”

MC: “Mainly I got them because I like heavy bass, these ones had good reviews, plus they were cheap. The frequency response goes all the way down to just 5 hertz!”

Mo: “Holy sh- cow! That’s below what elephants can hear!”

MC: “Yeah it’s got this thing on the back called a “bass port” to allow for less interference in the bass lines.”

Mo: “What’s the model?”

MC: “It’s JBL’s [HA-FX1X](https://www.amazon.com/JVC-HAFX1X-Headphone-Xtreme-Xplosivs/dp/B004S7Q8CA), from their line of Xtreme Xplosives headphones.”

Y: “The design of your headphones also look very nice, the red paired with black and tubular shape creates a very rugged, aggressive look for such small headphones.”

MC: “Actually you bring up a good point! Check this out, it’s got its own little carrying case.”

Y: “Oh, that’s handy!”

MC: “It’s proved fairly sturdy, I’ve sat on it a few times and it still stayed in shape!”

Y: “A very nice feature to protect your headphones.”

MC: “Yeah definitely. I love the bass these headphones can put out, I can hear all the lowest lows and I can practically feel my eardrums tremoring, it’s great.”

Mo: “You probably shouldn’t have it up that loud, you need to have healthy ears in order to enjoy life well, and not have bad repercussions from hearing damage!”

MC: “What did you say? Speak louder please…” MC joked. It made everyone laugh again.

S: “Hah! That reminds me, I wanted to tell you all about the science of why a song is catchy!”

Mo: “Ooh, do tell! I’m curious!”

Y: “Well… I’ve noticed patterns that catchy songs tend to have a fast tempo, take Pharrell Williams’ “Happy”, it has an upbeat tempo with clapping as part of the percussion.”

S: “You’re right Yuri, that’s part of it! Songs around 120 to 160 beats per minute or increments of that are usually catchy songs, because it’s the heartrate most people exercise at! It’s all about the excitement! The main thing, surprisingly, is repetition and rhyming.”

N: “Really? I would have never guessed parroting things over and over again would make a song catchy…”

S: “Well, too much repetition can become annoying, but if you vary it up just a little, like rhyme things, you can create a song that you can listen to over and over again!”

N: “Strange, that doesn’t make much sense to me.”

S: “Imagine Taylor Swift’s “shake it off” for example, she repeats rhyming words multiple times in the chorus like “play, hate, shake, and fake”.”

N: “Why does that appeal to the brain though?”

S: “Because the brain likes to learn! If you hear something over and over again, it’s easier to remember!”

N: “Weeeeird…”

Y: “Psychology is a very interesting subject like that, I wanted to take that as a class next year at the nearby community college, but sadly all the spots are taken. That’s why I read psychology related books sometimes, or even learn by simple Google searches.”

S: “That’s the spirit! Why pay money to learn about something when you can just use Google?”

Mo: “Society doesn’t think that way, sadly.”

S: “Hnnnnn but why does everything have to be so hard!?”

Y: “Well, last time I checked you don’t need a college degree to be an expert ukulele guitarist, do you, Sayori?”

S: “Pff you’re too kind! I’m no expert…”

Y: “Your calm rhythm and proficiency when playing it almost lulled me off to sleep when you played for us last club meeting, I didn’t hear any slip ups whatsoever, you’re definitely an expert.”

MC:  “Yeah I have to agree, whenever you played at my house when we went on playdates as kids, I felt relaxed and at ease, and that was when you were just a kid!”

Sayori blushed a little. “Ohh thank you thank you thank you! It means a lot…”

N: “Man, you guys are making me envious! Yuri’s a professional on the violin, Sayori can play the ukulele like a native Hawaiian or something, MC and Monika can play the piano pretty decently, and then there’s me who can only move sounds around in FL Studio…”

S: “No need to FRET, Natsuki! Everyone learns at their own pace! Plus, it’s not like we expect you to play an instrument or anything.”

N: “That pun was horrible but thanks for the encouragement.”

Y: “I agree, it took me a while to get this good. Hard work and practice pays off when you can amaze someone.”

Mo: “Oh, right! I was going to play a song for you on the piano that I composed!”

MC: “There’s a little electric Yamaha piano over in the corner if you want to use that.”

N: “What’s it called?”

Mo: “I call it, “Play With Me”. I named it *after* I composed it because it sounded really happy and upbeat, like playtime!”

N: “Aww, sounds cute.”

Mo: “I haven’t played it yet! Hold on, let me get the sheet music…”

Monika walked over to the piano and turned it on. She got her phone out in order to see the sheet music she put together. “This particular app lets you use voice commands to change the page, if you don’t mind me using that feature.”

Y: “I don’t mind at all!

MC: “Me either.”

Mo: “Alright well here I go!”

Monika put her hands on the keyboard and took a deep breath before she [started to play.](https://youtu.be/Acte9V_bSxs)

As she played, the sounds of the piano floated throughout the room and made everyone feel very warm and happy. Ivory colored keys bounced and so did their hearts. Each note was a new discovery and a treat for the mind and ears. 

All of them listened intently and stayed quiet until the song ended. As she got up from the keyboard and curtsied, everyone clapped lightly.

Mo: “Oh thank you guys!”

Y: “No, thank you! That was wonderful!”

N: “Very cute song!”

MC: “It was so good I want to learn how to play it myself.”

S: “We should do a duet sometime!”

Mo: “W-with you? Well, I’d be honored!”

S: “No, I would be honored to do that with you!”

Monika squealed a little in excitement. “Eeeeeee! Then it’s settled! How does next club meeting sound?”

S: “Yeah! That would totally be fun!”

Mo: “Pick a song and I’ll play it with you~”

S: “I’ll look when I get home.”

N: “It kind of makes me sad that I wouldn’t be able to do much of a duet with someone without an instrument.”

Mo: “You can always make remixes of songs after someone makes it.”

N: “But I can’t play along with someone at the same time!”

Mo: “Hmm… You’ve got a point there…”

N: “I’m sad because after I graduate high school, I’m going to need to give back my school copy of FL Studio, my family can’t afford it.”

S: “Ohhh that’s really disappointing! I’m so sorry!”

N: “Yeah, it is… Not like I can get a job to pay for it either, my Father says he doesn’t trust strangers around me in public transportation so I can’t get back and forth to a job. He says I’m too weak to defend myself.”

MC: “But you’re 18, that doesn’t sound like protectiveness, that sounds like straight up manipulation.”

N: “Nononono it’s not like that! It’s just… Dad knows best for me.”

MC: “Are you sure?”

N: “Y-yeah…”

Mo: “Weeeellll… Would you agree to us pooling money for you to buy it? Music is a hobby of yours and I sure wouldn’t want your good ear for making tunes to go to waste.”

N: “R-really!? You would do that?”

MC: “Hold on I never agre-“

Mo: “Totally!”

N: “Oh… You guys are gonna make me misty… This club is one of the best communities I could ever ask for!”

MC: “Well you better pay it back with some good music, else I’d be disappointed for pitching in.”

S: “*Be quiet, MC, this is a happy moment!*”

MC: “*Sorry…*”

Mo: “I’m looking forward to graduation, myself, the whole wide world is opening a new list of opportunities to go out on my own!”

S: “I’m scared of graduating!”

Mo: “Me too, but you have to remind yourself about all the amazing stuff you’ll be able to do once you’re out.”

S: “Y-yeah, I guess so…”

Y: “I’ve been working at the local bookstore for two years now, trust me, the real world is not as bad as people make it out to be. And that’s saying something, because I get anxious around strangers.”

MC: “I once worked as a hot dog vendor at the baseball stadium. You remember that, right?”

S: “Oh yeah, you kept getting distracted by the game so many times they fired you.”

MC: “Well… That doesn’t count! My point is that I got a paid job and it wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be.”

Mo: “Just get excited about your dreams and the future will seem much less bleak! I’m hoping to find a job in the future where I can get on a team of programmers for video games.”

S: “B-but… I don’t ha… nevermind.”

Mo: “Aww, you don’t mean to tell me you don’t have any dreams, do you?”

S: “uuu… I kind of want to run a tropical resort…”

Mo: “It starts with a dream. Can you make it come true?”

S: “I don’t know…”

Mo: “You wanted to learn how to play ukulele once, didn’t you?”

S: “Well yeah but-”

Mo: “And you practically became a professional! Dreams do come true, Sayori.”

S: “Ehehe… Thanks.” Sayori said, as she fiddled with her thumbs.

Mo: “No problem! Plus, you’ve got plenty of time to figure out how to make it happen.”

S: “We should change the name to wholesome club instead of music club…”

Monika strolled over and gave Sayori a hug at that moment. They both seemed to enjoy it.

Mo: “Ah… Well it’s about time for us to leave.”

Y: “This was quite a pleasant meeting today.”

N: “Yeah, it was pretty fun!”

S: “Hehe! When I get home, I’m gonna take a nice after-school nap and have the songs I listened to today playing in my head as I fall asleep.”

MC: “You guys are a fun group. What are we going to do after we graduate?”

Mo: “Oh, Jeez… I didn’t even think about that.”

N: “Well we’re all still in that group chat together!”

Y: “Yes, before we leave, we should also exchange other contact information just to make sure we don’t lose contact. Who knows, maybe we could meet at music halls in the future.”

S: “Yeah! Or maybe do a 5 person band in the park!”

Mo: “Whoah, let’s not get ahead of ourselves! We’ve still got a lot of meetings before we graduate.”

MC: “Well that’s true, I guess I just think ahead too often sometimes.”

Mo: “Welp, I guess it’s time to go then! Thank you for attending the club today.”

Y: “I’ll make sure to bring my essential oil diffuser next time.”

S: “I’ll bring my ukulele!”

MC: “I’ll bring better tunes…”

Mo: “Hey, don’t sweat it, MC! Find what you like and we’ll listen in.”

N: “I would bring something baked but we’re kind of low on resources so that may have to hold off.”

Mo: “I can bring a box of cookies, if you’d like.”

N: “While store bought isn’t really preferred, I guess that’s fine! Thanks, Monika!”

Mo: “No, thank you for the good idea!”

N: “Hehe! Well we should be headed out, I don’t want to be late.”

Mo: “To what?”

N: “Shhhh…”

Mo: “... Well, ok! Have a great day everyone! Remember to bring a new song to share and also something fun to talk about next club meeting!”

Y: “Bye, you too~”

MC: “Hey Sayori, I'll walk home with you today.”

S: “Ok! Bye guys! Best wishes!”

MC: “Have a nice one, friends.”

N: “Keep it real!”

And with that, the club members left happy about their day. 

Music club felt like something special to them- not just a place to get together but also a tiny community of sorts, and they hoped to expand it at the festival in the near future, where they’d bring their instruments to play. Music unites us all, it unites nations and brings happiness and a sort of special poetry to all of us, so it would be likely to gain members soon.

**Author’s note: Thanks so much for reading, everyone! I’m probably not the first one to come up with a music club fanfiction, but it all started out as headcanons for what the Doki’s favorite genres were, then it finally morphed into a full-fledged story plot. I’ve been writing and procrastinating and writing and procrastinating over and over again on this fanfiction, so I’m finally glad to have it done.**

**Even though I said the contrary in the beginning author’s note, to be honest, over the duration of writing this, I kind of started to lose interest in DDLC as a whole, so that may have been one of the stopping forces on it, as well as lots of other things going on, like I’m working on some fanart for DDLC that I’ve also been procrastinating on. So I hope I can finish that soon, too! I have ideas for more fanfictions, but based on the pace that I write, they probably won’t ever happen.**

,CallOfDutyBlackOps4,"Yesterday, PC players began digging into Black Ops 4 and the experience has been outstanding – thank you to everyone that has offered such constructive feedback. We’re loving how much everyone is playing and engaged in the conversation around the game! Remember, this weekend, the Beta is open, so if you’re not in – or if you haven’t invited your [Battle.net](https://battle.net/) friends to the party – now is the time to do it!

A quick housekeeping note: you’ll see another recap post floating around Reddit, which shouldn’t be confused with what’s happening here. In our updates to the PC community, we’ll make sure to identify what is being deployed for all Black Ops 4 players (global) and what is being deployed specifically for PC players (PC).

Betas are all about helping to make for the best Day 1 experience possible, and you’ve certainly done your part to do that. So, taking that feedback, it’s time for us to get to work and do ours. . . here’s what you need to know:

Saturday Updates (Global)

Here’s what you’ll see added to the game today:

- Added Hacienda to all playlists
- Increased level cap to 40
- Activated 2XP and 2Weapon XP

General Fixes (PC)

- General stability and error messages in Settings and Heist menus.
- Performance and usability of the Settings menu has been improved.
- Fixed issue when removing a friend on the scoreboard.

As we move forward, we will be integrating all the relevant fixes to the console version (see the PS4/XB1 release notes/Appendix for more information).

Also, NVIDIA released the GeForce Hotfix Driver Version 398.98 yesterday, which resolved a stutter issue for some configurations. Download it here: [https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4694/~/geforce-hotfix-driver-version-398.98](https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4694/~/geforce-hotfix-driver-version-398.98)

There are a number of items that have landed on our radar that we’re currently tracking. If you encounter issues with any of these, please don’t hesitate to report them:

- Random Crashes: What? That never happens in game development. But when it does…we’re investigating these cases, trying to reproduce them, and find common trends. Some players were able to rectify issues on their own – most notably by disabling third-party programs running in the background, which can interfere with the game. Follow the steps here to temporarily disable these programs and eliminate them as the source of the problem: [https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/23848](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/23848)
- Stuttering Issues: Besides updating your graphics drivers, as mentioned above, you could also monitor your GPU temperature (in the Settings menu, you can show this information in Interface – Telemetry). If it rises above ~85°, your GPU may try to protect itself from overheating by throttling. You should try to do a few things then, such as cap the framerate (Settings Menu – Graphics – Display – Gameplay Framerate Limit), lower graphics options (ex.: post-processing), and make sure your PC is breathing properly (time to use those air cans!). As last resort, you could turn Vertical Sync on (Settings Menu – Graphics – Display).
- Weapon Balancing: We've been reading analytics data, watching streamers, monitoring the Black Ops 4 subreddit and we are planning to adjust the sniper guns on PC later today. Our weapon data will start to diverge from the console data, as we start balancing the experience. Additionally, the melee attack is also a hot topic we're closely monitoring. We have read reports that it's hard to earn kills with it. We will be taking a good look at this today.

And here are some friendly tips for the PC version:

- There are menus shortcuts! For example, you can quickly access the Settings menu by pressing F3 (it can be rebound in Keybinds - Interface).
- In Create-a-Class, you can remove items using R or Middle Mouse (it can be rebound in Keybinds - Interface), or using the contextual menu with right-click, then remove.
- The ADS Mouse Sensitivity uses a new formula which helps players build muscle memory on all guns. If this is taking you by surprise, you can revert to how it was in previous Call of Duty titles by setting ""ADS Mouse Sensitivity"" to ""Legacy"".

The teams at Treyarch and Beenox are fully dedicated to responding as quickly and actively as we can, which is why we pushed our first live update this morning. Today, everyone will get in on the action: the Beta is open and will roll through Monday at 10am/PT. If you haven’t done so already, invite your [Battle.net](https://battle.net/) friends!

As always, if you’re encountering problems, please reach out to player support on Twitter [@ATVIAssist ](https://twitter.com/atviassist)and Reddit [u/ATVIAssist](https://www.reddit.com/u/ATVIAssist).

Thank you for your feedback and continue to enjoy the Beta – we’re looking forward to playing with you throughout the weekend!

APPENDIX:

The following changes will be deployed across all platforms today:

Movement:

- Jump - As we mentioned in our Day 3 Beta Update, we made some modifications to jump mechanics to reduce bunny hopping. After reviewing those changes yesterday and taking into consideration the feedback from the community, we’ve relaxed some of that tuning by increasing the default jump height back to where it was last weekend. We are still scaling down jump height with each subsequent jump to prevent repeated jumping during combat, but that initial jump is now 5 units higher again. This should help with some of those more difficult mantles.
- Slide – Alongside our updates to jump, we also made some slight reductions to slide speeds and distances for Weekend 2. Now that we’ve had a chance to play with those changes internally and out in the wild with you all, along with evaluating feedback, we’re slightly increasing the default slide speed and distance. Our goal is to strike a nice balance between Weekend 1 and the current tuning. We intend slide to be used as a way to get to cover and perhaps surprise an enemy around a corner. This is a delicate balancing act between achieving those intentions while ensuring slide is not used as a primary means of traversal and cannot be spammed repeatedly during combat. If you really want to get your slide game on, check out the Dexterity Perk which will increase your speed and distance while sliding!

Weapons:

- GKS
    - Extended the damage range to compete better at mid-range.

- ABR 223
    - Increased 2nd shot recoil to make it harder to hit the 3rd shot in the burst at longer distances.

Specialists:

- Recon
    - Reduced sensor dart duration.

- Torque
    - Reduced razor wire cooldown.

Scorestreaks:

- Mantis
    - Health buffed.

Game Modes:

- Heist
    - Removed irrelevant items from the Hellion Salvo’s upgrade path.",t2_1ejv84ne,,,0,,Beta – Week 2: Day 1 Recap - PC,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Official Content'}]",r/CallOfDutyBlackOps4,False,,ren,,,,False,,False,dark,,,public,,,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},Official Content,False,1,,,,self,False,xxshg,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Treyarch INTEL for r/callofdutyblackops4'}]",,,True,,,richtext,,,,richtext,self.CallOfDutyBlackOps4,,,,,,,False,True,True,False,False,,,False,,True,False,False,Treyarch INTEL for r/callofdutyblackops4,,,,,,t5_37z9z,,,,,96l4dm,,,TreyarchPC_,,3,True,,False,,,dark,/r/CallOfDutyBlackOps4/comments/96l4dm/beta_week_2_day_1_recap_pc/,,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDutyBlackOps4/comments/96l4dm/beta_week_2_day_1_recap_pc/,1561,1534032517.0,0,,False,,self,,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '8jruQSFlNW-73QcSPbvq7S6hFXy26m43fUkKxhsILfA', 'resolutions': [{'height': 56, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/jqy2ekVMvA5pe6H2sR4vivTRhoMUk8_R1rETFP7A4DE.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=8df771383ce97fd6c8ad6b11f6c4a4d1', 'width': 108}, {'height': 113, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/jqy2ekVMvA5pe6H2sR4vivTRhoMUk8_R1rETFP7A4DE.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=0ed6a7ca28e414870cc0e4f674eb7382', 'width': 216}, {'height': 167, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/jqy2ekVMvA5pe6H2sR4vivTRhoMUk8_R1rETFP7A4DE.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=0c65cb586e4db72c7ecaeb86a4f1743b', 'width': 320}, {'height': 334, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/jqy2ekVMvA5pe6H2sR4vivTRhoMUk8_R1rETFP7A4DE.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=e0f609b6748f17218ed6255664677249', 'width': 640}, {'height': 502, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/jqy2ekVMvA5pe6H2sR4vivTRhoMUk8_R1rETFP7A4DE.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=00c67623a15574dedabc97fbb9da37f4', 'width': 960}, {'height': 565, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/jqy2ekVMvA5pe6H2sR4vivTRhoMUk8_R1rETFP7A4DE.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;s=b9c7b9a93640d497110d579586352420', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 628, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/jqy2ekVMvA5pe6H2sR4vivTRhoMUk8_R1rETFP7A4DE.jpg?s=0c8790451d7bdfafedea003468195cc6', 'width': 1200}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,1526766230.0,1536743265.0,,,

For now, we wanted to inform you of some hot fixes we just rolled out this morning and let you know about the Weekend Warfare playlist update for today:

MULTIPLAYER

- Pushed out a Phase 1 fix for issue where some players were not able to access their Master Prestige rewards. Players will need to idle in the first HQ menu (with vertical panels) for about 90 seconds and then navigate to the full HQ to see rewards show up. We will monitor and assess whether or not a Phase 2 fix is needed. Thank you for your patience! 
- Fixed Cavalry Division exploit (Free Rifleman and no shield, but still with Fast Capture and Cavalry Assists) 
- Fixed UI issue with weapon acquisition description 

Today's Weekend Warfare playlist update includes: 2XP on Prop Hunt and 2XP (still on) for Nazi Zombies. Live until 10AM PDT on Monday, August 13.

,destiny2,"Heroic Strikes are gone, again.

In their place are Strikes rated at power levels of 200, 300, 400 and 500. These will also include some form of modifiers as well. Once you reach 40 levels above  any tier that list is no longer playable. For example once you hit 440 the 400 list can no longer be played. The one exception is the 500 list which will always be playable up to max power level.

So two concerns.

1. Say I hit power level 440, now I can only play from the 500 list. What will the difficulty scale be like trying to play that far under the recommended power level? Will I need to grind up my power through other activities prior to jumping back on the strike playlist until I get closer to 500?
2. Once I start to get close to power max what will serve as the high end Strikes? Will we have to rely solely on the modifiers to increase the difficulty and rewards? Or once we get close to 600 will we be pushed more to the Nightfall instead? Of course without matchmaking that limits some players ability to participate.

Anyway these changes are interesting to say the least.

,wow,"Hello there,

I’m Veldr from Zul’Jin – US, I study Health Sciences, and I thought you guys would like to know a few tips on how to maximize your efficiency for the upcoming levelling grind without taxing your body. I apologize in advance for the grammar mistakes, English is my second language. Let’s get started!

To put this « guide » in context, I asked around my guild how people were preparing for the expansion in terms of in-game and IRL stuff, from laundry to snacks. Most of them were opting for the « pizza and soft drinks 48 hours marathon » mentality and I’m here to share with you some (perhaps really basic) health-related knowledge. I’ll separate the guide in three sections: healthy food, exercises and real-life obligations.



**Staying Fresh: Maximizing your energy through healthy food and drinks**


Hydration plays a big role in the well-being. It is recommended for adult women to drink between 2 and 3 liters/day of water, while 2.5 to 3.7 L/day for men [1]. Water is essential for long gaming sessions as it can also reduce and prevent headache pain. It is cost effective and doesn’t require you to take any medication, so why not? [2]. That being said, I’m “eco-friendly” and suggest that you stay away from disposable water bottles. Just fill a pitcher or a few reusable bottles, throw them in the fridge and drink away once it’s cold. Make sure to fill the empty bottles whenever you get up so you never run out of cold beverage and keep the headache away.

Coffee is a double-edged sword. Effects of caffeine on the body can vary from person to person depending on various characteristics. For some, it can increase alertness, mood, focus and your capacity to remain awake. For others, it can have disagreeable symptoms such as headaches, anxiety, hypertension (high blood pressure) and difficulty to fall asleep [3]. As such, I recommend staying away from drinks that contain high concentration of caffeine, such as energy drinks, espressos and the likes. To be honest, I’ll probably have a few cups during the day of the release but switch to decaf or even stop drinking coffee once the expansion releases to mitigate the impact on my sleep schedule. Decaffeinated coffee still contains a fair amount of the compound, keep that in mind. In the end, you know yourself best and should feel free to have some coffee without feeling bad about yourself.

To finish off this segment, I’ll write a few words about food. While you may be tempted to consume high fat, high carbs junk food during the grind, you’re only pleasing your mind short-term. Foods that contain high sugar make you “crash”, increasing tiredness and reducing your energy [4], which we should avoid at all cost if we want to grind it out for extended periods of time. That being said, here is a very short list of my personal favorite snacks during any gaming session:

-	Almonds
-	Dried fruits
-	Apple slices with cheddar cubes (comfort pick)
-	Fruit smoothies without added sugar
-	Whole grain bread
-	Orange juice
-	Eggs
-	Greek yogurt with frozen fruits and chia seeds
-	Dark chocolate
-	Fish (avoid fried), personal favorite dinner for the first night

Imagination is your limit here. Prioritize vegetables and fruits as much as your budget allows you, you’ll feel their benefits instantly [5].


**Keep the shape: Breaks, Exercises and Sleep**


While it may be tempting to sprint as fast as possible to level 120 without ever getting up from your chair, I can’t state enough times the importance of taking regular breaks while playing. It not only removes the strain on your eyes, but a good stretch prevents aching. I’ll personally be taking a break every hour of play to at least get up and stretch. Then, at every level, I’ll do some sort of desk workout and push-ups. You can find great tutorials online for this, to each their own. I want to point out that posture has an effect on your energy levels and food cravings [6]. Stand up often, even if it’s for a short amount of time and focus on having good posture, it will help you stay healthy and prevent back problems.

On the topic of sleep schedule, the global release may happen late at night for some of you (I’m US East, so it’s 6 PM for me, ;) ). Specialists recommend 7 or more hours of sleep per night on a regular basis. Including serious health risks, lack of sleep can lead to impaired performance, which would affect your rate of progression through the levelling and gearing processes, which we obviously want to avoid [7]. If you have a late-night release, my non-scientific advice would be to take a short nap (15-30 minutes) before the grind.

To summarize, break your sitting frequently by standing up (flight paths are great for this) and don’t neglect your sleep. Half of the fun is the gearing marathon that begins after the sprint to level 120, you’ll be glad you’ve slept enough to keep going for a few days.


**Waiting for the Release: Organize your living space**


This topic has the least scientific evidence and mostly comes from my own laziness. With Battle for Azeroth approaching, prioritize your real-life obligations to allow yourself for a few hours of uninterrupted play. Starting as you finish this piece, do your laundry, wash the dishes and clean your computer desk to be fully ready for the expansion. Prepare meals and drinks in advance and let them cool in your fridge. Cooking is always easier when done in batch, so prepare a few portions in advance and throw them in the oven or microwave whenever you’re hungry. Since the bulk of the job has already been done in preparation of game time, you’ll be able to focus on Azeroth and enjoy good healthy food.

Personally, I hate cleaning. I’d rather do it in short bursts than dedicate a whole day to it. Use any breaks you have to stay ahead of your cleaning. Should disconnection come, use your anger to clean faster instead of insulting the servers, that will not bring them back faster but will allow you to keep a clean room and enjoy the game better as you’ll have a feeling of accomplishment that always comes after tidying up the place. Queue times are also great for this, snack while you queue, arrange playlists, refill water bottles, exercise, walk the dog, have a quick shower, etc.


**Closing notes**


Maximizing your efficiency is important both in and out of the game! If you’ve read this far, I thank you for your time. My last advice would be to allow yourself to enjoy the game. Give yourself a break for the weekend, spend time outside under the sun and recharge your battery for the grind to come. Stay healthy, stretch and sleep as needed, you need a strong back to carry your raid group ;) .

Wishing you all the best release, may the servers stay strong and filthy Alliance die under my blade (horde bias, sorry),


Veldr@Zul’jin

Hello everyone! We’ve been hard at work finalizing our upcoming **Rocket League** update for the end of August;  because everything is not releasing at once, we wanted to give you a clear idea of what you can expect later this month and into September.


First, the most pressing news: we are still putting the finishing touches on **RocketID** -- better known as **Cross-Platform Parties** -- by making sure that it lives up to our standards and yours. With that in mind, we have decided to target RocketID for September (pending first-party certification) instead of this month as we had originally planned. It was a tough decision to make, yes, but our focus on quality -- even at the expense of our schedule -- is in place so that we can provide you with the excellent play experience that you deserve.


Though RocketID has been pushed out to the update after next, we’re still on track to deliver the ""August Update,"" as it’s called for now, by the end of the month. The August Update includes a [big change to progression](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/incoming-changes-to-xp-and-level-progression/), which updates what happens when you gain levels in **Rocket League** along with major tuning related to how frequently that happens. Our intent is to make gaining levels desirable, achievable, and rewarding.


We’re also very excited about our first **Rocket Pass**, which launches one week after the August Update rolls out to you. Rocket Pass and its ""Premium"" upgrade features a ton of fantastic content for you to collect --  you can learn more about it in our [Closer Look from June](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/rocket-pass-a-closer-look/).


In addition to Cross-Platform Parties in September, there are also a number of new features and content coming later this year. We’ll be kicking off **Competitive Season 9** this fall, along with moving all **Sports Playlists**, like Rumble, Dropshot, etc. into their own Ranked tab (may the best players win)! And be sure to keep an eye out for additional announcements in the coming weeks, including some exciting social features we think will be a big hit.


That’s a quick preview of the next couple of months of what’s in the development pipeline. We’re still planning another Roadmap blog to cover the last few months of 2018.",t2_10jstd,,,0,,Cross-Platform Party and Summer Roadmap Update,[],r/RocketLeague,False,6.0,psyonix-answered,,,,False,,False,dark,,,public,,,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},Psyonix Comment,False,590,,,,self,1533834043.0,staff,[],,,True,,,text,6.0,,,text,self.RocketLeague,,,,,,,False,False,True,False,False,,,False,,True,False,False,Psyonix,,,,,,t5_30cz1,,,,,95y0jk,,,Psyonix_Devin,,474,False,all_ads,False,,,dark,/r/RocketLeague/comments/95y0jk/crossplatform_party_and_summer_roadmap_update/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/95y0jk/crossplatform_party_and_summer_roadmap_update/,427409,1533832463.0,0,,False,,self,,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'AQdsIt7C2cMbJsRr9lvTlpxJaiJKQRJP4AGXUIMZc7k', 'resolutions': [{'height': 60, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/YdlNBBrb__9jE9e7mRvFj2mJsWJFQL7dnIdVor1W3mA.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=ea43293b86cdcf1cd149e41003d165a0', 'width': 108}, {'height': 121, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/YdlNBBrb__9jE9e7mRvFj2mJsWJFQL7dnIdVor1W3mA.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=d572f0060e03d85a3c9fee59f129b648', 'width': 216}, {'height': 179, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/YdlNBBrb__9jE9e7mRvFj2mJsWJFQL7dnIdVor1W3mA.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=a71d531dab9d861b4fe6b513ed633db0', 'width': 320}, {'height': 359, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/YdlNBBrb__9jE9e7mRvFj2mJsWJFQL7dnIdVor1W3mA.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=68361ed0beb17c371bd25270e8358ebd', 'width': 640}, {'height': 539, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/YdlNBBrb__9jE9e7mRvFj2mJsWJFQL7dnIdVor1W3mA.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=5a538dcbef7c742381ed3b7290f79469', 'width': 960}, {'height': 607, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/YdlNBBrb__9jE9e7mRvFj2mJsWJFQL7dnIdVor1W3mA.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;s=033235b1fb507f61a623b1a87ae07765', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 674, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/YdlNBBrb__9jE9e7mRvFj2mJsWJFQL7dnIdVor1W3mA.jpg?s=639c3cde341c58baf3b9ae237830cb6a', 'width': 1199}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,1471303006.0,1536732396.0,,,
,DDLC,"In this chapter is a clickable link for you, a YouTube link for an acoustic song Sayori hears at the moment it happens. Given the theme of song and the nature surrounding when she reads it. If you are normally influenced strongly by music, I'd advise against listening to it while you read, but I feel it didn't warrant a NSFW warning. 

Much like in Chapter 8 I believe music or just sound in general in the background can massively add to the experience when it is included at the right moments. Music is part of every chapter I have written so far, from what I've included in other chapters, to just how it affects the very things that I write while its on in the background, I will never not have some on.

So I hope you enjoy this chapter, took me a little longer than normal with some IRL changes going on, it also I believe has the highest word count I've done so far. With what feels like less dialogue than normal too. As usual let me know what you think, either here or by PM.

**Chapter 20**

&amp;nbsp;    

It's been a couple of days since we found him awake in his room. Tomorrow is the day I've been worrying about, if he can't get out of the hospital even for a few hours. It'll crush him, he doesn't need that right now. His recovery has been steady, he can manage to be up and about for a little while, but moving is still clearly painful for him despite his best efforts to hide it.

I've actually managed to sleep. Not the whole night through, but for the first time in just over a week I don't wake up feeling worse than I did the night before. Checking my phone, I see that I've missed a few messages from him during the night.

&amp;nbsp;    

“Hey beautiful, can you bring me something to read or something to play games on next time you visit? I'm so bored here.” 

“I take your silence as a, Yes MC, I can certainly do that.”

“I messaged Natsuki to ask why we now call her Cupcakes, I don't know if its cause I woke her up or what I was asking, but she was very rude. I also hurt my side laughing. Productive day so far.”

&amp;nbsp;    
I find myself giggling silently at the last message, until the realization hits that we are the ones who now have to deal with an already annoyed Natsuki. Wiping the sleep from my eyes, sitting up in bed and stretching, I turn my phone sideways to start my reply.

“My silence was a, Its 3am and I'm sleeping, maybe you should have tried the same.”

“If she does something to my breakfast cause you made her mad, I'm holding you responsible.”

&amp;nbsp;    

A couple of minutes pass with no reply, so I decide to leave it for now. He should be resting anyway. I make my way downstairs, even with me waking up early I'm still the last one awake. Last night was the last time Yuri and Monika are going to stay over. Natsuki is laying on the sofa watching TV, her legs dangling over the arm and her head resting on a cushion which seems to be half on Yuri, who is sat with her arms out either side resting on top of the back of the sofa. Did she sleep in MC's T-shirt? I swear she had brought night clothes with her. My train of thought is interrupted by Monika coming out of the basement in what looks to be work out gear.

&amp;nbsp;    

M: “Morning all, we should probably start to get ready soon. Mind if I go first?”

N: “What were you doing down there?

M: “Sayori mentioned before MC kept some exercise stuff down there, figured I'd use some of them. I couldn't get back to sleep when I woke up, beats laying around doing nothing.”

&amp;nbsp;    

I disagree. I'm quite happy to do that when I'm able to. While Monika uses the bathroom in the hall, I use the one in MC's room. After I've finished I stay standing under the water, thinking about tomorrow. Trying to let it wash away the worry. Letting out a long drawn out sigh due to the fact that it isn't working, I turn the water off and and begin to get ready for school. As I'm dressing I find myself humming to a tune that I can't place? I physically stop what I'm doing trying to think what it is and where I heard it. Looking over at the bed, its cover not tucked. If he was here it would drive him crazy that I've left it like that. Smiling slightly as I think of what his reaction would be, we really are quite differ...

&amp;nbsp;    

*For all of our differences.*

*I always said I'd be there if you should come undone.*

&amp;nbsp;    

That's what the song is. The one he sang on the balcony on our trip, the one he quoted the first time we shared a bed. This bed. It hits me like a wave, taking the smile with it. The feeling of how lonely I've actually been at nights without him. I know he is recovering, I know he is coming back, slowly. Even when he gets out we more than likely won't be able to share it right away, not with his injury where it is. I'd be too afraid of hurting him during the night.

I need a distraction. Booting up his computer to put on some music, I know he has some of my songs on here, since I complained he had nothing I could listen to. Flicking through the different playlists he has made, all the way down to S.

&amp;nbsp;    

Sayori's Playlist, of awful radio friendly garbage. 

&amp;nbsp;    

Real mature MC. I go to double click the playlist to start it after rolling my eyes, but accidentally hit the playlist beneath, stupid sensitive mouse. Why can't he have a normal one?! I can almost hear him in my head, The average mouse is 800 blah blah, This one can do 16000, but I keep it on 4500 with my custom blah blah, Who needs this many buttons! A mouse is a mouse, right?

File not found? This file has changed location? But he would never keep his music in a different location. He's insanely proud of his music being laid out correctly, album covers, every minor detail he can add he does. One of the CD's he transferred onto here of mine, none of the songs had details or names. He deemed it unacceptable and deleted it, buying me a digital copy online and downloading it, not that I'm complaining.

&amp;nbsp;    

Okay Sayori, you know how to do this, you've seen him do it countless times. Search for the file name. [Breathe Underwater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtrKv38twwI)? Its in a folder called S220518. Is that a date? Its just over a week after we became a couple. Two text documents and the song are all that are in this folder. I click the song for it to play and open the newer of the two text documents, Simply titled I'm sorry.

Before I even start reading, the sombre tone and lyrics of the song have already hit me in the stomach. What the hell is this.. This is the kind of song you would listen to if you were going to..
Starting to read the note, line by line I feel more and more sick.

&amp;nbsp;    

*If this note is being read, Then it's because I couldn't give her what she needed.*

*I did everything I could, but I still couldn't put a smile on her face or in her heart.*

*My best was not good enough and it cost me the light in my life.*

*She picked me up when I was down, but I couldn't do the same.*

*I wasn't strong enough to carry her when she needed me.*

To you and everyone else.*

&amp;nbsp;    

The moment I've finished the note, I can't keep it in any longer. Almost sprinting to his bathroom I make it just far enough to the sink before I'm sick. Looking up at myself in the mirror, my eyes have gone red and puffy and I'm trembling. My hands shaking violently because of what I just read. That note was about me. About what he would do if I had tried again and not have been stopped. He said he had suffered nightmares about that night, as I had after he showed me. Had they really frightened him this much? That the surrounding what if scenarios in his own head drove him to plan this just in case? As my breathing begins to calm, I make my way back over to the computer. Looking at the second text document, date created 17th of November 2015. That's around the time he..

I'm struggling to bring myself to open it. If the other note is anything to go by then this is what he wrote from back then. Don't read it Sayori, it's in the past. Nothing good will come of this. Walk away. I turn off the computer to make sure I don't read it. I finish getting ready, rinsing out my mouth with water then brushing my teeth. This certainly isn't how I saw my morning going.

&amp;nbsp;    

The whole walk to school is pretty silent, or at least I think it was. I was in a world of my own, with those words on the screen playing over and over in my head. Every time I come to the same answer. It was more than just nightmares, and I did that to him.
Class goes more or less the same as the walk here, I'm there in body but not mind. Drifting through the halls between classes, thankfully not being singled out by teachers for spacing out. By now news of what happened has gone round most of the school, avoiding people in the club room during lunch break was a pretty good idea by Monika.

Walking towards the building the clubroom is in, I stop before I reach the door, under a tree. Looking at the ground in front of me, this is where we used to have lunch together. Being in our final year, people had habits and routines, this was ours. Even with him not here, people didn't sit here. Stood here I can painfully see moment after moment playing in my head. From us eating together, laughing together, to him leaning against the tree and me leaning against him. 

&amp;nbsp;    

*I'm Sorry.*

&amp;nbsp;    

I can't take this, I have to see him. To tell him I had found it. Turning away from the clubroom building, I head to the exit. Normally we aren't allowed out of school during hours, but with what happened. The four of us had been given temporary permission to go home should we find things becoming too overwhelming. We had agreed that we would try not to use it, up until now none of us had.
Arriving back home, I change out of my uniform and quickly into some light blue jeans and a strawberry red ¾ length sleeve top, before long I've grabbed everything I need and closing the door behind me.

The bus ride seems shorter than normal, likely down to the time of day. Stopping only at the door to his room.
Reaching out for the door handle has never been harder than it is right now, wave after wave of doubt and worry weighing my arm down. Eventually I manage to force my hand to the handle and pushing open the door. Entering the room and walking to his bedside, he's asleep. I can wait, they have a chair I can rest on while I do.

&amp;nbsp;    
Slouching down into the chair, I rest my head against the wall. Opening my eyes and checking my phone to find just over an hour has passed since I arrived.
Standing up I walk over to his bedside table, taking the things he had asked me to pick up for him on the side. The sound of the book hitting the table causing him to stir and open his eyes.

&amp;nbsp;    

MC: “Hey you. Is it that late already? Guess I slept a bit more than I thought I would.”

S: “I brought the bits you asked for.”

MC: “You're the best, I knew I could count on you.”

I can't help but smile at how legitimately grateful he is. I can imagine being stuck in here is driving him crazy. Should I really tell him? Would it not be better to wait until he at least gets home first? Sitting up a little, he checks his phone for messages from the others, noticing what time it is as he does.

MC: “You should still be in school right now, is something wrong? Are you alright?”

S: “Are you?”

MC: “I'm stuck in a hospital room and struggle walking to the bathroom, I've never felt so alive, barely.”

S: “Why do you turn everything into a joke? Especially this.. There isn't anything funny about this..”

MC: “What's wrong? Normally me joking about stuff doesn't bother you this much.”

S: “I..found your notes.. On your computer.. in the folder with that song..”

&amp;nbsp;    

There are no jokes, nothing to try and hide behind. He is sat there with his eyes closed, either gathering his thoughts or hoping that he'll wake up again. Taking a deep breath and almost sighing as he breaths out. He reopens his eyes and looks straight at me.

MC: “I knew I shouldn't have kept them. You read them I take it?”

S: “I listened to the song and read the one from this year. I didn't read the older one. Why? Why didn't you tell me things were that bad.. I could of helped you..”

MC: “You would have blamed yourself for it Sayori, which would have led to exactly what I was afraid of. The last thing you needed then was to know about it. Its why I didn't tell you about the nightmares until you started getting them. I could not let anything push you back there. Especially not after what I had been wanting for as long as I can remember had finally happened. I'd been thinking about it since you did that stupid pocky thing to me. I was not about to let you go.”

&amp;nbsp;    

With everything going on lately, I'd almost forgotten this feeling. Hearing that he had been wanting us to get together for almost as long as I had, I can feel the warmth being sent around my entire body by my heart. Reliving the memory of me convincing him to try the pocky game by playing to his competitive side, I was doing it for two reasons. The first being me properly trying to understand how I felt, the other being me taking a chance on what I thought was a vain hope of me trying to awaken those feelings in him. A chance that of his admission actually worked.

&amp;nbsp;    

MC: “When you get home, I want you to delete them. All 3 of them. I'm not going to argue about why I chose to write it in the first place. Look at this week for example, what if I hadn't reached here in time? What would you have done?”

I can't reply to that.
If anything had happened to him I'd... I can feel the realization snap in my head. I'd have done exactly what he was prepared to do...
He's right... he really does know me too well..

There is a long awkward pause. I don't even want to look away from my own shoes. He knows he is right but doesn't want to say it. I know he is right but don't want to admit it. Breaking the silence, he changes the topic.

&amp;nbsp;    

MC: “Your dad and I managed to sort out arrangements for tomorrow, he knows you are coming with us too when you get out of school. I'm being allowed to go given the reason, under the condition that one of the staff who know my case comes with us to keep an eye on me.”

S: “I was worried sick that you would miss it. Are you sure about me standing with you though? I'd understand if you would want to be alone first.”

MC: “Just let the others know not to come here tomorrow during club time, as you and I won't be here, and of course I'm sure about it. How else am I going to tell him he was right?”

&amp;nbsp;    

Final year of high school, just like he said to my parents. His father had more faith in me than I had in myself. So I'm going to do everything I can to make him proud.

,FortniteCompetitive,"This isn't so much about a playlist but competitive settings in general. So if you look over a lot of competitive games, they have differences in their competitive nature vs their casual nature. Whether that is some thing like adding an attack and difference round like Overwatch or changing movement speed and re-spawn timers like Halo(I know Halo has more settings than that I'm just trying to make a point), there is usually some change. So that brings us to Fortnite and finding it's happy medium in the competitive scene. It should obviously not change to much so that the viewer base that enjoys watching competitive and not playing, or those that are trying to get into the scene aren't thrown off too much.

1. Circles and their mechanics. There are many things in this category that can change. [This](https://i.gyazo.com/89a031c061f904a58242c549cfebf2ad.png) is an example of circle settings in a PubG event.
   1. The sizes of each circle: You can have each circle slightly smaller to push enemies closer together, or larger to allow more breathing room.
   2. Circle DPS: You can make the damage done per circle smaller or larger. Possibly even smaller in the beginning like in the decimal region to allow for in the storm moves for better positioning in the circle, and then ramp it up as time goes on so that it can be even higher then the 10 it is right now in the late game.
   3. Wait and Shrink time: Would personally like to see shorter wait times and then have a higher shrink time. This will make teams move quicker, but at the same time give them time to move.

2. Removal/Addition of weapons: This is obviously something that will have people extremely opinionated about, but things like this should be considered. Just saying ""remove SMGs because spam meta sucks"" isn't a valid reason to remove them from competitive. However something like ""Jetpacks(assuming they weren't vaulted) should be removed, because it offers to high of an advantage, and with their limited number in each game it will dictate fights to highly in one teams favor, and thus can be seen as gimmicky and should not be in competitive"" could be seen as more reasonable(I know that isn't an accurate portrayal but I hope you see where I am going with this.).

3. Weapon rarity: This goes into how many of what weapon type are dropped onto the map, making Epics and Legendaries more or less rare. Possibly making Epics and/or Legendaries spawn only in supply drops.

4. Weapon/Building characteristics: Personally these should be kept the same. Changing these makes large differences in the gameplay over the casual game experience. Changing a weapons DPS, building health, or even everyones wanted Pump pullout delay kind of cross a line in how the casual viewer watches the game or how a user bounces between pubs and competitive games.

I'm sure there are more things one can change to make a better competitive experience, but I feel like these are the core elements than can really change how a game feels. I also feel that if any changes do come, Epic should not change them alone. They should reach out to pro players that are signed and are scrimming all the time to find the right medium. And again I said playlist because obviously if something were to change for competitive, people would need a place to play under these settings since there is no technical private matches in the game.

Curious to hear from you guys on if you think the settings should stay the same, or if some changes should happen.",t2_h0yoo,,,0,,A Competitive Playlist,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Discussion'}]",r/FortniteCompetitive,False,6.0,,,,,False,,False,dark,,,public,,,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},Discussion,False,17,,,,self,False,,[],,,True,,,richtext,6.0,,,text,self.FortniteCompetitive,,,,,,,False,False,True,False,False,,,False,d139545e-6435-11e8-8312-0e49581a19be,True,False,False,,,,,,,t5_ac643,,,,,95ignl,,,Demonify,,2,True,all_ads,False,,,,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/95ignl/a_competitive_playlist/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/95ignl/a_competitive_playlist/,43949,1533698480.0,0,,False,,self,,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'pjETiNpdp5yTII-s7-utRg0-vBxgLCJ91DlHgSOxzy0', 'resolutions': [{'height': 54, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/C8WH6BpVmaZRafOv2WrNwPV02T4CceXi4fBhbNmaHTQ.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=ff2b483fdbaabeaa1469310a2e91b615', 'width': 108}, {'height': 108, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/C8WH6BpVmaZRafOv2WrNwPV02T4CceXi4fBhbNmaHTQ.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=75392e90a8d7f0c240913ec7b0cdd1f0', 'width': 216}, {'height': 160, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/C8WH6BpVmaZRafOv2WrNwPV02T4CceXi4fBhbNmaHTQ.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=1cac5cc0661af19b6033b92fac2cd962', 'width': 320}, {'height': 320, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/C8WH6BpVmaZRafOv2WrNwPV02T4CceXi4fBhbNmaHTQ.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=476219549a9468596f8e7a776bcc9ec8', 'width': 640}, {'height': 480, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/C8WH6BpVmaZRafOv2WrNwPV02T4CceXi4fBhbNmaHTQ.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=14dc0919851e77e359826195620847b7', 'width': 960}], 'source': {'height': 512, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/C8WH6BpVmaZRafOv2WrNwPV02T4CceXi4fBhbNmaHTQ.png?s=9b2340d16590969e403228a2a103925e', 'width': 1024}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,1403067559.0,1536725043.0,,,

Chapter 5: K Estonii!

Tyler couldn’t keep his eyes off Natsuki. He wanted to go over and explain why he had said all those things that morning, but he just couldn’t find the right time nor muster the courage to do it. 

*‘Am I seriously starting to have feelings for a girl I’ve known for only* **TWO** *days??’* He pushed aside the thought of it and carried on with pitching the tarpaulin next to the tank. 

*“Right, my side is up!”* Sergey called to Tyler.

*“Ok, and… there we go! Mine too.”* He replied, nodding amidst his accomplishment. *“Right, so we’re sleeping on the ground?”*

*“Well sure, unless you want to sleep in the same tank we’ve been serving in for twenty hours??”* Natsuki pointed out. 

*“N-no! I-I just... Ugh! I’ll just go get the sleeping bags, I guess?”* Tyler asked with an embarrassed look on his face.

*“Well duh! Do you want to sleep on rocks, ya dummy?”* She shook her head and sighed as Tyler clambered onto the tank.

The sleeping bags were finally laid out after Tyler had spent ten minutes searching the tank for them. *“Righty-ho, so who’s sleeping where?”* He said as he scratched the back of his head. 

*“I guess me, Sergey and Dimitri will be next to each other, up to you guys where you go.”* Nicolay piped up.

*“Fine! I-I’ll sleep next to you Tyler, b-but not because I want to, so don’t get the wrong idea d-dummy! It’s just safer if we have someone next to us!”* Natsuki stumbled over her own words.

*“Erm… okay I guess?”* He shooted back with a confused look. *“Well anyway, I’m going to hit the hay because I’m bushed.”*

*“I second that, hopefully this time we won’t have any Germans waking us up?”* Dimitri laughed.

*“Alright then, good night you lot. I’ll make sure to wake you all up then, as I have something special planned for Kitti-hunter.”*

*“K-kitti-hunter? Is that what it’s named?”* Sergey stuttered, trying to comprehend the childish name.    

*“Y-yeah, as in like, it hunts tigers. Don’t tell me you have a problem with that too…”* Natsuki sighed.

*“Oi, I said I never had a problem with it!”* Tyler groaned, face-down in his sleeping bag.

*“N-no it’s cool, just a little... different I guess.”* Sergey sighed, sounding unsure of the new name.

*“Well it’s sticking, so deal with it!”* She exclaimed, annoyance creeping up in her voice.

*“R-roger that Commander. Right, off to the land of sleep!”* And with that he flopped back on the sleeping bag.

Now that they had gone quiet, Natsuki now thought back on what she had said to Tyler. Admittedly a part of her did want to be next to him as she felt a strange sense of security whenever he was nearby, however the true reason as to why she did was still mostly shrouded in mystery to her. 

*‘God damn it, I’ve only known him for two days, and I’m his Commander! I-it’s probably nothing, I-I should just ignore it.’* Trying to keep her thoughts away from the matter she drifted off to sleep.

Unbeknownst to Natsuki, Tyler himself couldn’t stop thinking as well about her now. And since he wasn’t in a life-or-death situation anymore he could finally think clearly. Why did he just grow this feeling towards her? He respected her immensely, sure, but that wasn’t what he was feeling. Whenever she would talk to him, he’d feel a pang of happiness, even if she was calling him a dummy. 

*‘Maybe it’s just nothing, all this lack of sleep is messing with my head.’* He forced the thought out of his head and closed his eyes, falling into a much-needed sleep.

The next morning came around instantly, Tyler was awoken by Natsuki tapping him in the ribs with her boots.

*“Come on dummy, wake up!”*

*“Ugh,”* he groaned while curling up into a ball. *“J-just five more minutes…”*

*“No ‘five more minutes’, get up now or I shall have Dimitri sit on you!”* She said, stooping over him with her hands on her hips.

*“Alright, alright I’m getting up! I’d rather not be flattened...“*

*“Hey, I heard that!”* Dimitri yelled over in offence.

*“You were supposed to!*” Tyler answered back with a smirk.
 
*“Alright, get your asses in gear because I want to paint Kitti-hunter up before we head to the ship in Estonia!”* Natsuki grinned, pointing to a collection of paint cans.

*“Where in the holy hell did you find all that??”*

*“I found a shop down the road, and they just so happened to have some paint!”* Natsuki looked pleased over her findings.

*“So… what colours do we have?”* Nicolay questioned.

*“Black and… pink.”*

***“PINK!?”*** All four boys shouted in shock. 

*“Where the hell are we going to put pink on a TANK!?”* Sergey complained, definitely not pleased with the choice.

*“I-I don’t know, I-I just thought it would add a bit of character to the tank!”* Natsuki defended, sounding hurt. 

*“I-I could do something with it.”* Tyler suggested.

*“C-can you?”*

*“Yeah, I think I have an idea.”* He pondered, staring at the pink paint can while deep in thought. *“And if you three aren’t happy about it, just leave me and Natsuki to do the work.”*

*“Alright, if you say so.”* Nicolay said as the boys wandered off at his suggestion.

*“Right then, let’s get to it Nat. I do hope you don’t mind that nickname,”* Tyler asked her, cracking a smile.

*“Hmpf, could be worse, I guess. And may I ask, what do you have planned?”* She inquired.

*“Oh, that’s a surprise. For now you can go and do your bit of the tank, and don’t come to my side until I say so, ok?”* 

*“Okay, whatever.”* And with that, they proceeded to get on with the task of painting.


*‘So then, let’s paint a… kitty?’* Tyler hadn’t put much thought into his idea, but the concept of a kitten on ‘Kitti-hunter’ sounded like a good plan, even if it was just him who said so.

Meanwhile, Natsuki was stuck with what things to paint on the tank. *‘M-maybe some Katakana… I could spell err… how about Manga! Yeah, that sounds good! Well that was kinda easy.’* 

*“Tyler! Can I come over yet??”* Natsuki yelled over the tank.

*“What? No! I said come over when I say so!”*

*“Ugh, but you’re taking forever!!”*

*“Hey, you can’t rush art, okay? Plus, it’s only been five minutes!”*

*“How long are you going to take then??”*

*“Not much longer! Sheesh...”* Tyler sighed at her growing impatience while finishing his ‘kitty’ emblem. After adding a few finishing touches before he could deem it as “done”, he gave himself a pat on the back as he wallowed in pride for his nice piece of work. *“Right, now you can see it!”*

*“Finally! Let’s see this so-called ‘art’ that you’re so confident about.”*

*“Oi, if I say it’s art, it’s art. Okay?”*

*“Tyler, you also said you could sing, so don’t blame me if I have trust issues.”*

*“I can sing! I just can’t sing too well in Russian…”*

*“Yeah, yeah alright.”* She said whilst emerging around the corner. 

*“Bellissimo! If I do say so myself…”* He huffed, pointing towards the little kitten painted on the metal hull.

The corner of her lips were pulled into a pleased smile as she gazed upon his work. *“Hey, it’s not so bad after all! And it goes with the tank. Nice work dummy!”* 

*“Th-thank you… I guess?”* He giggled, both embarrassed and happy at the praise he had received.

*“Ya welcome. Now, I can do what I wanted to do!”*

*“W-wait, what are you doi-“*

*“Shhh, I’ll tell you when I’m done.”*

*“O-okay then…”*

After two minutes, she had finished writing the foreign word upon the tank.

*“Aaaand done!”* She announced, looking rather smug as she managed to paint the kana “マンガ” rather well.

*“Sooo, what does it mean?”* Tyler asked

*“Manga!”* Natsuki proudly exclaimed.

*“‘...Manga’?”*

*“Y-yeah, you got a problem!?”*

*“Hmmm, I don’t know, I’ll have to take a closer look.”*

*“Erm okay, don’t know why that would make a dif-“* She was cut short as Tyler booped her nose with his paint brush. The girl was silent before what he did sunk in. *“Did you just…”*

*“Yes… yes I did, what’cha gonna do about it?”* Tyler teased, hands on both sides.

*“What am I gonna do? I’mma do this!”* She lunged towards his face with her brush, but she was too slow as Tyler flinched back and evaded her attack.

*“Gotta be quicker than that!”* He let out a laugh.

*“C’mere you!”* She went forward again, but instead of going for his face, she leapt at him, catching him off guard.

*“Waaaaah!”* He fell backwards on a patch of soft grass with Natsuki landing on top of him, knocking the wind out of him. *“Oof!”*

*“Got you now!”* She announced, pinning him down while holding his hands in place. 

*“Ugh, get off me!”*

*“Nope! Not until I do… this!”* She proceeded to splodge his face with black paint from her brush.

*“Gah! Stop it!”*

*“Hehehe, you look so helpless! Not so cocky right now, are you?”* Natsuki giggled.

*“That’s because you’re on top of me!”* Tyler complained, struggling under her. Though little in size and not very heavy, he didn’t want to push her off and accidentally hurt her.

As their shared laughter died off, their gazes met amidst the silence. It was the first time they had looked into each other’s eyes since the morning of the battle from the previous day. Tyler noticed the many emotions that sat behind her eyes before had disappeared, leaving only one behind... 

Bliss.

Natsuki had noticed this in his eyes too. It had been the happiest she had seen him since they had met, which in a sense brought her more happiness.

They could both hear their heartbeats as if their hearts were caught in their throats, their staring contest getting deeper at each passing moment. There were words that both had wanted to say, but instead of speaking they found comfort in relishing their moment together, time grinding to a halt around them.

Since when had she gotten close to a boy before? Natsuki couldn’t remember, or if there even was a time that she had. She mostly kept to herself as far as she could recall, not truly wanting to interact with others unless necessary.

That didn’t mean she was completely aloof, but she never had completely opened up to anyone, fearing that if she had grown close to one person she would end up getting hurt just like in the past…

Tyler too, was currently unable to think straight as he was lost looking into those pink eyes, now gleaming with what he could guess was curiosity. Not only that, but looking at her from this angle he deduced that while he had always found her this cute, she definitely was more than that…

Simply told, she was beautiful. Underneath that callous exterior and sharp tongue of hers, she was still a girl through and through, and one that somehow put him in a weird state of nervousness that he had never experienced before in his entire life.

Their tender moment that seemed to have lasted for an eternity was then suddenly broken by the sound of the other three returning.

*“Oh shit, the others!”* Tyler whispered in a worried tone.

*“Umm, g-get over by our ‘art’ and pretend we are just looking at it!”* Natsuki ordered him hurriedly as she got off of him.

*“Err yes ok!”* Tyler rushed over to the tank just in time as the three boys came around.

*“Jesus Christ, you two do know you were supposed to paint the tank and not yourselves, right?”* Sergey laughed.

*“Ehehe, yeah we got a bit clumsy while painting.”* Tyler mentioned, nervously scratching his cheek.

*“Hmm okay, whatever. Anyway, us three are ready to set off whenever you two are.”* Sergey announced, the other two nodding in agreement.

*“Mount up and we’ll meet up with the rest of the convoy. They should be ready to set off to Estonia soon.”* Natsuki advised them.

*“Roger that Commander, we’ll take the tarpaulin down and we’ll get seated in our positions.”* Nicolay answered.

As Tyler and the other three were taking the tarpaulin down, his mind began to wonder to the thought of Natsuki once again. 

*‘Holy fuck, do I actually like her? H-how could I? How could I possibly go about telling her? I can’t do it now, not this soon... And what if she made a big fuss about it and the other three found out? That would certainly lead to an awkward time in the tank...’* Tyler shook the thought out of his head, it was probably best to forget it for now. Instead, he carried on with the job at hand.

Whilst she sat on the tank and watching her men at work, Natsuki was having similar thoughts as him. 

*‘What if Tyler actually was trying to tell me he had more certain feelings towards me that morning?’* Thinking back on it there was something different with his tone and expression from the usual Tyler. *’I mean, he did say I was his friend, so maybe I shouldn’t get my hopes up on it, but...’*

Her eyes unconsciously monitored as the boy in question worked with the other three, unaware of the pair of pink, watchful eyes from afar. Just looking at that goofy face was enough to make her smile, as well as a red streak to tinge her cheeks.

*‘But he did cry like there was no tomorrow, I don’t think you’d bawl your eyes out for just anybody… Besides, why did he have to show he cared so much?’* Natsuki clenched her fists, her mind running through the countless possibilities she could come up with. ‘*Was he really afraid for my sake? Did he really not want me to go out there and get myself killed? Or was he just trying to keep himself out of trouble in case something bad happened to me and he was the last person I was with? I mean, I really can’t see any good reason for him to try and stop me, but the way he spoke to me at that time felt too… genuine to be out of pure selfishness. A-and if he does feel something... w-why me?’* The girl groaned as she rustled her hair in frustration. *’Ugh, why is thinking about this making me sick to the stomach?’*

*‘No, that’d be too soon, no way that’s happening. God damn I need to stop dwelling over this when I have a crew to lead...’* She lightly slapped both her cheeks and cleared her mind. *’Alright, get yourself together Natsuki, don’t screw up. Your men need you. Save daydreaming for another day.’*

She then looked up to see the tarpaulin packed up back on the turret. *“Right, if that’s taken care of then let’s get going, otherwise Lieutenant Krakowski will be waiting for us, and I don’t know about you lot, but I’d rather not get on his bad side. So chop-chop!”*

*“Understood Commander!”* They all replied in a shout.

The crew scrambled to their positions, Sergey put the tank into idle as Nicolay looked for a song to play. *“Hmmmm, we haven’t got many records left, if we are going to want more we are going to either have to buy a whole new set of records… or get a more “modern” sound system which doesn’t require records…”*

*“Well we could always purchase a new one in the U.K? I imagine we will have a little time to chill out before we start training.”* Tyler suggested, poking his head into the driver compartment.

*“Very true. Well, how about we play this for now? ‘Burning Bridges - Kelly’s heroes soundtrack’?”* Nicolay suggested, placing it on the relic of a gramophone.

*“Ooh, very fine choice my Russian friend!”*

*“Come on then, let’s move her out!”* Natsuki ordered, whirling her finger.

*“Aye aye, onwards!”* Sergey slammed the tank into gear as the music kicked in. 

They were now on their way to Estonia and a long trip laid ahead for Natsuki and her crew, where at the end she hoped to find her friends from the past and a solid answer to Tyler’s feelings…

*OI YOU, YEAH YOU! So I have now made a playlist dedicated to this fanfic! I shall try my best to fit it around it as it goes along, and make it work with the fic. So if you are interested (and if you have Spotify) search up my name on it (same as on Reddit) and find the playlist “Rozovyy Tovarishch: Soundtrack” on there you shall find the songs mentioned in the fic, and the songs that play in the background!* 

*I shall go through each chapter (future and past ones) posting the places to play the songs. I have listed them in appearance order so it’s more easy to follow! I hope people like this idea, and if people can’t get on Spotify, I might try and make a YouTube version too!*

,Blackops4,"Before I get to my notes, just a little bit of info about me. I've been playing Call of Duty for the better part of the last decade. The majority of my Cod career has been played in hardcore game modes, although due to the recent featured playlist in Black Ops 3 I've been playing more core game modes and adapting to that play style. However, my preferred game modes are Hardcore Domination and Hardcore Search. All that being said, I'm a relatively average player, I have my good matches and bad matches just like many of you.

***

#Notes

##TTK

Man, I really loved the beta this weekend! The TTK felt really good overall, and that's coming from a hardcore player. My only gripe was that if you ran into two or three of them you're pretty much boned, although I guess that's pretty consistent amongst most COD games.

Body Armor was annoying, but I don't feel like it was OP or broken. I personally felt like out of all of the choices in that category, body armor was the most useless one. Although, it did make Search and Destroy a touch more irritating.

***

##Game Modes

Control is by far one of my favorite new additions to the game! I had a blast playing that mode. I was even fortunate enough to clutch a game or two. 
Search felt really good 5v5, and in my opinion that really didn't feel like it slowed down the pace at all. One thing I noticed that did bother me, when sliding up to a bomb site to plant or defuse, you have to physically stop and wait for the prompt before you can do anything with the bomb. It might not sound like a big deal, but search can be a game of seconds, and I much prefer to be able to slide up to the bomb site and immediately press square and start performing whatever action it is I'm there to do. Additionally, there were a handful of times where my entire team was dead but after the enemy defused the bomb the round continued until the timer ran out. 
I felt like TDM played pretty well with a score cap of 75, but I'm relatively indifferent as to whether or not it should be raised. 
My last thought on game modes refers to domination. In WWII, the domination spawns were terrible! The enemy could literally be holding my hand, and the spawns still would not flip. In this game currently, the spawns feel very reactive, and flip when teammates push too far, that's how it should be.

***

##Weapons and Balancing

I tried my best to mix up my class setups over the course of the weekend as I reached level 34. I really enjoyed the majority of the weapons in this game, and felt like they were all viable options for the most part. The only weapons I really didn't tinker too much with were snipers, shotguns, and lmg's, I used them some, but not as much as the rest of the weapons. The operator mods were an awesome new feature, I had a lot of fun with those! The pistols felt great as a sidearm, but I felt that the shotguns were underpowered. Although, I had some friends level the shotguns up high enough to get some of the better attachments, and they seem to perform quite well once you level them up. I personally felt that sniper rifles might need to be fine-tuned a little bit further than what they are currently. I'm terrible with snipers, and the few times that I used a sniper class, or picked one up off the ground, I did relatively well with them.

***

##Specialists

I've really enjoyed the Specialists so far. I love the annihilator in this game compared to the BO3 version. I really didn't feel like any particular character was overpowered. Although, it was a little Annoying how effective the 9 Bang was, even when I was wearing tactical mask. I get that it perhaps should not be completely negated since it is a specialist gear, but the effects still last longer than what I think is appropriate when wearing tactical mask.

***

##Scorestreaks

I felt like the rate at which scorestreaks were earned was reasonable across most if not all game modes. At one point I was playing a game of domination and I managed to get all three of my streaks, the highest being a lightning strike, at a bloodthirsty streak. I feel like that type of streak is doable for most players, and is a reasonable one to reach in order to earn 1-3 of your streaks. One thing I noticed though, score doesn't seem to carry over from one-half of domination to the next. Also, the RC car can get stuck on things, with no way to get unstuck. Some context on that, I was playing a match on Seaside, the one with the winery, and my RC car got stuck on a barrel lid and I was unable to jump off or back off of it. I ended up having to blow it up and move on.
All that being said, the scorestreaks could definitely stand to be buffed a little bit. I know this was already addressed by Treyarch in their last post, but I felt it needed to be said even still.

***

##Movement

I personally was a big fan of Advance Movement! Black Ops 3 was probably one of my all-time favorite Call of Duty titles. I was very excited whenever WWII came out, and then quickly disappointed when I realized just just how slow the game play was. With Black Ops 4, I felt that they made a pretty good compromise between Advanced Movement fans, and B.O.T.G. fans. The slide mechanic was fun and efficient, and the jumps seemed to help navigate the map and assist in staying alive in gun fights. I really hope that this doesn't change, and if so very little, or is perhaps even enhanced.

***

Treyarch, thank you for the beta experience, it was a great weekend. I look forward to reaching max level next weekend! There are definitely still some things that need to be looked at and fine-tuned, but so far, you've created a truly fun and addicting installment to the Call of Duty Black Ops series.

***

To those of you that made it this far, thanks for reading! If there's anything you do or don't agree with, please comment, I would love to get more insight and discuss this even further.

,Blackops4,"I don’t see a discussion thread so far, so I don’t know where to post this. So everyone just discuss their bugs and issues here until mods pin a thread.  

First off, I’ve been playing CoD since Black Ops 1, and I honestly love this game...when I have friends and teammates I know. This is not an easy game to find enjoyment out of solo. Even in TDM. If you don’t have a team you are more likely to have your shit pushed in and that can be frustrating a lot of times. So as many of already said, a mercenary playlist is a must for the full game (I recommend adding Merc TDM next weekend just to get data on it and seeing if you really should put it in the full game based on how many players are in it). Treyarch, you have an amazing game on your hands but by god do you need to adjust some over powered weapons and specialist weapons (I’m not even gonna bring up armor. You know the communities stance; you said you’ll address; I’m not beating a dead horse). 

Nerf the damage on Ajax’s pistol in shield mode or give it less bullets. It’s too lethal in OBJ gamemodes. If you don’t have grenades you aren’t gonna be able to get rid of someone competent using him (if you can win an entire 1v4 in control using only the shield something went wrong there)

Buff Molotov’s. They feel useless and not worth giving up something like a trip wire or a nine bang or the cluster grenades. I recommend a small damage and AoE buff for this weekends beta

The Cordite SMG needs a longer cool down on the OP Mod. Currently I run around with a damn mini gun and anyone in my range doesn’t get a chance to fight back because of all my bullets

I don’t know what you should do with wildfire mod on the Spitfire. It’s ridiculous. You don’t stand a fighting chance once you see it. 

The Mozu needs a small nerf as much as I hate to say it. Damage wise it’s too powerful. That thing can outgun SMGs

The GKS OP Mod is useless according to my friend (two of my friends and I made the effort to grind separate mods in order to get a full feel of what’s broken and what’s not.) I don’t know what you should do to make giving up three pick ten slots worth it. 

The MOG-12 dragons breaths needs to do small and I mean small incendiary damage (not like WWII. That’s too much). It doesn’t feel worth it to waste three perk slots only not allowing them to heal. 

The spawn trapping is ridiculous. The threshold at which spawns flip needs to be increased. I’ve been trapped and I’ve trapped way too many people in the back of their spawn to die. 

Nomads dog. The barking nightmare. I run screaming whenever I see him through engineer because I know that this dog tanks bullets. His health is currently too high. Maybe cut it down by 10-25%. 

Increase the cooldown timer by two - five seconds for the shock drone on Prophet. Little bastards are running around non stop. 

The Spitfire needs a damage nerf. Even without Wildfire you are not likely winning that gunfight. 

The VAPR-XKG needs a small damage buff. It can barely compete with things like the Rampart or the KN. Even the ICR can out class it

Nerf the Koskha’a ADS or damage. I’ve been quickscoping since MW3 and it’s broken MSR. I love sniping. But by god does the Koshka feel as if I’m running around with a laser. People breathe slower than I ADS. 

The health feels fine as is. Leave it alone. It’s fundamental for the game. 

The snow map (forgot what it’s called don’t hurt me) is terrible. You will be spawn trapped 90% of the time. That’s gotta stop. 

Buff the attack chopper and straffing run. I feel as if the only think a straffing run does is make noise. The chopper just needs a duration buff. 

Streaks in general. As much as I dislike how much score they take, it’s necessary. The score in this correlates to the feature of assist counting as kills meaning you can tap someone in the toe and as long as he dies, the assist counts. It makes sense. Players are still adapting to the new system. 

The MX9 is still a bit stronger than most other guns. I don’t think it needs a damage nerf but instead a small fire rate nerf. 

The KN, ICR, Rampart and GKS seems perfectly balanced for now. (Good call on the small GKS nerf the first day. You have the data so of course you would know)

War Machine, Tempest, Vision Pulse, Grav Slam, Guardian Shield, Annihilator, Purifier, and the Medic Health (Crash’s Ability. I forgot what it was called) seem fine for now. 

Kill confirmed needs to go back to the way it used to be in terms of points per tag. 

Do not make TDM 100 kills. This game can barely complete 75. 




BUGS AND ISSUES:

•Final killcam glitch where you can’t see the actual kill cam and just see a screen of the map(I’ll find an example on my twitch stream later on and link )

•The RC-XDs poor handling needs to be addressed

•The tripwire for Nomad has a bug where direct impacts do not hurt people

•Semi frequent crashes (First the blue PSN screen for two minutes, then black, then the error report comes up for an app crash)

•People have been reporting frame stutters and things of that nature

•The Koshka sniper rifle
    -I love sniper rifles but I’m assuming it’s not working the way intended. The operator mod can literally make you seem like you have auto aim with little effort and I’m pretty sure that’s a bug. If that’s a feature it needs a nerf. 

•The shock drones pathing needs to be re-evaluated. 

•Spawning in either too late or without a visible gun (happens randomly and I can’t replicate it)

•A pathing issue with Nomads dog just standing still and growling at the enemy

•Footsteps seem louder than elephants compared to enemy footsteps. That’s a major issue in SnD. 

•A glitch with Seraph in SnD where she respawns more than once with her tac insert. 



If you know about anymore bugs let me know and I’ll include it in the main post. 


Honestly that’s all I can think of currently in general . I love this game and it can be great once some of the blaring issues are looked at and fixed.

,LetsTalkMusic,"Hi all, I noticed that since I joined Spotify (about a year or two ago) I developed an habit where I'm on a constant hunt for a song that will move something inside me, therefore I'm skipping songs a lot, jumping from one thing to another etc.

Lately I started to think about it and I feel like I lost the depth in music. 

In the past, I would listen to albums that I like back and forth, these days, I barely listen to albums and I feel bad about it.

It's also related to the fact that Spotify is a Playlists centric platform - playlists are getting pushed to your face. it's not about the album, or the artists - it's about the playlist.

I made a move and switched to Apple Music - Apple music has less features, playlists are worst etc, which is a good thing for me - it makes me focus more on albums without all the clutter around. iTunes has some great library management features, which also helps me build a better collection over time.

What's your take guys? do you feel the same? maybe the world changed and listening to a full album belongs to the past? How do you do it? how do you build a collection if you do so?

,DnD,"Last night I DMed a 5e adventure for three friends who had never played an RPG before. Not only did my players love it, I had more fun than all the years I played in college. I wanted to share some tips for any others who are new to DMing like I am, while also trying to teach all new players. I’ve also included links to some planning documents, plot synopsis, and other artifacts if you’re curious. I'm always curious how people actually plan these things!

**Background**

* This was a single-evening one-shot adventure that lasted about 6 hours.
* Four all-new players and myself. We all knew each other from work.
* I made up my own loose adventure structure in a generic fantasy setting.

# Tips

**Pre-roll characters for everyone, but push players to define who they are**

Since we could only commit to a single evening, I saved time by making character sheets for everyone based on their loose input (“I want to control fire!” = wizard with a lot of fire spells), but I provided only a single phrase description of *who* they were. I made sure to let them name themselves, told them to draw a portrait, and I asked them why they had all decided to adventure together as a party. So while I made character sheets, they were making characters.

[Picture of everyone’s portraits](https://imgur.com/a/AtscU2w)

Beyond character creation, I didn’t want to overwhelm players with mechanics and limit their thinking to what their character sheets said. I encouraged them to just tell me what they wanted to do, and I would decide what mechanics applied.

I've always found it hard to teach new players about spells, spellcasting, abilities, etc. It takes a lot of work to organize all of that information, bookmark the PHB, etc. To keep things simple and maintain a certain level of momentum in the evening so we're not constantly looking up info, I made each player a spell / ability list like [this one](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13tSx-v6klA6d23GROLjM3-h97PCtAWQtHn0aMijKeOM/edit?usp=sharing) , and a [combat cheat sheet ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QocgqGoexnT1PYAw_XFV1YU4MdBoy65vxfe-M05t304/edit?usp=sharing). Some might consider this too much hand-holding, but now that they have the hunger for D&amp;D, I can expose them to more of the mechanics in future sessions and give them more control over their characters' progression.

**Start with a fight to set the tone and expose players to basic mechanics**

Our adventure began on a ship. The captain had barely finished describing their destination of Silverport before being unceremoniously harpooned in the chest by an attacking merrow. It gave the party clear goals, and allowed them to play out the mechanics I had explained only minutes before, so it was all still fresh in their minds. In addition, everyone was so hyped to play, this allowed them to immediately do all the cool shit they had imagined they could do in the game.

**Invite players to narrate their successes and contribute details to the world**

Everyone likes feeling like a badass. Finishing moves are particularly good opportunities to let players describe their coup de gras. Having been on the receiving end of the merrow’s biting attacks, our barbarian chomped down into its jugular after a final blow with his great axe, referencing his cannibal background.

Beyond that, I asked players for details like the names of characters and cities beyond what I had planned. When discussing the terms of a quest they were going to accept, they wanted safe passage to another city. Not having a name for this new city, one of the players blurted out “White Claw!,” which is the name of a booshie, zima-like drink we all had in-hand. Thus, the next episode may take them to the bristling port of White Claw.

**Have a strong story framework that finds the party**

New players will generally be overwhelmed by a sandbox. And while you don’t want to railroad players to the point that they feel their choices don’t matter, you want a story that finds find them regardless of what they decide to do to ensure players have a coherent purpose. This is particularly important for one-shots with new players.

In our adventure, the owner of the ship was impressed by the party’s heroics that saved her company’s cargo. I planned to have her representative find the party and offer them a quest in exchange for the safe passage they were looking for. But my players ended up going *to her* estate before I had a chance to introduce the quest giving NPC. So they received the quest in a way that felt organic and reactive to their choice, though my quest NPC could’ve found them anywhere (Waiting outside their room at the inn, at the docks if they were to search for a ship, etc.) It would not have felt out-of-the-blue because the quest was being offered as a direct result of their actions in the first encounter.

[Here is my planning document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s6LuTOq9ajlr1zCkvttbILRAFsuBgEhAx3Dpq3yQ6vc/edit?usp=sharing)

Compare to the [plot summary ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bjf2B40lxxx0FlVtxTwfPip4tePterJgoOLuks5rq5o/edit?usp=sharing)to see how it actually played out.

**Provide vivid descriptions to inspire players**

I had a loose, 5-room-dungeon type plan that involved an intro fight, town RP and accepting a quest, wilderness travel w/ skill challenges, and a boss fight. But beyond that, I wanted to vividly describe a vibrant world. My players ended up being inspired by these details in ways I could not have anticipated, driving the story forward in satisfying ways.

One example: I described Silverport as being home to large, majestic birds that were revered in the city, and some followed the party as they ventured into the forest. I just thought it’d be cool to have that visual in our heads. I didn’t have a reason or plan for them, but it inspired the druid to speak with them and later transform into one to scout things out. As a new player, they may not have thought to use that ability without mention of animals.

**Get players hyped and involved beforehand**

Going meta, a big reason the evening went so well was because everyone was so hyped for it. They were set on having a good time. Reinforcing that, each person ‘brought’ something, metaphorically speaking. One player hosted. Another put together an ambient playlist on spotify. Things like that get people invested in the evening.

,rpg,"Last night I DMed a 5e adventure for three friends who had never played an RPG before. Not only did my players love it, I had more fun than all the years I played in college. I wanted to share some tips for any others who are new to DMing like I am, while also trying to teach all new players. I’ve also included links to some planning documents, plot synopsis, and other artifacts if you’re curious. I'm always curious how people actually plan these things!

**Background**

* This was a single-evening one-shot adventure that lasted about 6 hours.
* Four all-new players and myself. We all knew each other from work.
* I made up my own loose adventure structure in a generic fantasy setting.

# Tips

**Pre-roll characters for everyone, but push players to define who they are**

Since we could only commit to a single evening, I saved time by making character sheets for everyone based on their loose input (“I want to control fire!” = wizard with a lot of fire spells), but I provided only a single phrase description of *who* they were. I made sure to let them name themselves, told them to draw a portrait, and I asked them why they had all decided to adventure together as a party. So while I made character sheets, they were making characters. 

[Picture of everyone’s portraits](https://imgur.com/a/AtscU2w)

Beyond character creation, I didn’t want to overwhelm players with mechanics and limit their thinking to what their character sheets said. I encouraged them to just tell me what they wanted to do, and I would decide what mechanics applied.

I've always found it hard to teach new players about spells, spellcasting, abilities, etc. It takes a lot of work to organize all of that information, bookmark the PHB, etc. To keep things simple and maintain a certain level of momentum in the evening so we're not constantly looking up info, I made each player a spell / ability list like [this one](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13tSx-v6klA6d23GROLjM3-h97PCtAWQtHn0aMijKeOM/edit?usp=sharing) , and a [combat cheat sheet ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QocgqGoexnT1PYAw_XFV1YU4MdBoy65vxfe-M05t304/edit?usp=sharing). Some might consider this too much hand-holding, but now that they have the hunger for D&amp;D, I can expose them to more of the mechanics in future sessions and give them more control over their characters' progression. 

**Start with a fight to set the tone and expose players to basic mechanics**

Our adventure began on a ship. The captain had barely finished describing their destination of Silverport before being unceremoniously harpooned in the chest by an attacking merrow. It gave the party clear goals, and allowed them to play out the mechanics I had explained only minutes before, so it was all still fresh in their minds. In addition, everyone was so hyped to play, this allowed them to immediately do all the cool shit they had imagined they could do in the game.

**Invite players to narrate their successes and contribute details to the world**

Everyone likes feeling like a badass. Finishing moves are particularly good opportunities to let players describe their coup de gras. Having been on the receiving end of the merrow’s biting attacks, our barbarian chomped down into its jugular after a final blow with his great axe, referencing his cannibal background.

Beyond that, I asked players for details like the names of characters and cities beyond what I had planned. When discussing the terms of a quest they were going to accept, they wanted safe passage to another city. Not having a name for this new city, one of the players blurted out “White Claw!,” which is the name of a booshie, zima-like drink we all had in-hand. Thus, the next episode may take them to the bristling port of White Claw.

**Have a strong story framework that finds the party**

New players will generally be overwhelmed by a sandbox. And while you don’t want to railroad players to the point that they feel their choices don’t matter, you want a story that finds find them regardless of what they decide to do to ensure players have a coherent purpose. This is particularly important for one-shots with new players. 

In our adventure, the owner of the ship was impressed by the party’s heroics that saved her company’s cargo. I planned to have her representative find the party and offer them a quest in exchange for the safe passage they were looking for. But my players ended up going *to her* estate before I had a chance to introduce the quest giving NPC. So they received the quest in a way that felt organic and reactive to their choice, though my quest NPC could’ve found them anywhere (Waiting outside their room at the inn, at the docks if they were to search for a ship, etc.) It would not have felt out-of-the-blue because the quest was being offered as a direct result of their actions in the first encounter. 

[Here is my planning document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s6LuTOq9ajlr1zCkvttbILRAFsuBgEhAx3Dpq3yQ6vc/edit?usp=sharing)

Compare to the [plot summary ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bjf2B40lxxx0FlVtxTwfPip4tePterJgoOLuks5rq5o/edit?usp=sharing)to see how it actually played out. 

**Provide vivid descriptions to inspire players**

I had a loose, 5-room-dungeon type plan that involved an intro fight, town RP and accepting a quest, wilderness travel w/ skill challenges, and a boss fight. But beyond that, I wanted to vividly describe a vibrant world. My players ended up being inspired by these details in ways I could not have anticipated, driving the story forward in satisfying ways. 

One example: I described Silverport as being home to large, majestic birds that were revered in the city, and some followed the party as they ventured into the forest. I just thought it’d be cool to have that visual in our heads. I didn’t have a reason or plan for them, but it inspired the druid to speak with them and later transform into one to scout things out. As a new player, they may not have thought to use that ability without mention of animals.

**Get players hyped and involved beforehand**

Going meta, a big reason the evening went so well was because everyone was so hyped for it. They were set on having a good time. Reinforcing that, each person ‘brought’ something, metaphorically speaking. One player hosted. Another put together an ambient playlist on spotify. Things like that get people invested in the evening.

,BarefootRunning,"[Wall-of-text warning]

I still consider myself new to running (6 months), not just barefoot running, so I am still developing strength and endurance while trying to figure out the technique.

I have been doing a lot of slow, easy miles on my treadmill for the past few months.  I do run outside some, but most mornings I do skin-on-tread running while I watch Netflix.  I recently switched from 4 miles everyday M-F to 7 miles on MWF.  

I had to stop a couple times this morning due to Bluetooth connection problems to the PC I watch while I run, eventually I switched to music on my phone.  I have a playlist that I haven't used in a while that I filled with songs at 90 or 180 bpm, so that my steps should line up to every beat or half-beat.  Once my cadence got above 180, I stopped worrying about it and switched to video-based running distractions.  I recently found that my too-high cadence was robbing my efficiency (verified my heart-rate monitor).  Slowing down my cadence let me go a lot farther while keeping my heart rate in the aerobic zone.  I also tend to speed up my cadence to 190-200 spm when I try going faster than 9 minute miles.

I decided to try a faster pace on the treadmill against my correct-tempo music this morning.  I found that by keeping my cadence down, I could go a LOT longer at higher speed without my heart rate jumping up and wearing myself out in a quarter mile.  

I also got a better feel for Trevise's lifting advise.  When running 10-11 minute miles, lifting quicker means faster cadence, but at a faster speed, you push off and can stay in the air for a bit longer on each step.  I think quick lifting refers to pushing off quickly and letting the turnover be a bit relaxed instead of leaving the foot down longer and pushing back more.",t2_3gpg2,,,0,,Another light bulb moment or two this morning,[],r/BarefootRunning,False,,,,,,False,,False,dark,,,public,,,{},,027a2072-fec4-11e0-979d-12313b071981,False,,,False,False,,{},,False,9,,,,self,False,,[],,,True,,,text,,,,text,self.BarefootRunning,,,,,,,False,False,True,False,False,,,False,,True,False,False,unshod,,,,,,t5_2rp0r,,,,,952qk2,,,hogiewan,,3,True,,False,,,dark,/r/BarefootRunning/comments/952qk2/another_light_bulb_moment_or_two_this_morning/,,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/BarefootRunning/comments/952qk2/another_light_bulb_moment_or_two_this_morning/,15168,1533572786.0,0,,False,,,,,,,,1241020672.0,1536717609.0,,,

Edit your main channel banner links for your social medias: the links don't direct to your new social media accounts (still not done yet).

You unstickied your livestream youtube channel link from the subreddit. You can provide others with a link to it by changing the social media youtube link you have on the subreddit. The link you currently have is for your main channel but it should be for your second channel.

At least get a stand for your mic, with the minimum quality of the mic being a blue yeti

Get a discord tab for CX entertainment for viewers to post clips &amp; timestamps to help him pump out more highlights for people who miss streams. We also need better thumbnails to attract viewers, which can be posted in that tab.

List of good higlights missed so far: vaping tricks, buying a car on craigslist, and like beginning, some clips, and ending of the coffin stream

We need a link for people to buy the 150$ bags (you said you're currently on it, probably a paypal link).

Fix the streamerbot in the discord (ex. "".cxnetwork"" function malfunctioning).

Do the Evan tinder shoot.

People want you to make sponsor streams PUBLIC but make the CHAT sponsor-only (attracts more viewers and sponsors). That way your sponsors will be happy, and we can also have more PC streams.

Find a cheap car from craigslist to buy for the trip with Evan (you said you want around the range of 500$).

Work with Michael Reeves to for some sort of electronic device (ex. Robot Andy #2).

Install ublock origin ""adblock"". It will save the wasted time from ads on videos and allows for more viewer retention.

For streamlabs to work for liveu you need to get the liveu data to send to your PC then OBS etc to youtube for overlay to work. You can pay Jacob to setup it up or ask someone on discord for help.

Reaction playlist for you to react to (whenever): \[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7YJSrjC6GM&amp;list=PLzGYH9v8nDbmV6RevaPYVMhlcsMGLwLc0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7YJSrjC6GM&amp;list=PLzGYH9v8nDbmV6RevaPYVMhlcsMGLwLc0)\] (contains constantly updated old videos and new highlights)

React to Daily Dose of internet videos, DramaAlart videos, Scarce Videos, and LiveFails subreddit.

Incorporate both PC and IRL (maybe some gaming streams while on your PC, like playing Runescape on a new account just for shits and giggles or reactions for like 30 minutes before the IRL part).

Change the donation set-up so different donation amounts trigger different reactions from the TTS or on the screen (something you mentioned).

Make sure the camera is better set-up for the next Sam and Evan challenge (a better view than the coffin stream).

**Stream Ideas you still haven't done yet:**

You mentioned doing a TTS Henna Tattoo stream for a certain donation amount.

A sit down stream with Andy Milonakis discussing your issues with each other.

Start approaching strangers more on your stream. Don’t make it a main point of your stream and always have a concrete plan or activity to fall back on (such as going to a golf course, the beach, on a hike, to a restaurant, etc.) but start to do it more. Don’t be afraid to walk up and film random people and talk to them. If you’re afraid to straight up approach people and talk to them while filming them, then instead make sure they don’t know you’re filming them and keep the camera lowkey. For example, keep it on your shoulder and tell them you have it there in case an emergency happens and you need to film something quickly. Or have Evan wear the camera on his shoulder and have him stand far away from you and secretly film you talking with people.

Start streaming with Evan outside of LA. You’re bound to get better reactions out of people outside of LA because outside of LA people aren’t as used to people walking around filming/streaming content. Also, you guys can take trains instead of driving or flying. Go to cities in California other than LA and go to places like Phoenix Arizona. No Cx livestreamer has ever went to Phoenix and there’s a chance that’d be great content.

Buy different disguises other than the old man mask. Buy wigs, prosthetic noses, tanning spray, fake facial hair, etc.

You and Evan should get wireless lavalier mics immediately.

Go to a lunch hall at a college campus and sit down and eat there while Evan films you from across the room secretly.

Buy a wheelchair and those things that old people walk with called “walkers” and go to malls and public places while wearing the old man mask. Act old as fuck when you do this. Pretend to have a heart attack. Fall down as if your hip just gave out. Walk up to younger people at restaurants or in the food court at the mall and walk up to them and pretend to be a lonely old man and ask if you can sit and eat with them.

Buy a hidden camera that resembles a tie and wear it around in public while it’s connected to your LiveU and your streaming.

**Extras:**

Invite Lit Papi (Show Luciano) to a stream for the memes!

New challenge/task for the subreddit (for example, new meme of the day, video concept and you can feature it etc.)

Do a short 5-10 minute discord voice chat on stream where everyone talks so new people join it and also for the memes.

It's good to have cameos: call an old friend on stream, Evan as usual, someone from the CX network (example: crazy Erin), Lit Papi etc.

Reddit Recap every stream.

Regularly join discord VC (when possible).

Sam and Evan combined streams weekly (ex. a weekly challenge, like biking, running, getting pushed on a cart, etc.)

Clickbait an event for you channel (ex. like UFCx2, you can clickbait the moon eclipse, or any popular event to attract new viewers outside of Cx).

Have a suggestions tab on discord for possible stream ideas (many people on discord mentioned wanting it).

Games to play if there's a short wait before IRL stream: Runescape for the first time \[[Runescape.com](https://runescape.com/)\], Short games \[[https://miniclip.com/](https://miniclip.com/)\], Multiplayer short games that can be interactive with chat \[[http://iogames.space/](http://iogames.space/)\], any sort of game that people suggest in chat as well.

Maybe record some gaming content for cut-screen so people don't get bored.

Get a discord tab for CX entertainment for viewers to post clips &amp; timestamps to help him pump out more highlights for people who miss streams. We also need better thumbnails to attract viewers, which can be posted in that tab.

List of good higlights missed so far: vaping tricks, buying a car on craigslist, and like beginning, some clips, and ending of the coffin stream

We need a link for people to buy the 150$ bags (you said you're currently on it, probably a paypal link).

Fix the streamerbot in the discord (ex. "".cxnetwork"" function malfunctioning).

Do the Evan tinder shoot.

People want you to make sponsor streams PUBLIC but make the CHAT sponsor-only (attracts more viewers and sponsors). That way your sponsors will be happy, and we can also have more PC streams.

Find a cheap car from craigslist to buy for the trip with Evan (you said you want around the range of 500$).

Work with Michael Reeves to for some sort of electronic device (ex. Robot Andy #2).

Install ublock origin ""adblock"". It will save the wasted time from ads on videos and allows for more viewer retention.

For streamlabs to work for liveu you need to get the liveu data to send to your PC then OBS etc to youtube for overlay to work. You can pay Jacob to setup it up or ask someone on discord for help.

Reaction playlist for you to react to (whenever): \[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7YJSrjC6GM&amp;list=PLzGYH9v8nDbmV6RevaPYVMhlcsMGLwLc0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7YJSrjC6GM&amp;list=PLzGYH9v8nDbmV6RevaPYVMhlcsMGLwLc0)\] (contains constantly updated old videos and new highlights)

React to Lil Bored's new video of blasphemousHD's reaction on you: \[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2I\_H3q\_\_tc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2I_H3q__tc)\]

React to Daily Dose of internet videos, DramaAlart videos, Scarce Videos, and LiveFails subreddit.

Incorporate both PC and IRL (maybe some gaming streams while on your PC, like playing Runescape on a new account just for shits and giggles or reactions for like 30 minutes before the IRL part).

Change the donation set-up so different donation amounts trigger different reactions from the TTS or on the screen (something you mentioned).

Make sure the camera is better set-up for the next Sam and Evan challenge (a better view than the coffin stream).

**Stream Ideas you still haven't done yet:**

You mentioned doing a TTS Henna Tattoo stream for a certain donation amount.

A sit down stream with Andy Milonakis discussing your issues with each other.

Pimp out the grandpa costume next time (ex. for a party).

24/7 Apartment Stream (recommended in the discord).

Grafitti stream (suggested on discord)

Bus stream (suggested on discord)

Go Karting (suggested on discord)

Homeless stream for a few days (suggested on discord)

Start approaching strangers more on your stream. Don’t make it a main point of your stream and always have a concrete plan or activity to fall back on (such as going to a golf course, the beach, on a hike, to a restaurant, etc.) but start to do it more. Don’t be afraid to walk up and film random people and talk to them. If you’re afraid to straight up approach people and talk to them while filming them, then instead make sure they don’t know you’re filming them and keep the camera lowkey. For example, keep it on your shoulder and tell them you have it there in case an emergency happens and you need to film something quickly. Or have Evan wear the camera on his shoulder and have him stand far away from you and secretly film you talking with people.

Start streaming with Evan outside of LA. You’re bound to get better reactions out of people outside of LA because outside of LA people aren’t as used to people walking around filming/streaming content. Also, you guys can take trains instead of driving or flying. Go to cities in California other than LA and go to places like Phoenix Arizona. No Cx livestreamer has ever went to Phoenix and there’s a chance that’d be great content.

Buy different disguises other than the old man mask. Buy wigs, prosthetic noses, tanning spray, fake facial hair, etc.

You and Evan should get wireless lavalier mics immediately.

Go to a lunch hall at a college campus and sit down and eat there while Evan films you from across the room secretly.

Buy a wheelchair and those things that old people walk with called “walkers” and go to malls and public places while wearing the old man mask. Act old as fuck when you do this. Pretend to have a heart attack. Fall down as if your hip just gave out. Walk up to younger people at restaurants or in the food court at the mall and walk up to them and pretend to be a lonely old man and ask if you can sit and eat with them.

Buy a hidden camera that resembles a tie and wear it around in public while it’s connected to your LiveU and your streaming.

**Extras:**

Invite Lit Papi (Show Luciano) to a stream for the memes!

New challenge/task for the subreddit (for example, new meme of the day, video concept and you can feature it etc.)

Do a short 5-10 minute discord voice chat on stream where everyone talks so new people join it and also for the memes.

It's good to have cameos: call an old friend on stream, Evan as usual, someone from the CX network (example: crazy Erin), Lit Papi etc.

Reddit Recap every stream.

Regularly join discord VC (when possible).

Sam and Evan combined streams weekly (ex. a weekly challenge, like biking, running, getting pushed on a cart, etc.)

Clickbait an event for you channel (ex. like UFCx2, you can clickbait the moon eclipse, or any popular event to attract new viewers outside of Cx).

Have a suggestions tab on discord for possible stream ideas (many people on discord mentioned wanting it).

Games to play if there's a short wait before IRL stream: Runescape for the first time \[[Runescape.com](https://runescape.com/)\], Short games \[[https://miniclip.com/](https://miniclip.com/)\], Multiplayer short games that can be interactive with chat \[[http://iogames.space/](http://iogames.space/)\], any sort of game that people suggest in chat as well.

Maybe record some gaming content for cut-screen so people don't get bored.

,amwf,"NOTE: Love how my post and other AMWF posters comments are getting a few down votes here and there by bitter people lol. I can see the votes going up and down you sneaky sneaky people you! ;) 

----------------------------------

I've noticed quite recently that a new sub called Toxic AMWF has popped up and a few recent comments on r/hapas has brought up the subject of Asian Male White Female couplings as being potentially toxic. While I agree our own relationships are just as susceptible as others to being toxic and it's good to educate people on the issues, in some cases I feel this may be an attempt to push the agendas of certain frustrated people and their ideals, to call out other pairings while trying to promote the one they feel is exempt to any toxicity - which is of course untrue.






With the recent popularity of Kpop and Jpop and Asian culture, a lot of non Asian woman are beginning to realise Asian men have always been just as attractive as White and Black guys and its about time! 






I can understand why such a community would form perhaps out of frustration and anger out of many Asian men choosing to go out with white woman but being reluctant to date them, Black woman which is very unfair.






But I think it's also unfair (admittedly way less so) to lump all AMWF relationships as toxic because let's face it, many are not. I took a look at the new sub and they just seem to post pictures of people who have been involved with crimes (minor to major ones) who happen to be children from AMWF relationships. I got the feeling they are trying to fairly aggressively say if you are an AM with a white gf you will all have criminal children but if you pair with them you won't... Okaaay. Tbh if anything I feel this approach will most likely alienate AM who come across the sub, because if an AM is gonna date a WW he will anyway.







Many Asian guys you are likely to date will be 1st generation American, British ect. Their parents are born overseas in Asia and unfortunately Asia is known at the moment for being more behind with racial issues than the west and in some cases whitewashed. People of African origin can sadly have a hard time and in some cases looked down upon by Asians.






The psyche of Asian culture is also normally very family oriented. If for any reason the Asian family opposes their son going out with a woman he may in the end try to please his family rather than do what he wants. I'm not saying this is a good thing at all (he needs to grow a pair) but in some cases Asian culture does work like this. I don't think all AM are inherently racist towards black people its probably more down to family pressure, and that has an effect on who they choose. So this is why some woman feel excluded from dating AM.







However THERE IS NO HOLY GRAIL of any radical paring. Anyone from any race can be racist, any mix can be potentially toxic. Same race couples have countless cases of their children turning into criminals as do other pairings, it's often the way the child has been brought up and their poor life choices that has an effect on their future. Choose your partner wisely.






It's more down to the individuals in the relationship whether it will turn out toxic for them or their children. I've been an avid reader of r/hapas and while there is proof some couplings such as WMAF especially in the US can be troublesome its because people get together for the wrong reasons, I do still really think it is up to the individuals in the relationship. If you have one toxic person or worse two it's a recipe for disaster. There are some very nice WMAF couples who genuinely care about their kids, as there are AMXF couples.






A reason why AMBW relationships could be seen as the best option is that both Asian men and Black woman have faced similar hardship by being oppressed in wider society in the west, so they are better equipped to raise mixed/non white kids. While I agree with this their kids will still face issues they themselves never had to deal with much like asian and white couples. Their parents never had people saying they weren't asian or black or white enough, not believing what their heritage is. This puts both AMWF and AMBW couples on a similar boat. 






If you are an Asian male, make sure your partner is good for you, whatever her race is. Is your partner into you because she has a big collection of Kpop playlists and sees you as an accessory as her very own Kpop signer? does she have no real interest in your culture? Is she only into Japanese guys? Does she think your culture is better than hers while rejecting her own (weeaboo koreaboo alert) Hates the food, does she make racial jabs at your culture or others? if so AVOID






Are you into her because you think going out with a white woman is an achievement? Do you have a fetish for woman from Russia ect. Or that certain woman make the ""best babies"". That you are improving your race. Are you doing it to spite the AF who might have rejected you? Do you want a Black gf because you love ghetto and rap culture and think all Black people fall into that category? you get the idea... If so you need to seriously rethink why you want date these woman.






There's nothing wrong with wanting to date people because you are attracted to them and have an interest in their culture, but make sure it's for the right reasons and not extreme reasons, at the end of the day your partner is a human like you are not an accessory and you need to love them for who they are not what they are.






As white woman it's up to us to be sensitive and supportive of our Asian partners and non white children as we face issues we probably haven't faced before and will become a lot more aware of race issues as it begins to affect us as well. My advice is read up on these issues and try to become more aware or as some people say - woke.







Guys, if you are interested in checking out r/hapas please be aware it's not a place for us lot to post too often and try to join in with that group, it's their space respect it. They are quite happy to answer any Hapa related questions you may have though.

,Drugs,"Hopefully I am posting in the right place.

I'm trying to create a playlist. If you're interested read on.

I'd like to consider myself experienced in psychedelics/entheogens, and my friend is leaning on me because of it. I don't want to let this person down. They saved a fuckload of lives - not just American lives or ""allied"" lives either.

So I can't go into a lot of details because, frankly, I don't know how many people are actually receiving this treatment and just giving details about my friend may be enough to identify them. So I apologize for not giving a lot of background. I hope everyone can understand why I would value protecting their privacy.

Suffice to say their PTSD is rooted in some serious shit. Valor device type shit (that means they were exceptionally fucked up beyond all recognition situations). We're talking situations beyond just being under fire, beyond having to push themselves, we're talking situations where a slightly different roll of the dice and they'd be in a grave...and it's not just once that it happened. My friend has been through the ringer. Suicide was on the line at one point though thank fuck my friend had the strength to tell someone close to them that they were thinking about suicide (and had a plan). My friend has persevered and, to their credit, the military doctors have actually treated them incredibly well. Above and beyond is how I would describe it. The military has continued to let them pursue active duty and even given promotions while this treatment has been ongoing.

But my friend's PTSD can be debilitating when it hits.

So with all other methods exhausted they're now they're going to start ketamine treatment. And we're not talking a small dose.

We're talking 0.5 mg/lb IV. That's a pretty heavy dose. K-hole starts around .75 with IM, not so sure on when that hits with IV.
During the effects they're in an isolation room. It's sound proofed. They can't hear anything outside. No one can hear them outside unless they open the door or hit the emergency button.

The VA is giving my friend a ticket, punching it IV, and letting them take the ride wherever it takes them.

So I want to give my friend a playlist.

Obviously this needs to be a decent playlist. Typical trippy music isn't wanted, obviously. This needs to be something curated. Something tasteful.

Something that makes you feel happy, but introspective. Above all music that's unlikely to inspire anxiety.

My first thought was the [Daft Punk track Touch ft. Paul Williams from Random Access Memories](https://youtu.be/XfH3erWacsQ) as that song seriously seems to encapsulate the exact sort of thoughts and feelings his doctors and therapists want my friend to be able to internalize.

This post is already way too damned long. I'm sorry for that.

,MGTOW,"(The begging part is essentially talking about Queen, skip to later on if you want the point of it.)

Me and my mom where driving home from my sisters house. I hate my mom, she is far too feminine for me to get along with her, militaristic, and in some ways abusive.  But thats besides the point. 

We were driving home, and her being born in late 70s, i put on my Queen playlist for us to listen to. All the hits and some underground stuff. We Will Rock You came on, and after the song finished she told me to put Pandora 60s, 70s &amp; 80s hits. Under Treasure came on, Bowie and Freddie Mercury usually sing it. But this was the Annie Lennox version.

I'm already protruded by this ""stranger"" singing a song a love. The lyrics ""Pressing down on you no man ask for. Under pressure that brings a building down, Splits a family in two."" Really hit me... hard...

Now, i barely know Annie Lennox's work. And, I'm sure he was a great singer, but there was no pressure. I feel like the male competition (gay, bi, or not) made Freddie performance... pressurizing. The male and female duality of Bowie and Lennox is just existing, nobody pushing themselves. You aren't hearing soaring highs of a legend doing everything in their power to out shine another person, it has no POWER behind it. Now, im convinced this isn't about the person entirely, Freddie was a legend, but Anne could of done that too. But she didn't drive it, she didn't drive anything, it was Bowie outshining a women.

This got me thinking. The systematic replacement of men. In almost live version of Freddie its a women.



Our Society is so fucked. We grow up sitting, with people spewing information to us, to go into a world where all women have had 50 dicks in them before they get to you, and 5 years into your marriage she leaves you. We live in a world where young BOYS, get told that they can be anything they want. And are then told Masculinity is wrong.

We live in a world where you can't be a man. We live in a world where men cant spread their legs on the subway. We live in a world where having a wife raise her kids at home with a man doing all the hard work is ""male tyranny"". We live in a world where, when you want to sit down to watch sports, men in the their prime actually showing off the power of humanity, we get told thats toxic too.

We live a world where, if you're just soo unlucky to white, people believe no matter your achievements, you should be damned to be forgotten because you're just another ""dead white male"". 

Even more, we live in a world where if you're want to believe in a God, you're a fool. If you want to not have sex before marriage you're ""suppressing women"". WE LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE WOMEN SHOWING 90% OF THEIR BODY IS ""EMPOWERING"".


Does anyone think the current suicide rate is normal? Its not. And no wonder why we kill ourselves, when being a man is just toxic, and you repress it. When you make men into women because they can be whatever they want. When you make women into disgusting creatures, and punish marriage, what do you think happens? Men go their own way. And some men are too weak, and kill themselves.


We go to government mandated school to be indoctrinated, and preached to about how men are toxic, and taught in a way so anti man its insane. It crushes your desire to learn.
 
Honestly, living in our society. Men kill themselves because they have no purpose, because being a man is toxic. And, when you're repressed for 20 years, and you don't know why, and see no way out, i cant blame you for pulling the trigger.

At some point, when you're lost in this maze, and you dont know why you have no purpose, you go down 2 paths. You kill yourself, or you kill others. And its scary, because the vast majority of these mass shooters grew up in homes without DADS. No wonder why they do it.

I'm 15, i dont have the extreme separatism from women yet as I've only seriously dated 2. I want to find out for myself before I take a vow of celibacy. But yet, i feel me realizing this is a tad bit abnormal.

,SamPepper,"**For (** [u/sampepper\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/sampepper_) **):**

Continue with the set-up of: chill-streams in the morning, IRL in the evening, and sponsor-chat streams with games and reactions at night.

You asked for co-op games to play with Evan, here's a list of game names: hand simulator, keep talking, nobody explodes , and a way out.

Add new cut-screens for when the LiveU Fs.

List of cut-screens: ([https://www.reddit.com/r/SamPepper/comments/938stj/list\_of\_fscreens\_to\_choose\_from\_so\_far\_regularly/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SamPepper/comments/938stj/list_of_fscreens_to_choose_from_so_far_regularly/))

Discord suggested a new F-screen idea: ([https://www.reddit.com/r/SamPepper/comments/948lbn/new\_f\_screen\_idea/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SamPepper/comments/948lbn/new_f_screen_idea/))

Edit your main channel banner links for your social medias: the links don't direct to your new social media accounts (still not done yet).

You unstickied your livestream youtube channel link from the subreddit. You can provide others with a link to it by changing the social media youtube link you have on the subreddit. The link you currently have is for your main channel but it should be for your second channel.

At least get a stand for your mic, with the minimum quality of the mic being a blue yeti

Get 4 more emotes for sponsors. Add discord memes for discord users. Add reddit flairs for reddit users.

The following emote packs can be used for youtube sponsors, for discord memes, and reddit flairs, this is constantly updated):

Emote Pack 1: ([https://www.reddit.com/r/SamPepper/comments/92xrpb/emote\_pack\_1\_completed\_comment\_which\_one\_you\_need/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SamPepper/comments/92xrpb/emote_pack_1_completed_comment_which_one_you_need/))

Get a discord tab for CX entertainment for viewers to post clips &amp; timestamps to help him pump out more highlights for people who miss streams. We also need better thumbnails to attract viewers, which can be posted in that tab.

List of good higlights missed so far: vaping tricks, buying a car on craigslist, and like beginning, some clips, and ending of the coffin stream

We need a link for people to buy the 150$ bags (you said you're currently on it, probably a paypal link).

Fix the streamerbot in the discord (ex. for "".cxnetwork"" function) and possibly a member's-only chat.

Do the Evan tinder shoot.

People want you to make sponsor streams PUBLIC but make the CHAT sponsor-only (attracts more viewers and sponsors). That way your sponsors will be happy, and we can also have more PC streams.

Find a cheap car from craigslist to buy for the trip with Evan (you said you want around the range of 500$).

Work with Michael Reeves to for some sort of electronic device (ex. Robot Andy #2).

Install ublock origin ""adblock"". It will save the wasted time from ads on videos and allows for more viewer retention.

For streamlabs to work for liveu you need to get the liveu data to send to your PC then OBS etc to youtube for overlay to work. You can pay Jacob to setup it up or ask someone on discord for help.

Reaction playlist for you to react to (whenever): \[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7YJSrjC6GM&amp;list=PLzGYH9v8nDbmV6RevaPYVMhlcsMGLwLc0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7YJSrjC6GM&amp;list=PLzGYH9v8nDbmV6RevaPYVMhlcsMGLwLc0)\] (contains constantly updated old videos and new highlights)

React to Lil Bored's new video of blasphemousHD's reaction on you: \[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2I\_H3q\_\_tc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2I_H3q__tc)\]

React to Daily Dose of internet videos, DramaAlart videos, Scarce Videos, and LiveFails subreddit.

Incorporate both PC and IRL (maybe some gaming streams while on your PC, like playing Runescape on a new account just for shits and giggles or reactions for like 30 minutes before the IRL part).

Change the donation set-up so different donation amounts trigger different reactions from the TTS or on the screen (something you mentioned).

Make sure the camera is better set-up for the next Sam and Evan challenge (a better view than the coffin stream).

**Stream Ideas you still haven't done yet:**

You mentioned doing a TTS Henna Tattoo stream for a certain donation amount.

A sit down stream with Andy Milonakis discussing your issues with each other.

Pimp out the grandpa costume next time (ex. for a party).

24/7 Apartment Stream (recommended in the discord).

Grafitti stream (suggested on discord)

Bus stream (suggested on discord)

Go Karting (suggested on discord)

Homeless stream for a few days (suggested on discord)

 Start approaching strangers more on your stream. Don’t make it a main point of your stream and always have a concrete plan or activity to fall back on (such as going to a golf course, the beach, on a hike, to a restaurant, etc.) but start to do it more. Don’t be afraid to walk up and film random people and talk to them. If you’re afraid to straight up approach people and talk to them while filming them, then instead make sure they don’t know you’re filming them and keep the camera lowkey. For example, keep it on your shoulder and tell them you have it there in case an emergency happens and you need to film something quickly. Or have Evan wear the camera on his shoulder and have him stand far away from you and secretly film you talking with people.

Start streaming with Evan outside of LA. You’re bound to get better reactions out of people outside of LA because outside of LA people aren’t as used to people walking around filming/streaming content. Also, you guys can take trains instead of driving or flying. Go to cities in California other than LA and go to places like Phoenix Arizona. No Cx livestreamer has ever went to Phoenix and there’s a chance that’d be great content.

Buy different disguises other than the old man mask. Buy wigs, prosthetic noses, tanning spray, fake facial hair, etc.

You and Evan should get wireless lavalier mics immediately.

Go to a lunch hall at a college campus and sit down and eat there while Evan films you from across the room secretly.

Buy a wheelchair and those things that old people walk with called “walkers” and go to malls and public places while wearing the old man mask. Act old as fuck when you do this. Pretend to have a heart attack. Fall down as if your hip just gave out. Walk up to younger people at restaurants or in the food court at the mall and walk up to them and pretend to be a lonely old man and ask if you can sit and eat with them.

Buy a hidden camera that resembles a tie and wear it around in public while it’s connected to your LiveU and your streaming.

**Extras:**

Invite Lit Papi (Show Luciano) to a stream for the memes!

New challenge/task for the subreddit (for example, new meme of the day, video concept and you can feature it etc.)

Do a short 5-10 minute discord voice chat on stream where everyone talks so new people join it and also for the memes.

It's good to have cameos: call an old friend on stream, Evan as usual, someone from the CX network (example: crazy Erin), Lit Papi etc.

Reddit Recap every stream.

Regularly join discord VC (when possible).

Sam and Evan combined streams weekly (ex. a weekly challenge, like biking, running, getting pushed on a cart, etc.)

Clickbait an event for you channel (ex. like UFCx2, you can clickbait the moon eclipse, or any popular event to attract new viewers outside of Cx).

Have a suggestions tab on discord for possible stream ideas (many people on discord mentioned wanting it).

Games to play if there's a short wait before IRL stream: Runescape for the first time \[[Runescape.com](https://runescape.com/)\], Short games \[[https://miniclip.com/](https://miniclip.com/)\], Multiplayer short games that can be interactive with chat \[[http://iogames.space/](http://iogames.space/)\], any sort of game that people suggest in chat as well.

Maybe record some gaming content for cut-screen so people don't get bored.

,FortNiteBR,"Before I begin, let me start off by saying this game was getting about as stale as it’s ever been despite all the changes, nerfs, buffs, etc. I felt as if even though there were many changes, they were not enough. I feel like a huge part of me feeling that way stemmed from hitting a “skill plateau”. I consider myself a decent, above average player but for the longest time I felt like I couldn’t improve - and I’m all about improvement. 

At first, I didn’t play solo showdown when it first came out. I played one or two matches but immediately when back to regular solos. This time around I decided to give it a shot, but found myself quickly intimidated by all the competition. I felt compelled to go back to the normal playlist but thought to myself “maybe this is why you’re not improving, your fear of competition”. I pushed myself and after a few matches I completely fell in love with all the competitive gameplay. 

I can honestly say it’s pushed me to play better, think different (building, pushing, knowing when to attack or fall back, gun-wise), and a whole bunch of other factors.  Fortnite hasn’t been the same for me after that playlist but for the better. 

I wish Epic would come up with a similar playlist but I know that’d be hard. Solo showdown has allowed me to go outside my comfort zone and play a lot better than what I used to, huge shoutout to everyone who took part in it and congrats to the winners!

,relationships,"Hey Everyone!

I love this sub and always find comfort in the advice and suggestions here. I usually lurk, but today I wanted to get an outsiders opinion on my specific experience.  Feel free to tell me I am the one wrong here, a part of me does feel that maybe the issue lies within myself and my need for a controlled environment; however, a bigger part of me is concerned there is a lack of courtesy and overall self-absorbed entitlement going on.

I met this really cool guy about 8 weeks ago.  Checks all the boxes emotionally, physically, and professionally.  We have connected on so many levels and have great chemistry.  We have decided to be official and spend as much time together as we can with our busy schedules.  Prior to meeting him, I was single for quite some time.  I really got into a routine of consistent sleep hours, working out, and do a pretty loose meal prep for the week to keep my time at home stress free on Monday-Thursday.  The weekends I let loose and eat and play as much as my heart desires, but during the work week I like to feel refreshed and well rested. Well, this new development in my life has thrown all of that down the drain.  My new SO likes to eat out almost every night, stays up late, and plays his music at my house (his apartment is pretty shitty, we stay at my house most nights) non-stop.  All my tv shows and music has about disappeared in my routine. 

 I've managed to scrape by working out still, but he always complains I work out too much and is overall grouchy when I try to do things that I find important away from him.  Even for work, he pushes me to take days off when he isn't working just so he isn't bored.  I would never do this on a whim, I take my vacation and sick days seriously and wouldn't risk compromising my job for some new guy. In the beginning the exposure to his music and shows was welcomed, I love finding new music and shows.  However, it has become where it is always his preference.  He dictates every media outlet and I am starting to feel irritable.  I like music an hour or so a day but not 4+ hours after a long day at work and surely not music that isn't my favorite all the time.  I'll go turn it down while we are eating and he will turn it back up the second I leave.  I'll ask to play a few songs and he will oblige and after a few goes right back to dictating the playlist shortly after.  

And with food, he always has a few drinks after work and I am literally starving after i work out and he will keep pushing dinner to 9:00 PM so he can have a few drinks.  I legitimately get ""hangry"".  I eat healthy and work out - so when I am hungry at 7:00 it is genuine hunger.  I was going to make my own dinner a few times  to alleviate the problem and he kept pushing me to wait to eat with him.   He somewhat makes me feel like I am uptight and abnormal for sticking to a routine like this during the week.  He is very carefree and go with the flow every single day.  I love letting loose on the weekends, but I prioritize my work week nights so that I don't ever slack at work.

Some other issues are he never, and I mean never picks up after himself.  The few times I have been to his apartment it was a complete disaster.  So when he is over at my house I am also constantly picking up after him since I like a clean home.  This doesn't surprise me considering his attitude about schedules and eating and isn't a deal breaker to me completely as I like the idea of catering a little bit to a bf, but we spend almost every day together and it is wearing me down after a long day of work.  His schedule is about to be more hectic and I think we will see each other a lot less soon so maybe just having more time to myself will alleviate all these issues, but a part of me thinks that he just wants someone to mold to his life and not be a healthy 100/100 partnership.  

He made a comment too that he couldn't be alone ever, that he needs someone there to take care of him (in a joking manner), but I felt a lot of truth to that statement.  He usually has dated women in careers (only work 10-15 hours a week) that allowed this type of catering behavior. He finds my drive and hard work ethic really attractive and is very impressed with my job and ability to support myself.  He has never dated someone at the same level professionally.  I think he doesn't realize though, that I also don't have the energy to cater to someone else 24/7 and my job and hobbies keep me sane for the most part with a stressful job.  I feel like the parts he likes most about me also make us somewhat incompatible for the type of girl he wants to sit around and wait on him.  I know part of the problem is me and my need for control during the week, but I also think that he is being incredibly selfish with his wants and needs and criticizes the traits that have gotten me where I am today when it doesn't fit his schedule.  

I honestly like that he can be carefree and loose with his life and timing and wouldn't ask him to change to my style of living, but he doesn't allow me to live how I want to.  He just keeps trying to make me adapt to his lifestyle and gets fussy and critical when I really push for my priorities and timing for just myself.

,gorillaz,"Time for a Humanz review from me! My reception of this album is rather mixed. Some songs are great, some are pretty poor, but keep in mind I have strange and sometimes strong opinions on music, I mean not to come off as harsh towards anyone or anything. This was the first album I listened to entirely, as I didn't become a Gorillaz fan until about February of 2017. Overall I think one of the bigger problems here is the focus on showcasing other artists, which is something Damon agrees was a mistake. Another big issue is the order of songs, some of them sound worse when put back to back than when played alone. Let's begin with:


The Interludes 
This one has interludes! I really don't think they're all too necessary but they don't subtract from the album much. I think New World is a better intro than I Switched My Robot Off (to anyone who has Humanz on a playlist, try switching these two around) and Non-Comformist Oath goes into Submission well. I'm rating all of them as one here. 7/10.


Ascension 
And so we dive into Humanz. Ascension is our opener today, and I like the start of this one, the emergency sirens are foreboding and a bit spooky. And then the sky starts falling. First time I listened I didn't expect what I got, the hook, while fitting with this albums ""end of the world party"" theme, isn't something I like. Instrumentals are alright though, and they do fit with Vince's rap. I don't wanna keep you captive all night, so I won't go in depth to how I feel about this song's meaning, I will say that I like 2D's verse the most out of anything here. 6.5/10. 


Strobelite 
Now this I like much better. Very much a disco song. It's pretty fun and happy, a contrast to Ascension. Peven did a very good job as a vocalist here. The only thing about this one that bothers me is the length (a complaint I have for a portion of this album), it goes on about forty-five seconds longer than I feel it should. Overall though it's a nice jam, it's my girlfriend's favorite Gorillaz song and one of my favorites from Humanz. 8.5/10


Saturnz Barz 
Not a great transition from Strobelite (another problem I have) but that's not what I'm rating these off of. This is a bizzare song that I can't really categorize, but it's in no way a bad one. Popcaan and 2D sound amazing here, as does everything else really. It gets better and better as it goes on. One thing I need to say about this one is it feels like all the pieces fit so nicely together, that removing or changing anything about it gets rid of the feel. Saturnz Barz is perfect at what it does, it defies categorization and sounds excellent. 10/10. 


Momentz
Jesus Hamilton Christ on a pogo stick, where do I begin? I'm about to upset somebody, just a quick heads up. This track is bad. This track is rael bad. It's just a big mess to me, not coherent and it feels kinda forced. I know Damon and co. had fun with this one but it feels like Momentz was forced, like they made it because they knew another De La Soul collaboration was expected. It's a bit of a mess, some elements are too loud and make it even more unpleasant to get through (looking at you, Noodle) but overall there's nothing I find great or really redeeming at all. Might be my least favorite of the album. 3.5/10.


Submission
Now here's something else that's fun. I think the transition using the interlude is great, and I always play it before this. The arcade-y instruments are great, and my favorite part of this track. Not saying Kelela and Danny are bad, they are great too, though Danny's part doesn't exactly match the rest of the song. One of my favorites. 9/10. 


Charger
I've seen a lot of mixed views on this (well, I can say the same for most of Humanz) but I find it to be good overall. The hypnotic electric guitar, the kind of spooky feel, Grace Jones, all good. I have read somewhere that Grace Jones' lyrics were improvised, which makes them a little better to me, and kind of explains why she's a little bit away from the rest of the song up until the end. I also like their choice in guests, Grace's voice is kind of authoritative, commanding. 8/10. 


Andromeda
Damon gets the spotlight in this one, and he doesn't waste his time. Most everyone I've showed at least portions of Humanz to agree that this is their favorite off the album. Personally I can't pick one favorite but this is one of mine. I don't think D.R.A.M. being here for about fifteen seconds is justified but his version of the song is awesome too (see the end of this ramble for more on that). Not so complex instrumentals and a personal message can work really well, and here they do. When I heard what Damon wrote this one about my eyes got watery, something hardly any song has done to me. 9.5/10. 


Busted And Blue 
Our second Damon-centered song in Humanz. My first listen left me in a trance, but as I've listened to this more it's lost some of its power. I get a slow, somber and uncertain feeling from this. Oddly, Damon's lyrics are my least favorite thing here. Too many references to technology and the world changing aren't really my thing  (I was never a big fan of the song Everyday Robots). But it is Damon's thing, and he sounds good while doing it. 8/10. 


Carnival
Surprisingly short track here, I rather like this one. Some of the tracks on here do a good job of sounding spooky, and this is one of them. I like having Anthony here, even if it's only for a couple minutes. Because it's short I don't really have much more to say other than that it's overall good. A litttle better than the alternate version to me. 7.5/10.


Let Me Out 
Another song I find unsettling, more so than was probably intended. Don't care too much for Mavis, though I can't say she's bad, I'm just not big on her style. The whispering throughout the song reminds me of Del for some reason. Rip in recursion Del. I personally like the Banx &amp; Ranx remix better, but this is alright. 7/10. 


Sex Murder Party 
Jamie Principle really wants you to remember those three words. Back to the ""end of the world party"" theme of this album. Some people, if given the knowledge that life as they know it will soon end, would spend their last days alive with their loved ones. Some would prepare to try and survive, attempt to push an immovable barrier. Some would just have sex, murder and party. This song isn't as exciting as the prospect of all life disappearing. I find it monotonous, 2D's part is again abstract but not good (what's with his obsession over keys?) but being who I am, I will not try to analyse every line to find meaning. This is almost filler, an extra track put in to further extend the album. 4.5/10.  


She's My Collar 
Far better than the songs surrounding it, this is another real banger. Another contender for my favorite track. 2D's weird slant rhyming actually sounds great alongside the unusual beat. Unusual is a good word to describe this with. Great is as well, since it's both of these things. Kali sounds wonderful, by the way. 10/10.


Hallelujah Money 
The short of it: This is a Donald Trump diss track that ends with Spongebob going ""BWAAAAHAHAHAHH"" which made me laugh out loud. The long of it: This was one of the first Gorillaz songs I heard (shortly after release in January 2017) and the first time I heard it I got the impression that Gorillaz wrote music solely about politics. I'm not here to discuss politics so I won't go into my feelings on Trump, but I will say how I feel about this song. Benjamin's loose and flowing style combined with stiff, stagnant beats do not make for a good song. Benjamin isn't bad, he does a good job really, but this is another case of me not liking the style. I don't find the instrumentals to be pleasant on their own either This one goes about three minutes and twenty-three seconds too long. 4/10. 


We Got The Power 
I don't get what others are saying when they call this cheesy or annoying, this song is a good contrast to the album's overall messages and themes. It makes me feel excited, especially when it comes up in shuffle after I've listened to some of Gorillaz' dreary and sad songs. Noel Gallagher performing it live makes it even better. This song is confident and fun, I don't see much bad about it. 8/10. 


The Apprentice
Time to explore the deluxe side, starting here. I'll say now that The Apprentice is my favorite of all these deluxe tracks. Rag'n'Bone Man and RAY sharing the chorus is really nice. Zebra Katz coming in is alright, but the weakest part of the song to me. Only thing I could improve this with is if 2D joined the chorus at the end. This really should have been on the main album, even a single on the main album. 10/10. 


Halfway To The Halfway House 
Unpleasant. This is another wierd one that's wierd in all the wrong ways. I'm not gonna spend a lot of time griping, just checking boxes. Surreal? Check. Monotonous? Check. Bizzare lyrics? Check. Goes on and on? Check. Cherry-Aide? Check, check, check. Should have said this earlier but I'm sorry for being overly rude to Humanz, it didn't ask to be so varied in material category and quality. 4/10. 


Out Of Body
I had to rewrite this one three times because my feelings towards it changed quite a lot over time. This isn't just a case of poor quality or low effort (probably), it's more of a bad outcome. I see it like dripping hot sauce into chocolate milk (neither of those I'm a big fan of (some people question if even I'm human)) to add to the flavor, but you spill too much in there and having a crummy drink that you finish anyways because you don't want to waste all that chocolate milk. Nothing in here seems to compliment each other well. I see no good benefit in Imani and Zebra Katz having parts on here, they only drag this out even longer than it should be. Gorillaz has made wild and unusual songs before but most of them turn out way better. Beat kinda funky at times though. If I went with my first writing of this, I'd probably be scoring 2.5 at most, but let's just rate this and move on. 4/10.


Ticker Tape 
Nice, calming instrumentals. Unlike the previous track, 2D's parts are nice here, and Carly works well as a sort of narrator. Once we get to about the three-minute mark I kinda get bored for a bit, until Kali comes in. This one fails to keep me hooked the whole way through, and I find that every time I listen I lose some of my interest and never recover. If this track was about a minute and a half shorter or didn't have all. the. pauses. it would be better. 7/10. 


Circle Of Friendz 
Much like We Got The Power this one shows me a stormy sky with beams of sunlight shining through the gaps. It's a bit repetitious but doesn't stay around long enough to become grating. It's kind of like We Got The Power and Demon Days in that it's a closer with a different message than the rest of the album it's in, though I enjoy both of those a little more than this one. Overall not a bad ending to the album, but not a great one. 6.5/10.


In conclusion, this album ranges from amazing to upsetting, and can do so fairly quickly. I listen to Humanz in my own playlist under a new order, removing a couple of the bad songs, and that order makes it even better to me. 

ALBUM FAVORITE: Tie between She's My Collar, Saturnz Barz and The Apprentice. 

ALBUM LEAST FAVORITE: Momentz. I couldn't  enjoy this one if I tried to, it's just all over the place and not in a good way. 

ALBUM AVERAGE (rounded): 7

DIFFICULT TO LISTEN TO IN ALBUM ORDER: -0.5 

FINAL SCORE: 6.5 

BONUS: Garage Palace 
Another real jammer, unfortunately not part of the album. It kind of has that made on Damon's iPad in a few days feel, which isn't necessarily negative. Little Simz is great live, but the studio version sounds unenergized and bored, which is the worst thing about it. 7/10.

You asked for co-op games to play with Evan, here's a list of game names:  hand simulator, keep talking, nobody explodes , and a way out.

Add new cut-screens for when the LiveU Fs.

List of cut-screens: ([https://www.reddit.com/r/SamPepper/comments/938stj/list\_of\_fscreens\_to\_choose\_from\_so\_far\_regularly/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SamPepper/comments/938stj/list_of_fscreens_to_choose_from_so_far_regularly/))

Edit your main channel banner links for your social medias: the links don't direct to your new social media accounts (still not done yet).

Remind people of the LA Bird Meet-up (since it still has a while to go). It would be good to sticky the post closer to the event (since you can only sticky 2 posts at a time it seems). If needed, put multiple announcements in ONE post and just name that post ""UPDATES"" and sticky that post.

You unstickied your livestream youtube channel link from the subreddit. You can provide others with a link to it by changing the social media youtube link you have on the subreddit. The link you currently have is for your main channel but it should be for your second channel.

At least get a stand for your mic, with the minimum quality of the mic being a blue yeti

Get 4 more emotes for sponsors. Add discord memes for discord users. Add reddit flairs for reddit users.

The following emote packs can be used for youtube sponsors, for discord memes, and reddit flairs, this is constantly updated):

Emote Pack 1: ([https://www.reddit.com/r/SamPepper/comments/92xrpb/emote\_pack\_1\_completed\_comment\_which\_one\_you\_need/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SamPepper/comments/92xrpb/emote_pack_1_completed_comment_which_one_you_need/))

Get a discord tab for CX entertainment for viewers to post clips &amp; timestamps to help him pump out more highlights for people who miss streams. We also need better thumbnails to attract viewers, which can be posted in that tab.

List of good higlights missed so far:  vaping tricks, buying a car on craigslist, and like beginning, some clips, and ending of the coffin stream

We need a link for people to buy the 150$ bags (you said you're currently on it, probably a paypal link).

Add streamerbot to discord (ex. for "".cxnetwork"" function) and possibly a member's-only chat.

Do the Evan tinder shoot.

People want you to make sponsor streams PUBLIC but make the CHAT sponsor-only (attracts more viewers and sponsors).  That way your sponsors will be happy, and we can also have more PC streams.

Find a cheap car from craigslist to buy for the trip with Evan (you said you want around the range of 500$).

Work with Michael Reeves to for some sort of electronic device (ex. Robot Andy #2).

Install ublock origin ""adblock"". It will save the wasted time from ads on videos and allows for more viewer retention.

For streamlabs to work for liveu you need to get the liveu data to send to your PC then OBS etc to youtube for overlay to work. You can pay Jacob to setup it up or ask someone on discord for help.

Reaction playlist for you to react to (whenever): \[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7YJSrjC6GM&amp;list=PLzGYH9v8nDbmV6RevaPYVMhlcsMGLwLc0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7YJSrjC6GM&amp;list=PLzGYH9v8nDbmV6RevaPYVMhlcsMGLwLc0)\] (contains constantly updated old videos and new highlights)

React to Lil Bored's new video of blasphemousHD's reaction on you: \[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2I\_H3q\_\_tc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2I_H3q__tc)\]

React to Daily Dose of internet videos, DramaAlart videos, Scarce Videos, and LiveFails subreddit.

Incorporate both PC and IRL (maybe some gaming streams while on your PC, like playing Runescape on a new account just for shits and giggles or reactions for like 30 minutes before the IRL part).

Change the donation set-up so different donation amounts trigger different reactions from the TTS or on the screen (something you mentioned).

Make sure the camera is better set-up for the next Sam and Evan challenge (a better view than the coffin stream).

**Stream Ideas you still haven't done yet:**

You mentioned doing a TTS Henna Tattoo stream for a certain donation amount.

A sit down stream with Andy Milonakis discussing your issues with each other.

Pimp out the grandpa costume next time (ex. for a party).

24/7 Apartment Stream (recommended in the discord).

Grafitti stream (suggested on discord)

Bus  stream (suggested on discord)

Go Karting (suggested on discord)

Homeless stream for a few days (suggested on discord)

**Extras:**

Invite Lit Papi (Show Luciano) to a stream for the memes!

New challenge/task for the subreddit (for example, new meme of the day, video concept and you can feature it etc.)

Do a short 5-10 minute discord voice chat on stream where everyone talks so new people join it and also for the memes.

It's good to have cameos: call an old friend on stream, Evan as usual, someone from the CX network (example: crazy Erin), Lit Papi etc.

Reddit Recap every stream.

Regularly join discord VC (when possible).

Sam and Evan combined streams weekly (ex. a weekly challenge, like biking, running, getting pushed on a cart, etc.)

Clickbait an event for you channel (ex. like UFCx2, you can clickbait the moon eclipse, or any popular event to attract new viewers outside of Cx).

Have a suggestions tab on discord for possible stream ideas (many people on discord mentioned wanting it).

Reddit Recap every stream.

Regularly join discord VC (when possible).

Sam and Evan combined streams weekly (ex. a weekly challenge, like biking, running, getting pushed on a cart, etc.)

Clickbait an event for you channel (ex. like UFCx2, you can clickbait the moon eclipse, or any popular event to attract new viewers outside of Cx).

Have a suggestions tab on discord for possible stream ideas (many people on discord mentioned wanting it).

Games to play if there's a short wait before IRL stream: Runescape for the first time \[[Runescape.com](https://runescape.com/)\], Short games \[[https://miniclip.com/](https://miniclip.com/)\], Multiplayer short games that can be interactive with chat \[[http://iogames.space/](http://iogames.space/)\], any sort of game that people suggest in chat as well.

Maybe record some gaming content for cut-screen so people don't get bored.",t2_16qr3f65,,,0,,List of Errands/Reminders for Sam (regularly updated) (everything mentioned from the last stream added and removed everything that you already did from this list),"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'SUGGESTION'}]",r/SamPepper,False,,,,,,False,,False,light,,,public,,,{},,a2c249e2-9c38-11e8-a32a-0e98e01e6e22,False,,,False,False,,{},SUGGESTION,False,1,,,,self,1533215956.0,POLEflair,[],,,True,,,richtext,,,,text,self.SamPepper,,,,,,,False,True,True,False,False,,,False,8aea2aa2-4d09-11e8-b888-0ea72814b416,True,False,False,,,,,,,t5_2zkbq,,,,#0aa18f,93ort8,,,We_Broke_Up,,0,True,,False,,,dark,/r/SamPepper/comments/93ort8/list_of_errandsreminders_for_sam_regularly/,,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/SamPepper/comments/93ort8/list_of_errandsreminders_for_sam_regularly/,4300,1533128652.0,0,,False,,self,,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'aSbctnYGMgKVUnXeXxzcHp7OGySbGDg512xIMVHrVag', 'resolutions': [{'height': 81, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/43O-QuG9we60iyHziwS4OQnfvRcSMgLV5sICT_-0t0w.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=ea4ebf23ffd13a43bfce56022d6935ef', 'width': 108}, {'height': 162, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/43O-QuG9we60iyHziwS4OQnfvRcSMgLV5sICT_-0t0w.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=c128e5b143d2571c13add2cb158490ec', 'width': 216}, {'height': 240, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/43O-QuG9we60iyHziwS4OQnfvRcSMgLV5sICT_-0t0w.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=1eb31216e254bc9b274c1c2bb4b6dbd3', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/43O-QuG9we60iyHziwS4OQnfvRcSMgLV5sICT_-0t0w.jpg?s=8e46dcbae3c6ce86efde613eb49b91bb', 'width': 480}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,1523607923.0,1536693622.0,,,
,leagueoflegends,"Hey y'all! LoL BR has shared 17 playlists on Spotify, each for 17 different champions. It's a little thing called ""Your Vibe"" that compares the songs you have on your Spotify with those in their playlists, then tells you with which champion you share the same musical style, almost like a personality quiz but for music. The original can be found [here](https://suavibe.br.leagueoflegends.com/), but it's in portuguese and currently down due to heavy traffic. I thought I should share it with reddit, so I collected all the playlists and translated their flavour text the best I could. Enjoy!

&amp;nbsp;

[Blitzcrank](https://open.spotify.com/user/riotgamesbrasil/playlist/28w4DaqUyakx5CsfCJy9U7): Every technological breakthrough starts somewhere. The first attempt can be a shock - and if you're not afraid to try the new (while recognizing the classics), this Blitzrank-worthy selection brings the beginnings of electronic music!

&amp;nbsp;

[Heimerdinger](https://open.spotify.com/user/riotgamesbrasil/playlist/5NNWEioGj1H5CGiOrVYUUE): Technology advances at a frenetic pace just like Heimerdinger - and he who doesn't go with the flow stays behind...but that's not your case, of course. It's as if you were born to master the dance floor (or DJ booth).

&amp;nbsp;

[Jayce](https://open.spotify.com/user/riotgamesbrasil/playlist/6Jz8JwixxDSCIzUnjIuJ23): Jayce never stops researching - maybe it's a good idea to leave a more relaxing sound in the background...also recommended for studying, working, or even hanging out at home. Go on, we won't judge.

&amp;nbsp;

[Mordekaiser](https://open.spotify.com/user/riotgamesbrasil/playlist/5A7EmsM4vSvjgMyOdYcGyu): Glory be to Mordekaiser! Amp it up to 12 and let Noxus' Cursed Revenant invade your eardrums with all the power and fury of classic heavy metal...Yes, you only need to click Play ONCE.

&amp;nbsp;

[Draven](https://open.spotify.com/user/riotgamesbrasil/playlist/028GsXlUnv00zZgvkrIEKR): You're like Draven: pure style. Everyon knows when you've arrived in the area - always. Whether for the confetti cannons, spotlights or fireworks, your place is in the arenas and mega stadiums - just like the hard rock stars. SHINE BRIGHT, STAR!

&amp;nbsp;

[Darius](https://open.spotify.com/user/riotgamesbrasil/playlist/6DZ3Pd2XNqGS1msSgMxvwC): You're one of those people that makes whoever see you walking on the sidewalk cross the street. Your very presence puts fear in the crowd and you won't tolerate clowning. With you, that's how it is: brutal like Darius, without fear or regrets.

&amp;nbsp;

[Viktor](https://open.spotify.com/user/riotgamesbrasil/playlist/0d5Rj52KrstmMcsMwVE2m7): Nowadays, we live with machines around us - some people more than others. You are viktor (or are you?), but the hammering of industrial music and the likes will prepare you for the Glorious Evolution.

&amp;nbsp;

[Amumu](https://open.spotify.com/user/riotgamesbrasil/playlist/7HVlHdBkRdmkGcOByy9YQ7): Does the real world make you want to cry? Does no one understand you? Is there  a lack of respect, love and comprehension in this cruel world? Amumu, the Sad Mummy, could be your soul mate.  There is no shame in letting the tears roll.

&amp;nbsp;

[Poppy](https://open.spotify.com/user/riotgamesbrasil/playlist/0ZdfMzGeIQs78JkjxiZRt7): Why be just like everyone else when you can have your own style? Sometimes, getting off the beaten path leads to different - and exciting - experiences. Poppy has already explored much of this world, and what is not lacking is alternatives.

&amp;nbsp;

[Tristana](https://open.spotify.com/user/riotgamesbrasil/playlist/1t7rBvMUkjsucqkI3kQRrb): So, you've always preffered a different sound than what the radios try to push down your throat? ""Well, well"", Tristana would say.

&amp;nbsp;

[Vi](https://open.spotify.com/user/riotgamesbrasil/playlist/7MxKHifjkamomEH3RQLrtp): You're here to stay. Be like Vi and don't take it home - let alone let people tell you what you can't do. And you can be sure the gang is with you.

&amp;nbsp;

[Jhin](https://open.spotify.com/user/riotgamesbrasil/playlist/6FoZp8fsWjtvPe6UMB18xe): There's beauty in the sound of the strings...in the blow of the woodwinds...in the thunder and march of percussion. Appreciating the pomp of an orchestra is for a few people, like Jhin, the Virtuoso.

&amp;nbsp;

[Lux](https://open.spotify.com/user/riotgamesbrasil/playlist/05PFXeknFLqe6EELTmGtNW): You have an inner light that makes you have a glow of your own. It reminds a certain Demacian girl...except that, unlike her, you do not have to hide your magic. Your charisma makes you the most popular person wherever you go!

&amp;nbsp;

[Ahri](https://open.spotify.com/user/riotgamesbrasil/playlist/4CyfYT7yd7YetrMpleMULj): You have a kind of charisma that does not look the part of the ones you live with. Sometimes, you think you were born in the wrong place - and like Ahri, they see you with a certain...exoticism, you know? You know what they say: those who hear not the music think the dancers mad.

&amp;nbsp;

[Ekko](https://open.spotify.com/user/riotgamesbrasil/playlist/2KGLf9anfpJ9LsXKAj8l6V): You are in tune with the reality of the streets. Your wit can get you out of the biggest trouble, even if you can't rewind to the past like Ekko - after all, time is not a turntable for you to scratch.

&amp;nbsp;

[Yasuo](https://open.spotify.com/user/riotgamesbrasil/playlist/5ZiAX5Spd2CjdBmwMYyhM6): Just like Yasuo, you've seen a lot in this life, always learning - both by self-effort and by listening to the voice of experience. For that reason, there's some extra wit in your eyes...

&amp;nbsp;

[Kled](https://open.spotify.com/user/riotgamesbrasil/playlist/7cKzCWV0BFAiyRwEniftVp): Big city? Pfff! Get out! With you, it's this way: on the back of the mount, crossing green fields, dry lands, the sun on your head, and the life on the farm. Just like Kled - though we hope your sanity is preserved. Meanwhile...HOLD ON, COWBOY! 
&gt;Kled's playlist consists of brazilian country music, just so you know.

,CruciblePlaybook,"&gt;With the release of Update 1.2.3, we introduced 6v6 Quickplay with a bug that causes skill-matching and potentially connection-matching to fail in that playlist. This results in much faster – but lower-quality – matches than normal. Our plan for the immediate future is to take no immediate action, monitor the health of the playlist, take notes, and ready a potential fix. We will inform the community with our findings and if we make a change, you will be the first to know (just like this time).

&gt;No planned changes to Quickplay Matchmaking in Hotfix 1.2.3.1.

&gt;Check out the post- we are in the process of monitoring the health of the playlist and the Crucible as a whole. Won’t be taking action without transparency.

DMG, [Source](https://mobile.twitter.com/A_dmg04/status/1023624665028157440).

I like playing with people at all skill levels, but my experience of teams being constructed with extreme ELO imbalances on one side on a consistent basis means that I’m either being stomped or stomping. I’m either below 1 KDA or over 3. I’ve seen more matches called early since 6v6 QP than my entire time playing D2.

I personally don’t find this fun. Even when I’m playing a casual match, I want a little bit of a challenge. I want some push back. I’d much rather lose by 1 pt and throw my hands up at the end and furiously type “gg” in team chat rather than win by 50.

Stomping doesn’t make you a better player. It doesn’t force me to improve my game. Being stomped frustrates new players and doesn’t even give them a chance to “git gud.” It’s like throwing someone in the deep end and telling them they don’t need to start in the shallow area because they’ll never “git gud.”",t2_9s7nf,,,0,,Let’s clear up some disinformation.

Edit your main channel banner links for your social medias: the links don't direct to your new social media accounts (still not done yet).

Remind people of the LA Bird Meet-up (since it still has a while to go). It would be good to sticky the post closer to the event (since you can only sticky 2 posts at a time it seems). If needed, put multiple announcements in ONE post and just name that post ""UPDATES"" and sticky that post.

You unstickied your livestream youtube channel link from the subreddit. You can provide others with a link to it by changing the social media youtube link you have on the subreddit. The link you currently have is for your main channel but it should be for your second channel.

,CruciblePlaybook,"Crucible Labs was back this week with a new gamemode, Lockdown. If you didn't get the chance to try it out, let me run you through how it plays. Each game goes up to 3 rounds. There are 3 zones (with the same positions as control), and the objective is to capture and hold 2 zones to gain points (or progress) up to 100%, once you get to 100% you win the round. HOWEVER, you can also win a round by triple capping all 3 zones at the same time. *No matter the point deficit, if you control all 3 zones at once, you win the round.* That last point right there is the important part of what makes this gamemode so good.

To give some context, my competitive background in gaming comes from Gears of War. I played competitively from the beginning of Gears 2 all the way to the end of Gears UE. With the introduction of Gears 4, a new gamemode was introduced that was ""designed for eSports."" That gamemode was called 'Escalation', and it changed the competitive landscape of the game. It plays the exact same way that Lockdown does now, with the exception that in Escalation you gain points even if you only control one zone as opposed to Lockdown. If you keep up with Gears at all, you'll know that Escalation is almost singlehandedly responsible for the eSports scene growing as much as it has. Before that gamemode was introduced, the competitive scene consisted of Execution which was basically D1 Elimination, and King of the Hill. Those gamemodes are fun in and of themselves, but they aren't inherently the most competitive. In Execution, a typical game would consist of one team getting the first kill, and then playing as passive as they had to in order to win the round by life advantage. King of the Hill had an objective, but the problem was that when you capped that objective, you had to do nothing else but sit and defend. Both of those create very one-dimensional gameplay, that isn't fun to watch or play if you aren't on the winning side.

Even if you wanted to play those gamemodes the way they were intended to be played, the *optimal* way to play is was to   
do what I just described, and in a competitive environment optimal is the name of the game. Escalation eliminated those issues entirely, and I believe that Lockdown eliminates those same issues that plague Destiny 2's competitive landscape.

Here are some clutch moments that happened to me while playing this week:

* My team came back from a 2-0 deficit by triple capping two rounds in a row by strategically using our supers for a team wipe
* I lost many rounds due to a bait-and-switch where someone would pop a super at a point they knew they could get by themselves, stack three at the point they needed to cap, and win the round
* I rushed the last zone my team needed to capture to win the round with two guardians there, knowing if I won that 2v1 we'd take the round (I did and it was glorious)
* Hilariously, I also used Fists of Havoc on a point with a full team alive just to try and get the triple cap since I knew they wouldn't push me

In Lockdown, there is always someplace for you to be moving. If you only have one zone, you have to go cap another or you lose the round. You leave A to go cap C, the enemy team leaves C to go cap A, the cycle repeats until someone figures out how to get the upper hand. You can't just sit back with power ammo, or hold hands with your team to win. If a team wants to stare down a lane and teamshot, fine, but they're losing C while they're too busy staring at A. You can camp power ammo, but you put yourself open to losing one, or both, of your zones and losing that round instantly. There are no dull moments (between balanced teams anyways) in this gamemode. I say that from my experience this week playing Lockdown, and almost 2 years of playing Escalation in Gears. 

Lockdown as a competitive mode has the edge over Countdown and Survival in every way imo. In Countdown, the only objective in the game doesn't even come into play if the team in control doesn't want it to, and that can create some pretty stale games when the team that should be planting the bomb, just goes for kills instead. Countdown has the *potential* to be a great competitive gamemode, but from my experience seeing the way it's actually played, it isn't. Survival on the other hand doesn't even have an objective. In essence, it's not different from Clash except for the lack of radar. Just think back to how many times while playing Survival you've gotten a kill and heard a teammate call ""we've got life advantage, play your life."" That can get boring, and in my experience playing Lockdown extensively this week, I never ran into any of those issues. The only time I felt a match was out of reach was when I had a teammate leave. Even when we're down 94%-8% I know that if we play smart we can win that round. If a team wants to stand back and farm the other team, or camp power ammo, they can't win that way because the optimal way to play the gamemode is exactly the way it was intended to be played. You play the objective.

As far as improvements that I think could be made, there is only one that stands out to me, and that's the zone placement. Lockdown will unfortunately suffer from the same issues that some Control maps do (I'm looking at you Emperors Respite), in that one team has an inherent advantage with their spawns based on the way the zones are placed. I didn't run into this issue myself as I never hit one of those unbalanced maps (the closest I did play was on Distant Shore, but the zone imbalance between A and C spawn there didn't seem to be an issue.) I believe that if Bungie is able to rectify that problem, Lockdown is nearly perfect technically speaking.

I don't know how much differently it would play without radar in the competitive playlist, but I can't see any reason to not make this gamemode the competitive Destiny 2 offering. It has every element that makes a good competitive gamemode, and on top of that it's just damn fun. I hope you guys have enjoyed it this week as much as I have, and I look forward to catching you guys in the crucible! Thank you Bungie for such an awesome gamemode.",t2_lvwmggd,,,0,,Why Lockdown is the future of Competitive Crucible,[],r/CruciblePlaybook,False,6.0,,,,,False,,False,dark,,,public,,,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},,False,161,,,,self,False,,[],,,True,,,text,6.0,,,text,self.CruciblePlaybook,,,,,,,False,False,True,False,False,,,False,,True,False,False,,,,,,,t5_37lup,,,,,93e3fv,,,criggles_,,37,True,all_ads,False,,,,/r/CruciblePlaybook/comments/93e3fv/why_lockdown_is_the_future_of_competitive_crucible/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/CruciblePlaybook/comments/93e3fv/why_lockdown_is_the_future_of_competitive_crucible/,42363,1533040602.0,0,,False,,,,,,,,1511461138.0,1536688203.0,,,

,Drugs,"So a friend wanted to try MDMA then 2CB for the first time and offered me the chance to join him. He's an experienced psychonaut who had done it the other way before and was left ""hanging"" on the MDMA come down.

Having only known the buzz/high of alcohol, amphetamine and weed and no real knowledge of the effects of these substances I thought, annoyed, ""Why so long?... And all the way over there? For what??..."" when he suggested we rent a cabin home in some quiet woods for 3 nights.

It seemed like such a waste of money/effort just to get high for 3-5 hours, but he kept re-enforcing that it was going to be ""so fucking great."" I just naively said ""ok.""

So I drove us over 2 hours to the place. We came with food and he set us up some blankets and a Tycho playlist and got to planning our doses. I came fasted as he suggested and chose a larger dose for my body weight/first time.

Around 6pm he showed me how to test the substances which were in powdered form and we took some helpful supplements for jaw clenching and brain protection.

An hour later we did a toast, said a statement of intent to set to the atmosphere and drank the MDMA in water.

We moved to the couches and did 4 sets of Wim Hof breathing followed by a guided meditation with Sam Harris. We sat in peaceful silence for few minutes then got the fireplace going before moving back to the table to talk.

About 45 minutes in I felt a cool rising sensation at the base of my skull that got my attention. Kind of like the feeling on your skin when you slowly, barely graze a few hairs. Except it was gently buzzing and slooowly flowing, stretching, upward like a bubble in a lava-lamp wrapping around the inside of my skull, coating every inch of my brain.

I just sat in silence, observing with no preconception of where it would go or what would happen. I told my friend something had started happening so we moved to the couches to chill out.

I remember the wonderful feeling of the gradual come up and the intense bliss and joy as I peaked while listening to ""Glider"" with my eyes closed.

By now that head sensation had turned to a tight squeeze on the sides of my head and a buzzing feeling so high frequency you could barely make out the undulations. I kept catching myself clamping my jaw down hard from the intensity. My head felt heavy and would sway like a pendulum if I let it.  I melted into my seat.  My mind was fucking blown.

I felt compelled to smile, really smile, wide, in a way I hadn't done in years and felt overwhelming gratitude.  I thanked my friend.  He laughed ""You're very welcome!"" since he knew I'd take to it so well.  We started to chat and describe our experiences.

I was saddened when he said he wasn't experiencing anything physical that I was because I couldn't imagine a better feeling. I remember being able to actually fuzzily make out and feel each half of my brain as ridiculous as that sounds.

Instead he said it was like this good emotion and warmth flowing out from his chest in all directions to his limbs. I had a really tough time trying to imagine it.  It seemed like a tamer experience, but given his love of MDMA maybe I'm the one missing out.

We did a redose and eventually starting coming down from it about 4 hours in then decided to take the first 2CB dose when things got weird.

While on the way back up, with the same head sensations intensifying as on MDMA I started noticing a slowly rising pleasurable sensation in my crotch, especially my limp member. Once again, not knowing what was happening I just observed.

Slowly and surely it rose closer and closer to the Point of No Return except that when it finally brought me to a boiling climax where I should have ejaculated, the 2CB just kept me there, stuck in an intense, completely steady, drawn out feeling of blowing-my-load like I had never experienced.

At the same time on the way up, I felt this somewhat pleasurable burning/aching all around and in my crotch as well as the back of my brain near the base. Similar in feeling to the itchy/burning/soreness of a recovering muscle when pressed down on hard and massaged days after a weight training session to failure, except 2-3x stronger.

This sensation continued while I closed my eyes and began to experience a constant stream of a kaleidoscope of images and shapes that would morph into things I could recognize, linger for 2 seconds then zoom and fade towards me before being replaced by another set of images.

The images were superimposed on black just like when you stare at a light and close your eyes and see the shifting glow of the shape of the object. Everything was normal with my eyes open.  The only color I saw were about 3 spiraling sparks of green about as small as a dime at arms length for a second.

I saw things like hexagrams morphing into upside down pentagrams that flowed into each other with a demonic eye in the middle, to then the outline of a church, grass, and fence, to two naked women one pushing the other down about to kiss, in this back and forth play of themes.

I don't remember many images because I recognized them so late before they faded since they appeared in random spots in my periphery.  On top of this I was in a weird dream-like state, where I was fully conscious to where I could snap out of it at anytime I wanted and get up, but as soon as I would close my eyes and relax, fell back into feeling like not being all there. My distracting crotch wasn't helping either.

I told my friend what was going on and he got worried. He suggested maybe to try to go jack it off. I went into the bathroom and grabbed hold of it and experienced the most curious feeling.

I could feel my fingers wrapped around my knob, and the normal/non-sexual sensations of that, but at the same time felt like there was another distinct thing there which was experiencing the orgasm. Almost like a phantom limb. A phantom cock.

I couldn't get hard no matter how much I tried. I tried to both put aside the feeling of orgasm as a separate thing and concentrate, which I was somewhat able to do, or try to work with the feeling. All the plumbing was off, but every bit of flesh was innervated.

Physically, I felt sooooo fucking good, but that was it. The MDMA had long worn off so I had the bodily sensations without the uplifting euphoria. I started to get really irritated and the trip began becoming negative for me. I wanted relief from the feeling of relief.

Eventually, the 2CB started to wear off and the pleasure slowly tapered off with it. I wasn't happy, but I had calmed down some and just felt neutral about the experience at this point when my friend asked if I was ready for a redose.

Against better judgement, determined to finish the race I said yes. He said he wanted to try and snort it this time and asked how i'll be taking it. I said I would too. I had never snorted anything before.

My friend rolled up a sheet of paper and went at it, gently getting a bit in each nostril, then started lining up the remaining powder which I assumed he weighed.  He had eyeballed it.  I grabbed the the paper roll, quickly lined it up and deeply inhaled just as he said something to the effect of ""you might want to ju..""

He just looked at me surprised and blurted ""that was a shit load of 2CB"".  I gave him a shit eating grin, until my nasal cavity and throat began to burn. The next 45 minutes combined the physical sensations of a head in a vice, a perpetual orgasm, and tiny shards of glass in my sinuses.

Eventually everything slowly got better. The burning stopped which was such a relief on its own that the rest of the experience was tolerable as I got used to it until the final come down.

Some 9 or 10 hours in we went to sleep, woke up, had breakfast and hung out the next day. Taking a day to decompress and reflect was definitely the right way to go before returning to the mundane.  I'm also glad we didn't do it close to a noisy area.  Only the pure sound of music or silence filled the space.

Things were normal except after 2 months, anytime I would consume caffeine and sugar, like a small black coffee and a chocolate glazed donut, I'd get a strong 2CB-like come up with the head sensations and innervated crotch, sometimes leaving me intoxicatedly wanting to cum.  Sometimes it would just randomly happen while sitting.

That was consistent behavior for a solid month, but has died down. Rarely does it happen now, usually while sitting and very mildly at that.

I'm not sure I learned anything profound from the experience other than 2CB is a hell of a drug.",t2_1n7uwyni,,,0,,Did MDMA/2CB for the first time and orgasmed for 4 hours,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Long Post'}]",r/Drugs,False,3.0,Custom,,,,False,,False,dark,,,public,,,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},Long Post,False,69,,,,self,1532999380.0,,[],,,True,,,richtext,3.0,,,text,self.Drugs,,,,confidence,,,False,False,True,False,False,,,False,,True,False,False,,,,,,,t5_2qh7l,,,,,935pej,,,complete_chaos,,29,True,promo_adult_nsfw,False,,,,/r/Drugs/comments/935pej/did_mdma2cb_for_the_first_time_and_orgasmed_for_4/,promo_adult_nsfw,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/935pej/did_mdma2cb_for_the_first_time_and_orgasmed_for_4/,446319,1532969176.0,0,,False,,,,,,,,1529941748.0,1536684204.0,,,

,DestinyTheGame,"Bungie, *this* is how you make a Competitive game mode. I love how much focus, strategy and team coordination goes into each decision and play. The ability to bounce back and instantly win a round after being down by potentially 90+ percent is great too. It allows for teams to quickly switch tactics on the fly and still come out with a clutch win. Every single point contention can make a gigantic difference in the match, giving every player some incredible hero moments.

Having infinite respawns also lets players be more aggressive when pushing for zones, making for more exciting gameplay. But the timers are long enough to make sure each death is still punished accordingly.

This mode gives me some nice Halo 3 Territories vibes and I love it.

,popheads,"Y'all. I'm shooketh. This post is gonna cover Alec Benjamin, currently known for his recent song [""Let Me Down Slowly"".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50VNCymT-Cs) 

Let me preface this by saying that this post was wholly inspired by u/cihfnrfi's post from 5 months ago [about Bazzi being an industry plant.](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/7z16jx/i_was_right_bazzi_is_an_industry_plant/) Also, I want to make it clear that this is not a takedown post of Alec, whom I've actually been a fan of since he released ""End of the Summer"" in 2016. I just thought it was weird that he's suddenly gaining momentum almost over night after releasing ""Let Me Down Slowly"". So I finally did a little digging last night and I felt like Nev from Catfish after finding out some info.

Here's what I found out:

* Alec Benjamin’s music is currently being published by [Warner/Chappell Music.](http://www.warnerchappell.com/artist-details/76) If you look at the copyright info for the ""Let Me Down"" music video on YouTube, it's licensed by WMG (Warner Music Group) on behalf of Atlantic Records. But if you look at the [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/2uaiyLKnYvazyfR0Ky3Kbk) or [Apple Music links](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/let-me-down-slowly-single/1386999436) for the song, there's just a ""2018"" label without any reference to the publisher or licensor. This is the same case as to what happened to Bazzi's songs.
* He's [opening for Camila Cabello on her current tour for a few dates,](https://twitter.com/AlecBenjamin/status/1023324587784720384) just like [Bazzi did previously.](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8351074/bazzi-chartbreaker-mine-interview) I also find it strange that Alec has been and is very vocal about being signed &amp;amp; dropped from Columbia Records 2 years ago, yet doesn't mention at all that he's currently signed to Warner.
* As of July 26, his new single [""If We Have Each Other""](https://open.spotify.com/track/2yQbzfcs28JrjKqxqAboEg) is on [Spotify's New Music Friday playlist,](https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX4JAvHpjipBk) which has over 2.75 million followers. The song still doesn't have any copyright info on it besides the year ""2018"". 

Anyways, I just wanted to do this to find a reason for Alec's sudden meteoric rise, so I can explain it to myself. Just thought I'd pass the info I found along to y'all. And he's the next artist to be pushed in an ""indie"" vein after Bazzi, I mean they're basically labelmates under Warner. So Imma end this by saying that next time you think you're discovering an indie artist on Spotify's playlist, look up info on them to make sure you're not fooled. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk. P.S. - [""Paper Crowns""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzmjdntlRJk) is the OG bop.

Edit: I’ve been told by u/kelleyfox that his music is actually being published Warner Chappell and that it’s not a label so I made that correction.",t2_ni0nr,,,0,,"The Industry Plant Strikes Again!

Felt amazing afterward.  No I’m not a gym rat, I try to go a healthy amount but stopped for months because of the breakup.  Last night I was too tired to stay up thinking about her.  Woke up feeling worlds better.  Is she still in my mind? Yes.  Do I still get the pain in my gut? Yes.  But it doesn’t hurt so bad today waking up.

,weddingplanning,"My wedding is in 70 days and I still do not have a dj or officiant . 

For no charge, I am able to use the venue’s sound system. The sound engineer is also volunteering his services to run the equipment, set up, and tear down. The ONLY dj in the area I can find wants to charge me $700 for the day. This seems insane to me!! I’m not saying it’s a worthless service, but I’m basically paying him $100 an hour to push play on his laptop ffs. Does this seem like an unreasonable quote to you guys??

Is it such a horrible idea to just give my sound engineer like $150 to play dj for the night with a playlist?? 

He is a friend but has no experience. I’m really nervous about making playlists for some reason! 

As far as an officiant, my fiancé has always envisioned one of his childhood friends marrying us. Unfortunately this friend couldn’t commit. Now, he says he can’t see any other friends doing it. But the officiant wants $300. We aren’t religious and it seems like we could just print off a speech on the inter webs and have one of our charismatic friends do it. There are no requirements for officiants in my state. 

I’d probably have both of these vendors paid already, but neither accepts credit cards and I don’t even own checks lol. Who doesn’t take credit cards these days !! The only benefit to this hugely expensive endeavor has been the number of miles We’ve accumulated. (and I guess being married to the love of my life, and seeing everyone i love in the same room for probably the only time ever will be pretty cool) 

How did weddings you’ve attended with no professional dj or officiant go ?

m so SOO close to throwing both in the fuck it bucket. I need advice! Talk me down!

by retardfag69

""I've never done this before,"" Randy whispered as he placed his trembling hand on Cranberry's fat, white tits. Cranberry noticed Randy was nervous and got it in her mind she was going to make him feel more at home. She put her ring laden fingers on Randy's and delicately guided him to her road weary vagina.

""You never been with a lady, you mean?""

Randy snapped his hand back and put them deep in his pockets. ""Come on, honey, why you shoving your fists in those pockets when my nasty wet pocket is begging for 'em.""

""My w-h-h-ole fist?"" Randy stuttered and backed away. ""I just, I- I've been with ladies before. I'm not a virgin, if that's what you're implying. I've just never been with a, a pro-person, like yourself.""

""You can say it. I'm a legal hooker. I fuck men for money. It's alright and I'm not ashamed of it."" Cranberry grabbed Randy by his pants zipper and pulled him towards her heart shaped bed. ""I can tell you real horny. What's your name?""

""My name? My name is...well...my name is Monad.""

""Oh, alright, Monad. Mind if I call you Randy?""

""Wait, what? How? Uh, that's fine. It's not my name, though. So don't be surprised if you say it and I act like you're talking to someone else.""

""OK, Randy.""

""Oh cool are we having a threesome because you clearly are talking to someone in addition to me, Monad. Weird. Well, I'm not really into that, so I'm think I'm going to bounce.""

Cranberry rose off her bed, which was stiff from years of hard earned cum and relieving period blood. She could tell he was a gentle soul. ""Hey google, play slow dancing music,"" said Cranberry. ""OK, playing 'Slow Dance Date' playlist on Spotify,"" said the google home sitting on the dresser between two opened boxes of condoms, one extra large size, the other extra small.

""I know you're a good man,"" Cranberry whispered in Randy's ear. ""I can also tell you' full of old space cum.""

""What? Just who the fuck are you and how do you know all this?"" Randy yelled, violently pushing Cranberry to the ground.

Cranberry didn't get up.


 Randy heard a knock at the door and from behind it a voice of a man they had just met. ""Randy. This is Ryebro. We met just a moment ago, in line. Are you almost done with Cranberry? I've got some new moves I want to try on her specifically. They're sure to have cranberry's juice covering the walls.""

""Oh god. God. God no."" Randy cracked the door just enough to see Ryebro. ""I need...something happened. I didn't mean to do it. Can I trust you?""

""Oh, you can trust me. Whatever it is.""

Randy panicked and opened the door and Ryebro entered and slammed it closed. Ryebro's eyes sparkled as he saw Cranberry's lifeless, naked body on the floor.  ""Oh Randy, the moment I saw you in line, I knew we were the same. I just didn't realize *how* we were the same.""

During the last stream, someone donated for the revenge giveaway but the stream F'd, his user is:( u/Josearreola760 )

Edit your main channel banner links for your social medias: the links don't direct to your new social media accounts (still not done yet).

Remind people of the LA Bird Meet-up (since it still has a while to go). It would be good to sticky the post closer to the event (since you can only sticky 2 posts at a time it seems). If needed, put multiple announcements in ONE post and just name that post ""UPDATES"" and sticky that post.

You unstickied your livestream youtube channel link from the subreddit. You can provide others with a link to it by changing the social media youtube link you have on the subreddit. The link you currently have is for your main channel but it should be for you second channel.

At least get a stand for your mic, with the minimum quality of the mic being a blue yeti

Get 4 more emotes for sponsors: New Sam emote,  F-ing emote, Vape emote, and one more emote (if you say which ones you want I can edit them personally).

Add streamerbot to discord (ex. for "".cxnetwork"" function) and possibly a member's-only chat.

Do the Evan tinder shoot.

Enable ""adaptive bitrate"" on LiveU for when the stream F's, so it can at least play at lower quality until the stream fixes.

People want you to make sponsor streams PUBLIC but make the CHAT sponsor-only (attracts more viewers and sponsors).  That way your sponsors will be happy, and we can also have more PC streams.

Add a special flair to your reddit username, so everyone can recognize it's you.

Find a cheap car from craigslist to buy for the trip with Evan (you said you want around the range of 500$).

Get Michael Reeves to collaborate with you to form some form of electronic device (ex. Robot Andy #2).

Install ublock origin ""adblock"". It will save the wasted time from ads on videos and allows for more viewer retention.

For streamlabs to work for liveu you need to get the liveu data to send to your PC then OBS etc to youtube for overlay to work. You can pay Jacob to setup it up or ask someone on discord for help.

Incorporate both PC and IRL (maybe some gaming streams while on your PC, like playing Runescape on a new account just for shits and giggles or reactions for like 30 minutes before the IRL part).

Change the donation set-up so different donation amounts trigger different reactions from the TTS or on the screen (something you mentioned).

Add a cut-scene image or trailer for your LiveU like Evan, ONLY if the stream Fs really hard  (cpost something like ""be right back"". Viewers and Cx entertainment can work together to make it). We can add best reddit posts, discord memes, etc. to advertise those links. You can also use it as an intro for your streams or stick to a random music video playing as usual.

Extras:

Invite Lit Papi (Show Luciano) to a stream for the memes!

New challenge/task for the subreddit (for example, new meme of the day, video concept and you can feature it etc.)

Do a short 5-10 minute discord voice chat on stream where everyone talks so new people join it and also for the memes.

It's good to have cameos: call an old friend on stream, Evan as usual, someone from the CX network (example: crazy Erin), Lit Papi etc.

,wow,"**Welcome!**

First and foremost, Welcome (Back) to the game. \*\*This is absolutely a great time to come back/start the game.\*\* I have seen a lot of new people either starting out or returning to the game and in an effort to help our community grow, I wanted to write out a short compilation of information. This will be a long read, possibly bathroom material, but I hope it helps some of you.  I have played since Vanilla, starting a little after the honor system was introduced, so I am hoping I can help explain some of the changes since people last played. If you need extra help in game or just someone to chat/play with, please feel free to add me Magnanimoto#1983. On that note, if you are returning since the Battle net change, you can still add people to your friendslist from your server, but also by account. As always, have fun an enjoy the game. 

**What’s New?**

Depending on when you last played, there are a lot of different changes that effect how the game works. Dailys have been replaced with something called World Quests. Imagine random daily quests that require you to traverse the different zones to complete them. These are also one of the easiest ways to gear. Dungeons still have regular, heroic, and mythic, but now also have Mythic+. Mythic+ is where you can continue to push difficulty, obtain better gear, and all around it brings a new aspect of the game/competition to life. If you have ever played Diablo, this is kinda like the combination of greater rift levels plus the random affixes champion packs have. They are timed, extremely fun, and just add a new element. Raids are still around with normal, heroic, and mythic. One big thing that has recently changed is the looting system. We are strictly in personal loot now, which is what it sounds like. Each character obtains their own loot from a boss. This has upset some people, but we will see how it works out. One thing it is good for is transmog running old raids. If you are +11 levels above the raid level, you enable legacy loot mode. This will allow your loot to resemble old loot rules and treat your raid ID like the maximum number of people are in your group. Transmog is basically changing the appearance of your gear without changing the actual gear. So, if you start your account back up, and you are rocking that sweet Tier 2 judgement set, you can change any corresponding armor into that appearance. You just have to obtain it by owning the item. This adds a new element of collecting to the game. On the subject of collecting, mounts, toys, appearances, and pets are all account wide now which is really cool. Pets are basically pokemon now, and have a whole aspect devoted to them. Gear can now upgrade itself when it is “rolled” to appear for you. This just gives you even more options to get better gear, but it’s strictly RNG. There is now Warmode, which enables pvp flagging, but gives you a 10% increase in rewards/exp. This can only be activated/deactivated inside Stormwind/Orgrimmar and might seem like a good idea while leveling but it can be really bad sometimes with high levels actively seek low level players to hunt/farm. For reference, there was a lvl 110 Warlock rotating between quest hubs in Ghostlands for four hours the other night. \*\*Enter at your own risk!\*\* 5v5 is gone, but everything else remains. There are new pvp events called brawls which help spice things up. Gear can drop from winning/completing pvp events now, and conquest is coming back in BFA as well as pvp vendors. Most zones scale now so you do not have to leave a zone halfway through because you outleveled it. You can also mix it up in certain brackets like going to Northrend at 60 instead of 70. There is a lot of changes, but I can go over that 1 on 1 if any of you want to reach out, please do. 

**Upcoming**

As you might know, the new expansion Battle for Azeroth will be releasing on August 14th. This may cause you to feel overwhelmed with things to do before release, but I would advise you to take it slow and relearn/learn the game. There is a ton of content in this game and if you try and cram it all into one sitting, you are going to have a bad time. We are currently in the ""pre-patch"" of BFA. Basically, this means, they made the game ready for the expansion with changes and additions but haven’t opened the gates yet. There was also a stat squish, where the numbers we see got lowered to help keep them from getting stupid high. In turn, we are seeing some problems, these are normal, just do your best to avoid/report them. For example, you might be questing and find a mob that has not been stat squished, and will one shot you, or a mob who puts an absorb shield on that takes an insane amount of damage to break. Ignore most these problems, it is done to help make the game better, just try to avoid them. 

**Starting out**

Picking a class/race is going to be one of the first and ongoing thing you struggle with. They did/do a good job giving you lots of options so it is expected to be tough. There is a new feature called class trials where you can experience the class closer to endgame. These are good options to help get a better understanding of how a class feels endgame, where the majority of the game is, without having to level them all the way up. When it comes to races, unless you plan on being the top 1% of players in PVP/PVE then you should pick the race that looks like fun. Even if you want to, just pick something fun. Here are some websites I would use/used when starting out. 

**Resources**

*Wowhead* – This is the go to website for looking up quests, items, or what not. If you are returning this is the new *thottbot* or [*allakhazam*](https://www.google.com/search?q=wow+allakhazam&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwik5Knru8LcAhUPnawKHYjsDW8QkeECCCYoAA&amp;biw=1268&amp;bih=855).

**Allied Races** \- These are the new races that have been added/will be added in the new expansion. As of this writing, Lightforged, Nightborne, Highmountain, and Void Elf are currently unlockable endgame. Dark Iron Dwarf and Mag'har Orc are visible, but they will be unlocked after the expansion releases. In order to unlock the currently available allied races, you will need to meet a rep requirement, and then complete a scenario. You will have to have a toon on each side to unlock the respective races - Void Elf and Lightforged on Alliance, and Nightborne/Highmountain on Horde. 

*Here is a quick rundown of how to do this:*

**Void Elf** comes from Argussian Reach rep on Argus

**Lightforged Dranei** comes from Army of Light rep on Argus

**Highmountain Tauren** comes from Highmountain the zone

**Nightfallen** comes from Nightfallen rep from Suramar.

The goal to unlock the races, is to get exalted, and then start a quest line with a short scenario to unlock them. You get the mount after unlocking the race.

Army of Light and Argussian Reach rep comes from dailys and quests on Argus, which you should start the quest to unlock Argus and get that chain started. This is a good place to get some starter gear as you go through everything.

For Highmountain, do all the quests in the zone, and then do the WQs every day for them.

Edit: Credit to u/tempredditaccount28 \- The third boss of Neltharion’s Lair also grants 250 Highmountain rep per kill

For Nightfallen, do the extremely lengthy quest chain in Suramar to unlock them. After you are done with the entire chain, you might have to grind a couple extra days of WQs to get exalted.

Make sure you do your garrison missions on any alt you have for extra rep tokens to help.

**To sum it up:**

Do all the story quests in Highmountain, Suramar, and Argus while also completing the WQ's in these zones every day. As a side effort, work on your garrison followers so you can send them out for rep token quests. If you have alts, some of these tokens are BOA so you can send them over.

**Tips for picking a class**

· Do your research, watch videos, play class trials, look at upcoming changes, and pick something you don’t mind standing in the middle of your screen the whole time. 

· Some class is always going to run by you with killer looking gear, or a killer looking class mount. This is just part of the game. If you want to have alt characters, this is cool, but don’t let it make you second guess your class choice. 

· I have done it all from rolling characters to taking “what class am I” quizzes. Just remember that it is a game, and it should be fun. 

· Try and find something that mechanically suits you. Try out all the different roles and different types like melee vs ranged. 

· If visuals are your thing, look up the class sets and find something cool that really suits you. 

· Play what you find fun, cool, and enjoyable. Don’t play what is OP or topping meters.

**Leveling Up**

This is painful right now, plain and simple. It is a lot slower that you probably remember unless you are coming back from playing in vanilla. \*\*There is no secret route that is gamebreaking to leveling!\*\* There are too many variables. I was leveling recently and heard completing a skirmish is the same exp as turning in a quest. Nice in theory, but if que times are 45 minutes, it isn’t very efficient. There are many ways to get exp along the way, try and mix it up if you get bored. I am expecting something to change soon, but for the time being, just try and push through it. If you want to try warmode for the extra 10% exp, go for it, but don’t sit and be farmed. Look for people in the same quest set as you and get in a group to help things go faster. Spec into whatever mobility spells you can get like Pathfinder/posthaste. Take this as a time to learn your class and if I had to give you tips, it would be this.:

1. If you can, get heirlooms. These are pieces of gear that level with you, never break, and give an experience boost totaling 50% if you have them all. I have enough for 55% but I have heard that it caps at 50%. These are expensive to have the cap raised on. They start at 60 but can be upgraded through gold to go higher. 

2. Do a mix of things. We all have playlists or Netflix series we watch while leveling but with how slow it has gotten, its nice to mix things up. Que for a BG, knock out quests, and do some pet battles along your way. One thing I feel needs to be consistent is questing. No matter what you are qued for, always be turning in quests. 

3. Upgrade gear as you get it, heirlooms aren’t crazy OP anymore so you can shave off seconds of each kill if you keep your gear up to date. 

4. Dungeons are very slow and honestly some are slower than they were in vanilla. Things take a long time to kill, so if there aren’t quests you can do in the dungeon, I would skip it.  Even in a guild group, all heirlooms, things still are slow. 

5. Take advantage of events like darkmoon faire and get the exp buffs from them while they last. 

6. Make sure you log off in a Inn for rested (double exp) growth. I do not believe there is a 2 level cap anymore. I have had lvl 100’s sitting since the start of legion so if my theory is right, they probably have a lot of levels of double exp. 

7. Upgrade your mount anytime you have the opportunity to. 

8. Time is of the essence, so make sure whatever it is you are doing isn’t a waste of your time. 

9. Try and enjoy it, there are some really good hidden gems in this game that get forgotten because there are not in the current expac. My personal suggestions: Pandaria, BC Nagrand, Zangarmarsh, Feralas, Hyjal, Grizzly Hills, Sholazaar, and Vashj’ir if you are crazy and have a thing for aquaman. 

**In closing**

This is a great game with a ton of content. There is a great community even if it isn’t always visible. You are coming in at the end of an expansion with a lot of changes so there are some very unhappy people. I have been around for every one of these. Some are worse, some are better, but I still love the game. They will not be able to make every single player happy. Explore all the game has to offer, and if it isn’t for you, then it isn’t for you. You will run into your fair share of turds, but just ignore them. I wish you luck in your journey and I hope you enjoy the game! **Have fun, and enjoy this incredible world they have created!**",t2_143f2gso,,,0,,New/Returning player?

Add a special flair to your reddit username, so everyone can recognize it's you.

Find a cheap car from craigslist to buy for the trip with Evan (you said you want around the range of 500$).

Get Michael Reeves to collaborate with you to form some form of electronic device (ex. Robot Andy #2).

Install ublock origin ""adblock"". It will save the wasted time from ads on videos and allows for more viewer retention.

For streamlabs to work for liveu you need to get the liveu data to send to your PC then OBS etc to youtube for overlay to work. You can pay Jacob to setup it up or ask someone on discord for help.

Reaction playlist for you to react to (whenever): \[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7YJSrjC6GM&amp;list=PLzGYH9v8nDbmV6RevaPYVMhlcsMGLwLc0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7YJSrjC6GM&amp;list=PLzGYH9v8nDbmV6RevaPYVMhlcsMGLwLc0)\] (contains constantly updated old videos and new highlights)

React to Daily Dose of internet videos, DramaAlart videos, Scarce Videos, and LiveFails subreddit.

Incorporate both PC and IRL (maybe some gaming streams while on your PC, like playing Runescape on a new account just for shits and giggles or reactions for like 30 minutes before the IRL part).

Change the donation set-up so different donation amounts trigger different reactions from the TTS or on the screen (something you mentioned).

Add a cut-scene image or trailer for your LiveU like Evan, ONLY if the stream Fs really hard  (cpost something like ""be right back"". Viewers and Cx entertainment can work together to make it). We can add best reddit posts, discord memes, etc. to advertise those links. You can also use it as an intro for your streams or stick to a random music video playing as usual.

Extras:

Invite Lit Papi (Show Luciano) to a stream for the memes!

New challenge/task for the subreddit (for example, new meme of the day, video concept and you can feature it etc.)

Do a short 5-10 minute discord voice chat on stream where everyone talks so new people join it and also for the memes.

It's good to have cameos: call an old friend on stream, Evan as usual, someone from the CX network (example: crazy Erin), Lit Papi etc.

Reddit Recap every stream.

Sam and Evan combined streams weekly (ex. a weekly challenge, like biking, running, getting pushed on a cart, etc.)

Clickbait an event for you channel (ex. like UFCx2, you can clickbait the moon eclipse, or any popular event to attract new viewers outside of Cx).

,barstoolsports,"Hey guys (and girls, shoutout frozengrape and marlin's woman), I'm back for another regularly scheduled music thread. For any newbies on the sub, this thread goes up every Friday around noon, feel free to talk about anything music related here (new releases, throwbacks, upcoming shows, etc). And of course you can check out my personal blog as well as the official spotify playlist with music from these threads below.

[Spotify Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/122646323/playlist/7fn0CRECXcKZl68lu9uuSP?si=BzouukNzS4qz7OcqOo0a7Q)

[GhostfaceKyle Music Blog](https://ghostfacekylemusic.wordpress.com/)

**NEW RELEASES:**

[Tom Morello - ""We Don't Need You""](https://open.spotify.com/album/5ek4h00E3bVEbV6m06QX3D?si=K7WbVZDXT825pWfYyA7A9Q) and [""Battle Sirens""](https://open.spotify.com/album/6OYtFV3Arutl1bjmQ1Yh1k?si=WFW2E-SeSneSkbueuqoVUA)

\-After recently putting out an album last year with Prophets Of Rage, the former RATM guitarist continues to grind and officially announced his new solo album, *The Atlas Underground*, is due out October 12th. We got 2 singles from the album here with features from Vin Mensa and Knife Party. It's cool to see an older artist embracing younger artists instead of being an old man yelling at clouds. Both of these tracks have that signature RATM guitar but manage to push boundaries a little bit, especially on ""Battle Sirens"" which is essentially an EDM track. The features on the rest of the album are insane as well, Morello bought in Gary Clark Jr, Killer Mike, Big Boi, Portugal The Man, and a ton more. Going to be a very interesting album to say the least.

[Mac Miller - ""What's The Use?""](https://open.spotify.com/album/0ppUC3Jf1kIDvOZsxCYpEe?si=9IbexPsXTGew1glpad_6ow)

\-I'm officially all in on the Mac Miller funk train.  This one gives off the same strong funk vibes as [“Dang!”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LR3GQfryp9M) which I’'m not complaining about at all. Thundercat provides an unbelievable bassline throughout the song, with uptempo percussion which Mac floats over perfectly. He sings on the hook without overdoing it, and both of his verses are as strong as anything he’s done lyrically. I also LOVE how he managed to let the beat breath at certain points and didn’t feel the need to pack in as many rhymes as possible. He also announced a Fall tour with J.I.D and Thundercat which is going to be unreal.

[A$AP Rocky &amp; Tyler the Creator - ""Potato Salad""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iu7wJwbLkpo)

\-I absolutely love these two together. Pretty different styles but complement each other so well and always seem to be having a great time together. They both also teased a ""WANG$AP"" collab, but no timeline so don't get too excited.

[Brockhamtpon - ""1997 DIANA""](https://open.spotify.com/album/2YltjwKulQeLRj4C4O7M1X?si=-C9EkY48QLuB41yPhPAXBQ)

\-Another one from the upcoming album *the best years of our lives.* These guys have mastered the loud, sloppy, in your face sub genre of hip hop and it just works. I don't love this track as much as I did ""1998 TRUMAN"". No release date yet for the album, but I do like what they're doing with the song titles in relation to the title of the album.

[Denzel Curry album - *TA13OO*](https://open.spotify.com/album/6idVoBWP2mt1qoMtASm3gc?si=0KtR-3A3RP-5Ki4RXE7f9Q)

\-This one is actually part 3 in a trilogy of EP releases over the last few weeks. Other than a few singles I've never given Denzel Curry enough of a chance, partially because sometimes he does the whole yelling/over the top energy rapping, but this album is surprisingly impressive. There are certainly a few duds here but a few tracks I really like are ""Black Balloons"", ""Sirens"" ft. JID, ""Percs"", and ""Switch It Up"".

[From First To Last - ""Surrender""](https://open.spotify.com/album/65XwIvA8vCbzSsdmgoAqlP?si=3yPb1wNmTmuJTUf2uc1I4Q)

\-Sonny Moore back in the fucking building! If you were a fan of FFTL way back in the day then I think you'll definitely enjoy this one. This one is catchy as fuck and has the perfect blend of vocals and screaming, and tossed in with a nice double bass drum. It's really cool to see Skrillex back in his rock roots. No indication of whether or not there's more of this to come, but it's a nice taste either way.

[Leon Bridges - Spotify Singles](https://open.spotify.com/album/66BHCqvohArD6Hk2uga5dX?si=MYmTik8cRnWYJ3XSUOKGmQ)

\-Goddamn this man is so talented. We got 2 stripped down acoustic spotify singles. One of them is his hit single ""Beyond"", which isn't far off from the studio version, and then we got a banger of a cover with Ginuwine's ""Pony"". This ""Pony"" cover is pure sex. Bridges brings a perfect jazz sultriness to it, and makes me feel like I'm sitting in a dimly lit jazz lounge drinking an old fashioned.

[Vic Mensa - ""Metaphysical""](https://open.spotify.com/album/1QNDQ11mLoNKAyj1T9c3M4?si=8YK1NT81SdC-rqTmjuJYPg)

\-In addition to the single with Tom Morello, we got a bouncy, African influenced single. Yes, this track sounds very similar to Drake's ""One Dance"" but who cares. Summery, good vibes all around on this one.

[Wallows - ""Underneath The Streetlights...""](https://open.spotify.com/track/1iLVNryGTKYzgHQITD1XTG?si=Cn0R7fuyRwmyWGWNXE1ibA)

\-Solid indie/alternative rock single from these guys. I'm not a huge fan of the heavy lo-fi sound on this one however, I liked their Spring EP which was a bit more refined. Fun fact the main dude from 13 reasons why is the front man for this band too.

[YG feat. A$AP Rocky - ""Handgun""](https://open.spotify.com/album/5TOA5oO9rF94LjEBLRCmj6?si=xn5bRzkuQJG-EfVN6jijxQ)

\-Usually not a big YG guy but I can't ignore a Rocky feature. Not a track that'll blow you away and YG sounds like he''s doing some weird accent? But I love the pounding bass drum throughout the track. Also can't ignore great lyricism with lines like ""She all on my nuts, fuck her once, I don't eat the butt""...Same yo, same.

[Slash ft. Myles Kennedy &amp; The Conspirators - ""Driving Rain""](https://open.spotify.com/album/7uonTXm4WR3QXhlpKi4Zv9?si=gt3qyXo7TPy6a5QVC1z_1A)

\-Hey first of all, have a longer band name dude. Besides that, I love me some pounding Slash guitar riffs and this track has plenty. This is the first single off their upcoming album coming out September 21st. This one has a great classic rock feel to it so I'm interested to see what the rest of the album has in store.

**OTHER STUFF I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THIS WEEK:**

\-Anyone else have those songs that you found randomly and feel like literally nobody else knows but you? This week's other stuff is dedicated to those deep cuts. (Yes I understand that obviously someone else somewhere knows these songs). Would love to hear what songs you guys have.

[Adult Mom - ""Survival""](https://open.spotify.com/track/2w0nIRl9BhixD3DcS1Mz3g?si=PJUYSVrqSomTR5vQ6n0Wag) Very hipster, indie band I found a year or 2 back.

[Gabriel Mayers - ""Too Close To The Sun""](https://open.spotify.com/track/1Lkc8Kl6TItmInHyRHvIuf?si=zvEET3kDRT6E03JtlXwXgg) \- This dude was a contestant on this music reality show hosted by Linda Perry. Never heard from him again but this song is great.

[Neako ft. Wiz Khalifa - ""Back To The Set""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJ5gHclCiE) Throwback from 2010 that never got an official release but this track BANGS.

[JR Writer - ""What You Know About Crack""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNI--YdG-rA) \- Dipset affiliate back in the day, no idea what he's up to now but this TI remix is hot fuego.

**OTHER RANDOM STUFF**

\-Hitting up Smashing Pumpkins next week at PNC in Jersey, anyone else catch this tour yet?

\-Shout out to my man /u/joeysnowbank for mentioning the fact that Bleed American by Jimmy Eat World came out 17 years ago and bought up an interesting question about best albums of the 2000s. I'll give a personal quick top 5 off the top my head, and for the record I'm only counting albums released between 2000-2009. 2000-current would be too much. In no particular order, I'd say my top 5 albums of 2000-2009 are:

1. Rise Or Die Trying by Four Year Strong

2.Take Off Your Pants And Jacket by Blink 182

3. Late Registration by Kanye

4. Elephant by The White Stripes

This week at Bungie, we’re preparing for a celebration.


The Tower is getting ready for the kickoff of Solstice of Heroes, starting next Tuesday, July 31. To keep the party lively, you’ll find bounties to help you track your Triumphs and new challenges for upgrading a new armor set. All the details are laid out in the [Solstice of Heroes article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47017). The event will run from July 31 until the weekly reset on August 28. 


Today, we showed off what some of the new weapons and armor can do in *Forsaken*. We love it when the game does the talking. Here is a glimpse of some of the tools of the trade that arrive with *Forsaken* on September 4.

##Full Stream Ahead

Ever since we started talking about the second year of Destiny 2, we’ve dropped a lot of hints about how the state of combat between Guardians will be changing. We know you have questions about how you’ll be using your weapons next season. How will you equip them? How will you customize them? How will you earn the ammunition you’ll need to use them?


Some of these things defy explanation, so we’ll demonstrate the performance of the new arsenal in real time. You are invited to watch us engage in combat—for science!


**Year Two Combat Reveal Stream**

**Tuesday, August 7, 10 AM PDT**

**[twitch.tv/bungie](https://www.twitch.tv/bungie) or [youtube.com/Bungie](https://www.youtube.com/user/Bungie)**


Joining us again in one of the hot seats will be full-time **Senior Sandbox Designer** ([and part-time rockstar](https://twitter.com/Bungie/status/1020405496623185926)) **Jon Weisnewski**. He makes some promises that we’ll keep when we go live on stream.


&gt;
&gt;**Newsk**: Hello friends! If you’re a sharp-eyed PvP enthusiast, you may have noticed from some Forsaken coverage that the weapons are doing a bit more damage than they do in the current version of *Destiny 2*. If you’re a seasoned Destiny 2 player, you may then extrapolate the possibility of a global lethality pass on weapons and abilities that may or may not be in the pipe to go live when *Forsaken* is released. I’m here to quickly confirm that, along with weapon slots and ammo availability, we have globally adjusted the “time to kill” in the Crucible. If you’d like more details, join us on stream and we’ll get into it! See you then!


And that’s just one question we’ll answer beyond the shadow of a doubt. Tune in for a full demonstration of perks, mods, loadouts, and everything else you’ll need to know to best your fellow players in battle. We can’t give you skill, but we can equip you with a pre-mission briefing.


Save the date, follow our channels, and prepare your favorite chat room snacks.

##Back to the Lab Again



[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/113/113271/crucible_labs_blog.jpg)


Crucible Labs has been on hiatus for a while. It’s time to start experimenting again. Senior Designer Andrew Weldon has the details about the new mode coming next and when you can expect to see it go live. 


&gt;
&gt;**Andrew**: Hello again!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Back in May, we launched the first Crucible Labs playlist with the game mode “Showdown.” As discussed in the [following week’s TWAB](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/46940), this was a good opportunity for us to test the playlist on a relatively safe baseline that we had mostly already shipped for Crimson Days and the standalone Doubles playlist. The first test served its purpose—we stood the system up and got great feedback on an in-development mode. We’ve also made one noteworthy change to Labs as a whole—with the 1.2.3 update, **Labs matches will now also count toward your Valor ranking and will offer standard Crucible rewards at match complete!**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Now that we’ve released that 1.2.3 update, we’re ready to deploy our next Crucible Labs experiment to you—“Lockdown.” Lockdown is a new 4v4 round-based Competitive mode that, like Control, is about capturing and holding zones. Unlike Control, your only score comes from playing the objective. Those of you from the Taken King/Rise of Iron era know this mode’s predecessor, the Control variant “Zone Control.” Here’s how it plays out:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Both teams start Lockdown with a “Progress” percentage of 0% displayed under the scoreboard. Once a team holds two zones, progress will begin ticking up for that team at a rate of 1% per second. There is no round timer—the first team to reach 100% will win the round, and the first to win three rounds will win the match.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;That’s not all, though—if a team can successfully capture all three zones, they will *instantly* win the round, regardless of each team’s progress state. A well-coordinated push from your opponents will *always* be dangerous, which means you need to stay focused on your objective.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;However, winning a round that way is not necessarily as simple as it might seem. To earn capture progress or win on the triple cap, you must hold *uncontested* zones. If a team holds two zones, you can fully halt their progress by contesting one or more zones (you’ll see “PROGRESS HALTED” display under the scoreboard to let you know this is happening). They won’t start earning score again until they clear you and your progress off the point(s). The same applies when going for the triple cap lockdown—the instant win only applies if all three zones are completely clear.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;We’ve seen some really exciting matches play out from this ruleset internally, and we hope you have similar experiences out in the wild!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;As with any Labs playlist, this mode is not final, and you may come across some tuning issues or bugs. Your most direct avenue for feedback on this mode will be in a new Labs thread on the [Feedback forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/247331393), and we’ll be monitoring the conversation we see around the mode to pluck out actionable items for future iteration and polish.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;We hope you enjoy this first look at the new mode—and you can play it *right now*.

##Shhhh

Many Guardians have heard whispers on Io and rushed to investigate. Some of you encountered a long streak of Cabal drills—far too many Cabal drills. We did some investigating to see if this was a bug. Turns out there’s no bug, but the current random generator doesn’t do a good job of preventing streaks of either event. 


We’re currently investigating ways to prevent these bad luck runs in the future. We did some simulations to see if there might be any more long streaks of one type of event in the forecast. We expect a few more outliers, but balanced with long streaks of only Taken Blight events. This activity will be available every week, and once you do unlock the Heroic version, it will stay unlocked. We will continue to monitor the situation. Happy hunting.

##From Now Until Forsaken

Earlier this week, we published a new [Development Roadmap](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47048). Previous editions of this forecast were more focused on our plans for the future. With our immediate future looking brighter—even with a darker story to tell—we’re using the Roadmap to telegraph the updates you’ll need to download before your second year of *Destiny 2* can begin.


[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/113/113271/dev_roadmap_07_25_18.jpg)


We’ve been pretty true to the plans we laid out in the last roadmap, but there were some new entries. As we do, today we’d like to provide some commentary on **Director Updates** and **Milestones and Challenges Updates**. 


Two of the main functions of the Director have been to help players know what to do next and lead them to sources of more powerful gear. We have some new ideas for how we can better support these goals, so we’re changing the way those things work.


There will be three ways to acquire Powerful Engrams in Forsaken:



* A whole new **challenge** system that will replace the way you have been tracking milestones. 


* Specific **quests and bounties** will provide better gear, indicated by their summaries.


* New **mysteries** are rarer sources—but if we told you about them, they wouldn’t be mysterious.


Most of these sources of power will be refreshed weekly or daily. Some will be one-time sources.


Once these changes are deployed into the wild, the “Milestones Blade” will call attention to these activities:



* Critical, required missions such as the main campaign or new subclass path pursuits


* Next steps for quests or other aspects of the progression of your characters


* Legacy milestones from *Destiny 2* campaigns that aren’t becoming “challenges” or quests


Additionally, the layout of the Director will be updated to accommodate two new destinations: The Tangled Shore and the Dreaming City. You’ll obviously need to purchase *Forsaken* to visit them, but they’ll appear on the interface that we all see.


Today, we wanted to set some expectations for what’s changing, and why it was on the roadmap. You’ll understand the full experience for how these new (and improved?) features lead you on your journey to your maximum potential as a Guardian when you play. That’s always the best source of understanding. Plus, discovering the path is part of the fun.


***



##Save the Dates

There are plenty more than just downloads that have to happen before *Forsaken* launches. With Gambit as our special cargo, we’re heading to gamescom, where we will make some important announcements. We’re going to PAX West, where we’ll mix it up with the community (and, yes, play some Gambit) one more time before launch. As always, there will be fun things happening in the game to keep you challenged and entertained as you count down the days until September 4.


Check out our August calendar of events in the game and in real life.

**The Sacred Texts!**


A popular request among Guardians is to see the Grimoire committed to print. Today, we are proud to announce an upcoming *Destiny Grimoire Anthology*.


Until now, the myths, mysteries, and machinations of the *Destiny* universe were found hidden throughout the worlds—enticing threads that hinted at a greater tapestry. The *Destiny Grimoire* *Anthology* weaves tales from multiple sources together for the first time, casting new light on Destiny’s most legendary heroes, infamous villains, and their greatest moments of triumph and tragedy. 

Each unique volume intends to illuminate a facet of the world, and the complete anthology will confirm and challenge players’ thoughts and assumptions about what it means to be a Guardian, offering new and differing perspectives on the cosmic war that rages between the Traveler and its ancient enemies.


[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/113/113271/dstny_Grimoire-Anthology_mock-cover.jpg)


[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/113/113271/GRIMIORE_Paperback-Book-Mockup_OPEN_072518.jpg)


The first volume is titled Dark Mirror and available [for preorder on the Bungie store](https://bungiestore.com/products/preorder-destiny-grimoire-anthology-volume-i). Look for it this fall wherever books are sold. It will also be published in additional languages and available in additional regions to be announced.

##Service Guarantees Citizenship



[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/113/113271/07262018_user_research.jpg)


There are many ways we collaborate with our players to make a better game. We pore over feedback loops from multiple sources on the internet. We contract notable experts among you to join us as testers for a limited run. Sometimes, we’ll even host a summit in our studio to dig into our future plans. Those measures, while effective, unfortunately don’t stand a chance of including everyone.


Bungie User Research casts a wider net. Willing test subjects complete online surveys. There are even occasional invitations to visit our studio and step into the lab to sample something in development. The registration questionnaire has been updated with new data points that we’d love to know about you. If you’re already in our database, hit it again. If you didn’t know about this opportunity to do your part, this is your chance to sign up for a future testing opportunity.


Would you like to know more?


Fill out our [User Research Questionnaire](https://www.bungie.net/en/Questionnaire/UserResearch), and we may call upon you to participate in a live-fire exercise sometime in the future.

##For the Monarchy

New Monarchy claimed the third and final Faction Rallies victory of Season 3. They were dominant in previous seasons but were winless coming into this one. The faction managed to squeak out a victory despite Dead Orbit having more players pledged. It’s about action, not promises.

##Helping Hands



[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/113/113271/DPS_Gif_.gif)


This is the Player Support Report. 


&gt;
&gt;###**Tuesday Morning Glory**
&gt;
&gt;This week, Destiny Player Support became aware of an issue impacting the Glory bonuses earned by players who were completing three or more Competitive Crucible matches a week.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;With the launch of Crucible Ranks in Season 3, it was intended that players who were Fabled rank or below would receive a bonus allocation of Glory points following the weekly reset of any week during which they completed three or more Competitive matches. After investigating player reports regarding this feature, we have determined these Glory rank packages are not being granted as intended.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;While we’re working with our Crucible team to investigate this issue, players should expect that this issue will persist for the remainder of Season 3. Players who are aiming to unlock Glory rank–based rewards for Season 3 should plan their Crucible play accordingly.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;For more information, players should visit our [Seasonal Crucible Ranking](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/46787) help article.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Destiny 2 Hotfix 1.2.3.1**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Next week we’re deploying *Destiny 2* Hotfix 1.2.3.1 to players. This hotfix is the final barrier between players and the launch of Solstice of Heroes, and all players will need to install this hotfix before they can join the celebration. Provided below is a brief timeline of this deployment.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;On **Tuesday, July 31, 2018**:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* **9 AM PDT**: Destiny 2 Hotfix 1.2.3.1 will become available to all players.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* **9–10 AM PDT**: Players will be prompted to accept Hotfix 1.2.3.1 as they return to orbit after completing activities.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* **10 AM PDT**: All players who have not yet accepted Hotfix 1.2.3.1 will be removed from activities and returned to the title screen to take this hotfix.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;For more information on this deployment, players should see our [Destiny Server and Update Status](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/13125) page. For live updates on this hotfix as it becomes available, players should follow [@BungieHelp](https://twitter.com/bungiehelp) on Twitter or monitor our support feed on [help.Bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/en/help).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;


&gt;
&gt;**Solstice of Heroes**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Next Tuesday, July 31, 2018, Solstice of Heroes will kick off in Destiny 2. Before this event goes live, here are a few points of vital information:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* Before attempting to complete a Triumph, players should make sure they have acquired it from the Statue of Heroes. Some Triumphs may need to be completed again if the Triumph is not in the player’s inventory at the time of completion.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* For Moments of Triumph, adventures and Region Chests are tracked by the character that has completed the most of them, and they are not tracked account-wide. Players who encounter issues making progress toward these Triumphs should make sure they are playing on the character that has made the most progress toward these Triumphs.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* **Progress toward Triumphs and event rewards may be lost if players delete any characters on their account.** For the best experience, it is recommended that players do not delete any characters until all desired rewards have been redeemed and Solstice of Heroes concludes on August 28, 2018.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;For more information, players should visit our [Solstice of Heroes](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47017) blog post as well as the [Moments of Triumph Guide](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/46969) and [FAQ](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/46970).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Cayde’s Exotic Stash**



&gt;
&gt;Since the reveal of *Destiny 2: Forsaken*, players have asked whether or not Cayde’s Exotic Stash will be included with pre-orders directly from platform online marketplaces. We can confirm that this pre-order bonus will be available to all players who purchase through the PlayStation, Xbox, and Battle.net online stores before launch.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Additionally, shown below is what players can expect to become available to them in Year 2, based off of title ownership:

This week at Bungie, we’re preparing for a celebration.


The Tower is getting ready for the kickoff of Solstice of Heroes, starting next Tuesday, July 31. To keep the party lively, you’ll find bounties to help you track your Triumphs and new challenges for upgrading a new armor set. All the details are laid out in the [Solstice of Heroes article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47017). The event will run from July 31 until the weekly reset on August 28. 


Today, we showed off what some of the new weapons and armor can do in *Forsaken*. We love it when the game does the talking. Here is a glimpse of some of the tools of the trade that arrive with *Forsaken* on September 4.

##Full Stream Ahead

Ever since we started talking about the second year of Destiny 2, we’ve dropped a lot of hints about how the state of combat between Guardians will be changing. We know you have questions about how you’ll be using your weapons next season. How will you equip them? How will you customize them? How will you earn the ammunition you’ll need to use them?


Some of these things defy explanation, so we’ll demonstrate the performance of the new arsenal in real time. You are invited to watch us engage in combat—for science!


**Year Two Combat Reveal Stream**

**Tuesday, August 7, 10 AM PDT**

**[twitch.tv/bungie](https://www.twitch.tv/bungie) or [youtube.com/Bungie](https://www.youtube.com/user/Bungie)**


Joining us again in one of the hot seats will be full-time **Senior Sandbox Designer** ([and part-time rockstar](https://twitter.com/Bungie/status/1020405496623185926)) **Jon Weisnewski**. He makes some promises that we’ll keep when we go live on stream.


&gt;
&gt;**Newsk**: Hello friends! If you’re a sharp-eyed PvP enthusiast, you may have noticed from some Forsaken coverage that the weapons are doing a bit more damage than they do in the current version of *Destiny 2*. If you’re a seasoned Destiny 2 player, you may then extrapolate the possibility of a global lethality pass on weapons and abilities that may or may not be in the pipe to go live when *Forsaken* is released. I’m here to quickly confirm that, along with weapon slots and ammo availability, we have globally adjusted the “time to kill” in the Crucible. If you’d like more details, join us on stream and we’ll get into it! See you then!


And that’s just one question we’ll answer beyond the shadow of a doubt. Tune in for a full demonstration of perks, mods, loadouts, and everything else you’ll need to know to best your fellow players in battle. We can’t give you skill, but we can equip you with a pre-mission briefing.


Save the date, follow our channels, and prepare your favorite chat room snacks.

##Back to the Lab Again



[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/113/113271/crucible_labs_blog.jpg)


Crucible Labs has been on hiatus for a while. It’s time to start experimenting again. Senior Designer Andrew Weldon has the details about the new mode coming next and when you can expect to see it go live. 


&gt;
&gt;**Andrew**: Hello again!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Back in May, we launched the first Crucible Labs playlist with the game mode “Showdown.” As discussed in the [following week’s TWAB](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/46940), this was a good opportunity for us to test the playlist on a relatively safe baseline that we had mostly already shipped for Crimson Days and the standalone Doubles playlist. The first test served its purpose—we stood the system up and got great feedback on an in-development mode. We’ve also made one noteworthy change to Labs as a whole—with the 1.2.3 update, **Labs matches will now also count toward your Valor ranking and will offer standard Crucible rewards at match complete!**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Now that we’ve released that 1.2.3 update, we’re ready to deploy our next Crucible Labs experiment to you—“Lockdown.” Lockdown is a new 4v4 round-based Competitive mode that, like Control, is about capturing and holding zones. Unlike Control, your only score comes from playing the objective. Those of you from the Taken King/Rise of Iron era know this mode’s predecessor, the Control variant “Zone Control.” Here’s how it plays out:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Both teams start Lockdown with a “Progress” percentage of 0% displayed under the scoreboard. Once a team holds two zones, progress will begin ticking up for that team at a rate of 1% per second. There is no round timer—the first team to reach 100% will win the round, and the first to win three rounds will win the match.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;That’s not all, though—if a team can successfully capture all three zones, they will *instantly* win the round, regardless of each team’s progress state. A well-coordinated push from your opponents will *always* be dangerous, which means you need to stay focused on your objective.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;However, winning a round that way is not necessarily as simple as it might seem. To earn capture progress or win on the triple cap, you must hold *uncontested* zones. If a team holds two zones, you can fully halt their progress by contesting one or more zones (you’ll see “PROGRESS HALTED” display under the scoreboard to let you know this is happening). They won’t start earning score again until they clear you and your progress off the point(s). The same applies when going for the triple cap lockdown—the instant win only applies if all three zones are completely clear.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;We’ve seen some really exciting matches play out from this ruleset internally, and we hope you have similar experiences out in the wild!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;As with any Labs playlist, this mode is not final, and you may come across some tuning issues or bugs. Your most direct avenue for feedback on this mode will be in a new Labs thread on the [Feedback forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/247331393), and we’ll be monitoring the conversation we see around the mode to pluck out actionable items for future iteration and polish.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;We hope you enjoy this first look at the new mode—and you can play it *right now*.

##Shhhh

Many Guardians have heard whispers on Io and rushed to investigate. Some of you encountered a long streak of Cabal drills—far too many Cabal drills. We did some investigating to see if this was a bug. Turns out there’s no bug, but the current random generator doesn’t do a good job of preventing streaks of either event. 


We’re currently investigating ways to prevent these bad luck runs in the future. We did some simulations to see if there might be any more long streaks of one type of event in the forecast. We expect a few more outliers, but balanced with long streaks of only Taken Blight events. This activity will be available every week, and once you do unlock the Heroic version, it will stay unlocked. We will continue to monitor the situation. Happy hunting.

##From Now Until Forsaken

Earlier this week, we published a new [Development Roadmap](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47048). Previous editions of this forecast were more focused on our plans for the future. With our immediate future looking brighter—even with a darker story to tell—we’re using the Roadmap to telegraph the updates you’ll need to download before your second year of *Destiny 2* can begin.


[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/113/113271/dev_roadmap_07_25_18.jpg)


We’ve been pretty true to the plans we laid out in the last roadmap, but there were some new entries. As we do, today we’d like to provide some commentary on **Director Updates** and **Milestones and Challenges Updates**. 


Two of the main functions of the Director have been to help players know what to do next and lead them to sources of more powerful gear. We have some new ideas for how we can better support these goals, so we’re changing the way those things work.


There will be three ways to acquire Powerful Engrams in Forsaken:



* A whole new **challenge** system that will replace the way you have been tracking milestones. 


* Specific **quests and bounties** will provide better gear, indicated by their summaries.


* New **mysteries** are rarer sources—but if we told you about them, they wouldn’t be mysterious.


Most of these sources of power will be refreshed weekly or daily. Some will be one-time sources.


Once these changes are deployed into the wild, the “Milestones Blade” will call attention to these activities:



* Critical, required missions such as the main campaign or new subclass path pursuits


* Next steps for quests or other aspects of the progression of your characters


* Legacy milestones from *Destiny 2* campaigns that aren’t becoming “challenges” or quests


Additionally, the layout of the Director will be updated to accommodate two new destinations: The Tangled Shore and the Dreaming City. You’ll obviously need to purchase *Forsaken* to visit them, but they’ll appear on the interface that we all see.


Today, we wanted to set some expectations for what’s changing, and why it was on the roadmap. You’ll understand the full experience for how these new (and improved?) features lead you on your journey to your maximum potential as a Guardian when you play. That’s always the best source of understanding. Plus, discovering the path is part of the fun.


***



##Save the Dates

There are plenty more than just downloads that have to happen before *Forsaken* launches. With Gambit as our special cargo, we’re heading to gamescom, where we will make some important announcements. We’re going to PAX West, where we’ll mix it up with the community (and, yes, play some Gambit) one more time before launch. As always, there will be fun things happening in the game to keep you challenged and entertained as you count down the days until September 4.


Check out our August calendar of events in the game and in real life.

**The Sacred Texts!**


A popular request among Guardians is to see the Grimoire committed to print. Today, we are proud to announce an upcoming *Destiny Grimoire Anthology*.


Until now, the myths, mysteries, and machinations of the *Destiny* universe were found hidden throughout the worlds—enticing threads that hinted at a greater tapestry. The *Destiny Grimoire* *Anthology* weaves tales from multiple sources together for the first time, casting new light on Destiny’s most legendary heroes, infamous villains, and their greatest moments of triumph and tragedy. 

Each unique volume intends to illuminate a facet of the world, and the complete anthology will confirm and challenge players’ thoughts and assumptions about what it means to be a Guardian, offering new and differing perspectives on the cosmic war that rages between the Traveler and its ancient enemies.


[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/113/113271/dstny_Grimoire-Anthology_mock-cover.jpg)


[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/113/113271/GRIMIORE_Paperback-Book-Mockup_OPEN_072518.jpg)


The first volume is titled Dark Mirror and available [for preorder on the Bungie store](https://bungiestore.com/products/preorder-destiny-grimoire-anthology-volume-i). Look for it this fall wherever books are sold. It will also be published in additional languages and available in additional regions to be announced.

##Service Guarantees Citizenship



[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/113/113271/07262018_user_research.jpg)


There are many ways we collaborate with our players to make a better game. We pore over feedback loops from multiple sources on the internet. We contract notable experts among you to join us as testers for a limited run. Sometimes, we’ll even host a summit in our studio to dig into our future plans. Those measures, while effective, unfortunately don’t stand a chance of including everyone.


Bungie User Research casts a wider net. Willing test subjects complete online surveys. There are even occasional invitations to visit our studio and step into the lab to sample something in development. The registration questionnaire has been updated with new data points that we’d love to know about you. If you’re already in our database, hit it again. If you didn’t know about this opportunity to do your part, this is your chance to sign up for a future testing opportunity.


Would you like to know more?


Fill out our [User Research Questionnaire](https://www.bungie.net/en/Questionnaire/UserResearch), and we may call upon you to participate in a live-fire exercise sometime in the future.

##For the Monarchy

New Monarchy claimed the third and final Faction Rallies victory of Season 3. They were dominant in previous seasons but were winless coming into this one. The faction managed to squeak out a victory despite Dead Orbit having more players pledged. It’s about action, not promises.

##Helping Hands



[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/113/113271/DPS_Gif_.gif)


This is the Player Support Report. 


&gt;
&gt;###**Tuesday Morning Glory**
&gt;
&gt;This week, Destiny Player Support became aware of an issue impacting the Glory bonuses earned by players who were completing three or more Competitive Crucible matches a week.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;With the launch of Crucible Ranks in Season 3, it was intended that players who were Fabled rank or below would receive a bonus allocation of Glory points following the weekly reset of any week during which they completed three or more Competitive matches. After investigating player reports regarding this feature, we have determined these Glory rank packages are not being granted as intended.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;While we’re working with our Crucible team to investigate this issue, players should expect that this issue will persist for the remainder of Season 3. Players who are aiming to unlock Glory rank–based rewards for Season 3 should plan their Crucible play accordingly.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;For more information, players should visit our [Seasonal Crucible Ranking](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/46787) help article.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Destiny 2 Hotfix 1.2.3.1**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Next week we’re deploying *Destiny 2* Hotfix 1.2.3.1 to players. This hotfix is the final barrier between players and the launch of Solstice of Heroes, and all players will need to install this hotfix before they can join the celebration. Provided below is a brief timeline of this deployment.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;On **Tuesday, July 31, 2018**:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* **9 AM PDT**: Destiny 2 Hotfix 1.2.3.1 will become available to all players.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* **9–10 AM PDT**: Players will be prompted to accept Hotfix 1.2.3.1 as they return to orbit after completing activities.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* **10 AM PDT**: All players who have not yet accepted Hotfix 1.2.3.1 will be removed from activities and returned to the title screen to take this hotfix.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;For more information on this deployment, players should see our [Destiny Server and Update Status](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/13125) page. For live updates on this hotfix as it becomes available, players should follow [@BungieHelp](https://twitter.com/bungiehelp) on Twitter or monitor our support feed on [help.Bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/en/help).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;


&gt;
&gt;**Solstice of Heroes**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Next Tuesday, July 31, 2018, Solstice of Heroes will kick off in Destiny 2. Before this event goes live, here are a few points of vital information:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* Before attempting to complete a Triumph, players should make sure they have acquired it from the Statue of Heroes. Some Triumphs may need to be completed again if the Triumph is not in the player’s inventory at the time of completion.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* For Moments of Triumph, adventures and Region Chests are tracked by the character that has completed the most of them, and they are not tracked account-wide. Players who encounter issues making progress toward these Triumphs should make sure they are playing on the character that has made the most progress toward these Triumphs.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* **Progress toward Triumphs and event rewards may be lost if players delete any characters on their account.** For the best experience, it is recommended that players do not delete any characters until all desired rewards have been redeemed and Solstice of Heroes concludes on August 28, 2018.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;For more information, players should visit our [Solstice of Heroes](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47017) blog post as well as the [Moments of Triumph Guide](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/46969) and [FAQ](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/46970).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Cayde’s Exotic Stash**



&gt;
&gt;Since the reveal of *Destiny 2: Forsaken*, players have asked whether or not Cayde’s Exotic Stash will be included with pre-orders directly from platform online marketplaces. We can confirm that this pre-order bonus will be available to all players who purchase through the PlayStation, Xbox, and Battle.net online stores before launch.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Additionally, shown below is what players can expect to become available to them in Year 2, based off of title ownership:

,FortNiteBR,"I posted this in the mega thread but not much response was gathered. I know I won't do any better but ehh it's worth a try.

As a 0 win player I have just finished a set of various solo, duo and squad games, all in which I couldn't even make it out of the place I landed in. Trust me it is one of the most demoralising shit ever. I'm only still playing because of a dogged belief that I will get better eventually and then I'll be slayin', and some people don't have that. Being shit on repeatedly is NOT going to keep the playerbase in.

Epic has been nerfing building into the ground (badumtss) lately and all the pros are complaining. This is because they need to keep the new players around or they'll lose value. The new SMGs and explosives buffs further develop my point.  

Bringing skill based matchmaking will allow the game to develop better. New players and noobs in one lobby, great players in another. This way, learning the game is easier and more attractive, and the eSport scene can develop further.  

&gt;But being shit on repeatedly helps you learn!

Yes I am aware of that. It's gonna get worse before it gets better. But some others won't or don't believe this. They play the game 4-5 times and get shit on every time (probably with 0 kills) and then they say ""fuck this, i ragequit, back to tf2"". They just don't have the time or patience to continue playing, and get better.  

Let me put it this way. Would you rather learn boxing by being shit on 100 times by John Cena until you get marginally better, or fight 100 people of your level and win over 50 of them? Most importantly, if you have 100,000 people making that decision every day, many of whom are young children, which would they choose?

&gt;Pros will just create new accounts to shit on new players!

Perhaps they will. But I think I would much rather have Ninja battle five 5kd players, win over all of them, and get the win than he cum all over 15 bushies and 5 average players. Besides, pros are shitting on new players \*now.\* Better a small fix than nothing. 

&gt;BRs aren't good for skill based matchmaking!

Whatever it is, it will attract new players. I'm not too sure of the intricacies of SBMM but I know that fighting 3 people fairly and winning over 2 and dying to the 3rd is definitely more encouraging than getting shit on 99% of the time. I have 0 wins I would know. In addition, SBMM will allow Epic to push the skill ceiling higher, allowing for better eSport scenes.

&gt;It's hard to implement in this random BR environment!

Maybe create different lobbies for those with 0 wins, 1 win, 2-5 wins and &gt;5 wins in the mode. Or something like that. I'm only a teenager and this is only my opinion, and retarded idea, but I think this will help really nicely in helping noobs and kids like me learn 2 play, and give the pros slightly more challenging games. Alternatively, get a different playlist a la Showdown without vBucks (hell, maybe 50 vBucks/win in that mode) and split the playerbase. Epic had plans for this in season 2, I'm sure they can modify it or make it better.  

&gt;We've talked about this before, in season 2  

That was season 2, and strategies were only developing. 3 seasons later what is Epic doing? Nerfing building, adding SMGs that melted in 0.7 seconds, killing shotguns and catering to noobs. We want a well-established meta with high skill ceiling, that doesn't affect the higher-ups like it does now.

&gt;git gud

Don't get me wrong. I have been trying. I just spent a long time in playground getting double ramp wall down (and tested the new p90 in the process). But that kind of time isn't what everyone has. I'm in middle school and hours can stretch until 6:00 in the evenings, plus homework, and we hardly have time to practice building in playground. I'm quite sure many others have even busier schedules. We just want to play and have fun, and getting shit on every game, well, isn't.  

It was said somewhere in Reddit. Half the player base has 0 solo wins, and that's the tracked player base. The real number could be much higher. Meanwhile we have streamers like Tfue and Myth going around getting 8 kills per game upon that 1/2 the game (no offence to them, they're both great). Who knows? That no skin no builder in a bush with a heavy that Dae just styled on? That might just have been his last game.  

I want to reiterate this. Being shit on is not fun. People need a fair base to work with, and with 5kd players just wiping them off like butter, it isn't going to work.  

TLDR Get skill based matchmaking in the game, so noobs can practice and have more fun, and pros can give better content.

,offmychest,"I need to get away from you.

We met at a bar; you're friends with my friends. We both recently got out of engagements earlier this year. Through that, we developed an amazing, close, casual friendship.

I had a crush on you the whole time; eventually, I told you, and we talked about it. We decided to try and continue being best friends.

That may have been a mistake.

We started spending nearly every day together; making food for each other, watching Glee, petting cats, and riding bikes around the city. You got me a toothbrush and a blanket in your apartment, to the chagrin of your other two roommates, for all the nights I spent crashed on your couch after a few too many High Lifes.

My crush on you never faded; over time, we grew closer, and more confused. Instead of focusing on being single and growing past my codependent, cheating ex-fiancee, my heart drew me into you, to try and fill that hole. You were accommodating, and friendly. I felt like I needed that.

I didn't care that you were sleeping with your coworkers; I know you left your fiancee because you developed feelings for a man you work with, see almost every day, and have been fucking regularly for weeks. At least, at first. (Shoot, I don't blame you; he's really cute.)

Then we made out, on the bus ride home from the music festival. You said it was bound to happen eventually.

Then we slept together.

Then, drunk after karaoke and walking home together, we crashed at your other coworker's place, snuggling together in her bed. Just to see what it would be like to wake up next to each other.

After that, our relationship became strained. Both of us were confused and lonely, and we were reaching out for something that neither of us could provide the other - a chance at going back to a supportive, loving relationship, without the risk of pain and hurt.

But, you maintained the entire time, that you're not into me. I knew that then, and I know that now; I still care about you deeply, and it's killing me.

Maybe if I hadn't gotten drunk at the company baseball game yesterday and started drunk-texting you about my emotions after you told me yet again that you were distracted at work by your coworker crush, we could keep pretending that we're still best friends, and keep providing each other the emotional support we so desperately want.

But you shot me down, again. I wasn't even pushing for anything; I was just drunkenly speaking my mind. Yeah, I'm jealous of him. I also know that he doesn't really like you, and he's using you for sex and getting his romantic and emotional support from the woman you encouraged him to hook up with during his China trip a couple months back. You know it too; you're smart enough. But I'd never say this to you so bluntly; you don't deserve that pain right now.

I'd also never say to you that I wish you'd give up on him and run to me instead, but I've sure felt that way a few times.

The thing is, we're both broken and confused.

We get along well, we've got chemistry, and under different circumstances we might have been a pretty amazing couple, I think. But neither of us needs that right now.

You hurt me with that rejection, and then like a fool, I let you come over later that same day. We cooked dinner together, and watched Glee, like nothing was wrong.

But the atmosphere was toxic.

Instead of coming out to karaoke, you left to go home. You refused our typical goodbye hug, and you said something about needing to go home and wallow.

I never got an answer as to what that meant. But I'm pretty sure I already understood.

Please don't come over again, unless it's to get your spare car key back.

I can't deal with it anymore. And I know I won't be able to resist, if you ask to stop by.

We'll have to get rid of the list of TV shows we planned to watch together. I'll stop listening to the secret playlist of songs I made on YouTube from the tracks we sent each other back and forth, and the songs we've sung together at karaoke.

I wish this had turned out differently. But I can't be codependent on someone again. Honestly, neither can you. Even if you maintain that you don't like me, and you don't want to lead me on, we've always been a little more than just friends. I was just hopeful that eventually, it'd develop into something more, when both of us are ready.

I'm still a little hopeful; I will always hold a candle for you, in a room of my heart that I'm trying not to visit for a while.

But right now, I need to get away from you.

I need to get back to me. Who I am, who I'm not. I need to focus on my job, on my sex life, on my hobbies. On getting rid of my ex-fiancee's crap. On getting rid of my own crap.

You have become a distraction. At first, it was a welcome one; having someone that cared about me got me through a lot of bullshit with my own self-confidence. But now it just hurts to be around you. For so many reasons.

I don't blame you; you're just as confused as I am. But I do need to remember why I got out of my last relationship; I was giving too much, at my own expense, and feeling unappreciated.

I hope that the guy you're crushing on realizes how much of an amazing woman you are, and chooses you over China girl. You deserve to have the man you want. Or you deserve to be single for a while and grow as a person. Or you deserve to have someone who cares for you as much as I've tried to, and who isn't as broken as I am.

I want you to be happy and confident in whatever path the universe throws you down.

Right now, though, that path isn't with me.

I hope we both grow, and find amazing people for ourselves to love and cherish, when the time is right. But we flew too close to the sun; now we're both picking through our feathers to see which ones are burnt.

I love you, I hate you. I'm your best friend, and you're my worst enemy. Everything that could have been, and maybe could still be, will be tarnished by what's come before, and almost isn't even worth it at this point.

,antiMLM,"I’m a 20 year old college student who is currently searching for a job. So yesterday I went in for my first interview at Vector. Dressed nice as they had recommended (business casual) and arrived about 20 mins early. Unlike most of the other stories I’ve read, the office complex was fairly decent; they had an elevator and a whole bunch of other offices. 

Go up to the 4th floor and walk in, I’m greeted by the girl who recruited me on Facebook (I messaged her about the job after seeing her advertise it) who was an acquittance from High School, she hands me a paper on the clipboard and sends me into a separate room for to wait for my interview. They room was hot as Satan’s balls and they had a tv playing drone shots from various cities with shitty “chillax house” music that you would find on some YouTube playlist. (I love house but this is that kind of basic white girl house music)

As I’m filling it out a couple of other people walk in, some of them are much better dressed than I am so I start to feel a little nervous. As I get down to the bottom of the paper, it asks you to list character references so I list previous employers; funny thing is instead of phone numbers for these references, they ask for their address. I’ve got time to kill so being the curious bastard I am I start researching the company name (btw I only found out the name of the company when I went in for the interview) and immediately start seeing all this bad shit of how it’s a scam. 

Eventually my jolly interviewer comes out and introduces herself and takes me into her office. She asks me all the normal questions you would expect in an interview. She also asks whether I know anything about the company to which I respond “Yes I actually did some research while I was waiting” enthusiastically she responds “THAT’S GREAT” so either this woman has never browsed google or she thinks I’m a fucking moron. Interview finishes in about 5 minutes and she asks if I can stay for a second interview. I say yes and I’m instructed to go back into the waiting room where I find the room is filled with a ton of people and I squeeze myself into one of the few open seats.

I wait about 45 minutes as the rest of the people in the room are called in for their interview. Most of these people don’t make it back, so I start to think maybe the company’s reputation has changed as me and only 3 other people remain in the final cut. Our interviewer comes out to conduct a group interview with “the lucky four” that remain. She pulls out some cutlery to demonstrate to us and try out. She pulls up a YouTube video of brainwashed employees and hands us each a sheet of paper with 4 questions on them to fill out after watching the video. All of the questions are ridiculously simple and I shit you not all of the answers were “All of the above” and “True”.

We finish with the video and she tells us she can’t accept all of us but she wishes us each the best. I sit waiting for an hour for my second interview while she takes everyone in and I’m the last one called in. Im hired, she asks if I can come in for 2 training days both 7 hours each, for some ungodly reason I agree... I’m handed a booklet and a paper in which I’m instructed to fill out 10 people I can recommend cutco to, but she pushes that I can probably get to 30. I got there at 12:40 and left at around 4:30; 4 fucking hours. To top it off I live in Georgia so I had to deal with Atlanta’s rush hour traffic on the way home.

I go home fill about 9 people I know and the rest are some random ass people I find in the yellowbook pages, just so I can look good the next day.  I tell both of my parents about my new “job” and how I’m skeptical but willing to see how it is, they both think it’s a load of horse shit.

 I walk in today for training which started at 11 and ended at 6. This time, 5 other people are there for training, none of which are the other 3 that made the final cut. The interviewer from yesterday was our trainer. Surprisingly, some kid I had two college courses with was in my training class, so I’ll see how it turns out for him should he decide to stay with the company.  Our trainer handed us booklets on how to sell knives to customers and a little binder with pictures of their product. We were instructed to bring food and drink since the course was 7 hours, and better yet we only had a 10 minute break. I felt like I was back in high school during this course. We took notes, read out loud with the booklet because the interviewer wanted to make sure we were paying attention... crazy right? She even tried convincing us we could get a head start in the business world because “Kanye West actually used to sell Cutco!!!”

A lot of the training were videos of testimonials and previous training videos. Other employees came in and the trainer asked them all the exact same questions “What do customers like most about cutco?” “What’s your favorite part of the job? “Do you have any tips what vegetable to cut?” After meeting the employees we are told to clap once “on the count of 3” since clapping like a normal person apparently isn’t respectful. I started to zone out because clearly this was a complete waste of my time. She began to hand out “junk knives” from their competitors to compare to “The World’s Finest Cutlery”.  She Explains that the $1200 (or 5 monthly payments of $275) asking price for their shitbox of knives is “pocket change” to the average homeowner, because “average college students make $3k a year, and you have different concepts of money” which is bullshit.

Towards the end of the interview, we’re asked to give it our all because it’s the most important part of training; writing down as many people you know and scheduling appointments. She says who ever schedules an appointment first gets a prize, a fucking apple peeler. The list for appointments is massive; 30 slots for relatives, 40 for friends, 30 for family friends, and a whopping 60 for overflow. I feel like a complete annoying telemarketer as a ring up my random numbers and read off of they booklet they handed out; as they want married 30 year old homeowners. I manage to get an appointment with one of my mom’s close friends and the rest I bullshit; during the whole ordeal with everyone calling their friends and family, I use my extra time to schedule an interview with a car dealership. You can make money with them but it isn’t worth your time, you have to make about 5 calls just to get one appointment, and you aren’t even guaranteed a sale. You make $15 per appointment, but factoring in for gas and wear and tear you’re putting on your car it isn’t worth the effort. Your entire day will be eaten up scheduling appointments.

As we leave she wants us to gather more appointments when we get home and arrive 2 hours early before our next training day to call even more people for appointments. I decide that I’m not even going to show up the next day and call my moms friend and tell her not to worry about the appointment but thank her for willing to help me out. I’ll let you know how they handle my no show. Then continue my hour drive home in Atlanta’s famous traffic. Fuck Vector Marketing.

Now here’s my plan, they don’t ask for any proof of ID or anything so you can literally schedule an interview with a fake name. Fill out your paper before the interview with fake addresses and numbers. You’ll get your sample knife set on your second day of training and you can bullshit all of the appointments. On the second day they ask for your social security number (fake that too). Take their $1200 knife set and vanish. This company will try and fuck you and your friends/family so you might as well fuck them first, it’s too late for me I was tricked into giving them my info but I dodged the bullet since they’ll never get my social security. If you’re willing to sit thru 14 hours of shit to get a knife set you can either sell or keep, I’d say do it but don’t give them any legit info about yourself; the knives seem pretty decent and from what I’ve heard they are actually nice quality. 

Hope you’ve enjoyed my little experience with this shithole company and I hope you don’t fall for their tricks.

,weddingplanning,"Hi everyone! I posted here a couple of times just around when I got engaged, and was an avid reader for a while, back when I was super excited about wedding planning. So much of the happiness feels like it has been drained out of it now...so I suppose I was hoping this would be an alright place to vent, and maybe ask for some support from other people in the thick of it? Wedding is October 25th this year.

My main problem at the moment is stress. I have an anxiety disorder, dysfunctional family and a job that, while emotionally satisfying, is wearing and low-paid. On top of that, I now seem to be having INSANE stress reactions to...just about everything. I think a lot of it centres around the wedding but no matter how many calming techniques, CBT thought reframing, cups of green tea I fix myself, I can't seem to get it under control. The spikes (which can happen over literally anything vaguely construed as stressful) involve high heart rate and/or heart palpitations, dizziness, nausea, confusion, hyperventilating, and more often than not now diarrhoea (tmi but Jesus Christ a week with normal poops seems like a thing of the past).

Like I say I know a lot of this is around the wedding. We have a lot done but it feels like SO much more to do and I feel like I'm fighting SOMETHING every step of the way. Some of the things on my mind tonight:

* Our cake vendor has never given us a contract and has not replied in over a month to our email asking for one. She is a friend of a friend and I suggested bailing on her a month or so ago because she hadn't talked about a contract or deposit and said we could meet with her ""sometime in September"" to discuss things as the summer was a busy time and she had other stuff on. It feels like making our cake is a favour instead of us being customers? The email asking for a contract was what FH asked/decided to go with instead of straight up looking for someone else.
*  I spend most days wanting to scream at my bridesmaids. We still don't have dresses because one bridesmaid who only replies when she feels like it vetoed both the affordable dresses I found because they wouldn't suit her. We now have one three times the price but I can't get people to let me know if they are actually going to buy it! It took me weeks to get people's SIZES off them and the complainy bridesmaid still hasn't given me hers, hence farming it out and saying ""buy your own"" but are they going to???
* We're looking at two florists and one only just got us a quote after meeting with her over a month ago. I want to sit down and compare them but the best I can get out of my FH is a little time Friday night after work because he's away all this weekend and most of next weekend with his sport, and doesn't like doing wedding stuff in the evenings as it's stressful. So even though I want that sorted I have no idea when it is going to be.
* Similar with invitations - after a week or so of back and forth with an Etsy designer we have the final PDFs, but getting my FH to look at them with me not during 'wedding planning time' was like pulling teeth. Now we have to find a local printer to print them, and I want to do a proof print to check they're alright but he thinks we don't need to? And he has said he will look at printers but I think he has just decided to go with the one he uses at work without researching whether they do invitations and not just banners/posters and I don't even know if me is this overthinking it and feeling I need to research more or if that really is fine?
* I nearly fainted in the heat and from stress having my first dress fitting and I think I hate the dress to be honest but I just wanted to get one bought and it looks OK but I feel floofy and stupid in it.
* I'm going to do my own makeup but after years of managing to make my face look nice just fine I now feel like I know NOTHING and have NO idea how to get wedding ready.
* Our photographer seems great but every time I talk about maybe meeting up with her to discuss shot lists/plans for the day my FH seems very confused by the idea and asks why we need to. I don't feel like I have the energy to explain how much chaos it would be on the day if we just said go for it!
* We are having friends do our non-legal ceremony on the day. My MOH said yes, absolutely. His friend...hasn't got back to him and FH 'doesn't want to push him' because he's away this weekend, it's not nice to talk about at a party, he's got a job interview, I just want to go and hang out and not talk about this etc etc etc.
* I realised that in doing our own music we need playlists for the ceremony, cocktail hour, dinner AND reception, not just reception, because I'm an idiot and music has been the furthest thing from my mind, and that we need to setlist them and I still don't know the details of the set up at the venue for it.
* FH doesn't have a suit, he has found a place in Edinburgh he is going to check out so now he has to somehow going to find time to go there and then get it fitted here.
* I have no idea which if any of my bridesmaids are going to be around to help on the morning off because I can't pin half of them down for conversations or they only reply half the time, and through this FH keeps asking what the point of having them is.
* We still don't have plans for decor; we want to go see the venue again but that will depend on finding a day we are both of that I'm not stuck in the bathroom sicking up my stress and FH isn't ill with HIS stomach issues and we both feel like the hour long trip to the venue which should be a nothing drive but somehow isn't.
* I honestly think no one is going to turn up because why would they and I feel like a fraud and a freak in my dress and like it's a total joke anyone would be looking at me or interested in anything I have to say or do.
* We still haven't written any of the ceremony because I don't want to start until I know if his friend is in or not also I'm nearly dying of stress every day.
* I still haven't called the registry office to make an appointment to give notice and I think I'm just going to as FH to do it because my working hours are fixed and his change constantly so me doing it makes less sense as I'll just have to wait to check when he is free anyway.
* I have done ALL the research for our honeymoon after he suggested/decided we go to the South of France which by the way is a GIANT area with TONS of regions so THANKS FOR NARROWING THAT DOWN. I am now trying to work out transport but the whole thing gives me anxiety attacks because until recently I've had a huge fear of travelling and booking things wrong and messing up arrangements but it's only in the last week or so he has actually got round to looking at any AirBnBs.

And this isn't even getting into any work/daily life/family stresses, not to mention the stupid heatwave which is stupid killing me. I'm just so wound up and feel like crying and I want to cancel but I know for sure I would regret it forever and I just want things to be nice and to respond like a normal person instead of having heart palpitations every time I think about October. I love him and he's incredible and I want to marry him but I feel like I have to drag him into every conversation about this. But I think that's me too - I think I want to do way more research and discussing that might be necessary because I'm so scared I'm going to mess this up and something is going to go wrong.

I just want to have a day without stress and actually enjoy this because I looked forward to planning this wedding for so long but I just want to lie down and not get up.

Sorry. I don't know if this violates any rules - if it does, sorry for creating work for the mods. I just wanted to get it off my chest somewhere. I may well be being silly and honestly I do feel like that, I just don't know how to get a handle on my stress or life or anything.",t2_i9v8s,,,0,,Coping with excess wedding stress?,[],r/weddingplanning,False,6.0,rant,,,,False,,False,dark,,,public,,,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},Rant,False,8,,,,self,False,,[],,,True,,,text,6.0,,,text,self.weddingplanning,,,,,,,False,False,True,False,False,,,False,49f24cc4-545d-11e6-a00e-0ed2209aa23d,True,False,False,,,,,,,t5_2rv3t,,,,,91w5n3,,,geckopup,,7,True,all_ads,False,,,,/r/weddingplanning/comments/91w5n3/coping_with_excess_wedding_stress/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/91w5n3/coping_with_excess_wedding_stress/,76684,1532554897.0,0,,False,,,,,,,,1410025610.0,1536662588.0,,,
,Sum41,"Just last year we celebrated the 10th anniversary of Sum 41's album Underclass Hero (seriously 10 years already?!?!?) and it was around that time Deryck was posting videos opening up the mixes of some of the tracks and I was thinking a lot about this album.  This may have been a post more suited for then...but I'm doing it now because better late than never I guess.

Underclass Hero is an album that seems to be divisive among the sums fan base. It was certainly a weird time for the band and I myself went through my own evolution regarding my take on it. At the time I was 16 years old and I had just discovered Sum 41. After quickly locating their whole discography on the internet through questionable means I was ecstatic to learn that they had a new album just around the corner. I remember begging dad to take me to Wal-Mart day of and listening to it with him the whole ride home.  It was exactly what I wanted at the time.  Although eventually I did a 180 on my preferential sound for sum 41 at the time I much preferred their album all killer to anything heavier that came after.  And although this didn't have that same youthful energy and summer break feel, it was more pop punk and definitely a step closer to their roots. To me it was a perfect album, it was how I thought they should grow in their sound. 

As time went on and my tastes evolved I began to sour on the album. More of its flaws became increasingly apparent. Things I initially saw as strengths turned to weaknesses in the sound to my ears. I began to learn more about the band and I grew to appreciate albums like Does This Look Infected and Chuck much more. And suddenly to me, as It already had been to many, the album felt like a left turn out of nowhere compared to where the band had been growing and how good of a direction they had been going in previously. I learned about Brownsound leaving and his absence began to feel more and more obvious and caused the album to feel more lacking to me.  The album felt increasingly derivative of itself with every listen,  and repeated vocal melodies and chord progressions stood out like sore thumbs.  My view of the band began to change too.  It seemed as though they were awkwardly trying to find their new identity with the loss of brownsound and were trying to pander to the mainstream to regain the more pop audience they may have lost with albums like Chuck.  All of a sudden they were wearing dress shirts, ties, and sweaters instead of t shirts and really talking up how mature they were now  (all the while counter intuitively airing their hilarious home video YouTube series road to ruin showing how immature and hilarious they were). In interviews they dismissed the sound of their older albums that i loved as a phase, and were done with heavy music (that stance lasted long).  It felt like they were really pushing a new image that I wasn't sure I preferred anymore and the list of songs I appreciated from underclass hero continued to dwindle in my playlist. 

But now years have passed and would you believe I think it has some of their best songs? Yes the dust has finally settled and actually out of the two albums the group released without Brownsound I actually think Underclass Hero is the stronger and more consistent album.  As much as I would shock my younger self who initially felt that Screaming Bloody Murder was the second coming of Christ and setting the past right, in hindsight, although I want a darker sum 41, SBM ends up coming off as more of a confussed mess and a rushed course correction after fan backlash of UH.  I remember Deryck really talking up how heavy SBM was going to be and how much they tried to play off the rock star partying image. At the time in college i was completely sold, but now looking back some of it was really quite cringy.  Both quotes/actions of the band and music.  And honestly it ended up coming off as an album that wanted to be heavier than it really was and wasn't as much of the band getting back on track as 13 voices actually ended up being.

UH really does do a lot of things right in my opinion despite how much it does wrong. Songs like walking disaster, speak of the devil, with me, and pull the curtain are great tracks and to me are a lot more memorable than a lot on the follow up. They do show genuine growth and depth in the writing of the band.  Honestly I think Underclass Hero is an album that I think could be saved by just simply shaving off a few of the reeaally bad tracks leaving the decent to great songs to form a shorter but more consistently solid pop punk record.  A lot of the mature attempts come off really lame (dear father and best of me come to mind), but I'd argue more actually land.  So all of this stupidly long post to say give Underclass Hero another chance. It's not perfect but has a lot of great moments worth remembering.

,u_maddyisanidiot,"him and i were in a production of peter pan, he was cast as Wendy's father and i was cast as her mother. after maybe 3 weeks into rehearsals, he texts me on snap and demands that we speak in private. i was really uncomfortable with the whole situation. And you wanna know what he did? he wrote me a poem. and it wasn't even a poem, but 4 paragraphs of creepy descriptions of my hair and comparisons to Romeo and Juliet.  i was kind of creeped out but i didn't want to be rude so i said 'haha this is really sweet, but i uhhhh i have a girlfriend'. and looking back on it i should have just said 'im not interested' because he took that and thought 'she likes me but she cant be with me because she has a girlfriend'. cut to 2 more weeks of rehearsals, filled with creepy stares and uncomfortable comments on my instagram. i was ignoring him, leaving him on read, no even opening his snaps, and when it did talk it was uninterested one-word responses. 
during a show night, i made a mistake on stage and got yelled at pretty harshly by the director, i was upset to say the least and i ran to the greenroom to get out of my costume. and what do i find? he's ambushed outside of the GIRLS DRESSING ROOM, waiting for me. he tries to talk and i of course push past him and say leave me alone. luckily he wasn't there when i got back. 
later that night my sister messages him and tells him to leave me the hell alone, because it makes me and my girlfriend super uncomfortable. but alas he's still messaging me about his Beatles playlist (to which i don't respond) 
the worst part is when i get to the the theater the next day, there on the prop table is a letter addressed to me (side note: he actually spelled my name wrong on the letter) 
its a front to back apology note explaining why we should still be friends and still, weird comparisons to Romeo and Juliet. 
during the show i work backstage since im only in the first and last scenes. but i find out from the backstage manager, that he's talked to one of the stage hands about how im ignoring him. me and the manager have a little laugh about the situation. and she says to him in private that he needs to aim a little lower (a little mean tbh but i wasn't there for the conversation so idk.)
after the last night, im hanging around a group of my friends and i see him in the distance and im like oh shit so im actively moving myself around the group so he doesn't get to me. 
he ends up talking to my brother (who was working lights) and he tells him to try and get me to talk to him. 
i leave with some friends and immediately block him. the vibes are too strong and i dont want to associate with him anymore. 
last night, i got this email at 11:30 ish while i was face timing my friend at a party. i see the notification pop up on my screen and i freak out. (i have never given this guy my email) 
me and my friends are laughing about it and were trying to figure out how he found it. 
turns out, he was creeping through my instagram and since my profile is a business account, he finds my email from there.

now lemme give you some visuals. 
we're both the same age but im considerably more mature than he his. we're both young teenagers but im more... lets say developed. he on the other hand is... very very skinny with big feet and knobby knees. he has an uncomfortably deep voice for his frame which just adds to the creepy factor. now im not one to  judge on looks alone and attractiveness doesn't have to matter in a relationship. but for simplicity's sake, im objectively attractive, i did not ,however, condone the people in my theater saying things like 'how could he ever think he'd that her"" or 'doesn't he think he's reaching a little high?"" 

moral of the story is you don't have to be polite to people who make you uncomfortable. be stern and assertive, but also stay safe because there are some crazy people out there.

,AllFantasyEverything,"I found the postcast about a month ago, and in that time I think I've knocked out a solid 30 episodes or so.  Lots more to go, but some random thoughts on my new favorite podcast

**1.  Top 3 favorite moments.** 

1 - Reaction to Sean picking Vlad the Impaler in the Late Night Talk show draft.  Ian gives out a disappointed ""What??"" and stays silent for a solid 20 seconds, while Miel repeats ""What the fuck Sean?"" three times until she laughs so much she isn't really coherent.  David is his usual awesome self, giving Sean a ton of shit.  #1 with a bullet, a top favorite moment in any podcast ever for me. 

2 - The story of an intoxicated David stealing a chicken wing (and not even eating it) from another table at a bar the night before.  Typing out a recap won't do it justice, just listen to it (Fuckjamz episode)

3 - Discussing Tupac's ""Hit Em Up"" and Biggie's ""Dead Wrong"" from the Songs that make you 90% ready to fight pod.  Great picks for that draft topic, but it was hilarious how the guys kinda seized up and got a little uncomfortable when diving into the actual lyrics.  Ian wouldn't even discuss Biggie's third verse from Dead Wrong. 


**2.  Shane**  

I'm still pretty new to the show, and haven't heard an episode yet with Shane Torres, or for that matter, ever even heard his voice/seen him.  

Part of this is by chance, and part of it is by choice.  See, I absolutely love the caricature of Shane the group has made him into, and their impressions of him.  Based off the comedians Ian has on the pod/is friends with, I'm confident Shane is a normal, and very funny person.  But I don't want that - I want to assume he's as cranky and weird as they make him out to be.  So just for the moment, I've pushed those Shane episodes down in my playlist, so I can savor the caricature some more.  

Plus I like to think that if Shane ever found out someone was actively avoiding his episodes, solely because of the hilarious impressions made on the pod, it would make him dive right into the patented ""Oh great..."" tirade that the guys do so well.  

**3. Taco Bell**  

I haven't had Taco Bell in probably 10 to 12 years.  I decided a long time ago that I flat out just didn't like it, and it was gross.  That's been a fact in my head for a very long time.  After hearing the Taco Bell episode,  I started to question myself.  What if I was wrong this whole time?

Last night I went for it, and got three Dorioto Loco Tacos, and a Cheese Quesadilla.  It was all DELICIOUS.  I couldn't believe it.  I'd say the guys helped expand my palette, but I'm not sure bringing Taco Bell into my diet is exactly that.  

**4. Can I hang?**   

Can the guys have a patreon, contest, or SOMETHING, where the winner gets to just hang out for a day or two?   

A short trip to beautiful LA, to hang out on the couch and watch Training Day with the guys, get stoned, maybe see some stand up, and then a night of going hard.  I'll throw back some Cutty Sark and Black Velvet.  It sounds like a dream vacation.  What do I have to do to get this going?

,androidapps,"I am looking for a Music Streaming Service where the &gt;android app&lt; supports the following features:
- Folder Structure for Playlist (create/delete/move/folder-in-folder)
- Play playlists in folder (and subfolder) and maybe add folder playlists to queue/currently playing.
- (Somewhat dynamic playlists: adding artist to a folder which updates, when new albums are release. Alternatively a reliable way of notifications for followed artists, so I can update it myself)

Reason: I structure my music by genre, because I listen to different genres depending on my mood.
A simple out of the box genre grouping by the provider usually does not satisfy my needs, because the genre is to general or just covers the main genre but not the sub genres (especially in the metal genre).

Currently I am using Spotify which does support support Folder but are only editable on tablet/desktop applications. Unfortunately I am almost only using Spotify using on my smartphone.
Also Spotify removed the function to play a certain folder.

Additionally Spotify does not notify me about any new releases (randomly and rarely it does, but as I found out, this is intentionally and instead the Release Radar should be used), but I prefer a push not a pull service.

,AbuseInterrupted,"**Don't fear the squat rack (or any other piece of equipment)**

Cables, pulleys, loud clanking, wondering if that's where your knees go…or, wait, is it your elbows? When it comes to comfort at the gym, figuring out what equipment you need — and how the heck to use it — can be more than half the battle.

Some gyms offer free tours of the equipment. Even if you don't see any notices about it, you can always ask at the front desk. When it's time for your tour, remember that it's completely fine to be clear about your needs and goals — whether you want them to keep it weight-neutral, or focus on the strength machines rather than cardio, etc.

If don't want to take the tour, you can check the gym's website to see if they offer a virtual tour, or take the at-home version. Do some quick research to find out what kind of machines your gym has, then look them up online and on sites like YouTube.

**Dodging unwanted advice**

[The article didn't have great advice for this section, so I'm just compiling what I've seen in other subreddits.]

* headphones in your ears
* cheerfully say ""no, thanks!"" or ""have a great day!"" or ""I'm good!""
* glance at them and make a 'wtf?' face (or side eye) and go back to working out
* speak to gym staff and/or gym management
* ignore them
* change hours
* change venues/gyms
* tell them you are not interested
* sarcasm: ""I'm unaware that I've signed up for you to be my trainer.""  Also, just say ""unsubscribe"".
* hostile resting face/blank face

**Choosing a gym — Finding the right fit**

There are practically as many types of gyms as there are gym-goers. Everything from the bare-bones gym with nothing but free weights and Olympic style lifting, to gyms that don’t allow Olympic style lifting, to massive franchises with international presence, to boutique gyms focused on specific workouts like Zumba, Pilates, Barre, etc. Some gyms are full of people in sweats and shirts with stains and rips; others look like you just stepped into an activewear fashion show.

To avoid signing up for a gym that you'll never want to go to again, don't just make sure that it meets your needs for things like hours, equipment, and group classes. Make sure that the gym's style and clientele make you feel comfortable.

You can look for gyms that show outward signs of inclusivity:

&gt;I've had better luck with gyms that participate in the ""Silver Sneakers"" program. It's through Medicare and is a program for elderly people that pays for their gym membership, and some gyms have specific classes just for their ""silver"" members. I've found that these gyms just seem to attract a more diverse clientele. This isn't 100% effective, because there are a few [people] who feel like they can say whatever they want, but overall I've had positive experiences.

**Don't go it alone**

You've probably heard other advice to ""get a workout buddy."" This is usually offered as a form of accountability — that you're less likely to skip the gym if there’s someone there waiting for you. That's nothing wrong with accountability, but it's also not the only reason to go with a friend. Not being alone at the gym can help with every aspect of gymtimidation.

**Remember who you are there for**

What works for me in almost any situation where I'm afraid of being mistreated in a space:

&gt;What helps me is reminding myself that I’m there for me, and whatever other people are thinking about me in that space is their issue, not mine. Also, I openly stare back at anyone who seems to be watching me extra hard. I always get really anxious before going, but once I'm there, in my head-space, moving and feeling good, the rest tends to wash away.

The more of us who show up, refuse to leave, and claim our space in the fitness world — the more space we're making for people like us who would also enjoy using the gym. Your very presence there helps reduce the gymtimidation they might have to experience themselves.

* I was able to get a partial orientation on some of the equipment and I started with the things I was comfortable with first — treadmill and dumbbells. I found a time of day that works for me and also doesn't have a lot of people there and I used those times to experiment with the machines. After getting a TON of good advice and support from an online support group, I learned to watch a bunch of YouTube videos on the machines I want to try before I go in. I’ve now used almost all of the machines I want to try.

* I planned out my routine before going so I have a game plan. It takes away some of the anxiety for me if I’m going through a plan.

* I have a playlist with some great powerful songs that get me going and help me give a mental fuck-you to my fears. I tell myself repeatedly that I deserve to be there as much as anybody else.

* Last of all, I think just consistently going and pushing my limits a little bit every time has helped. I still worry about what jerks may be thinking, but I also really enjoy the feeling I get when I work out and I'm seeing awesome gains in how much I can lift and my endurance — so it's worth it to me.

&gt;What if you could deform and reshape the world itself?

&gt;Semblance is a innovative platformer with deformable terrain, set in a beautiful minimalist world. It's a game that asks, what if you could deform and reshape the world itself? Semblance takes the idea of a 'platform' in a platformer and turns it on it’s head. What if platforms were actually part of the gameplay, part of the way you solved problems?

&gt;Explore a world where the default is soft, where the property of 'hardness' doesn't exist. Each of the game's three worlds explore a new consequence of a planet that can shift, change and deform. Beat back the strange, crystalline infection of hard material by freeing the world's life essences and uncover the dark cause for its appearance.

&gt;Can't reach a collectible? Just deform and elevate a piece of the ground so that the point you jump from is higher. Nasty spikes in the way? Just deform and push-down the ground lower so that you can pass by. Squish, bounce, squash and transform the world- and yourself to solve problems.

&gt;Explore 3 worlds bursting with colorful minimalist charm, quirky critters, and calming vistas. Become hypnotized by each world's dynamically layered score, each with a hint of African aural distinction.

&gt;The game allows you to move between puzzles as you wish, never forcing you to find a solution in order to progress and enabling you to come back later. Similarly, the game's narrative is presented expansively, allowing you to explore- and piece together the story for yourself as you roam the game.

,running,"Quick back story before I talk about my race. Back in November I decided I was going to lose weight and get in shape. I joined a kickboxing class at a local gym. Started tracking calories with my fitness pal and started to track my steps and walk a few days a week. Move ahead to April I ran my 1st 5k without stopping. In June I ran my 2nd 5k without stopping, while improving my time by a whole minute without any training. At this point I wanted to challenge myself and run a 5 mile race without stopping. 

To train for this race I used the novice program for an 8k from Halhigdon.com. I used my kickboxing classes and cycling as my form of cross training. My initial goal was to run the race under 1 hour. During my training, I ran with a friend who ran track in college. From his assessment of the runs we did together, he felt that I could do the race under 50 minutes.

Morning of the race I was very excited. I felt extremely confident because of how well my training went. Ate a small breakfast and headed to the race. Upon arriving I became very overwhelmed. There was so many racers! Easily 500, which is double what I am use to seeing at the 5ks I've run. This race was being put on by The Maine Track Club. You could tell that a large majority of the racers were experienced. This made me feel intimidated. I put my ear buds in to block out the noise and reminded myself that I was racing for myself and against myself. After all, I had loved ones in the crowd cheering for me.

The race started with a long slight incline. I thought to myself the race was described as mostly flat and fast. As the path became flat it was apparent to me that my adrenaline was pumping. I was running faster than I typically do. At first this worried me but with my music playing, a smile came to me. This was a big moment for me. I was going to enjoy this race and give everything I got. 

As I approached the first mile marker there was a timer. Wow, none of the 5ks I did had this. I was on a 9:20 pace. 40 seconds faster pace than what my friend I ran just a few days ago. Was this pure adrenaline or could I really sub 50 this race? Surely I couldn't keep this pace or could I?

To try and steady myself I tried to find another racer to use as my pacer. After a short bit I found that someone. Well, that didn't last too long. After maybe 5 minutes I was ahead my pacer. Nearly at the 2 mile mark and there are still people on the side of the road, cheering for runners, spraying runners with their hose to cool them off. This is so cool. The 2nd mile marker like the first had a timer. 18:40. Holy shit i am still on a 9:20 mile pace.

Normally when I train I don't drink water while I run. There was a water station at mile 2. Took a cup and drank water while jogging. Maybe half of it made it in my mouth. 😂 Miles 2 and 3 I started to see a couple of racers go from running to walking. I saw this and used this as my fuel. That is not going to be. I am going to run this whole thing.

Mile 3 and there are still scattered  groups of people along the side of the road cheering. After not having a pacer for quite sometime I finally found one. A racer who stopped at a water station was now right next to me. We stayed within 10ft of each other. My playlist was pushing me a long. But I had arranged it so I had one song towards the end to motivate me for the last mile. Mentally I kept telling myself I needed to be at mile 4 when this song starts. My thought was it would give me strength tovfinish.

Miles 1-3 were all roads. Mile 4 began on walking trail that was much more narrow. Just as I started onto the trail my song came on. This is it, time to kick it in gear. The trail was much more hilly than any other part of the race. Which initially slowed me down. But with the music pumping, I focused on my breathing and kept going. 

Finally coming out of the trail there was roughly a half mile left. My legs were starting to burn. My paced slowed down but I kept trekking along. With one final left turn I knew I was on the home stretch. Had to skip a song on my playlist, I needed something upbeat to push me along. A lot was running through my head, where are my supporters? What is my time at? From a good distance away I could see my girlfriend holding her big white sign cheering me on. There is the official timer. Reading 47 something. Wanting to finish sub 48 I bursted into a dead sprint. Sprinting through the finish line I nearly knocked over a father and son who were standing a few several feet past the finish line. My offical race time was 47:50! I had done it! Sub 50 minutes.

The race was an amazing experience. Seeing so many strangers cheering you on. Training several months for an event and accomplishing the goal you set for yourself. A day later my legs are still sore. Yet I still want on a long slow run. New goal is to run a 10k before the year is over.",t2_jx029,,,0,,Finished my first 5 mile race this weekend!,[],r/running,False,6.0,linkflair-racereport,,,,False,,False,dark,,,public,,,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},Race Report,False,37,,,,self,False,,[],,,True,,,text,6.0,,,text,self.running,,,,,,,False,False,True,False,False,,,False,941b9770-3f38-11e3-b90c-12313d18f999,True,False,False,,,,,,,t5_2qlit,,,,,9139u3,,,DsDiagnosis,,6,True,all_ads,False,,,,/r/running/comments/9139u3/finished_my_first_5_mile_race_this_weekend/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/9139u3/finished_my_first_5_mile_race_this_weekend/,507536,1532312727.0,0,,False,,,,,,,,1418166012.0,1536648904.0,,,
,travel,"Poison smelled like spilled beer and cigarette ash as I entered alone looking for my guitar. It had been left there the night before in a drunken blackout haze after jamming with a couple random guys at the edge of the canal. Lord knows what kind of shit show performance we gave. Singing out wildly in screeching cat-like chords. The prospect of video evidence rightly frowned upon. The ideal case in Poison would have been the bartender seeing me, then with unspoken alertness, magically bring out my guitar from a hidden corner in the back room. And that's exactly what happened. Pasha was behind the bar and when his eyes met mine a knowing smirk came over his face as he automatically headed for the back to retrieve the lonesome six-string. It was not the first time this had happened.  He had also been there the previous night so no doubt watched me go completely berserk as he had done so many times before. The beauty of it was that he barely spoke any English. This, coupled with my corresponding lack of Russian, meant our friendship consisted of hi-fives, nods, winks, alcohol transactions and guitar returns. This was much more agreeable than the unappealing alternative of him always relaying to me the unsavory details of my past night's behavior, which were usually buried beneath a merciful fog of memory death. His thoughts and words forever remained a convenient mystery.

Pasha returned from the back room, handed me my guitar and the moment of truth came. Should I stay or should I go? That timeless question which has determined the fate of many a fine intention. And pulling another all-nighter was certainly not my intention. But one did not simply go to Poison and not pull an all-nighter. One stayed to the bitter end, the dawn hours when humans reverted back to their ancient ancestral skullduggery. Poison still crawled and boomed at closing time, 7am. I hesitated for a moment at the bar. The push and pull could be felt, vying for dominance. Then, as is often the case with indecisive moments, the decision was made for me.

“Dave!” 

I turned instinctively to the familiar call of my name and saw some strange long-haired guy with an unkempt black beard and sparkly black eyes smiling stupidly at me. He looked like a cuddly version of Charles Manson. His face was familiar but there was no chance in hell of remembering his name or how exactly we knew each other. A very common situation. People yelling “Dave!”, me turning around, not knowing who they were, then smiling and giving them a hi-five like best friends, making certain to guide the conversation away from names or shared history. For all I knew there could have been an army of twenty-something barflys buzzing around the Dumskaya area who knew all my dark secrets. People whom I had unknowingly confided in and divulged all my inner fears and desires while stuck inside a thick boozy cloud and the merciful fog of memory death. The struggle was real. Entering a bar, unsure of who knows you, who you've spoken to, or worst of all, who you've told your life history to. A constant brigade of alco-strangers existed who probably knew stories about my past that some immediate family members didn't even know. The raggedy array of dive bar therapists. So my spine was sensitively attuned to the unmistakable and dreaded yell of “Dave!” behind my back.

The guy was sitting at the middle of Poison’s three booths with a blonde girl who looked like she had just left her office job. 

“Dave! Come to drink!” he said.

I looked at Pasha, who knowingly grinned. The decision had been made, the die had been cast. I pointed to the tap of the cheapest beer, Pasha started pouring, the game was on. I brought the beer to the table and sat next to bright-eyed Charles Manson and this girl who looked like she was expecting news of a stock market crash at any moment. This guy obviously thought my Russian level was above shitty because right away he bombarded me with a rapid-fire stream of incomprehensible sounds. A full-scale barrage of wild noises came speeding towards me while I sat dumbly, nodding, not understanding a single goddam word, at various intervals grunting out “uh-huh” or “da”. 

My only respite was being able to light up cigarettes whenever the need arose. Cigarettes were still allowed indoors back then. The golden age of the St. Petersburg dive bar. And nowhere in Russia were dive bars as celebrated as in the central alco-district of Dumskaya. And nowhere in Dumskaya was the debauchery as glorious as in the guttural dank lair of Poison, the notorious rock n roll karaoke bar. Small in area, as all Dumskaya bars were, the bacchanalia of Poison usually got started around midnight, packed with the cream of Petersburg’s youth looking to indulge in cheap booze, unlimited cigarettes, and memory death. All while singing, or more likely screaming out, their favorite rock songs. There were no DJ’s in the proper sense at Poison and the music didn't consist of any set playlists or random shuffles. Rather there was a guy or girl standing behind a little makeshift counter near an equally little makeshift stage taking people's song requests and plugging them into the karaoke machine. So the background music of this tiny place consisted solely of drunk Russians (with a smattering of drunk foreigners) wailing out popular rock songs in hilarious drunk voices. Totally free of charge and totally crazy. Everything in English. In fact Poison’s entire songbook was only songs in English. Hundreds of songs spanning all eras of rock and pop. From The Beatles to Nirvana, Sex Pistols to Madonna, Led Zeppelin to Amy Winehouse, Queen to Radiohead, AC/DC to System of a Down. The walls and lighting were all in a deep, burlesque red, with disco balls and clouds of cigarette smoke engulfing the atmosphere. The bathrooms were unspeakable, the couches crusted in human embarrassment. It was authentically filthy and gloriously depraved. A total original.

I sat there chugging beer and sucking down cigarettes while the odd couple of bright-eyed Charles Manson and office lady spoke about God knows what. At one point the guy turned to me and, in a thick Russian accent, said “Dave, I'm sorry, she my sister. We talk. It's ok?”

“It's ok.”

“Hi,” the girl said to me.

“Hi.”

They started talking to each other again in unintelligible tones. I played with my phone while taking abnormally large gulps of beer. My guitar was back with Pasha behind the counter in expectation of what would inevitably commence. Again, one did not simply enter Poison to have a single, relaxing drink. A rule which applied to the whole district. Dumskaya had a special character. One sensed it when taking a right on Dumskaya street from Nevsky Prospekt. The music got a little louder, the buildings got a little shabbier, sidewalk trash cans began overflowing with beer bottles, sidewalk ashtrays began overflowing with cigarette butts, drunken laughter emerged, possibly someone peeing inside a courtyard, and questionable balloons appeared in people's hands. It was a place for people who knew exactly what they wanted to do: party hard til the sun came up. A T-intersection formed the backbone of the area. Packed with bars, liquor stores, and late night food joints. Dive bar after dive bar lined the streets with legendary names such as Fidel, Dacha, Belgrade, Morrison, Quarenghi, and Chyort Pobery. Surrounded on all sides by St. Petersburg’s most famous landmarks. Nevsky Prospekt, Gostiny Dvor, Kazan Cathedral, Griboedova canal. Dumskaya was its own self-contained organism which hadn't seen a sober day since the fall of the Soviet Union. 

It grew later, my previous companions had disappeared into some macabre corner of the night, the booth was all mine. Just then a loud group of girls entered. I recognized two of them.  

“Sasha! Nina!”

Two girls snapped their heads back, looked at me, and let out a burst of noise.

“DAVEY!” 

Sasha and Nina were two lesbians who had befriended me one drunken whirlwind night. The clincher of the friendship was when Sasha and I both peed in the forbidden courtyard of some palace while Nina was sitting on my shoulders. From that moment on our antics together only became stranger and stranger. Sasha was trying to start her own T-shirt company and Nina was a freelance artist. They were both very skinny, pale white, dark hair, cute, with that short hipster haircut that flows across the forehead like feathers in the breeze. They joined me in the booth and started rolling handmade cigarettes.

“Davey what you doing here alone? Hm?” Nina asked. 

“I came to get my guitar, then I had a beer…”

“Uh-oh, Davey’s gonna have fun tonight!”

“Yeah, maybe.”

“Davey, did you write that guy I sent you?” Sasha asked.

“What guy?”

“Davey! The guy I sent you about the music!”

“Oh yeah that guy. Nope haven't written him.”

“Davey! And why not? You said you wanna start a group. This guy can help.”

“I know but, there's been too much Poison this week.”

“Davey! That's not reason. You always telling us how you wanna start a group. So what's the problem? Send the guy a message!”

“I will message him. I will. But first I'm gonna sing some songs.”

“Is Davey ready to sing tonight?” Nina asked.

“I might be ready. I've already been here for a couple hours.”

“Maybe Davey gonna do the Green Day song again?”

“We'll see. Good chance.”

“Haha it was so funny last time. You left with Tonya's jacket. You didn't know what was happening.”

“Davey do you still have that jacket?” Sasha asked.

“No, I gave it to the other Sasha to give back to her.”

“Ok, I think your jacket is still with her.”

“Did she wear my jacket home?”

“Yes! And she look like some mafia gangster it was so big for her.”

“I still don't know how you could wear Tonya's jacket home,” said Nina, “Davey it was a girl's jacket! How it could even fit on you?!”

“I don't know, but somehow I woke up the next morning in my bed using that tiny jacket as a blanket.”

“Haha that's our Davey!”

“So how are Daria and Nadia? Have they broken up?”

“Oh, Davey, yes! We forget to tell you. Yes Daria left Nadia and now she living with Olga.”

“What? She already found another girl to  live with?”

“You know what it is the expression we have for lesbians in Piter?”

“Um, I don't think so.”

“Oh how to say…?” Nina started mouthing words trying to translate.

“On a second date you bring suitcase!” said Sasha.

“Yes something like that! What do lesbians bring on the second date Davey?”

“What?”

“A suitcase!”

“Haha good one.”

“It sounds better on Russian. But who cares let's drink no?”

We drank. And drank. The booze kept flowing. People came and went. Poison turned into a living, breathing creature with fire dragon breath. We got lost in the mad shuffle of party people. Before long I found myself at a different booth surrounded by a cornucopia of girls. A blonde Swedish girl named Karla, in a very high midriff and very short black skirt, a British girl named Becky wearing a green beanie over long brown hair, and Svetlana, a cute little Russian girl in an unbuttoned black and red flannel. The names were only recalled later when an embarrassing Instagram post showed up with all of us tagged in it. That wasn't everyone though. At the very edge of the booth sat a random Russian guy with a mullet sitting sending out truly creepy vibes. Nina and Sasha had vanished without a trace. The scene was apocalyptic. People talking, yelling, spitting, smoking, drinking from all sides until everything blended into a mishmash of primal indulgence. I told this motley group of strangers my name was Sven from Iceland, and attempted to sound Icelandic. Everyone bought it. I periodically did this, both out of boredom and a desire to troll, but also to mask my American identity whenever I wasn't in the mood to answer the same questions over and over again.

So everyone at the booth was referring to me as Sven as I did my best Icelandic accent in this pit of pure madness. 

“How long are you here for Sven?” Becky asked.

“Oh, I've been here long time. Doing business.”

“What kind of business?”

“Importing the medical equipment.” 

This might seem like a totally out of nowhere response but in fact it was one of my earlier jobs in Russia.

“I was in Iceland last year,” Karla said, “which place are you from?” 

Nobody had ever questioned me about my supposed Icelandic hometown before. The only place I knew was the capital but had no idea how to properly pronounce it like a local.

“Reykjavik,” I said with laughably guttural tones. Sounded like somebody starting up a lawnmower.

“Oh, yeah. It’s nice there.”

“Yeah. But I like it here better.”

“Where are the girls more beautiful?” asked Becky in her high British accent sounding like it came straight from a theatrical performance of Pride &amp; Prejudice. 

“Ze girls maybe are ze same beautiful but I like ze attitude of ze girls here more.”

“And plus they probably drink more vodka right?” 

“Maybe. Speaking about ze vodka who vants a Boyarski shot?” 

“A what? Boyarski? What’s that?” 

“It's ze classic St. Petersburg shot. Vodka, uh grenadine and uh Tabasco.”

“Tobasco?”

“Yes. It's very nice. Let's try, yeah?” My fake accent was slowly starting to sound more and more like Borat.

“Yes it's very good! You must to try!” Svetlana said.

“Ok why not?” said Becky. Karla was acting shy and keeping silent while the creepy Russian guy simply sat at the edge plotting some bloody doomsday scenario. I got up and ordered five Boyarskis, winking at Pasha as he poured Petersburg’s most distinctive shot. 

“Ok, here we have ze fun,” I said upon returning to the table. My accent was getting ridiculous.


A shot was placed in front of everyone. Even the suspiciously silent mullet guy

“So what do they say in Iceland?” Becky asked. I panicked for a moment then remembered what most of Scandinavia said for toasts.

“Skol!” 

“Ok,” she continued, “should we say skol or na zdoriviya? That's what’s said in Russia isn't it?” 

“No it's not true! No one says that!” Svetlana said.

“Let's say skol...” 

We all turned our heads in collective horror to find that those words had been uttered by the creepy guy at the edge of the booth. His first words. Ice cold in tone. Nobody knew who he was or where he had come from. He was just there. Watching. Smoking. Biding his time. Waiting for the moment to strike.

“Ok skol!” I said. 

Everyone joined in the toast, sucked back their shot, then immediately lit up a cigarette. The table was a fortress of smoke. Impenetrable to prying eyes. Just then the DJ called out my song on the microphone. Pearl Jam “Black”. One of my trademark songs. 

“Oh it's my song!” 

My accent was slowly fading away but everyone was too boozed up to notice. 

“Really? Are you going to go sing?” asked Becky.

“Oh yes!”

I jumped up and hopped over to the tiny makeshift stage and took the microphone from Nastya, the hot DJ with long curly hair who was also the frontgirl of a popular local band. She smiled and nodded in expectation. She was a big fan of my particular rendition of this tune, which I had sung countless times in her presence during the previous couple years. The song began and I growled out the lyrics in my distinctly amateurish way. What made this song memorable for everyone was singing the entire “do do do do do do do” part at the end even after there were no more lyrics on the karaoke screen.

“Thank you Dave!” Nastya said as I walked through the crowd amid a wall of smoke back to the booth. Luckily it didn't seem as if anybody had noticed my real name being called out. Too many glasses clinking and lighters flaring.

“Well done!” Becky said.

“Thanks. Zis song is very popular in Iceland.”

“You're not really from Iceland, yeah?” Karla asked.

“Yezz! Yezz I am! You don't believe me?”

“No.”

“I think maybe it’s a time to have another Boyarski no?”

We took another shot and before I knew it our booth had turned into a midnight movie. Svetlana started it off by leaning over to kiss scantily-clad Karla. Karla accepted this kind gesture and paid it forward by leaning over to kiss Becky. All of this going on right in front of me as I leaned back, smoked a cigarette and spread my arms out on the booth like an Icelandic Scarface. At some point I got into the kissing action too and our group pretty much devolved into a late 90’s rap video or perhaps a mid-80’s hair band video. Creepy guy was not exempt from the freakshow. The time had finally come for him to make a move and without so much as a slither he creeped over to Becky, who was only too glad to suck faces with any suitor available. 

At that moment Nastya the DJ called out another of my songs - The Cure “Close to Me”. I released my face from Svetlana and returned to the tiny little makeshift stage. After my overly emotional rendition of the song it was time to use the bathroom. Poison was packed and maneuvering the 10 short steps to the toilet meant shimmying sideways and brushing up against hordes of sweaty merry-makers, most of whom were smoking without any thought as to where their ash fell. On the couch in the small adjacent room a group of people who looked like 1991 Nirvana roadies were pounding down shots, bouncing around as if on a trampoline, and yelling all sorts of nonsensical animal grunts. A very fine image of an anonymous beautiful girl with luscious eyes and equally luscious lips had been hand-drawn (without permission of course) on the wall and a couple hipster girls in retro glasses were photographing it from all angles.

There was a short line for the bathroom, which was two stalls protected by two short rickety doors that looked like entrance gates to a biker saloon in hell. The whole area was splattered with unsupervised graffiti, wet toilet paper wads and thick, dark, plaster-like substances which were no doubt spawned from the prince of darkness himself. The waste baskets were overflowing with toilet paper and the floor was littered with paper towels. It was an acceptable enough place to urinate but God help you and your kin if the uncontrollable urge to defecate made itself known in that altar of filth. One of the toilets didn't even have a seat and hunting for toilet paper usually meant digging through the unspeakable contents of the radioactive waste baskets. Both stalls had been closed for an abnormal amount of time when finally, after much commotion which everybody could hear, a familiar scene transpired. A guy and a girl nonchalantly emerged from the same stall with embarrassed yet proud looks on their faces. One of the guys in front of me gave them a sharp reprimand for holding up the line but everyone knew this kind of tomfoolery was to be expected at Poison.

Back at the booth things seemed to be getting on just fine. Which meant everybody was smoking and making out with each other. I got another beer from Pasha and rejoined the mayhem. 

“Where have you been?” asked Becky.

“I vas singing my song and zen I vent to za bathroom.” 

My “Icelandic” accent was so sloppy you could have poured it on fries and eaten it after a night of brutal alcohol abuse. Looking around I noticed Svetlana had an American flag patch on her purse.

“You like America?” 

“What? Oh yes, Sven, very much. It is my dream to live in Los Angeles.” 

“Have you been there?”

“No, never. But I think it is a magic place.”

“Why?”

“What, you kidding? It's Los Angeles! City of stars, Hollywood, Beverly Hills, the beach. It's a paradise I think.”

“Well I've been there. I like it here better.”

“What? How can you say so you crazy man!”

Instead of answering I immediately started making out with her again, then she immediately started making out with Karla again, who immediately started making out with Becky again, who, in turn, immediately started making out with the creepy Russian guy again. Smoke-drenched saliva forming a melting pot of international debauchery. 

Suddenly it was 5am. Daylight had been showing through the windows for an hour. Summertime in St. Petersburg leaves little room for darkness. Poison was still packed as if the concept of linear time didn't exist. Nobody wanted to descend from this trash heap of glory. Nobody wanted reality to creep in. Everybody wanted to squeeze out every last drop of Poison’s sweetly addictive nectar. My last song was called out - Billy Idol “Rebel Yell”. The song I usually finished the night with and sang with reckless wild abandon. Smashing vocal chords which had already been sufficiently smashed from seven straight hours of first and second hand smoke. After the song I roamed around the bar, still chugging beer, getting into bits of conversation with a seemingly endless array of oversized drunken characters. The soft red glow of Poison’s interior covering all thoughts of tomorrow with blood red instincts of today.

While ordering another beer from Pasha, Svetlana appeared and joined me at the bar. 

“Where are the other girls?” I had totally abandoned and forgotten all about the Icelandic persona.

“They went back to hotel.”

“And what about you? Where are you going?”

“I don't know...” 

“Do you want to continue partying with me?”

“Maybe…”

“Maybe?”

“Maybe.”

“Well maybe I'll have one last Boyarski.”

“Hey, you are really from Iceland?”

“Why, you don't think so?”

“I think no. Your voice change you sound like you from America now.”

“You mean you don't think my name is Sven?”

“Come on! You kidding with me? Do you really?”

“Haha. Well, if you really want the truth, I'm from Los Angeles.” 

“What?! No, it's not possible.”

“That’s the truth. Here, look...” I pulled out my California driver's license from deep inside my wallet.

“Oh my God, really?! It's amazing! You really from Los Angeles?”

“Yep.”

“I can't believe, it's so cool.”

I pounded my last Boyarski shot with a vengeance. 

“Then why you here in Russia?”

“I'll tell you later.”

“Wow it's so cool. Wait here ok? I must to go to bathroom then we can go somewhere ok?”

I gave her the thumbs up sign, “Ok.”

I went outside to get some fresh air and have the night's last cigarette. It was getting close to 6am and the street was full of crazy all-night partiers yelling, drinking, smoking, inhaling sketchy balloons, and lining up for post-party shavermas, the quintessential Russian drunk food. The sun’s rays were making their way to the street. A casual observer wouldn't have been able to tell if it was 6am or 6pm. I semi-consciously looked around at everybody. Kids everywhere released from inhibitions living out their fantasies in this debauched playground. This exact scene had been my life for the better part of four years. A continuous cycle. It had been fun. Too fun. Dangerously fun. Still, something nagged. Always this nagging feeling. Using alcohol to get rid of this nagging feeling of wasting away, which only served to accelerate the wasting away. A guy who was so drunk he could barely walk passed by and asked me for a cigarette. Which meant he pointed at me, made a few grunting noises, mimed smoking a cigarette, then made a few more grunting noises. In a flash moment right then I knew it was vitally necessary to get away from this downward spiral. Go home. Go stand on a bridge over Griboedova canal. Go on a trip. Go somewhere. Anywhere but there. I began walking away from Poison. Svetlana was expecting to find me waiting for her at the bar. Expecting to come home with me. Possibly even expecting me to take her to Los Angeles. But suddenly the prospect of a sloppy one-night stand sounded more like a burden than a blessing. I walked away faster, hoping the night wouldn’t follow me. A moment later I heard a shout from outside Poison. 

“Hey Sven!” 

It was the creepy Russian guy! I turned around instinctively.

“Hey Sven, your girl is looking for you!”

I smiled, waved, then turned and kept right on walking away. In the distance I heard him keep calling out “Sven! Sven! Sven!”

,Ijustwatched,"This prequel, sequel and so much more than equal to 2008’s surprise smash hit plays to every strength of its ludicrous premise, star-studded cast and indestructible jukebox soundtrack. Amanda Seyfried returns as Sophie, no longer planning the wedding of her dreams but instead a celebration for her recently passed mother and former Dancing Queen, Donna (Meryl Streep). The narrative flits between Sophie’s attempts to do right by her mother, her longing for distant Man After Midnight, Sky (Dominic Cooper) and the past flings of the young Donna (Lily James).

One might argue that having a predisposition to ABBA might make you a tad biased towards *Here We Go Again* (as the proud inheritor of a signature edition CD of their greatest hits, I plead guilty), but I’d argue that anyone with a beating heart would feel the same. It doesn’t matter how reluctant you feel going in, how utterly illogical the timeframes, nor how much your ears bleed from Pierce Brosnan’s crooning; the instant Seyfried lets loose the first strains of ‘Thank You For The Music’, the battle is all but lost.

The first *Mamma Mia* is a fun film. The second is a great one. It’s funnier (a single line from Christine Baranski damn near slew me), better-looking, genuinely well-acted and has emotion simply bursting from every pore. James is a total dream in the lead role, and her supporting cast take up the challenge with fizzing aplomb. The three younger incarnations of Sam, Harry and Bill (Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgård hand the stage to Jeremy Irvine, Hugh Skinner and Josh Dylan) are all suitably dashing. Gold stars are awarded to supporting turns from Cher (in a late appearance as Sophie’s grandmother) and Omid Djalili (playing a perfectly po-faced passport officer).

The songs are still largely crowbarred in, but this time around it’s a knowing, satisfying kind of shoehorn delivered by a script that knows exactly what you came for. Besides a smattering or reprisals, the chosen playlist is rife with a selection of underplayed classics (‘Angeleyes’ was a particular hit with my tear ducts) and pushes the boundaries of credulity beyond breaking point: the circumstances surrounding a performance of ‘Fernando’ are so incredulous that you’ll positively (if not literally) shriek with joy. And joy is the dish of the day in this smorgasbord of cheese, cheers and Cher, making *Here We Go Again* the surest hit of this summer: boy, is it gonna make money, money, money.

,SquaredCircle,"Here's a quick write up I did for the matches/feuds going in to Slammiversary. I apologize in advance for my bad writing and formatting, this is my first time doing one of these. I've linked the playlists from the Impact YouTube channel in case anyone wants some visuals or is interested in certain feuds and wants to see the videos.

[Road to Slammiversary Preshow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdSmbmEf3Zw&amp;t=159s)

---

[Tessa Blanchard vs Allie:](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcovtt7Bdo9PElt4jio20NXSoEETMw5gv)

* Tessa made her Impact in ring debut against Kiera Hogan defeating her and continued to attack her after the match. This prompted Madison Rayne who was guest commentator for the match to come in and break up the brawl. Madison ended up getting the better of Tessa in two separate matches following that altercation with Tessa attacking her after both and more times after those. Finally Allie had enough with Tessa’s bullying so she ran down to put a stop to another beat down from Tessa setting up for this match at Slammiversary.

Rich Swann vs Fenix vs Johnny Impact vs “Bone Soldier” Taiji Ishimori:

* No real build for this match as it’s an International X-hibition match showcasing Impact’s partnerships/talents but I wouldn't be surprised if it has X-Division contendership ramifications. Johnny Impact has been gone for a few months now after being taken out by Kongo Kong, Rich Swann recently debuted having stellar performances tagging with and facing Fenix but suffered a concussion at MLW's Battle Riot so it’s unclear if he will be able to compete tonight, Taiji Isjimori is a former X-Division Champion returning to Impact after joining NJPW where he became the Bone Soldier for the Bullet Club and Fenix has wow’d the Impact audience since his debut at Impact vs Lucha Underground.

Edit: Swann has been pulled from the match up due to his injury. Petey Williams will be his replacement. 

[Tommy Dreamer vs Eddie Edwards in a House of Hardcore Match:](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcovtt7Bdo9NGS_C2tjZtlhFSaecZdJRg)

* Edwards has been in a downward spiral since SamI Callihan hit him in the head with a baseball bat, shattering his orbital socket and crushing his nose. This obsession with revenge has caused Edwards to push away his friends and family and turn on anyone who he deems in his way to Callihan. Tommy Dreamer has been involved in this since the original House of Hardcore match teaming with Eddie and Moose against OVE at Redemption. He’s seen Eddie attack his own wife and him descend further and further in to madness trying to kill Callihan. Dreamer has tried everything he can to prevent Eddie’s obsession from completely consuming him like his did with Raven stopping him from ending Callihan on 3 separate occasion. The stress of this has also caused Eddie’s wife Alisha to leave him and take their belongings from the house. In a final attempt to break through to Eddie, Tommy confronted him, pleading with him to stop and mentioned how he hasn’t talked to Alisha in weeks. This caused Eddie to snap and get in Dreamer’s face asking him how he knew that, forcing Tommy to push him down and Edwards retaliated by hitting him in the head with a cane. Edwards finally crossed the line attacking Dreamer at a House of Hardcore show, driving a wooden shard in to his head till he bled. Edward’s may have an obsession with Callihan but now Dreamer has an obsession with him.

[Pentagon Jr vs Sami Callihan in a Mask vs Hair match:](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcovtt7Bdo9MR8DY55hU6erU7bQjsPm80)

* Being the usual deplorable human being that Sami Callihan is and since he didn’t have to worry about Eddie Edwards trying to actively murder him for a time, decided he wanted to start a Luchador Mask collection. This started with OVE trying to take El Hijo de Fantasma’s mask after a match which ruffled the feathers of Pentagon Jr who came to the aid of his fellow luchador. Callihan would actually get the better of Pentagon Jr in a cage match with the help of Jake and Dave Crist and stole Pentagon’s mask. Pentagon soon snapped back issuing a challenge to Callihan for a Mask vs Hair match which Callihan happily accepted. The story doesn't end there however, After an amazing match between Fenix and Rich Swann, Jake and Dave Crist ran down attacking Fenix. Pentagon rushed to the aid of his brother and fending off the Crist’s...till he gave Fenix a low blow, hit the Fear Factor Piledriver on him and ripped off his own mask revealing himself to be Callihan! OVE almost had Fenix’s mask till the real Pentagon Jr made the save for his brother setting up a six man tag match the next week that OVE won by pinning Rich Swann. Pentagon would have the last laugh going in to Slammiversary by potentially breaking the arms of Jake and Dave while Callihan was tied to a chair and forced to watch.

[LAX (c) vs The OGz in a 5150 Street Fight:](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcovtt7Bdo9MZXqAeLLmtkIR2eLN2eyXG)

* At Redemption Santana and Ortiz found out someone tried to take out Konnan, this caused them to lose focus and cost them their Tag-Team Championships. What followed was a losing streak until backup finally arrived in the form of King. Under King’s leadership the team started winning again and recaptured the Tag-Team Championships but soon there was trouble in paradise with the return of Konnan. Konnan accused King of being the one who set up the hit on him which King fessed up to claiming he did it for the better of the group as Konnan was the old and King was the new. Santana and Ortiz sided with Konnan forcing King to go with plan B, Homicide and Hernandez, who jumped Santana, Ortiz and Konnan during the confrontation solidifying the formation of the OGz and the challenge for a 5150 Street Fight was laid down.

[Matt Sydal (c) vs Brian Cage for the X-Division Championship:](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcovtt7Bdo9N4ilN_RwTKlrD16mhhRA8f)

* Matt Sydal has become spiritually enlightened, centering his energy, opening his third eye and became an overall douche. Brian Cage on the other hand is on a path of destruction having never been pinned or submitted since his debut even holding 2 straight pinfall victories over “Walking Armageddon” Bobby Lashley. This however isn’t the first time these two have met over the X-Division Championship. After outside interference from Kongo Kong, Sydal managed to scrape by and retain against The Machine via count out. It would take Brain Cage overcoming the Monster of Impact Kongo Kong one on one to earn the chance to challenge for the X-Division Championship once again at Slammiversary.

[Su Yung (c) vs Madison Rayne for the Knockouts Championship:](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcovtt7Bdo9Mp5k5wr1nwSrCzISF8Vzqb)

* Madison Rayne had no intention on getting back in to the ring again let alone challenging for the Knockouts Championship. But fate intervened and Madison could stand by on commentary as Tessa Blanchard attacked Kiera Hogan after beating her in a match. Through a string of upset victories Rayne has found herself in the hunt for the Knockouts Championship and in Su Yung’s nightmares.

[Austin Aries (c) vs Moose for the World Championship:](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcovtt7Bdo9N0LVAeXQJl22gpS07MrzRw)

* Even all the way back to Austin’s town hall meeting with the Impact lockeroom to address him losing the Impact World Championship at Redemption, he and Moose have been butting heads. Moose has given himself the moniker “Mr. Impact Wrestling” and claims 2018 is the year of Moose, the year Moose gets Impact World Championship gold around his waist. Earlier in the year Moose actually had a World Championship match in the form of a Feast or Fired briefcase but Eli Drake beat him for his case with some assistance from Sami Callihan. Drake would go on to cash in his Tag-Team title match he had from feast or fired and win at Redemption but the fall quickly came as he lost his Tag-Team titles to Z&amp;E followed by his World Championship match to Pentagon. The number one contendership came down to Eli and Moose having a one on one match where Moose came out the victor. Sparks soon began to fly between Aries and Moose once again during the Slammiversary press conference with Austin throwing some personal jabs towards Moose and his failed football career. However Moose wouldn’t let the mind games get to him and secluded himself training with his good friend DeAngelo Williams but that didn’t stop Aries from running his mouth. DeAngelo made an appearance to give an update on Moose’s progress while training and was rudely interrupted and then attacked by the belt collector himself with a steel chair. On the go home show for Slammiversary Aries and Moose were supposed to have one final face to face confrontation, the first time the two has been in the same building for weeks. Aries ever the strategist attacked Moose from behind with a low blow and a chair while he was distracted but this didn’t keep Moose down for long as he then then cleared the ring of Austin leaving the champion running with his tail between his legs before their match up.

,ShitpostXIV,"I think....it's decided.

It's going to take some time.

I'm already tired as you can tell, but yeah, I'm still making this thread. All right.

I will attempting to do, uh - it's not like is my thread or anything -

yeah, hello, my name is u/futureffxiv, and I will be attempting the longest great community btw ever. I will fail, just so you know, so don't get surprised. Alright. Got my drink, just in case.




HUGE wall of text incoming. If you don't plan to read it all, I don't really have a tl;dr. If you want to understand why I wrote this thread, you'll have to read the whole thing. Sorry, but if you're even remotely interested in what I have to say, please read it to the end.

Like many of us, I was, and still am, pretty sad that I wasn't able to procure some Fan Fest tickets to Las Vegas. I love the game, and of course, wanted to show that and enjoy myself with friends at Fan Fest. But recently, my reasons for wanting to go to Fan Fest changed quite drastically.

My grandfather passed away a few months ago. He was 100 years old. It hurt, but I understood that he had lived a tremendously good life. But the worst part of it was that the last few years of his life, he would drift in and out of his own mind. Sometimes he would remember us, and sometimes he wouldn't. We took care of most of his daily needs, and honestly, I feel like the grandpa I knew had left us a long time ago. Why am I starting with this? I think it'll make more sense down the line, but that's all I'll mention of my grandfather for now.

A few weeks ago, my dog who had been with me for 12 years, was having diarrhea issues. Yeah, I know. Sorry for the image lol. It's important though. Anyway, we (as in my family and I) cleaned her up and gave her some medicine hoping it was just some bad food or a small stomach hiccup. For a little while after, she was doing fine, so we figured whatever it was had passed. I thought, ""She's getting old, but she still acts like when we first got her. Maybe I'll grab some things from the store for her."" I bought her some Cesar Softies dog treats since she didn't have much teeth left at her age haha. I also gave her a bath once a week as opposed to my family's policy of ""every once in a while."" I usually didn't give her baths myself because my father would normally do it, but I just kind of felt like I needed to for once.

Later, a few days after tickets went on sale, and I, obviously, did not manage to get any, I began to notice my dog was having problems. She wasn't producing any visible stool, and she was still licking to clean herself even though, as far as we could tell, there was nothing to be cleaned. When I looked to check down there, it was pretty ghastly. The base of her tail and her backside were extremely swollen. I thought perhaps maybe she was just still feeling the effects of her recent episode or might have an infection. It was a Friday night and the vet was closed though, so I figured I'd wait until Monday to bring her in.

So I woke up the next day, Saturday, just looking to enjoy my birthday. Most of my birthday passed, and I suppose it was ""alright."" Nothing too crazy, but it was relaxing. Later that night, however, I came to the realization that my dog, for the second day now, had not managed to pass anything out. I was beginning to get pretty concerned. Coincidentally, my family had planned a trip to the beach starting from Monday until Friday. I wasn't planning to go because due to my skin's rather persistent heat-induced rashes, the sun isn't exactly my best friend. I also wanted to stay home and make sure my dog would be alright and bring her to the vet. So I spent most of that Sunday just thinking of what to do and asking around for advice on what might be causing problems. I went through an array of advice like ""She might have impacted anal glands"" or ""Try some pumpkin!"" By the end of the day, still nothing. This marked day three.

I slept terribly that night. Or rather I tried to. I might have been asleep for maybe 2 hours that day. There were a lot of things going through my mind, but nearly all of them were things I didn't want to believe. I called the nearby vet early that morning. Just as an aside, I have a terrible sleep schedule. I probably get my sleep between 6 AM to 2 PM on most days. I had to log into my father's computer that day since he couldn't, so I couldn't leave the house until after 10 AM. I called the vet at 10:30. They said they'd take my dog right away, and I could come in as soon as possible.

Just some background on my dog. She always goes nuts when I'm out of sight for more than 5 minutes lol. I know for most people, that sounds like some pretty serious separation anxiety. I'll admit that it is. My dog loved me a little too much. But it was okay, I work from home and don't usually go out, so for the most part I'm actually not that far away. Though it's weird when she starts pawing at the bathroom door. She also knows when I plan to leave. Getting dressed, grabbing my car keys, and walking around the house were the signs she knew meant I'd be leaving. Except this time, I was taking her with me (though she didn't know that).

I grabbed a leash out of courtesy for the vet. In the 12 years I've had my dog, she has needed the leash maybe once. She was so attached to me that I could walk around the neighborhood or in front of my house, and she would stick to me like glue. But this time, I figured probably safe to put her on a leash in case other dogs were there. My dog also hates to be picked up. So I did my best to get her to walk out of the house to my car on her own. For anyone that has ever had a dog like mine, you can probably imagine the struggle it was haha

She would always stand behind me as I opened the front door because she'd either whine or want to watch me as I went. So since she was already behind me, I tried to convince her to come with me. She ... eventually did, and I helped her up into the car so we could drive over to the vet. Wasn't too far. About 5 minutes. We get there, and she adamantly did not want to leave the car. If it were home, she'd have jumped out in seconds, but the place was unfamiliar. She was clearly pretty anxious about being out of the house. I felt for her, but I knew if she needed help, we'd get it at the vet. I picked her up and gave her a bit of pulling, and she gave in and followed. As anxious as she was, she was a good girl when it came to actually following me. She didn't really want anything else but to be with me, so it made sense.

I walk in, and to my relief, no other patients were there. The receptionist asked me if my dog had ever been there before or if she'd had any shots recently, and I had to embarrassingly admit no to both. As much as I loved my dog, my family has always been pretty laid back in taking care of our dogs. We'd trim her fur and cut her nails, but things like going to the vet, vaccination, and cleaning her teeth were kind of extra. To my relief again, the receptionist didn't seem to mind. I guessed that this thing was pretty common, which was logical. For a few minutes, I sat down, and tried to calm down my dog. She was always anxious outside of the house, and there wasn't really anywhere comfortable to sit here. Luckily, within a few minutes, the doctor came out and called us in.

As my very nervous dog walked in with me, the doctor asked me to explain what the problem seemed to be. I explained that my dog had some issues a few weeks ago, and that her tail and back area looked really bad. I also explained that it's been a few days since she's managed to pass anything so I was hoping he'd be able to do something for her. I mentioned that I thought it might be impacted anal glands and that was it. He asked me to help her up onto the examination table to check what was wrong. He, and his assistants gently held her still to check her eyes and her heart. He mentioned a heart murmur which could sometimes be an indication of heartworms but also that heart murmurs were common in small dogs so it probably wasn't too serious. It didn't really startle me as I didn't really think there was anything wrong with her heart.

Then he went to check her behind. Almost immediately, I imagine probably out of reflex, he said that among the many cases of things he's seen like this, this was the worst one ever. I didn't know him personally, but I knew this vet had been working here for a very long time. My heart sank. It wasn't the news I wanted to hear after all the worrying and sleepless hours. I vehemently wanted him to just say it was impacted anal glands and that he'd have it fixed right away. He said he'd, out of procedure, try to express them and see if it helped at all. Blood. So much blood. Though he hadn't said it yet, I knew what it meant. It wasn't just bad. It was beyond bad. He said he'd bring her to the back to examine further, and asked that I sit down for a bit. As they went to the back, I could feel the separation anxiety reverse. It was I that didn't want to be away from my dog at that moment.

When he came back, though I knew what he was going to say, he was a hard man to read. I imagine someone who had to give bad news often wasn't supposed to be. He said that cancer had invaded my dog. But not only was it bad, it was also abhorrently aggressive. So obscenely fast that even if we had caught it early, we would never have been able to stop it. The opening left for her to pass things through was about a millimeter wide. There was no hope. He mentioned the possibility of a specialist looking at it, but that it would likely cost thousands of dollars and even then, with likely no success. I was still sitting at the time. I imagine if I wasn't, I would have anyway. I remember him mentioning giving me a few minutes to process the shock, and I mentally agreed with him as my entire body had gone numb. They also brought my dog back, and it was obvious she was happy to see me. I didn't know how to react to her return. She had come back, probably happier than anyone in this world could be, to see me. And I now had to decide how much longer before she wasn't allowed that privilege.

I faintly asked the doctor if there was anything I could do, even a little, but his only answer was that we could administer euthanasia or she would likely die within a week, and not without pain. Though I know he meant no harm, it stung like hell for him to tell me that ""If it were up to me, I'd do it right now."" That was how bad it was. That the threat of her pain would come so fast that immediate action was required. Yet when I looked down, all my dog would do was look at me with those same eyes as always. She probably didn't feel any pain. To her, the only thing on her mind was staying with me. The obvious answer was that I should do it, but of course, I asked the doctor for at least a day or two. He prescribed some painkillers and anti-inflammatory medicine for her for a few days, long enough to wait a few days for my parents to come back if necessary.

I walked out to the receptionist. She wasn't aware of what was going on, so she simply did her job and printed out the bill, and as usual I imagine, asked me about my dog. I told her the bad news, and she was, as expected, sympathetic. After filling out the bill, I kind of began to blabber. No one was home, and I soon realized that I desperately needed someone to talk to. Most of my friends were busy at work, so the only available person was this receptionist. I told her about my past experiences with dogs, and why this experience was...as far as possible from anything I would have wanted or expected.

I've had 5 dogs in my life. Our first dog was vicious. I was very young at the time. I barely remember it other than that it was needlessly aggressive. Its name was Blackie, I believe. It was uh, large and black lol. Sorry, I was like 3 or 4. Eventually it became such a problem that my father just drove and let it out onto a random street and abandoned it. By now, I imagine that dog is long gone, but I hope that perhaps it had a good life after it had left us. I was too young to do anything for it, and I regret that. Not too long after, we received a very young puppy from my aunt. Her dog had recently had her puppy, and they weren't able to take care of the puppy with the house often being empty. So my family took her in, and my, I believe 5 year old self, named her Milky due to her milky white fur. I know. I was 5. Don't think about it. Again, not too long after that, we took in another dog. It was a stray we found, I think. I can't remember the exact details. I named her Cutie. Stahp. Don't look at me like that.

Anyway, Cutie was an older dog. She was very passive, and generally just a calm presence in the house. Many years later, when I was still young, probably around 10 years old, Cutie passed away naturally. She simply decided to stop eating one day and hid in a corner of the house. I didn't realize it at the time, but I think she didn't want to scar me when I was so young. No one would ever claim she was the greatest dog, but I appreciated her as much as any of my dogs, and I was sad to see her go. Here's the shocker I imagine for many people who have owned pets. My family is Vietnamese, and knowledgeable Buddhists. We're not what you'd call devout, but we subscribe to many of the religion's ideas on morality and the idea of the afterlife. After Cutie had passed, my dad took her remains and...tossed them into a dumpster. Yeah. If you thought dumpster diving was bad, it just got potentially worse. My dogs could be in there. Anyway, my dad believes that dogs, natural wanderers as they are, should be allowed to roam free in the afterlife. So he tosses them into dumpsters, where most wild dogs find themselves out of habit.

It made sense to little me at the time. I wasn't very good at processing emotion at that time though. I was young and ""gifted"" as people liked to call it. I thought the word was synonymous with ""special"" at the time, but as I've grown older, I realize all it meant was that I processed things differently than others, emotions especially. So for years, I accepted it, unaware of how spared I was both because Cutie had died naturally, and because my father was the one who handled the remains and not myself.

Fast forward a good few years to my 15 year old self. We had taken in one more dog. It was Milky's mother. Her name was Snowflake for her white fur. I didn't name her this time, I swear. It was my cousin. He was young too when he named her. Still more creative than me though. Snowflake was always a very timid dog. She was generally terrified of everything. Lightning, rain, loud noises, people walking near her, and sometimes even petting. When she came to us, she was...severely neglected. I don't blame my cousin or his family for it. I imagine that was the reason they decided to give her to us. We were better equipped to take care of her than they were due to family problems. We had to give Snowflake an extreme haircut and a lot of cleaning. After a while, she warmed up to us, and I might even daresay she liked us. She and Milky naturally got along as mother and daughter, and it was endearing to see Milky take care of her very sickly mother. After some time, Snowflake's health started to decline even more than it already was. We got a bit worried, so my father ended up taking her to the vet while I was at school one day. I wasn't aware he had planned on it. When I came home, I changed out of my school clothes and walked throughout the house and after a realization asked my dad, ""Where's Snowflake?""

He simply said ""She's gone. I took her to the vet."" I have not the words to describe how devastating that was. I won't lie to you. I'm no more immune to the idea of favoritism than anyone else. If you had asked me if Snowflake was my favorite, I'd have easily said no, but she was still, at least to me, my dog. I didn't even get to say goodbye. And I most certainly, for a good while, felt like I didn't convey how much I cared until it was too late. My dad explained to me that she had...several diseases and cancer that made her quality of life severely below optimal. She wasn't just timid. She was...hurting. I accepted that. I hoped she was not in pain anymore.

So Snowflake was gone, and left behind was her daughter, whom because of what happened, I began to treat better. I spent a lot of time with Milky in the next few years. I'd often let her play in my room and gave her some treats that we normally wouldn't go out to buy. She was accompanied by my newest dog, Chi Chi. Named and given to us by my cousin. I have no idea why he named her that. Maybe he was watching DBZ at the time. They gave her to us because she didn't get along at all with their other dog. Even going so far as to jump on top of tables to poop lol. Both of them I treated well and loved more than anything. They were there for me in some of my hardest times between high school and college.

Milky was the family dog. There wasn't a single person in the family that didn't love having her. She was excellently potty trained, knew all the dog tricks, would go on walks, knew to wait for food, and even loved baths. She was like the paragon of good dog. Chi Chi on the other hand, was terribly potty trained, knew no dog tricks, hated going on walks, would whine for food all the time, and could not for the life of her stand baths. The only thing she arguably did right was loving me, and only me. She would bark at anyone else if they got too close to me without my permission. I loved them both.

Eventually, in my sophomore year of college, when I was about 20, Milky started vomiting pretty badly. We weren't really sure what it was, but we tried not to feed her anything too solid, and gave her small doses of Pepto Bismol in hopes she'd be okay. We knew she was getting old, so we didn't think it was anything beyond just old age catching up with her. My parents mentioned that it might be her time, so with tears in my eyes, I stroked her for at least an hour. Recalling every moment I had with her and telling her that I loved her. On the day after that, she was still alive. I wouldn't say she was fine, but she seemed...better. I was optimistic that we'd at least be together a little while longer. After waking up the next day, I went to class as usual, and on my way to throw my clothes into the basket, noticed she was lying funny and my grandmother was cleaning her up. I was running late so I didn't have much time to think about it. After class, I came home, but only Chi Chi was barking at the door.

I came in, and asked, for the second time in my life, where one of my dogs was, knowing I didn't want to hear the answer. My dad, as he usually does, answered stoically with ""She died this morning."" I realized that the glimpse of her I saw this morning was...her leaving this world. I was heartbroken beyond words. This was the dog that I'd shared most of my, and all of her, life with. And on the last day she was alive, she did her best to give me hope. So that I wouldn't see her suffer. She pulled out one more day for me, but it still wasn't enough. I later found out that her symptoms were indicative of a stomach virus. It was then that I realized why she tried so hard on that last day. It wasn't her time, and we didn't do enough for her. I was furious and I was heartbroken. Both with myself and my parents. I was tired of our passive attitude with taking care of our dogs. I wanted more time with my dog, and I gave up the chance.

So now, alone, Chi Chi stayed with me. Everywhere. I don't know if the traumatizing experience of watching Milky die made her want to cling to me, but she stuck close to me even harder after that. Eventually, I finished college and got a job shortly after. It was about a 35 minute drive away, and a classic 9-5 government job. It was terrible. I don't wanna get into the details, but it was lifesucking. But the best part of those days was coming home after a long, terrible day at work and seeing Chi Chi go nugging futz at the fact that I'd come home. To her, it probably felt like I had been gone for ages. Sometimes my father would open the front door, and she'd dash towards my car waiting for me to open the door. She'd jump onto my seat when I opened the car door. It was the cutest thing, and probably some of my fondest memories of her. Eventually, I had the luxury of working much closer to home, and now I actually work at home. It was both lucky for me and Chi Chi lol.

Those were the things I told that receptionist. I was there probably for an hour longer than I needed to. When I finally mentioned it was time to go home, she stood up and gave me a hug, saying she'd pray for me and Chi Chi. I knew there was no reason to pray, but I was glad to hear it all the same. I'm glad that someone understood my pain.

I went home with Chi Chi that day. I explained to my friends and parents that Chi Chi was likely going to have to be put to sleep. I don't think I could describe what I did when I got home as crying. I think if screaming actually gave me strength, I probably would have gone Super Saiyan by now. Maybe one of the higher forms. I wanted to cry and curse the world for being so unfair. No matter how well I treated her or how much I loved her, the world was going to rip away my last dog just like the other two. The one thing I wanted to prevent.

As a person, I absolutely hate things that I can't control. So many things in my life have been taken away because I didn't have the ability to stop it. Or rather, there was no power that could have stopped those things from disappearing. There was no hope nor solution. ""There's nothing you could have done"" is no consolation. Because I want to do something. I want to change things for the better, but you tell me that there is nothing to do. I can't accept that. I don't think I ever will.

I spent that night letting Chi Chi sleep after her anxious and long day. That's all she did most of the time. She just loved sleeping with me nearby. That was her bliss. That was all she wanted. That and food. I fed her some of the meds wrapped in ham which she was very happy to have. I wanted to believe maybe the meds would be just enough to help her, but I knew that wasn't going to happen. She was becoming increasingly more uncomfortable, but she kept trying to pass waste and kept licking at her behind. I knew why she was doing it. She wanted to get better. She wanted to fix the problem and stay with me. My heart was already broken, and it just kept shattering into even more pieces. She still wanted to stay with me, and there was no way that she could. If I had cried any harder that night, I think I might have dehydrated myself.

I also contacted my cousin that night and asked him if he wanted to come with me to say goodbye since he was her original owner. I also wanted someone to be there with me so I wouldn't get into a wreck, both physically and emotionally, on the way home. I didn't sleep that night. I wanted to spend as much time with Chi Chi as I could. I wanted to listen to her shift around in her sleep and let out exhales of relief as she found a good comfortable position. Listen to her get up and switch between her comfortable spot next to my closet, her little doggy bed, and next to the door to my room to fend off invaders if they decided to come in during my sleep.

Around 10 AM that day, I called the vet's office. I told them I'd like to schedule an appointment for euthanasia at 5 PM since they close at 6, and I know no one wants to go back to anything after doing something like this. I looked over to Chi Chi, and thought ""I should spend as much time with her as possible."" But her response? Sleep. Even on that last day haha. I realized that was what made her my dog. I decided, due to exhaustion, that I'd sleep for a bit too. So I slept on my bed. You can count it as next to her since she sleeps about 2 feet away from my bed. I woke up a few hours later at 1 PM. I wasn't very hungry, but I air fried some chicken nuggets. They were Chi Chi's favorite food, by far. She would stare at me and whine for several minutes whenever I had a plate. I'd even sometimes try to hide from her and eat in the kitchen instead of my room, and she'd still find me lol.

Though I didn't feel like eating, my body disagreed. I didn't eat much the previous day, but my stomach was pretty happy to have those chicken nuggets in it. I'd bite half and share the other half with Chi Chi, who sat below the table staring at me. I actually didn't usually give her nuggets in the dining room because we didn't want to enforce the habit of her eating in the house, but that day I gave her as many as she wanted. And I cried. She hadn't been able to poop for 4 days now. Yet still she loved those nuggets as if she were starving. I wished so hard that I could keep feeding them to her after today, but I knew it wouldn't be possible. Eventually, I couldn't eat anymore as my emotions began to close up my stomach. Chi Chi and I went back into the room and I just...did what I always do. I played on my computer and occasionally would get out of my chair to pet Chi Chi and tell her I loved her. I wanted her last day to be special, but I realized that to her, every day was special. It was incredibly hard, but I'm sure that was how she wanted it.

Eventually 4 PM rolled around, and my cousin arrived. He and I talked for a bit. He said he couldn't believe it, and I said neither could I. We reminisced and I let him eat some of the leftover chicken nuggets from earlier. Eventually it was 4:45. It was raining, but we didn't have much choice. I tried to get Chi Chi to go out on her own, but I suppose the rain made her not want to go out. I had to pick her up. I brought her to my cousin's van, and we drove over. Chi Chi didn't normally like being in my lap actually. She probably thought it was too hot haha. But that day, she seemed pretty calm. Maybe I was holding her the right way that day. We got there finally, and I held her in my arms all the way into the office. While I was signing the papers and making sure everything would be set, she tried...one last time to push something out, and nothing. It took everything I had not to break down uncontrollably right there. She wanted so badly to live, and I was signing her up to die.

So we sat for a few minutes in a waiting room. She roamed around a bit before coming to my seat and pawing at it. She wanted to be held again. She wanted my assurance. My warmth. She was so scared, and so was I. But I picked her up, and I held her like my own child. I was trying so hard not to cry. My cousin and I were looking at a booklet that had choices for what to do with her remains. I wanted to cremate her, very likely against my parents' wishes. They would argue it would cost too much, and that it was against what they believe is best for spirits. I don't want to make it look like they're stereotypical Asian parents that are stubborn about everything. My parents are honestly great parents. They've let me decide most of my choices in life, and have supported and given me a very happy life even if we aren't the richest of families. This is just one of the very few things we don't agree on.

I wanted to let her be in my room because that was the place she loved most. If she were a normal dog, maybe I'd have been okay with putting her in a dumpster too. But she was my dog. She hated going outside. I knew what she wanted, and it was to stay with me. So that was my decision.

Eventually they said they were ready, even though I was clearly not. I took off her leash, and let her, one last time, walk with me into the examination room. We picked her up to put her on the examination table. There was a nice towel to make it a little more comfortable for her. The doctor said he'd have to give her a quick sedative to get her to calm down. When he stuck the needle in her back leg, she screamed pretty loudly. Most people would have said it hurt their ears, but all it did was terrify me. I was terrified that the last thing my dog felt in this world was fear. While the sedative did its magic over the next five minutes, I pet Chi Chi and held my face against hers. I did everything I could to make sure she felt safe. Eventually she laid down and she just kinda stared off into the distance. By this point I'm not sure if she knew I was there or not, but I hope she at least wasn't scared anymore.

The doctor eventually shaved her front leg, opened up a vein and began the procedure. I told Chi Chi that I thought we had a few more years together. That I wanted to stay with her. That I wish she could have stayed with me. I told her I loved her...and then she was gone. Her body flailed a bit at the end, but the doctor said it was her muscles spasming and that her heart had stopped a long time ago. I took it as a sign of how much she wanted to stay. God, how I wish she could have stayed with me.

I thanked the doctor for his help, and I noticed he stroked Chi Chi after the procedure was over. I knew, as emotionless as he seemed, he didn't want to do this either. I paid off the bill and thanked the receptionist as well, though it was a different receptionist from yesterday.

I went home, and my cousin helped me clean up Chi Chi's things. We talked for a bit, and then he left. The house was empty. And I was alone. Though you wouldn't believe it if you could hear me wailing into the night. I called a friend of mine on Skype afterwards. She had lost her dog last year as well. I knew her pain then and helped her through it, so she said she wanted to help me through mine. We talked for a bit, and I tried to rest, but I couldn't. Eventually, I remembered about the FFXIV Stormblood OST that I bought but hadn't listened to yet. Yes, this is finally when FFXIV comes into play.

I popped the Stormblood OST into my PS4. I have actually never played a Blu-Ray OST before. I didn't realize it was such an interactive experience. From the different playlists, to the small Kugane menu, and the screenshots. As I listened to the soundtrack and talked to my friend, I started tearing up again. Expected of course, but I realized it was for different reasons this time.

I started playing FFXIV about 3 years ago, with the release of Heavensward. I wasn't a stranger to MMOs, but I had recently acquired a very powerful desktop as a graduation present to myself. I thought FFXIV would be a good test of my new computer's capacity (FFXIV didn't even make it turn on the fans lol). I was enamored with the game. I had previously come from Mabinogi, a similar MMO, though obviously much older. It had an excellent story, and I hoped FFXIV would provide that same kind of experience (which it did). I asked a whole bunch of friends to play with me, I would play every day after work, and I just generally loved the game for everything it had to offer.

You might be wondering how my dog and FFXIV have anything to do with each other, though I imagine any of you who have followed this long story to the end have figured it out. During the last three years, both FFXIV and my dog were part of the same experience. I'd play FFXIV for hours on end, and Chi Chi would sit next to me, just listening to my keys and controller clack away during dungeons, trials, raids, you name it. During long DPS queues or whenever I'd need a break, I'd sometimes kneel down to pet Chi Chi next to me or walk around the house with Chi Chi in tow.

Sometimes during catchy tunes (and there are a lot of catchy tunes) I'd do a signature noise to the melody that Chi Chi liked. It's a bit hard to describe. It's like a whine mixed with a grunt. But she'd always react and come play whenever I'd do it. It's one of the signature things I associated with her. That was how she and I communicated primarily. We'd just make noises haha.

There was never a day that she and I weren't in the same room as I played FFXIV. She was as much of a Warrior of Light as I am, and it makes me immensely proud to think of her that way.

So now, why did I write this thread? I wanted, truly, to thank Yoshi-P, Soken, Foxclon, Koji-Fox, Aimi, the entire FFXIV staff, the FFXIV community, and this subreddit for being with me these last three years. As I listened to the Stormblood soundtrack, instead of crying over what could have been or what I had lost, I managed to look past this entire terrible experience.

A few months ago, as I mentioned at the beginning of this thread, my grandfather passed away. His passing reminded me how much I wanted to make sure that Chi Chi didn't suffer in her final years, so I began to look for ways to treat her better. And listening to the Stormblood OST made me realize that I did. I gave her the best few years that I could, and my solemn wish is that somehow my feelings might reach the FFXIV team and all its members. From the forefront with Yoshi-P, Soken, and the others, to the ones behind the scenes that deserve just as much of my thanks. I wanted to see more people like the famous Ozma designer, Masaki Nakagawa, who came out in 2016 during the Las Vegas Fan Fest, and thank them for their efforts as well.

I won't make it this year, but I hope someone might remember this thread in November and pass on my message to the staff at the Las Vegas Fan Fest. I wish I could be there, but I know everyone else wanted to be there just as much as I did. Please enjoy it for me, and remember that being a Warrior of Light means so much more than just beating up primals or collecting tomestones. I might agree with you if you told me it means upping your glamour game though.

Like many of us, I was, and still am, pretty sad that I wasn't able to procure some Fan Fest tickets to Las Vegas. I love the game, and of course, wanted to show that and enjoy myself with friends at Fan Fest. But recently, my reasons for wanting to go to Fan Fest changed quite drastically.

My grandfather passed away a few months ago. He was 100 years old. It hurt, but I understood that he had lived a tremendously good life. But the worst part of it was that the last few years of his life, he would drift in and out of his own mind. Sometimes he would remember us, and sometimes he wouldn't. We took care of most of his daily needs, and honestly, I feel like the grandpa I knew had left us a long time ago. Why am I starting with this? I think it'll make more sense down the line, but that's all I'll mention of my grandfather for now.

A few weeks ago, my dog who had been with me for 12 years, was having diarrhea issues. Yeah, I know. Sorry for the image lol. It's important though. Anyway, we (as in my family and I) cleaned her up and gave her some medicine hoping it was just some bad food or a small stomach hiccup. For a little while after, she was doing fine, so we figured whatever it was had passed. I thought, ""She's getting old, but she still acts like when we first got her. Maybe I'll grab some things from the store for her."" I bought her some Cesar Softies dog treats since she didn't have much teeth left at her age haha. I also gave her a bath once a week as opposed to my family's policy of ""every once in a while."" I usually didn't give her baths myself because my father would normally do it, but I just kind of felt like I needed to for once.

Later, a few days after tickets went on sale, and I, obviously, did not manage to get any, I began to notice my dog was having problems. She wasn't producing any visible stool, and she was still licking to clean herself even though, as far as we could tell, there was nothing to be cleaned. When I looked to check down there, it was pretty ghastly. The base of her tail and her backside were extremely swollen. I thought perhaps maybe she was just still feeling the effects of her recent episode or might have an infection. It was a Friday night and the vet was closed though, so I figured I'd wait until Monday to bring her in.

So I woke up the next day, Saturday, just looking to enjoy my birthday. Most of my birthday passed, and I suppose it was ""alright."" Nothing too crazy, but it was relaxing. Later that night, however, I came to the realization that my dog, for the second day now, had not managed to pass anything out. I was beginning to get pretty concerned. Coincidentally, my family had planned a trip to the beach starting from Monday until Friday. I wasn't planning to go because due to my skin's rather persistent heat-induced rashes, the sun isn't exactly my best friend. I also wanted to stay home and make sure my dog would be alright and bring her to the vet. So I spent most of that Sunday just thinking of what to do and asking around for advice on what might be causing problems. I went through an array of advice like ""She might have impacted anal glands"" or ""Try some pumpkin!"" By the end of the day, still nothing. This marked day three.

I slept terribly that night. Or rather I tried to. I might have been asleep for maybe 2 hours that day. There were a lot of things going through my mind, but nearly all of them were things I didn't want to believe. I called the nearby vet early that morning. Just as an aside, I have a terrible sleep schedule. I probably get my sleep between 6 AM to 2 PM on most days. I had to log into my father's computer that day since he couldn't, so I couldn't leave the house until after 10 AM. I called the vet at 10:30. They said they'd take my dog right away, and I could come in as soon as possible.

Just some background on my dog. She always goes nuts when I'm out of sight for more than 5 minutes lol. I know for most people, that sounds like some pretty serious separation anxiety. I'll admit that it is. My dog loved me a little too much. But it was okay, I work from home and don't usually go out, so for the most part I'm actually not that far away. Though it's weird when she starts pawing at the bathroom door. She also knows when I plan to leave. Getting dressed, grabbing my car keys, and walking around the house were the signs she knew meant I'd be leaving. Except this time, I was taking her with me (though she didn't know that).

I grabbed a leash out of courtesy for the vet. In the 12 years I've had my dog, she has needed the leash maybe once. She was so attached to me that I could walk around the neighborhood or in front of my house, and she would stick to me like glue. But this time, I figured probably safe to put her on a leash in case other dogs were there. My dog also hates to be picked up. So I did my best to get her to walk out of the house to my car on her own. For anyone that has ever had a dog like mine, you can probably imagine the struggle it was haha

She would always stand behind me as I opened the front door because she'd either whine or want to watch me as I went. So since she was already behind me, I tried to convince her to come with me. She ... eventually did, and I helped her up into the car so we could drive over to the vet. Wasn't too far. About 5 minutes. We get there, and she adamantly did not want to leave the car. If it were home, she'd have jumped out in seconds, but the place was unfamiliar. She was clearly pretty anxious about being out of the house. I felt for her, but I knew if she needed help, we'd get it at the vet. I picked her up and gave her a bit of pulling, and she gave in and followed. As anxious as she was, she was a good girl when it came to actually following me. She didn't really want anything else but to be with me, so it made sense.

I walk in, and to my relief, no other patients were there. The receptionist asked me if my dog had ever been there before or if she'd had any shots recently, and I had to embarrassingly admit no to both. As much as I loved my dog, my family has always been pretty laid back in taking care of our dogs. We'd trim her fur and cut her nails, but things like going to the vet, vaccination, and cleaning her teeth were kind of extra. To my relief again, the receptionist didn't seem to mind. I guessed that this thing was pretty common, which was logical. For a few minutes, I sat down, and tried to calm down my dog. She was always anxious outside of the house, and there wasn't really anywhere comfortable to sit here. Luckily, within a few minutes, the doctor came out and called us in.

As my very nervous dog walked in with me, the doctor asked me to explain what the problem seemed to be. I explained that my dog had some issues a few weeks ago, and that her tail and back area looked really bad. I also explained that it's been a few days since she's managed to pass anything so I was hoping he'd be able to do something for her. I mentioned that I thought it might be impacted anal glands and that was it. He asked me to help her up onto the examination table to check what was wrong. He, and his assistants gently held her still to check her eyes and her heart. He mentioned a heart murmur which could sometimes be an indication of heartworms but also that heart murmurs were common in small dogs so it probably wasn't too serious. It didn't really startle me as I didn't really think there was anything wrong with her heart.

Then he went to check her behind. Almost immediately, I imagine probably out of reflex, he said that among the many cases of things he's seen like this, this was the worst one ever. I didn't know him personally, but I knew this vet had been working here for a very long time. My heart sank. It wasn't the news I wanted to hear after all the worrying and sleepless hours. I vehemently wanted him to just say it was impacted anal glands and that he'd have it fixed right away. He said he'd, out of procedure, try to express them and see if it helped at all. Blood. So much blood. Though he hadn't said it yet, I knew what it meant. It wasn't just bad. It was beyond bad. He said he'd bring her to the back to examine further, and asked that I sit down for a bit. As they went to the back, I could feel the separation anxiety reverse. It was I that didn't want to be away from my dog at that moment.

When he came back, though I knew what he was going to say, he was a hard man to read. I imagine someone who had to give bad news often wasn't supposed to be. He said that cancer had invaded my dog. But not only was it bad, it was also abhorrently aggressive. So obscenely fast that even if we had caught it early, we would never have been able to stop it. The opening left for her to pass things through was about a millimeter wide. There was no hope. He mentioned the possibility of a specialist looking at it, but that it would likely cost thousands of dollars and even then, with likely no success. I was still sitting at the time. I imagine if I wasn't, I would have anyway. I remember him mentioning giving me a few minutes to process the shock, and I mentally agreed with him as my entire body had gone numb. They also brought my dog back, and it was obvious she was happy to see me. I didn't know how to react to her return. She had come back, probably happier than anyone in this world could be, to see me. And I now had to decide how much longer before she wasn't allowed that privilege.

I faintly asked the doctor if there was anything I could do, even a little, but his only answer was that we could administer euthanasia or she would likely die within a week, and not without pain. Though I know he meant no harm, it stung like hell for him to tell me that ""If it were up to me, I'd do it right now."" That was how bad it was. That the threat of her pain would come so fast that immediate action was required. Yet when I looked down, all my dog would do was look at me with those same eyes as always. She probably didn't feel any pain. To her, the only thing on her mind was staying with me. The obvious answer was that I should do it, but of course, I asked the doctor for at least a day or two. He prescribed some painkillers and anti-inflammatory medicine for her for a few days, long enough to wait a few days for my parents to come back if necessary.

I walked out to the receptionist. She wasn't aware of what was going on, so she simply did her job and printed out the bill, and as usual I imagine, asked me about my dog. I told her the bad news, and she was, as expected, sympathetic. After filling out the bill, I kind of began to blabber. No one was home, and I soon realized that I desperately needed someone to talk to. Most of my friends were busy at work, so the only available person was this receptionist. I told her about my past experiences with dogs, and why this experience was...as far as possible from anything I would have wanted or expected.

I've had 5 dogs in my life. Our first dog was vicious. I was very young at the time. I barely remember it other than that it was needlessly aggressive. Its name was Blackie, I believe. It was uh, large and black lol. Sorry, I was like 3 or 4. Eventually it became such a problem that my father just drove and let it out onto a random street and abandoned it. By now, I imagine that dog is long gone, but I hope that perhaps it had a good life after it had left us. I was too young to do anything for it, and I regret that. Not too long after, we received a very young puppy from my aunt. Her dog had recently had her puppy, and they weren't able to take care of the puppy with the house often being empty. So my family took her in, and my, I believe 5 year old self, named her Milky due to her milky white fur. I know. I was 5. Don't think about it. Again, not too long after that, we took in another dog. It was a stray we found, I think. I can't remember the exact details. I named her Cutie. Stahp. Don't look at me like that.

Anyway, Cutie was an older dog. She was very passive, and generally just a calm presence in the house. Many years later, when I was still young, probably around 10 years old, Cutie passed away naturally. She simply decided to stop eating one day and hid in a corner of the house. I didn't realize it at the time, but I think she didn't want to scar me when I was so young. No one would ever claim she was the greatest dog, but I appreciated her as much as any of my dogs, and I was sad to see her go. Here's the shocker I imagine for many people who have owned pets. My family is Vietnamese, and knowledgeable Buddhists. We're not what you'd call devout, but we subscribe to many of the religion's ideas on morality and the idea of the afterlife. After Cutie had passed, my dad took her remains and...tossed them into a dumpster. Yeah. If you thought dumpster diving was bad, it just got potentially worse. My dogs could be in there. Anyway, my dad believes that dogs, natural wanderers as they are, should be allowed to roam free in the afterlife. So he tosses them into dumpsters, where most wild dogs find themselves out of habit. 

It made sense to little me at the time. I wasn't very good at processing emotion at that time though. I was young and ""gifted"" as people liked to call it. I thought the word was synonymous with ""special"" at the time, but as I've grown older, I realize all it meant was that I processed things differently than others, emotions especially. So for years, I accepted it, unaware of how spared I was both because Cutie had died naturally, and because my father was the one who handled the remains and not myself.

Fast forward a good few years to my 15 year old self. We had taken in one more dog. It was Milky's mother. Her name was Snowflake for her white fur. I didn't name her this time, I swear. It was my cousin. He was young too when he named her. Still more creative than me though. Snowflake was always a very timid dog. She was generally terrified of everything. Lightning, rain, loud noises, people walking near her, and sometimes even petting. When she came to us, she was...severely neglected. I don't blame my cousin or his family for it. I imagine that was the reason they decided to give her to us. We were better equipped to take care of her than they were due to family problems. We had to give Snowflake an extreme haircut and a lot of cleaning. After a while, she warmed up to us, and I might even daresay she liked us. She and Milky naturally got along as mother and daughter, and it was endearing to see Milky take care of her very sickly mother. After some time, Snowflake's health started to decline even more than it already was. We got a bit worried, so my father ended up taking her to the vet while I was at school one day. I wasn't aware he had planned on it. When I came home, I changed out of my school clothes and walked throughout the house and after a realization asked my dad, ""Where's Snowflake?""

He simply said ""She's gone. I took her to the vet."" I have not the words to describe how devastating that was. I won't lie to you. I'm no more immune to the idea of favoritism than anyone else. If you had asked me if Snowflake was my favorite, I'd have easily said no, but she was still, at least to me, my dog. I didn't even get to say goodbye. And I most certainly, for a good while, felt like I didn't convey how much I cared until it was too late. My dad explained to me that she had...several diseases and cancer that made her quality of life severely below optimal. She wasn't just timid. She was...hurting. I accepted that. I hoped she was not in pain anymore.

So Snowflake was gone, and left behind was her daughter, whom because of what happened, I began to treat better. I spent a lot of time with Milky in the next few years. I'd often let her play in my room and gave her some treats that we normally wouldn't go out to buy. She was accompanied by my newest dog, Chi Chi. Named and given to us by my cousin. I have no idea why he named her that. Maybe he was watching DBZ at the time. They gave her to us because she didn't get along at all with their other dog. Even going so far as to jump on top of tables to poop lol. Both of them I treated well and loved more than anything. They were there for me in some of my hardest times between high school and college.

Milky was the family dog. There wasn't a single person in the family that didn't love having her. She was excellently potty trained, knew all the dog tricks, would go on walks, knew to wait for food, and even loved baths. She was like the paragon of good dog. Chi Chi on the other hand, was terribly potty trained, knew no dog tricks, hated going on walks, would whine for food all the time, and could not for the life of her stand baths. The only thing she arguably did right was loving me, and only me. She would bark at anyone else if they got too close to me without my permission. I loved them both.

Eventually, in my sophomore year of college, when I was about 20, Milky started vomiting pretty badly. We weren't really sure what it was, but we tried not to feed her anything too solid, and gave her small doses of Pepto Bismol in hopes she'd be okay. We knew she was getting old, so we didn't think it was anything beyond just old age catching up with her. My parents mentioned that it might be her time, so with tears in my eyes, I stroked her for at least an hour. Recalling every moment I had with her and telling her that I loved her. On the day after that, she was still alive. I wouldn't say she was fine, but she seemed...better. I was optimistic that we'd at least be together a little while longer. After waking up the next day, I went to class as usual, and on my way to throw my clothes into the basket, noticed she was lying funny and my grandmother was cleaning her up. I was running late so I didn't have much time to think about it. After class, I came home, but only Chi Chi was barking at the door.

I came in, and asked, for the second time in my life, where one of my dogs was, knowing I didn't want to hear the answer. My dad, as he usually does, answered stoically with ""She died this morning."" I realized that the glimpse of her I saw this morning was...her leaving this world. I was heartbroken beyond words. This was the dog that I'd shared most of my, and all of her, life with. And on the last day she was alive, she did her best to give me hope. So that I wouldn't see her suffer. She pulled out one more day for me, but it still wasn't enough. I later found out that her symptoms were indicative of a stomach virus. It was then that I realized why she tried so hard on that last day. It wasn't her time, and we didn't do enough for her. I was furious and I was heartbroken. Both with myself and my parents. I was tired of our passive attitude with taking care of our dogs. I wanted more time with my dog, and I gave up the chance.

So now, alone, Chi Chi stayed with me. *Everywhere*. I don't know if the traumatizing experience of watching Milky die made her want to cling to me, but she stuck close to me even harder after that. Eventually, I finished college and got a job shortly after. It was about a 35 minute drive away, and a classic 9-5 government job. It was terrible. I don't wanna get into the details, but it was lifesucking. But the best part of those days was coming home after a long, terrible day at work and seeing Chi Chi go nugging futz at the fact that I'd come home. To her, it probably felt like I had been gone for ages. Sometimes my father would open the front door, and she'd dash towards my car waiting for me to open the door. She'd jump onto my seat when I opened the car door. It was the cutest thing, and probably some of my fondest memories of her. Eventually, I had the luxury of working much closer to home, and now I actually work *at home*. It was both lucky for me and Chi Chi lol.

Those were the things I told that receptionist. I was there probably for an hour longer than I needed to. When I finally mentioned it was time to go home, she stood up and gave me a hug, saying she'd pray for me and Chi Chi. I knew there was no reason to pray, but I was glad to hear it all the same. I'm glad that someone understood my pain.

I went home with Chi Chi that day. I explained to my friends and parents that Chi Chi was likely going to have to be put to sleep. I don't think I could describe what I did when I got home as crying. I think if screaming actually gave me strength, I probably would have gone Super Saiyan by now. Maybe one of the higher forms. I wanted to cry and curse the world for being so unfair. No matter how well I treated her or how much I loved her, the world was going to rip away my last dog just like the other two. The one thing I wanted to prevent.

As a person, I absolutely hate things that I can't control. So many things in my life have been taken away because I didn't have the ability to stop it. Or rather, there was no power that could have stopped those things from disappearing. There was no hope nor solution. ""There's nothing you could have done"" is no consolation. Because I want to do something. I want to change things for the better, but you tell me that there is nothing to do. I can't accept that. I don't think I ever will.

I spent that night letting Chi Chi sleep after her anxious and long day. That's all she did most of the time. She just loved sleeping with me nearby. That was her bliss. That was all she wanted. That and food. I fed her some of the meds wrapped in ham which she was very happy to have. I wanted to believe maybe the meds would be just enough to help her, but I knew that wasn't going to happen. She was becoming increasingly more uncomfortable, but she kept trying to pass waste and kept licking at her behind. I knew why she was doing it. She wanted to get better. She wanted to fix the problem and stay with me. My heart was already broken, and it just kept shattering into even more pieces. She still wanted to stay with me, and there was no way that she could. If I had cried any harder that night, I think I might have dehydrated myself.

I also contacted my cousin that night and asked him if he wanted to come with me to say goodbye since he was her original owner. I also wanted someone to be there with me so I wouldn't get into a wreck, both physically and emotionally, on the way home. I didn't sleep that night. I wanted to spend as much time with Chi Chi as I could. I wanted to listen to her shift around in her sleep and let out exhales of relief as she found a good comfortable position. Listen to her get up and switch between her comfortable spot next to my closet, her little doggy bed, and next to the door to my room to fend off invaders if they decided to come in during my sleep.

Around 10 AM that day, I called the vet's office. I told them I'd like to schedule an appointment for euthanasia at 5 PM since they close at 6, and I know no one wants to go back to anything after doing something like this. I looked over to Chi Chi, and thought ""I should spend as much time with her as possible."" But her response? Sleep. Even on that last day haha. I realized that was what made her my dog. I decided, due to exhaustion, that I'd sleep for a bit too. So I slept on my bed. You can count it as next to her since she sleeps about 2 feet away from my bed. I woke up a few hours later at 1 PM. I wasn't very hungry, but I air fried some chicken nuggets. They were Chi Chi's favorite food, by far. She would stare at me and whine for several minutes whenever I had a plate. I'd even sometimes try to hide from her and eat in the kitchen instead of my room, and she'd still find me lol.

Though I didn't feel like eating, my body disagreed. I didn't eat much the previous day, but my stomach was pretty happy to have those chicken nuggets in it. I'd bite half and share the other half with Chi Chi, who sat below the table staring at me. I actually didn't usually give her nuggets in the dining room because we didn't want to enforce the habit of her eating in the house, but that day I gave her as many as she wanted. And I cried. She hadn't been able to poop for 4 days now. Yet still she loved those nuggets as if she were starving. I wished so hard that I could keep feeding them to her after today, but I knew it wouldn't be possible. Eventually, I couldn't eat anymore as my emotions began to close up my stomach. Chi Chi and I went back into the room and I just...did what I always do. I played on my computer and occasionally would get out of my chair to pet Chi Chi and tell her I loved her. I wanted her last day to be special, but I realized that to her, every day was special. It was incredibly hard, but I'm sure that was how she wanted it.

Eventually 4 PM rolled around, and my cousin arrived. He and I talked for a bit. He said he couldn't believe it, and I said neither could I. We reminisced and I let him eat some of the leftover chicken nuggets from earlier. Eventually it was 4:45. It was raining, but we didn't have much choice. I tried to get Chi Chi to go out on her own, but I suppose the rain made her not want to go out. I had to pick her up. I brought her to my cousin's van, and we drove over. Chi Chi didn't normally like being in my lap actually. She probably thought it was too hot haha. But that day, she seemed pretty calm. Maybe I was holding her the right way that day. We got there finally, and I held her in my arms all the way into the office. While I was signing the papers and making sure everything would be set, she tried...one last time to push something out, and nothing. It took everything I had not to break down uncontrollably right there. She wanted so badly to live, and I was signing her up to die.

So we sat for a few minutes in a waiting room. She roamed around a bit before coming to my seat and pawing at it. She wanted to be held again. She wanted my assurance. My warmth. She was so scared, and so was I. But I picked her up, and I held her like my own child. I was trying so hard not to cry. My cousin and I were looking at a booklet that had choices for what to do with her remains. I wanted to cremate her, very likely against my parents' wishes. They would argue it would cost too much, and that it was against what they believe is best for spirits. I don't want to make it look like they're stereotypical Asian parents that are stubborn about everything. My parents are honestly great parents. They've let me decide most of my choices in life, and have supported and given me a very happy life even if we aren't the richest of families. This is just one of the very few things we don't agree on.

I wanted to let her be in my room because that was the place she loved most. If she were a normal dog, maybe I'd have been okay with putting her in a dumpster too. But she was my dog. She hated going outside. I knew what she wanted, and it was to stay with me. So that was my decision.

Eventually they said they were ready, even though I was clearly not. I took off her leash, and let her, one last time, walk with me into the examination room. We picked her up to put her on the examination table. There was a nice towel to make it a little more comfortable for her. The doctor said he'd have to give her a quick sedative to get her to calm down. When he stuck the needle in her back leg, she screamed pretty loudly. Most people would have said it hurt their ears, but all it did was terrify me. I was terrified that the last thing my dog felt in this world was fear. While the sedative did its magic over the next five minutes, I pet Chi Chi and held my face against hers. I did everything I could to make sure she felt safe. Eventually she laid down and she just kinda stared off into the distance. By this point I'm not sure if she knew I was there or not, but I hope she at least wasn't scared anymore.

The doctor eventually shaved her front leg, opened up a vein and began the procedure. I told Chi Chi that I thought we had a few more years together. That I wanted to stay with her. That I wish she could have stayed with me. I told her I loved her...and then she was gone. Her body flailed a bit at the end, but the doctor said it was her muscles spasming and that her heart had stopped a long time ago. I took it as a sign of how much she wanted to stay. God, how I wish she could have stayed with me.

I thanked the doctor for his help, and I noticed he stroked Chi Chi after the procedure was over. I knew, as emotionless as he seemed, he didn't want to do this either. I paid off the bill and thanked the receptionist as well, though it was a different receptionist from yesterday.

I went home, and my cousin helped me clean up Chi Chi's things. We talked for a bit, and then he left. The house was empty. And I was alone. Though you wouldn't believe it if you could hear me wailing into the night. I called a friend of mine on Skype afterwards. She had lost her dog last year as well. I knew her pain then and helped her through it, so she said she wanted to help me through mine. We talked for a bit, and I tried to rest, but I couldn't. Eventually, I remembered about the FFXIV Stormblood OST that I bought but hadn't listened to yet. **Yes, this is finally when FFXIV comes into play.**

I popped the Stormblood OST into my PS4. I have actually never played a Blu-Ray OST before. I didn't realize it was such an interactive experience. From the different playlists, to the small Kugane menu, and the screenshots. As I listened to the soundtrack and talked to my friend, I started tearing up again. Expected of course, but I realized it was for different reasons this time.

I started playing FFXIV about 3 years ago, with the release of Heavensward. I wasn't a stranger to MMOs, but I had recently acquired a very powerful desktop as a graduation present to myself. I thought FFXIV would be a good test of my new computer's capacity (FFXIV didn't even make it turn on the fans lol). I was enamored with the game. I had previously come from Mabinogi, a similar MMO, though obviously much older. It had an excellent story, and I hoped FFXIV would provide that same kind of experience (which it did). I asked a whole bunch of friends to play with me, I would play every day after work, and I just generally loved the game for everything it had to offer.

You might be wondering how my dog and FFXIV have anything to do with each other, though I imagine any of you who have followed this long story to the end have figured it out. During the last three years, both FFXIV and my dog were part of the same experience. I'd play FFXIV for hours on end, and Chi Chi would sit next to me, just listening to my keys and controller clack away during dungeons, trials, raids, you name it. During long DPS queues or whenever I'd need a break, I'd sometimes kneel down to pet Chi Chi next to me or walk around the house with Chi Chi in tow.

Sometimes during catchy tunes (and there are a lot of catchy tunes) I'd do a signature noise to the melody that Chi Chi liked. It's a bit hard to describe. It's like a whine mixed with a grunt. But she'd always react and come play whenever I'd do it. It's one of the signature things I associated with her. That was how she and I communicated primarily. We'd just make noises haha.

There was never a day that she and I weren't in the same room as I played FFXIV. She was as much of a Warrior of Light as I am, and it makes me immensely proud to think of her that way.

So now, why did I write this thread? I wanted, truly, to thank Yoshi-P, Soken, Foxclon, Koji-Fox, Aimi, the entire FFXIV staff, the FFXIV community, and this subreddit for being with me these last three years. As I listened to the Stormblood soundtrack, instead of crying over what could have been or what I had lost, I managed to look past this entire terrible experience.

A few months ago, as I mentioned at the beginning of this thread, my grandfather passed away. His passing reminded me how much I wanted to make sure that Chi Chi didn't suffer in her final years, so I began to look for ways to treat her better. And listening to the Stormblood OST made me realize that I did. I gave her the best few years that I could, and my solemn wish is that somehow my feelings might reach the FFXIV team and all its members. From the forefront with Yoshi-P, Soken, and the others, to the ones behind the scenes that deserve just as much of my thanks. I wanted to see more people like the famous Ozma designer, Masaki Nakagawa, who came out in 2016 during the Las Vegas Fan Fest, and thank them for their efforts as well.

I won't make it this year, but I hope someone might remember this thread in November and pass on my message to the staff at the Las Vegas Fan Fest. I wish I could be there, but I know everyone else wanted to be there just as much as I did. Please enjoy it for me, and remember that being a Warrior of Light means so much more than just beating up primals or collecting tomestones. ~~I might agree with you if you told me it means upping your glamour game though.~~

,DarkTales,"“Y’know what? I’m just gonna do it,” I concluded to myself as I walked to my kitchen counter to grab the keys to my shitty Buick. I walked towards my apartment’s door and stepped down the stairs into the parking lot. It was a cool night in the midst of Chicago. You could hear the distant, yet slightly alarming police sirens and occasional barks of a dog or drunken stranger lurking around town.  

Where are my manners? I should probably introduce myself, my name is Sam Charleston. I know, not the most exciting name you’ve ever heard. I’m 23, dropped out of high school at the age of 17, and came to live in a shitty apartment downtown where I smoke blunts and play PlayStation all night. I work at a gas station just down the street, usually working day shifts so I would have little to no interruption during the night with whatever it is I decided to do. The usual small robberies happen. Kid steals a Gatorade or Snickers bar and most of the time I just let them have it. Not like anyone ever comes to this shit-show of a store anyway, and my boss rarely ever notices stuff like this happening. When I’m not smoking or working, I’m usually going on walks. I don’t have many hobbies or talents to attend to, so this usually keeps me from going completely insane. I don’t think about much, just simple things like what I want to eat or if a new DLC came out for a game I’m invested in. 

That was until lately. For the past, I don’t know, three or four months, maybe five, I’ve been really thinking about my life. Where I want to be in a few years, if I’d ever want to go back to school, you know, all the bullshit we think about. I soon started to realize how truly worthless I am, though. I mean, I dropped out in junior year because of a huge argument between me and my parents, and really haven’t spoken to them since. Because of it, I wasn’t able to obtain the things you should when you’re just about to be shoved into adulthood. I made an attempt to, but nobody would ever really help me out. Things like, figuring out how to get a job, saving your money, hell, even simple things like how to get an apartment or feeding yourself properly. I wasn’t a spoiled child, more like mentally scarred, so it’s not like I had zero discipline on my back. What I was was ignorant to what adults like to call “the real world” and how things operated. A lot of misses, very few hits, but I somehow managed to get myself a job, a car, and a tiny apartment. 

These seemingly empty thoughts began to really bother me after nonstop thinking. I eventually started to get anxiety attacks over them, only making me smoke more weed every night to numb myself from it all. I get it, I sound like some kid going through their tsunami of hormones, but this feels different than just weird mood swings. I’m not one for self-diagnosis either, I think it’s fucking stupid. I stopped going on walks eventually and continued to just stare at my blank walls in my apartment. Soda cans strewn about, empty boxes of snacks that failed to make it into the trash, overall an unhealthy, unmotivated kid sitting in their own pity. 

As by my living conditions and job, one could guess I don’t really have the funds to go seek any therapy on the matter. Yes, I have a car, but even that was cheap as hell. Barely runs, anyway. So, like everything else, I was stuck to my own accord. Now I’ll be honest, I really didn’t want it to be that way, of course I knew I needed some kind of help but didn’t feel it being necessary to get myself into the debt I was close to being in only to be told to spend even more money on medication I didn’t have the insurance to be paying for. That only pushed me down further into this dark hole of emptiness. Not having the privilege to not be fearful of if you’re next paycheck is going to be enough for this month’s rent or any utilities was something that ate at me. I already feel homeless as things currently are, imagine if I actually do lose everything. I should probably stop smoking weed then, but it’s an easy fix during those rougher nights. 

I stood in front of the driver’s side of my car and stared into my reflection on the dirty window. My brown eyes were sunken in, almost as if I was a decomposing body, hair was in messy, greasy strands, and my hoodie was dark and tattered. I rubbed my thumb in a circular motion on the key and contemplated what I was about to do. 

“Am I this much of a pussy?” I thought to myself. 

This wasn’t the type of thing I’d expect myself to be having serious thoughts over. I’ve taken okay care of myself for the past six years, haven’t I? What says I can’t go on for another six? 

Well, I’ll fucking tell you. These constant thoughts in my head are the ones controlling me. I can deal with and be fine with not being cool hot shit. I’m fine with going to work every day and playing stupid ass games I stole from GameStop all night. But you know what I’m not fine with? The constant reminders of how my father screamed at me in the kitchen of our old home, going over how he raised a retard of a son that won’t amount to anything, and having a frightened mother just sit there and watch me take every word. How she had the audacity to let this man take my innocence away by hitting me relentlessly. How, when I got overrun with anger, I hit her and she told me to leave after everything I went through, when *I* was the kid getting beat like I was some meat in a butcher shop and had a careless mother who sat and watched. The daily reminder of all those things being the fact that I really didn’t amount to anything. You were right, dad, I really haven’t done anything with myself. I’m no doctor or lawyer. You know, maybe a little normality in our family would’ve helped. Some love and compassion, maybe, but nooo, even that was too much fucking work for those two. 

I made up my mind and unlocked my car, got in, turned on the ignition, and drove to the nearby garages of the apartment building. Once I entered mine with my car, I closed the door, locked it, and slumped into the driver’s seat once again, turning the car off and not closing the door to it just yet. I grabbed my phone from my pocket, just an old iPhone 5, like it even matters, and opened Spotify. I looked through some of my playlists and collected a few of my favorites and made up about an hour and a half of songs. Nothing too intense or pumped up, I didn’t want to see color only for the world to be greyed out again in a few hours. Then all of this would just be a waste of time. 

I plugged my aux cord into my phone and played the first song. “A Little Death” by The Neighbourhood started to play. I closed my eyes and gave out a small chuckle. How ironic, even if it was a song about sex and not killing yourself. It’s at least safe to say I won’t be dying a virgin. That girl left me around two years ago. Still kind of hard to get over. She was a real catch I would say but fuck it. No going back after this. I lied my head back on the headrest, eyes still closed, and turned my car back on. It would be a little over an hour before I either passed out and died from the gas. After a few minutes, I was really feeling the effects of this. My head was swimming and soon the music sounded like I was underwater. I felt the bile in my stomach start to seep up through my esophagus, and tried gulping it down hard, but it was no use. I dry heaved until a hot liquid finally made its’ way up to my mouth, and down to the floor of my car. Then suddenly, I had to swing my door open and vomit an exponential amount of stomach acid, as I haven’t eaten in over twenty-four hours. 

Everything felt like fire at this point. My throat burned from more of the hot juice sitting in it, and I felt overwhelmingly disoriented. I looked around, beginning to feel the panic set in. My survival instincts felt the urge to rip open the door of the garage and suck down the cool, dingy air of Chicago, but I knew what I wanted. I knew I wanted to stay inside this dark, dusty garage. 

After what felt like hours, I got another wave of light headedness and plopped straight into the puddle of my own vomit. It was still warm. I tried getting up, but everything was too overwhelming at this point. My body was so weak already, I had no choice but to lie there in my filth. 

The music was now sounding that of a quiet buzzing noise, like a drone or an old TV. I could only very faintly hear some bass, but other than that, my body was starting to shut down. I could tell this was it, even in my confused state of mind, I knew that what I was getting was what I could finally call my last breaths. I didn’t know it at first, but now I know I won’t have to remember my father’s face as he hurt me, the only one he ever did make. And neither that of my mother’s fake, lying whore mouth. It’s been six years and I have never recovered. Here you go dad, a deadbeat son, just like you asked for. I can’t wait until they discover my body and are told what I’ve done to myself. I hope they’re happy, wherever those fucks are now. 

The world kept spinning, and soon, my eyes began to close. All I could see was the faint darkness of the garage and the light of my phone. Things faded, and now all I could see was pure darkness. My last thought was how happy I was to finally just be away from the daily bullshit. And that was that.

,DestinyTheGame,"I know I'm no diety in pvp, but I'm pretty okay. A friend I play with a lot is just as good if not a little better. We worked our way up to the 1600 glory region on our own. We sit at about a 50% win ratio. 

What we've noticed since the update is that we're now matched against extremely good players consistantly. At first i thought ""This is fine. It's the nature of the playlist, to be matched with better and better people as you progress."" However... something seems... off. My issue is that, since the update, we seem to only get matched against people who are well above us. In the 2200 range or more. Further more, it now takes twice, maybe three times as long to get matched up. Stack that onto the already absurd load times in pvp and the time commitment becomes annoying. We're struggling to keep afloat. On top of all that, we get matched with the same 3 or 4 stacked teams that always push our shit in. Every. Time. 

I'm not trying to start a revolution or demand change like I know a fuck about game development, but we were doing perfectly fine before. Now, all of a sudden, we arent. 

Just sharing what our experience has been like this week. 

P.S. 

We've gotten the ""left early"" warning twice tonight. We did not leave early once. We waited until the end of match screen took us back to orbit on its own.

,relationship_advice,"TL;DR - I’m really into this guy but I’m unsure if I  made it clear that I want to ride him into the sunset. 

So I started talking to this REALLY attractive dude (26M) like 6 months ago. And we messaged frequently for like maybe 4 months. 

He was really friendly and companionable. We got pretty deep at points and he told me I helped him get comfortable with being gay and helped him build the courage to come out to one of his childhood friends. 

DATE 1: Things were going great and so we went out to lunch, but because of one thing and another my friend (F) came along too. And it was fine. Like real nice and chill vibes. 

DATE 2: We texted more and then we hung out again, at a cafe with the same (F) friend. 

I felt like I was really getting to know him and I really enjoyed being in his company. 

DATE 3: this time we hung out alone. We went for a hike. It was real nice. I fell over down a muddy slope because of course I did. He laughed a lot. And his laugh is honestly like crack cocaine to my stomach butterflies.  We went out to dinner after with a few fiends and I drove him home because I’m a gentleman. 

DATE 4: my place. With out trusty BFF (F) who came on the first two dates, we decided to have a viewing party of the finale of this show. So we were all at mine and I made up my guest room for him because I didn’t want him to feel awkward you know? Like I was expecting him to sleep with me, because I totally wasn’t. So we watched the tv. Had some vodkas. I really felt him loosening up around me and it was a great night. 

At this point I’ll mention he’s a bit (A LOT) of an introvert. Which is fine, and in fact, adds to his absurd sexiness, but it does make him hard to read most of the time. 

DATE 5: we went to see a band together. So this band was playing and he asked if I wanted to go and obviously I said yes. (I downloaded all the music into a playlist and listened on repeat for two weeks so I didn’t look stupid in front of him). He flats with people so doesn’t have a spare room but texted saying he would sleep on the couch or we could just share the bed, whatever worked. 

I’ll be honest, I almost died because sweet Jesus getting into bed with someone so amazing is unrealistic. 

We went to the concert, I mumbled my way through. We went back to his and just sort of got ready for bed without talking about it. We fell asleep quite quick because we were exhausted. 

I woke up earlier than him and was like, uhhhh bloody hell.  So I went to the lounge and waited for him to get up. Might just add that when he did eventually wake up, MF had the audacity to look amazing meanwhile I looked like a piece of used sandpaper. 

We went to breakfast and I asked if he wanted to come to mine (we had planned to go
To a sports game the day after). He said yeah. I made sure he had heaps of opportunity to back out because I didn’t wanna pressure him but he was keen. 

So we hung out, chilled, he tinkled that damned fucking laugh. And at like midnight I was like, you ready for bed and he was like yeah. And so we just went and got into my bed. 

We chit chatted and then LAID THERE IN SILENCE FOR OVER A MINUTE AND I SHOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING. Then he was like, okay, I’m heading to sleep. And I said goodnight like a total pussy. 

When we woke up we stayed in bed on reddit and insta and shit, chatting for like an hour. 

We went to the sports game and after he hugged me and I was like PROGRESS FINALLY. 

So then I asked him out to dinner the other night and before-hand we chilled on his couch for like an hour being dumb and comfortable. Dinner was nice. I’ve never seen him so relaxed in a public setting before. He was loud and cute and it was at this point that I was like, okay. I REALLY want to date this boy. 

After dinner I took him back to his and he stood in the doorway and I stood near him but he didn’t make a move and I was too much of a pussy so I waved and got in the car. The entire drive home I was so angry at myself for not doing anything. 

I’ve never had a boyfriend before and neither has he (late bloomers). Aside from being a beautiful human, I feel like we have a real connection that I haven’t felt before. 

I compliment him all the time but I’m worried he thinks I’m just a flirty and friendly person. Truth is, I usually hate humans and won’t get vulnerable enough to get hurt. USUALLY.  

Backstory, as if this weren’t long enough. But I fell in love with a guy in high school and he was “straight” and after 5 years of flirting and never even kissing, he made me feel like I’d totally imagined it all and that sorta fucked me up. Because now I’m constantly in fear that I’m reading romantic situations wrong and that the guys I think are into me aren’t into me at all. 

We’ve literally slept in each other’s beds but we haven’t kissed and I’m just really concerned that he doesn’t find me attractive and or see me as a viable partner. 

Should I just kiss him the next time we hang out? Because I think life’s too short to pretend you’re not into someone, right? My only fear is that I’ll scare him off by being too forward. 

Or am I just being insane and need to chill TF out and see how things unfold and not push it?

,horrorstories,"Job’s life was in near perfect order. The alarm went off at 3:49 AM every morning. He had a glass of orange juice and an apple, shit, then went on a five mile run along the Brooklyn Heights Promenade. He’d come home to his brownstone, shower, dress, drink coffee, eat a hearty breakfast cooked by his nanny, and kiss his daughter before stepping out of the door at 6:00 AM.  He’d take the 2 or 3 train to Fulton Street and enter his building between 6:30-6:45 AM at the latest, depending on train delays. The doors of the elevator would open and the clock above would never be late. His days were like the second hand of the clock, fluid but mechanical — beats per minute that were always building toward a peak that remained elusive.

He never had cause for complaint. He was grateful for everything that he had. It all took work and he earned it. There were many years when he was broke and lonely. He rose through the ladder of the company to get where he was now. He’d worked his entire life for his current position. When he started as an unpaid intern, no one could remember his name. He was practically invisible. Now, his name preceded him. Of course, it came with a cost. Mainly, his time.

Which didn’t help his marriage. Lately, his work ethic had created a division between he and his wife Diane. There was a growing space between them. Few words, even less eye contact, and virtually no intimacy. Job approached their relationship the same way he addressed everything else. It was work, a task, an obligation that he adhered to and was happy to do.

It never was easy for Job, but his persistence produced breakthroughs. Take for instance how he met his wife, Diane. There were many postponed dates before he finally convinced Diane to finally accept his proposal. She didn’t show much interest, and it was a horrible first date. He felt like it was a pity meet and greet. Afterwards he called, hoping for a second date, only to get rejected. It wasn’t until years later when she ran into him on the promenade that her interest finally emerged. Running became a retreat for him so his chub was then gone. Shyness and insecurity had transformed into confidence and a pleasant outgoingness. He was a different man — to her.

Their daughter Basil was the easiest task of them all. She was born with down syndrome and that didn’t stop her from being the light of his life. Everything excited her and a smile rarely left her face. She was just so sweet and innocent. Of course, there were difficulties that were mainly rooted in his ego. He couldn’t help but think that her condition was somehow his fault despite all of the doctors who assured him otherwise. Maybe he shouldn’t have gone through that cigarette phase when he was a teenager. Maybe his sperm was abnormal. Maybe he would fail in raising such a precious spirit. He was paid very well for his analytical mind, but sometimes it got in his way more than it helped him.

One of his main beliefs was that there was always a way to resolve a problem. With enough work, even the direst of situations could turn around. Take for example where we find him now. An important client was going to leave the firm for a partnership with a young start-up. Job assessed the risks, ran through the numbers, and prepared a presentation that killed. This latest victory was months in the making. Preparing, practicing, and eventually executing. He was the last in the office again, basking in his success. The view from his office’s window overlooked Manhattan. The Empire State Building. Chrysler Building. Times Square. George Washington Bridge in the distance. A crescent moon dangled like a hook over the Jersey cliffs. The entire city was his in this moment. He had never felt prouder.

The clock hit 9:11 PM and finally Job rose from his desk. The picture frames surrounding his computer were lit in a dim golden light. He smiled and flicked off the green banker’s lamp. The faces of his wife and child were veiled by shadows and his footsteps left the room in silence. 

He was waiting for the elevator when he heard an impassioned voice booming from the corner office.

“I’ll make you eat the flesh of your children you little fuckin’ rat,” came from the office. Job treaded lightly closer to the door. It was the office of the founder and CEO of the company, George Owen Dowe. Job’s father always told him to never trust a man with two first names. Rarely was George seen in the offices. Usually, there were only rumors that gave him life. He’s in Senegal right now, tomorrow he’ll be Austria, oh -- did you see his pictures from Saint Tropez? He was more of a myth than a real person. Job had seen him only from across the room every now and again but even that made Job nervous. George inspired an entire generation of financiers. His name was synonymous with success. He lived at an echelon of stature that few would ever inhabit. By now, George Owen Dowe’s money infiltrated every trade across the board. He owned a piece of everything.

“Try me,” George bellowed, “and the only job you’ll be able to get will be shoveling shit.”

George slammed the phone on the base and Job shuddered. The elevator dinged and the doors opened. Job turned to leave and drove his face into the chest of a pale beastly man wearing a three piece burgundy suit. A sly smile slithered up his cheek. Job knew the man, Luc Milieu, and was just as sure that he was the last person you’d expect to find in this building. The door swung open and George stood there scowling. Job was wedged between a feud that had been boiling in each man’s blood for over a quarter of a century. 

“Job,” George said.

“Sir,” Job was shocked that such a man as George knew his name. “I— uh—”

“Were just leaving,” George said as he shot the thin man a hateful glare. 

“Yes sir,” Job bowed and slipped out from between them. The elevator doors were closing, and he raced over to stab his hand and hit the censors. The doors reopened and he hurried inside. He watched the two men enter the corner office with the utmost intrigue. Why would they be meeting after all these years? The elevator doors closed on the men. George stared out of the window with his back turned to his guest. 

\_\_\_

“Think of the devil,” George said as he looked out of the window, “and he’s already found you.” 

George watched the city glisten, looking through the reflection of his adversary. The sky line had been altered by their investment. Skyscrapers with their names lit up the night. Their signature was written in permanent monoliths of steel and concrete. Midtown. Flatiron. Central Park East. Luc lingered by the door and had a different view. He saw all of the windows sprawled out across the city, and wondered of all the pain and suffering hidden by the curtains. The world was a wicked place — and he’d seen the worst. No thanks to the abrupt expulsion from the company that he co-founded with George.

“Old friend,” Luc said with venom. “It’s been a while.”

“Yes, a good while too.”

“May I?” Luc motioned to the chair.

“If you must,” George said as walked over to the liquor cart. He poured two twelve year old whiskeys, neat. “To what do I owe this sudden intrusion?”

“I was just in town and thought I’d check in on our business,” Luc said as he sat gently into the leather chair and folded his leg over his knee. He took the glass from George and they solemnly clinked glassed.

“Our business. That’s funny,” George walked around the desk and sat back in his luxurious seat, not a trace of laughter was on his solid sunken face. “Where have you come from?”

“Everywhere and nowhere really,” Luc laughed wickedly and stroked his pointy goatee, “your workers are certainly dedicated if they are willing to work so late.”

“I don’t ask them to,” George smiled serenely, “They do so because they believe in our mission here.”

“Or they fear you,” Luc said. “That man was too terrified to speak.”

“Job? He’s one of our finest workers,” George boasted. “His faith in this company is unparalleled.”

“Is that so? It’s hard to be discontent when you have everything.”

“He’s earned it.”

“Wouldn’t it be a shame if he were to suddenly pursue a better offer from a competitor?”

“He would never,” George cleared his throat, falling into all seriousness. 

“Are you so sure?”

“He looks up to me as a mentor — his idol if you will. While you’ve been off galavanting around the world, I’ve been here — building this empire.”

“And whose decision was that?”

“Job is satisfied in his current position.”

“Is he now?”

“He obeys with absolute devotion — never a question asked.”

“Oh?”

“Works holidays, is the first to arrive in the morning, and the last to leave at night. Hell, he even missed the birth of his daughter. His allegiance to me is unbreakable.”

“Everyone has a breaking point.”

“Not this one.”

“How much would you be willing to bet?”

“A man’s life is not worth a wager.”

“Say, if his life wasn’t the wager? More, his devotion.”

George leaned back in his chair and examined Luc’s interest, “What’s in it for you?”

“The real question is, how much are you willing to gain?”

“And how is that?”

“What if I were to tell you that I’d be willing to sell you my remaining shares? You’d have complete control over your little kingdom.”

“I’ve been trying to convince you to do that for decades. Why the sudden change in heart?”

“Nothing gives me greater joy than proving you wrong.”

“You’d like that, wouldn’t you?”

“Ah yes,” Luc raised his glass and took a swig.

“So what are you proposing?”

“There is no perfection in this world. Nothing is pure. Nothing is sacred. It’s all a mess — utter chaos. A tree can only withstand so many storms before it bends.”

“And?”

“Allow me to test Job’s faith. I promise you that if he loses everything, he’ll turn against you without question.”

George laughed heartily while holding his belly. He then leaned with his forearms on the desk and the light cast a shadow across his face, “alright then, all that he has is in your hands, but don’t you hurt him.”

Luc smiled and kicked his leg off his knee. He rose and extended his hand, shaking with George.

Most mornings were met with the kick of a high hat as Job plummeted out of his feverish dream of falling from the top of a skyscraper. The descent always lasted long enough for the panic to be replaced by a calm awareness of certain death. He accepted it and that’s when his phone alarm would spare him of this repetitive torture. Today, the pavement stayed away and he fell and fell and fell to no quick relief. Perhaps he wasn’t falling but flying. If there were no end, then he was suspended from the heavens. An extension of the universe. He felt free.

And it was with this ease that he floated back through the window like a feather on a gentle breeze. His body was released onto his memory foam mattress and down comforter. His eyes fluttered open and he yawned at the sun. Why was the sun up? What time was it? He checked his phone but the power was off. He pressed the power button but only got the image of a drained battery with a red bottom. How could— He checked the wire and it was cut, split, and frayed in the middle. The cat never chewed wires before. What the hell got into her?

 He rubbed his eyes back into focus, 7:15 AM. Shit. He struggled to get dressed — every piece of clothing felt tight over his spasming muscles. He tried to get comfortable but nothing fit right. He didn’t have time for comfort. He was late for the pitch. 

Job entered the kitchen in a frenzy, “Why didn’t you wake me up?”

He looked around an empty family room. Then he checked the bathroom, Basil’s room. No one was there. He bent the blinds and saw the street sweeper barreling down the block. Their car wasn’t double parked like usual. His wife must’ve already taken their daughter to school.

As he jogged to the subway, Job tried calling Diane but it kept going to voicemail. He tried again while standing at the top of the steps as outgoing traffic from the arriving train spilled out from the burrow. He was checked by a man wearing a red checkered button up and grey slacks. He turned to shoot a dirty look and was met by a deathly scowl. The man was his age, handsome with a square jaw, icy eyes, and light hair. He was everything that Job was not. He may have lost all that weight years ago but he was far from symmetrical. Job pocketed his phone and descended into the subway, too timid to look back.

The subway was crammed with people during the morning rush. This is why he like to travel earlier, to avoid that cattle car feeling. He waited for the next train to arrive behind a crowd of people. It wasn’t for another half hour before it came chugging into the station. He pushed to the front of the platform and the train stopped with him standing halfway between doors so he got boxed out. The doors open and the people squished together. No one got off. They were all heading to the city for work. Job tried to pry through the others waiting in line but couldn’t manage to get to the door in time. The doors shut and train moved on.

The trains heading southbound were coming back to back but there was no sign of movement down the tracks heading in his direction. He waited and the crowd got thicker. Finally, a train dragged itself into the station and Job positioned himself in front of the door. He forced himself on, probably accidentally committing sexual assault in the process. There was no way to get into the city without snug full body touching these days. They were nearly into Manhattan when the train came to a screeching halt. The conductor announced that there was a medical emergency at the Fulton Street station. Job’s back was throbbing and his arm was going numb from holding onto the overhead bars. An itch burned on his back but there was no where to squirm.

Things didn’t improve at work either. The doors of the elevator opened to chaos. A frenzy of excitement echoed off the walls. The workers hurried around the hive like ants after being doused with gas and lit on fire. One of his co-workers rushed up to him with disheveled hair and his dress shirt halfway untucked. He clumsily shoved his glasses back up the bridge of his  sweaty nose.

“Where the hell have you been?” Phil said as he tucked in the back of his shirt. 

“My alarm didn’t go off,” Job said wearily. 

“You picked a hell of a day to not show up.”

“What’s going on?

“The Sorbos deal fell through.”

“How could it—”

“You didn’t show up so they walked.”

“…but we agreed to terms.”

Phil shrugged, “Yeah, well — they’re gone.”

The rest of the day was spent reaching answering machines or no answers at all. The constant sound of the ringing phone battered Job’s frontal lobe. The calls were always from some confused soul in the building and not the people he was hoping to hear from. Why would they back out? Just yesterday they sat in the boardroom with smiles on their faces. There wasn’t a hint of doubt in those plastered smiles. They didn’t need him there to finalize it. 

By lunch, rumors were beginning to spread. Job didn’t have time to eat but needed coffee to combat his heavy eyes. He scratched his forearm and listened to Zoe and Billy’s conspiracy theories. The rumors were flying around with the fury of a tornado. Zoe had it in her mind that the folks at Sorbos were tipped on some insider knowledge. She believed that the company was going down fast. Her division was responsible for the budget so she was one to know. Billy maintained that George’s arch rival, Luc Milieu, had returned to take back what was rightfully his. Luc was starting with their biggest account and would soon own them all. 

Sure enough, they were both right. Clients started closing their accounts despite the massive breach of contract fees. The numbers might have looked good for one time transactions but weren’t sustainable for the weeks ahead. The overhead for an entire skyscraper needed constant revenue to be pouring in. As if by a flip of a switch, the money stopped flowing and a drought set in almost immediately. The stocks plummeted and the panic in the office settled into a somber realization of how bad things could become. 

No one smiled that day. Job’s entire retirement plan was wiped away by the drop in price for each share. His planned progression in life was interrupted by an unforeseen obstacle. Surely, he would overcome it. He could defeat any foe — box with any opponent. Even if that opponent was George Owen Dowe himself. It wasn’t going to be easy if no one would answer their phone or call back. He felt like he was screaming into a void that went unheard. All he had to do was make the effort. Pull up his boot straps and put his head down. Keep his soul to the grindstone, chipping away piece by piece. Yet, without a response — there was nothing he could do.

There was a light rapping on the door and finally Job looked up from his computer screen. Phil stood in the doorway, his shirt stained by sweat and a sad exhaustion to his demeanor, “After today, drinks are in order. We’ll be at the White House. You coming?”

Job scratched his neck and sighed, “As good as that sounds, I need to figure this out.”

“Don’t kill yourself,” Phil said as he slapped the door and left. 

The overcast sky was getting dark and the same view that looked so promising the night before was now dreary and ominous. Job resigned to defeat for the day and decided to head home early. The only thing that could cheer him up was his baby girl. The commute home was just as packed as it was in the morning and the car he entered reeked of a homeless man hidden behind a wall of misery. All he wanted to do was lie down in his bed and sleep forever. 

The windows of his brownstone were dim when he arrived. His sore ankles stumbled up the stoop and he fumbled his keys. They clanked on the ground and he strained himself bending over to pick them up. He limped up the stairwell to the second floor and entered the living room. His daughter was sitting in front of the television. 

“What did I tell you about sitting too close to the television?” 

Basil’s face lit up with happiness. No matter what, she glowed when she was around her father and waited everyday for him to get home from work. If it was past her bedtime, she’d stay awake and prayed that he’d return. Please, please, please. She would have to pretend she was sleeping when he came in to give her a kiss because she didn’t want to get in trouble. She was an angel, lit by the dancing blue of the television.

“Hey baby girl,” Job hugged his sweetheart tight and strong, “Oh, I missed you.”

“I missed you too Daddy.”

“You’re a sight for sore eyes.”

“Why are your eyes sore?”

“It’s an expression, baby girl.”

“An exprection?”

“Yes, hunny,” Job looked around but there was no sign of his wife, “Where’s mommy?”

“She’s upstairs with her friend.”

“Upstairs? Which friend? Trudy? Melissa?”

“No, Steve.”

“Who the fuck is Steve?”

“Ooh, Daddy said a bad word.”

Basil’s giggle fueled his rampage up the stairs. A moaning escaped from behind the closed door at the end of the hall. Her voice. Her laugh. It was a stab to his abdomen and he keeled over in agony at the landing, balancing his weight on the bannister. He listened to her whelp. Her enjoyment. His grunting. The headboard slapping against the wall and her pussy clapping his balls. His chest tightened and he clenched a fist. He burst through the door and found his wife riding someone like a wild cowgirl. 

“What the fuck are you doing?”

Diane turned and smiled at Job with a malicious firmness as she continued to grind on top of this stranger. The sight of Job seemed to be what pushed her over the edge and she lapsed into a shivering orgasm. Her toes curled and her leg locked up and shook. She rolled off of Steve, bumping into each ab on her way down.

“Who the fuck is this?”

“I’m Steve,” Job recognized his face. It was the man from this morning who bumped into him. He was filled with rage but didn’t know what to do with it. He’d never been in a fight, and from the look of this guy Steve it wouldn’t be a fair match. He could toss Job around like a dog rips apart a stuffed animal.

“He’s Steve.”

“You brought another man into our bed?”

“Our bed? When was the last time you slept here? When was the last time you fucked me in this bed?” 

“You can’t just—”

“I can do whatever the fuck I want,” Diane barked. “You do.”

“And you bring him around our daughter?”

“Don’t pretend to care,” she laughed. 

“Don’t pretend to— Don’t pretend to care? You’ve gotta be kidding me.”

“Does it look like I’m kidding you?” she said in a cold brick tone as she grabbed Steve’s semi-hard dick and wiggled it around. 

“What did I ever do to you?”

“Oh, please. Don’t give me that bullshit. You did this. You care more about that company than you do your family.”

“Diane, that’s not true.”

“Oh? Then where were you when I was pushing your precious daughter out of my vagina? Huh? Where were you on her first day of school? Or her seventh birthday? You’re never here. You’re always working. And I get lonely.”

“Maybe I should—” Steve arose naked from the bed.

“You should,” Job foamed from the mouth. “Get the fuck out of my house.”

“No,” Diane grabbed Steve’s wrist.

“I don’t want to cause any—”

“He caused all the trouble,” Diane said. “So you’re going to stay and he’s going to leave.”

“I’m not going anywhere,” Job growled defiantly. 

“Sleep in your office tonight,” Diane said, “or go kill yourself. I don’t really care. Just go.”

\_\_\_

The White House was drunk with revelry. It was Friday night and all of the financial bros were in full pig squeal. The corner of the bar was calm compared to the rest of the rowdy patrons. Job pushed through the crowd and came across his co-workers’ booth. They all hung onto their empty glasses in despair. A bottle of tequila was propped up between them. They barely acknowledged Job’s arrival, but Phil scooted over and instinctively poured Job a shot which sat untouched. Zoe noticed that Job was worse off than the rest of them. 

“Look at this sad lot,” a voice shouted out from the Top 40 playlist booming from beyond the crowd. Job look up from his glass and saw Arthur Bernstein standing over them. He dropped a tray of glasses onto the table. The glasses had been used and one even had lipstick smear on the rim. The taller of the glasses had a yolky loogie floating at the bottom. Job went to Cornell with Arthur and has always despised him. 

“Courtesy of Milieu Industries,” Arthur grinned and slid the tray in front of them, “We offer you the bottom of the barrel.” 

“Fuck off Bernstein,” Billy shoved the tray at Arthur and the loogie splashed out and splattered on his chest. The table erupted in laughter. Billy rose from his seat and got in Arthur’s face. Arthur took a reluctant step back. 

“You think that you can’t be touched,” Arthur growled, “but you’re not special. You’re nothing.”

Billy didn’t let up and Arthur was pulled back by his goons. They faded into the reflective style of button ups and khakis and Billy sat back down in a gust of anger, “Fuckin’ asshole.”

Job stared into the glass, sniffed the whiskey, and thought about that old proverb on the fullness of a glass. If he saw the glass as being half full, he’d be a optimist. If it were empty, he’d be a pessimist. If he saw it as both half full and half empty he’d be a realist. He didn’t even see the glass anymore. What the fuck did that make him? Job. He stared into middle space. His house was on fire. His wife was dead. His daughter fell in love with an asshole like Arthur. He got fired. Had nothing. He was a failure. Job. It didn’t matter how hard he worked, it was all bullshit anyway.

“Job,” Zoe said and he looked up from the glass with tears streaming from his eyes. His co-workers were watching him nervously, “it’s not that serious.”

“Yeah man,” Phil said, nudging his shoulder. “It always works out.”

“My wife cheated on me,” Job muttered. 

“Oh,” said Billy and Zoe. 

“Shit,” said Phil, “I’m sorry.”

“What’s the point?” Job was nearly sobbing. “You work your ass off your entire life for what? You’re going to lose it all anyway. So what’s the fucking point? Life is nothing but wind.”

“You can’t blame yourself,” Phil said.

“Who else can I blame? Huh?”

“She’s the one that cheated,” said Zoe. “Blame her.”

“She said I work too much. I’m never there. I don’t— I can’t—”

“If anything, you did everything you could.”

“It wasn’t enough,” said Job. “It’s never enough.”

He rose from his seat having never touched his alcohol, and left his friends without so much as a second glance. He slept on the subway that night. He awoke as the train emerged from a tunnel and rose up over Brooklyn. The sun was breaking over the horizon and a burning itch spread up his wrist. He scratched it with no relief. He slid his sleeve up and saw a rash spreading across his inner forearm. The city was getting farther away. Everything he ever knew was slipping into the dark clouds of an impending storm. 

\_\_\_

Job entered the lobby of his work an hour early. He slept for an hour on the couch of the break room before the buzz of the office awoke him. He was still wearing the same suit as yesterday and smelled like liquor. Everyone shot him glances of disapproval. He didn’t care. He went to the bathroom, wet his hair, and combed it back with his fingers. His eyes were bloodshot and hugged by swollen lids. He looked like shit. Fuck it.

He was intercepted by Phil on his way back to his office, “The big man wants to talk to you.”

“He’s in today?” Job was surprised. 

“Yeah,” Phil whispered, “and he’s pissed.”

\_\_\_

There was someone else sitting in front of George when Job entered. The man turned and the sight of him punched Job in his pride. It was Steve. He fucked my wife. The room spun around him. His skin burned. He was unable to move, petrified by shock. 

“Job,” George said leaning back, “Please have a seat. This isn’t going to be easy to hear.”

“Wha—” Job choked. “What?”

“Have a seat,” George barked.

Job stepped forward, his vision never leaving the smirk on Steve’s face. His beating heart was about to break a rib. His hands trembled and his eyes filled with tears. His feet moved without thought and he sat gently into the seat next to Steve. They stared at each other with enough poison to destroy an ecosystem.  

“This is Steven Hendrix,” George said with nonchalance, “He’s here to right your wrongs.”

“Excuse me?”

“Is that the tone you wish to use in approaching this?” George said calmly.

“No, I— I just don’t understand.”

“It’s pretty simple. You lost our biggest account. That is unacceptable.”

“Of course, I—”

“Steven here has come highly recommended from Luc Milieu. He’ll be supervising the Sorbos account from here on out and you will report directly to him.”

“But—”

“There’s only one response I want to hear and that’s yes sir.”

“Yes, of course — sir.”

Steve’s glaring pride nearly got his throat slit. Job eyed the letter opener on George’s desk. It would be a simple task, really. Just thrust upward and through the Adam’s Apple. He’d bleed out and die in minutes. He’d suffer. That’s all that Job could ever want. He wanted Steve to suffer. Steve extended his hand, “I look forward to working with you.”

Job shook his hand, and would forever regret it. 

\_\_\_

Around lunch time, Job had to leave the office. Steve wouldn’t stop hounding him over every little detail that was missed. Every time he saw the man, he’d see his naked wife grinding. Thrusting. Fucking. Dirty and primal. He’d hear her moans. She orgasmed while looking at him. The day would end in murder, he was sure of it. He developed a fever and his rashes were aflame, spreading across his skin like a wildfire with a wind. He tried to make it to the elevator but his head was lightheaded from rising too fast. 

The doors of the elevator opened and Steve exited. There was no way to avoid him. Steve approached and placed his hand on Job’s shoulder, “How’s it feel to get fucked?”

\_\_\_

The soft fluorescent lights met Job’s blurry vision. He groaned and slipped in an out of consciousness. His daughter stood before him, crying. Wake up daddy, wake up. His wife made out with Steve, who held up a middle finger. Luc Milieu studied him, purely entertained by his pain. The doctor and nurses trailed around him in a blur. He was paralyzed.

He finally emerged from his coma four days later. He was alone and no one except doctors and nurses visited him. The right side of his face was paralyzed and he couldn't feel his legs. The doctors would only dip in every now and again and didn’t seem to do anything for him. They’d examine him, grunt, and leave.

“What happened to me?” Job asked.

“You had a stroke and hit your head,” the doctor said.

“A stroke? I’m too young for a stroke.”

“No one is too young to have a stroke.”

The doctor left while the nurse stayed and filled out his chart. 

“Miss,” Job said to the nurse, “Could you please reach my family?”

“They’ve been contacted,” the nurse said without a smile.

It was another week before Zoe knocked on his door. He almost slept through her visit but awoke just as she was about to leave.

“Zoe?”

“Hey,” Zoe smiled. “I heard you woke up.”

“What happened?”

“You freaked out and assaulted Hendrix,” Zoe said. “He’s not pressing charges but George fired you personally.”

“Fuck,” Job whimpered, “All I wanted is a little recognition. Is that too much to ask for? No, destroying me would please George too much.”

Zoe, “Maybe it is your fault. You did it to yourself. We all fuck up. Learn from it, suck it up, and throw yourself back out there. You have no right to question George with all he’s done for you. Wrath kills the foolish men, and envy kills the dumb ones.

“Yet, I’m still here.”

Zoe looked over Job with pity, “I’m sorry there’s not more that I could do.”

Job nodded and Zoe backed up to the door, “Take care of yourself, would ya?”

She abandoned him in that hospital room and it was at this point that Job Stein gave up. 

\_\_\_

They called Job a taxi when he was released from the hospital and he had no where else to go but home. When the car arrived, they took the wheelchair from him and he limped with the help of the cane to the back door. It was a struggle to get it open. His dominant right hand had become stiff.

He arrived at the brownstone just after sun set and the windows were dark. It seemed as if no one was home. He limped up the stoop and struggled to slip the key into the slot.

He entered the darkened living room and listened. The buzz of flies and skitter of rat claws. The old structure creaked on it’s foundation and the radiator popped and sizzled. A horrid stench clouded the air. He flipped on the switch and collapsed against the bookcase in shock. 

“No,” Job gurgled, “No, no.”

Blood was spread across the walls and the nanny’s body was slumped against the fireplace. Her hand was boiling on the burning logs and her caved face hung with agony. 

Job raced upstairs and found his wife lying face down with a bullet hole through her temple as if she was executed. Steve was seated at the vanity facing the mirror. The back of his head had a crater from a bullet and his brains slipped out of his chinless gaping mouth. How's it feel to get fucked? He only cared about his daughter. He stumbled down the hall and  dropped his shoulder into her door. It opened just slightly but was jammed. He kicked violently and the door eventually shoved the mass forward into a pool of blood. No. He scrambled for his daughter and lifted her limp body into his arms. He held her and she felt so light. As if she were made of air. No. He clenched her against his chest, heaving in hyperventilation. No, no. A peaceful smile was spread across her lifeless face. No.	

\_\_\_

The police held him in a small interrogation room. He leaned in a chair across from two other chairs and a small desk. He waited for hours before the detectives entered and grilled him. There was no better suspect. Job knew that. The detectives knew that. There was no way around it. He had to find a way through to them. Homicide detective Miles Saunders wrote down on a yellow legal pad while Trent Rosetto was empty handed.  

“What time did you arrive at the apartment?” Saunders said. 

“I was discharged from the hospital at six o’clock,” Job hummed in thought and searched his memories, “so around six thirty.”

“Were you aware that your wife was having an affair?” Rosetto pushed.

“Yes.”

“How long did you know?” Saunders asked. 

“I found out last night.”

“Last night?” Rosetto laughed. “Whoa.”

“I’m sure that would make you pretty angry,” Saunders led. 

“Of course,” Job said, “but I would never—”

“How did you find out she was cheating?”

“I caught her.”

“Ouch,” Rosetto coughed. “That’s gotta hurt.”

“Yeah,” Job grumbled, “It did.”

“So you killed your family?” Rosetto said. 

“No,” Job barked. “I would never do that. I loved them.”

“I bet it must have been hard raising a child with down syndrome,” Rosetto slipped out.

“No, you don’t get to do that.”

“Do what?”

“Use my daughter like that,” Job said. “She was perfect. She was the perfect little angel. You don’t get to do that.”

Job broke down in tears. He’d never cried like that before. Wailing. Sobbing. Whimpering. She was perfect.

They finally let him leave the station around 3:00 AM and urged him to stay close in case they had more questions. He stumbled into the street and his dysfunctional phone rang. Unknown Caller. He answered it out of habit and held it to his ear. 

“Hello?”

“Job, it’s George Dowe.”

“Oh— Sir?”

“Listen, we need you to come in today.”

“You need me?”

“Yeah, um— Hendrix hasn’t responded in a couple days so I need you to step up.”

“Yeah, no. I— I can’t. Not today.”

“Don’t be foolish. This is the chance of a lifetime.""

“I’m sorry.”

“It’s all yours.”

“I— Uh—”

“So we can count on you, right?”

“Yeah, sure…”

“Great! We’ll see you in the morning.”

All of his rage consumed his actions. His mind shut off and he ran through the street screaming like a mad man. If a police officer would have seen him, he would have been sent right back to jail and the murder would have definitely been pinned on him. He couldn’t stop though. His senses were controlled by a high power. He fired off like a piston, cursing his job, wife, life. The heavens absorbed his dissipating prayers and spit back a gust of wind. 

He arrived at his building and security stood up stiff at the sight of him. 

“You’re not supposed to be here,” the security guard said.

They tried to cut him off but he leaped over the barrier. Job grabbed the elevator keys from behind the desk and sprinted to the stairwell. The security guards gave chase. He climbed the stairs in a fervor and entered the third story. He ran over to the elevator and pressed the up button. Job watched the door with anticipation as the stomping footsteps got closer. The door swung open and the securities guards scrambled toward him. 

The elevator doors opened and he slid inside. Job slipped the key into the penthouse button and turned, pressing the door close button fervently as the security guards got closer. The doors pressed down as the security guards leaped. The door shut and there was a thud as the elevator rose to the Penthouse. 

The door opened to a magnificent living room three stories tall. There was a balcony for each floor and the lights flickered warmly — their light blanketed by darkness. George Owen Dowe stepped out from his private study and stood over Job with an air of higher authority. 

“What are you doing here?”

“Twenty four years,” Job said. “I’ve worked for you for twenty four years. Never once have you said thank you. Never once have you offered me a Christmas bonus. Why do you treat your best employees like shit? Oh, I know. Because you’re a goddamned asshole who exploits the hard work of good people like me. While we’re down there ruining our marriages and wasting our lives away, you sit up here in your ivory tower jacking off. Fuck you.”

“Are you done?”

“No, I’m not done. My family was murdered last night and you have the nerve to tell me that you need me? Now? I needed you and you just abandoned me. You’re the reason they’re dead. I looked up to you and I trusted you and this is what it’s gotten me.”

“Job,” George said.

“I just don’t get it,” Job continued, “I did everything you asked of me. I brought in countless accounts when no one knew our name. Yet, you have no mercy.”

“Job,” George tried again.

“What is it? What the fuck do you want from me?”

“Job, listen — I completely understand.”

“You understand?” Job cackled. “What on earth do you understand? You live in a different world than the rest of us.”

“I understand that you’re angry,” George said with ease. “I understand that you are hurt. We can focus on the past or we can look forward to the future. You can do whatever you want. Hell, hike the Appalachian Trail if you need to. Unfortunately, we can’t just stop our entire operation for you. That’s not how things work. We have to move on — with or without you. This opportunity will never happen again. Don’t miss it.”

George leaned forward on his desk and stared into Job’s soul. He knew that he had him. Job couldn’t respond. He was torn. George had implanted the smallest seed of doubt in his mind that ate away at his logic. He could choose a word to start with and it was apparent by George’s silence that they were done. There was nothing else to say. It was entirely up to Job.

The second hand of the clock spun around the minute. It was 6:59 AM on a Saturday and the office was completely empty. Even the custodial staff was absent when they would usually be finishing up the bathrooms. The elevator opened and Job hobbled out. He had showered, cleaned up, and made himself somewhat presentable. He may have been smiling but his soul was being dragged through hell. Another day at the office.

,Horror_stories,"Job’s life was in near perfect order. The alarm went off at 3:49 AM every morning. He had a glass of orange juice and an apple, shit, then went on a five mile run along the Brooklyn Heights Promenade. He’d come home to his brownstone, shower, dress, drink coffee, eat a hearty breakfast cooked by his nanny, and kiss his daughter before stepping out of the door at 6:00 AM.  He’d take the 2 or 3 train to Fulton Street and enter his building between 6:30-6:45 AM at the latest, depending on train delays. The doors of the elevator would open and the clock above would never be late. His days were like the second hand of the clock, fluid but mechanical — beats per minute that were always building toward a peak that remained elusive.

He never had cause for complaint. He was grateful for everything that he had. It all took work and he earned it. There were many years when he was broke and lonely. He rose through the ladder of the company to get where he was now. He’d worked his entire life for his current position. When he started as an unpaid intern, no one could remember his name. He was practically invisible. Now, his name preceded him. Of course, it came with a cost. Mainly, his time.

Which didn’t help his marriage. Lately, his work ethic had created a division between he and his wife Diane. There was a growing space between them. Few words, even less eye contact, and virtually no intimacy. Job approached their relationship the same way he addressed everything else. It was work, a task, an obligation that he adhered to and was happy to do.

It never was easy for Job, but his persistence produced breakthroughs. Take for instance how he met his wife, Diane. There were many postponed dates before he finally convinced Diane to finally accept his proposal. She didn’t show much interest, and it was a horrible first date. He felt like it was a pity meet and greet. Afterwards he called, hoping for a second date, only to get rejected. It wasn’t until years later when she ran into him on the promenade that her interest finally emerged. Running became a retreat for him so his chub was then gone. Shyness and insecurity had transformed into confidence and a pleasant outgoingness. He was a different man — to her.

Their daughter Basil was the easiest task of them all. She was born with down syndrome and that didn’t stop her from being the light of his life. Everything excited her and a smile rarely left her face. She was just so sweet and innocent. Of course, there were difficulties that were mainly rooted in his ego. He couldn’t help but think that her condition was somehow his fault despite all of the doctors who assured him otherwise. Maybe he shouldn’t have gone through that cigarette phase when he was a teenager. Maybe his sperm was abnormal. Maybe he would fail in raising such a precious spirit. He was paid very well for his analytical mind, but sometimes it got in his way more than it helped him.

One of his main beliefs was that there was always a way to resolve a problem. With enough work, even the direst of situations could turn around. Take for example where we find him now. An important client was going to leave the firm for a partnership with a young start-up. Job assessed the risks, ran through the numbers, and prepared a presentation that killed. This latest victory was months in the making. Preparing, practicing, and eventually executing. He was the last in the office again, basking in his success. The view from his office’s window overlooked Manhattan. The Empire State Building. Chrysler Building. Times Square. George Washington Bridge in the distance. A crescent moon dangled like a hook over the Jersey cliffs. The entire city was his in this moment. He had never felt prouder.

The clock hit 9:11 PM and finally Job rose from his desk. The picture frames surrounding his computer were lit in a dim golden light. He smiled and flicked off the green banker’s lamp. The faces of his wife and child were veiled by shadows and his footsteps left the room in silence.

He was waiting for the elevator when he heard an impassioned voice booming from the corner office.

“I’ll make you eat the flesh of your children you little fuckin’ rat,” came from the office. Job treaded lightly closer to the door. It was the office of the founder and CEO of the company, George Owen Dowe. Job’s father always told him to never trust a man with two first names. Rarely was George seen in the offices. Usually, there were only rumors that gave him life. \*He’s in Senegal right now, tomorrow he’ll be Austria, oh -- did you see his pictures from Saint Tropez?\* He was more of a myth than a real person. Job had seen him only from across the room every now and again but even that made Job nervous. George inspired an entire generation of financiers. His name was synonymous with success. He lived at an echelon of stature that few would ever inhabit. By now, George Owen Dowe’s money infiltrated every trade across the board. He owned a piece of everything.

“Try me,” George bellowed, “and the only job you’ll be able to get will be shoveling shit.”

George slammed the phone on the base and Job shuddered. The elevator dinged and the doors opened. Job turned to leave and drove his face into the chest of a pale beastly man wearing a three piece burgundy suit. A sly smile slithered up his cheek. Job knew the man, Luc Milieu, and was just as sure that he was the last person you’d expect to find in this building. The door swung open and George stood there scowling. Job was wedged between a feud that had been boiling in each man’s blood for over a quarter of a century.

“Job,” George said.

“Sir,” Job was shocked that such a man as George knew his name. “I— uh—”

“Were just leaving,” George said as he shot the thin man a hateful glare.

“Yes sir,” Job bowed and slipped out from between them. The elevator doors were closing, and he raced over to stab his hand and hit the censors. The doors reopened and he hurried inside. He watched the two men enter the corner office with the utmost intrigue. Why would they be meeting after all these years? The elevator doors closed on the men. George stared out of the window with his back turned to his guest.

\_\_\_

“Think of the devil,” George said as he looked out of the window, “and he’s already found you.”

George watched the city glisten, looking through the reflection of his adversary. The sky line had been altered by their investment. Skyscrapers with their names lit up the night. Their signature was written in permanent monoliths of steel and concrete. Midtown. Flatiron. Central Park East. Luc lingered by the door and had a different view. He saw all of the windows sprawled out across the city, and wondered of all the pain and suffering hidden by the curtains. The world was a wicked place — and he’d seen the worst. No thanks to the abrupt expulsion from the company that he co-founded with George.

“Old friend,” Luc said with venom. “It’s been a while.”

“Yes, a good while too.”

“May I?” Luc motioned to the chair.

“If you must,” George said as walked over to the liquor cart. He poured two twelve year old whiskeys, neat. “To what do I owe this sudden intrusion?”

“I was just in town and thought I’d check in on our business,” Luc said as he sat gently into the leather chair and folded his leg over his knee. He took the glass from George and they solemnly clinked glassed.

“Our business. That’s funny,” George walked around the desk and sat back in his luxurious seat, not a trace of laughter was on his solid sunken face. “Where have you come from?”

“Everywhere and nowhere really,” Luc laughed wickedly and stroked his pointy goatee, “your workers are certainly dedicated if they are willing to work so late.”

“I don’t ask them to,” George smiled serenely, “They do so because they believe in our mission here.”

“Or they fear you,” Luc said. “That man was too terrified to speak.”

“Job? He’s one of our finest workers,” George boasted. “His faith in this company is unparalleled.”

“Is that so? It’s hard to be discontent when you have everything.”

“He’s earned it.”

“Wouldn’t it be a shame if he were to suddenly pursue a better offer from a competitor?”

“He would never,” George cleared his throat, falling into all seriousness.

“Are you so sure?”

“He looks up to me as a mentor — his idol if you will. While you’ve been off galavanting around the world, I’ve been here — building this empire.”

“And whose decision was that?”

“Job is satisfied in his current position.”

“Is he now?”

“He obeys with absolute devotion — never a question asked.”

“Oh?”

“Works holidays, is the first to arrive in the morning, and the last to leave at night. Hell, he even missed the birth of his daughter. His allegiance to me is unbreakable.”

“Everyone has a breaking point.”

“Not this one.”

“How much would you be willing to bet?”

“A man’s life is not worth a wager.”

“Say, if his life wasn’t the wager? More, his \*devotion\*.”

George leaned back in his chair and examined Luc’s interest, “What’s in it for you?”

“The real question is, how much are you willing to gain?”

“And how is that?”

“What if I were to tell you that I’d be willing to sell you my remaining shares? You’d have complete control over your \*little kingdom\*.”

“I’ve been trying to convince you to do that for decades. Why the sudden change in heart?”

“Nothing gives me greater joy than proving you wrong.”

“You’d like that, wouldn’t you?”

“Ah yes,” Luc raised his glass and took a swig.

“So what are you proposing?”

“There is no perfection in this world. Nothing is pure. Nothing is sacred. It’s all a mess — utter chaos. A tree can only withstand so many storms before it bends.”

“And?”

“Allow me to test Job’s faith. I promise you that if he loses everything, he’ll turn against you without question.”

George laughed heartily while holding his belly. He then leaned with his forearms on the desk and the light cast a shadow across his face, “alright then, all that he has is in your hands, but don’t you hurt him.”

Luc smiled and kicked his leg off his knee. He rose and extended his hand, shaking with George.

\_\_\_

Most mornings were met with the kick of a high hat as Job plummeted out of his feverish dream of falling from the top of a skyscraper. The descent always lasted long enough for the panic to be replaced by a calm awareness of certain death. He accepted it and that’s when his phone alarm would spare him of this repetitive torture. Today, the pavement stayed away and he fell and fell and fell to no quick relief. Perhaps he wasn’t falling but flying. If there were no end, then he was suspended from the heavens. An extension of the universe. He felt free.

And it was with this ease that he floated back through the window like a feather on a gentle breeze. His body was released onto his memory foam mattress and down comforter. His eyes fluttered open and he yawned at the sun. \*Why was the sun up? What time was it?\* He checked his phone but the power was off. He pressed the power button but only got the image of a drained battery with a red bottom. \*How could—\* He checked the wire and it was cut, split, and frayed in the middle. The cat never chewed wires before. \*What the hell got into her?\*

He rubbed his eyes back into focus, 7:15 AM. Shit. He struggled to get dressed — every piece of clothing felt tight over his spasming muscles. He tried to get comfortable but nothing fit right. He didn’t have time for comfort. He was late for the pitch.

Job entered the kitchen in a frenzy, “Why didn’t you wake me up?”

He looked around an empty family room. Then he checked the bathroom, Basil’s room. No one was there. He bent the blinds and saw the street sweeper barreling down the block. Their car wasn’t double parked like usual. His wife must’ve already taken their daughter to school.

As he jogged to the subway, Job tried calling Diane but it kept going to voicemail. He tried again while standing at the top of the steps as outgoing traffic from the arriving train spilled out from the burrow. He was checked by a man wearing a red checkered button up and grey slacks. He turned to shoot a dirty look and was met by a deathly scowl. The man was his age, handsome with a square jaw, icy eyes, and light hair. He was everything that Job was not. He may have lost all that weight years ago but he was far from symmetrical. Job pocketed his phone and descended into the subway, too timid to look back.

The subway was crammed with people during the morning rush. This is why he like to travel earlier, to avoid that cattle car feeling. He waited for the next train to arrive behind a crowd of people. It wasn’t for another half hour before it came chugging into the station. He pushed to the front of the platform and the train stopped with him standing halfway between doors so he got boxed out. The doors open and the people squished together. No one got off. They were all heading to the city for work. Job tried to pry through the others waiting in line but couldn’t manage to get to the door in time. The doors shut and train moved on.

The trains heading southbound were coming back to back but there was no sign of movement down the tracks heading in his direction. He waited and the crowd got thicker. Finally, a train dragged itself into the station and Job positioned himself in front of the door. He forced himself on, probably accidentally committing sexual assault in the process. There was no way to get into the city without snug full body touching these days. They were nearly into Manhattan when the train came to a screeching halt. The conductor announced that there was a medical emergency at the Fulton Street station. Job’s back was throbbing and his arm was going numb from holding onto the overhead bars. An itch burned on his back but there was no where to squirm.

Things didn’t improve at work either. The doors of the elevator opened to chaos. A frenzy of excitement echoed off the walls. The workers hurried around the hive like ants after being doused with gas and lit on fire. One of his co-workers rushed up to him with disheveled hair and his dress shirt halfway untucked. He clumsily shoved his glasses back up the bridge of his  sweaty nose.

“Where the hell have you been?” Phil said as he tucked in the back of his shirt.

“My alarm didn’t go off,” Job said wearily.

“You picked a hell of a day to not show up.”

“What’s going on?

“The Sorbos deal fell through.”

“How could it—”

“You didn’t show up so they walked.”

“…but we agreed to terms.”

Phil shrugged, “Yeah, well — they’re gone.”

The rest of the day was spent reaching answering machines or no answers at all. The constant sound of the ringing phone battered Job’s frontal lobe. The calls were always from some confused soul in the building and not the people he was hoping to hear from. \*Why would they back out?\* Just yesterday they sat in the boardroom with smiles on their faces. There wasn’t a hint of doubt in those plastered smiles. They didn’t need him there to finalize it.

By lunch, rumors were beginning to spread. Job didn’t have time to eat but needed coffee to combat his heavy eyes. He scratched his forearm and listened to Zoe and Billy’s conspiracy theories. The rumors were flying around with the fury of a tornado. Zoe had it in her mind that the folks at Sorbos were tipped on some insider knowledge. She believed that the company was going down fast. Her division was responsible for the budget so she was one to know. Billy maintained that George’s arch rival, Luc Milieu, had returned to take back what was rightfully his. Luc was starting with their biggest account and would soon own them all.

Sure enough, they were both right. Clients started closing their accounts despite the massive breach of contract fees. The numbers might have looked good for one time transactions but weren’t sustainable for the weeks ahead. The overhead for an entire skyscraper needed constant revenue to be pouring in. As if by a flip of a switch, the money stopped flowing and a drought set in almost immediately. The stocks plummeted and the panic in the office settled into a somber realization of how bad things could become.

No one smiled that day. Job’s entire retirement plan was wiped away by the drop in price for each share. His planned progression in life was interrupted by an unforeseen obstacle. Surely, he would overcome it. He could defeat any foe — box with any opponent. Even if that opponent was George Owen Dowe himself. It wasn’t going to be easy if no one would answer their phone or call back. He felt like he was screaming into a void that went unheard. All he had to do was make the effort. Pull up his boot straps and put his head down. Keep his soul to the grindstone, chipping away piece by piece. Yet, without a response — there was nothing he could do.

There was a light rapping on the door and finally Job looked up from his computer screen. Phil stood in the doorway, his shirt stained by sweat and a sad exhaustion to his demeanor, “After today, drinks are in order. We’ll be at the White House. You coming?”

Job scratched his neck and sighed, “As good as that sounds, I need to figure this out.”

“Don’t kill yourself,” Phil said as he slapped the door and left.

The overcast sky was getting dark and the same view that looked so promising the night before was now dreary and ominous. Job resigned to defeat for the day and decided to head home early. The only thing that could cheer him up was his baby girl. The commute home was just as packed as it was in the morning and the car he entered reeked of a homeless man hidden behind a wall of misery. All he wanted to do was lie down in his bed and sleep forever.

The windows of his brownstone were dim when he arrived. His sore ankles stumbled up the stoop and he fumbled his keys. They clanked on the ground and he strained himself bending over to pick them up. He limped up the stairwell to the second floor and entered the living room. His daughter was sitting in front of the television.

“What did I tell you about sitting too close to the television?”

Basil’s face lit up with happiness. No matter what, she glowed when she was around her father and waited everyday for him to get home from work. If it was past her bedtime, she’d stay awake and prayed that he’d return. \*Please, please, please\*. She would have to pretend she was sleeping when he came in to give her a kiss because she didn’t want to get in trouble. She was an angel, lit by the dancing blue of the television.

“Hey baby girl,” Job hugged his sweetheart tight and strong, “Oh, I missed you.”

“I missed you too Daddy.”

“You’re a sight for sore eyes.”

“Why are your eyes sore?”

“It’s an expression, baby girl.”

“An exprection?”

“Yes, hunny,” Job looked around but there was no sign of his wife, “Where’s mommy?”

“She’s upstairs with her friend.”

“Upstairs? Which friend? Trudy? Melissa?”

“No, Steve.”

“Who the fuck is Steve?”

“Ooh, Daddy said a bad word.”

Basil’s giggle fueled his rampage up the stairs. A moaning escaped from behind the closed door at the end of the hall. Her voice. Her laugh. It was a stab to his abdomen and he keeled over in agony at the landing, balancing his weight on the bannister. He listened to her whelp. Her enjoyment. His grunting. The headboard slapping against the wall and her pussy clapping his balls. His chest tightened and he clenched a fist. He burst through the door and found his wife riding someone like a wild cowgirl.

“What the fuck are you doing?”

Diane turned and smiled at Job with a malicious firmness as she continued to grind on top of this stranger. The sight of Job seemed to be what pushed her over the edge and she lapsed into a shivering orgasm. Her toes curled and her leg locked up and shook. She rolled off of Steve, bumping into each ab on her way down.

“Who the fuck is this?”

“I’m Steve,” Job recognized his face. It was the man from this morning who bumped into him. He was filled with rage but didn’t know what to do with it. He’d never been in a fight, and from the look of this guy Steve it wouldn’t be a fair match. He could toss Job around like a dog rips apart a stuffed animal.

“He’s Steve.”

“You brought another man into our bed?”

“Our bed? When was the last time you slept here? When was the last time you fucked me in this bed?”

“You can’t just—”

“I can do whatever the fuck I want,” Diane barked. “You do.”

“And you bring him around our daughter?”

“Don’t pretend to care,” she laughed.

“Don’t pretend to— Don’t pretend to care? You’ve gotta be kidding me.”

“Does it look like I’m kidding you?” she said in a cold brick tone as she grabbed Steve’s semi-hard dick and wiggled it around.

“What did I ever do to you?”

“Oh, please. Don’t give me that bullshit. You did this. You care more about that company than you do your family.”

“Diane, that’s not true.”

“Oh? Then where were you when I was pushing your precious daughter out of my vagina? Huh? Where were you on her first day of school? Or her seventh birthday? You’re never here. You’re always working. And I get lonely.”

“Maybe I should—” Steve began to rise naked from the bed.

“You should,” Job foamed from the mouth. “Get the fuck out of my house.”

“No,” Diane grabbed Steve’s wrist.

“I don’t want to cause any—”

“He caused all the trouble,” Diane said. “So you’re going to stay and he’s going to leave.”

“I’m not going anywhere,” Job growled defiantly.

“Sleep in your office tonight,” Diane said, “or go kill yourself. I don’t really care. Just go.”

\_\_\_

The White House was drunk with revelry. It was Friday night and all of the financial bros were in full pig squeal. The corner of the bar was calm compared to the rest of the rowdy patrons. Job pushed through the crowd and came across his co-workers’ booth. They all hung onto their empty glasses in despair. A bottle of tequila was propped up between them. They barely acknowledged Job’s arrival, but Phil scooted over and instinctively poured Job a shot which sat untouched. Zoe noticed that Job was worse off than the rest of them.

“Look at this sad lot,” a voice shouted out from the Top 40 playlist booming from beyond the crowd. Job look up from his glass and saw Arthur Bernstein standing over them. He dropped a tray of glasses onto the table. The glasses had been used and one even had lipstick smear on the rim. The taller of the glasses had a yolky loogie floating at the bottom. Job went to Cornell with Arthur and has always despised him.

“Courtesy of Milieu Industries,” Arthur grinned and slid the tray in front of them, “We offer you the bottom of the barrel.”

“Fuck off Bernstein,” Billy shoved the tray at Arthur and the loogie splashed out and splattered on his chest. The table erupted in laughter. Billy rose from his seat and got in Arthur’s face. Arthur took a reluctant step back.

“You think that you can’t be touched,” Arthur growled, “but you’re not special. You’re nothing.”

Billy didn’t let up and Arthur was pulled back by his goons. They faded into the reflective style of button ups and khakis and Billy sat back down in a gust of anger, “Fuckin’ asshole.”

Job stared into the glass, sniffed the whiskey, and thought about that old proverb on the fullness of a glass. If he saw the glass as being half full, he’d be a optimist. If it were empty, he’d be a pessimist. If he saw it as both half full and half empty he’d be a realist. He didn’t even see the glass anymore. What the fuck did that make him? \*Job\*. He stared into middle space. His house was on fire. His wife was dead. His daughter fell in love with an asshole like Arthur. He got fired. Had nothing. He was a failure. \*Job\*. It didn’t matter how hard he worked, it was all bullshit anyway.

“Job,” Zoe said and he looked up from the glass with tears streaming from his eyes. His co-workers were watching him nervously, “it’s not that serious.”

“Yeah man,” Phil said, nudging his shoulder. “It always works out.”

“My wife cheated on me,” Job muttered.

“Oh,” said Billy and Zoe.

“Shit,” said Phil, “I’m sorry.”

“What’s the point?” Job was nearly sobbing. “You work your ass off your entire life for what? You’re going to lose it all anyway. So what’s the fucking point? Life is nothing but wind.”

“You can’t blame yourself,” Phil said.

“Who else can I blame? Huh?”

“She’s the one that cheated,” said Zoe. “Blame her.”

“She said I work too much. I’m never there. I don’t— I can’t—”

“If anything, you did everything you could.”

“It wasn’t enough,” said Job. “It’s never enough.”

He rose from his seat having never touched his alcohol, and left his friends without so much as a second glance. He slept on the subway that night. He awoke as the train emerged from a tunnel and rose up over Brooklyn. The sun was breaking over the horizon and a burning itch spread up his wrist. He scratched it with no relief. He slid his sleeve up and saw a rash spreading across his inner forearm. The city was getting farther away. Everything he ever knew was slipping into the dark clouds of an impending storm.

\_\_\_

Job entered the lobby of his work an hour early. He slept for an hour on the couch of the break room before the buzz of the office awoke him. He was still wearing the same suit as yesterday and smelled like liquor. Everyone shot him glances of disapproval. He didn’t care. He went to the bathroom, wet his hair, and combed it back with his fingers. His eyes were bloodshot and hugged by swollen lids. He looked like shit. \*Fuck it.\*

He was intercepted by Phil on his way back to his office, “The big man wants to talk to you.”

“He’s in today?” Job was surprised.

“Yeah,” Phil whispered, “and he’s pissed.”

\_\_\_

There was someone else sitting in front of George when Job entered. The man turned and the sight of him punched Job in his pride. It was Steve. \*He fucked my wife\*. The room spun around him. His skin burned. He was unable to move, petrified by shock.

“Job,” George said leaning back, “Please have a seat. This isn’t going to be easy to hear.”

“Wha—” Job choked. “What?”

“Have a seat,” George barked.

Job stepped forward, his vision never leaving the smirk on Steve’s face. His beating heart was about to break a rib. His hands trembled and his eyes filled with tears. His feet moved without thought and he sat gently into the seat next to Steve. They stared at each other with enough poison to destroy an ecosystem.

“This is Steven Hendrix,” George said with nonchalance, “He’s here to right your wrongs.”

“Excuse me?”

“Is that the tone you wish to use in approaching this?” George said calmly.

“No, I— I just don’t understand.”

“It’s pretty simple. You lost our biggest account. That is unacceptable.”

“Of course, I—”

“Steven here has come highly recommended from Luc Milieu. He’ll be supervising the Sorbos account from here on out and you will report directly to him.”

“But—”

“There’s only one response I want to hear and that’s yes sir.”

“Yes, of course — sir.”

Steve’s glaring pride nearly got his throat slit. Job eyed the letter opener on George’s desk. It would be a simple task, really. Just thrust upward and through the Adam’s Apple. He’d bleed out and die in minutes. He’d suffer. That’s all that Job could ever want. He wanted Steve to suffer. Steve extended his hand, “I look forward to working with you.”

Job shook his hand, and would forever regret it.

\_\_\_

Around lunch time, Job had to leave the office. Steve wouldn’t stop hounding him over every little detail that was missed. Every time he saw the man, he’d see his naked wife grinding. Thrusting. Fucking. Dirty and primal. He’d hear her moans. She orgasmed while looking at him. The day would end in murder, he was sure of it. He developed a fever and his rashes were aflame, spreading across his skin like a wildfire with a wind. He tried to make it to the elevator but his head was lightheaded from rising too fast.

The doors of the elevator opened and Steve exited. There was no way to avoid him. Steve approached and placed his hand on Job’s shoulder, “How’s it feel to get fucked?”

\_\_\_

The soft fluorescent lights met Job’s blurry vision. He groaned and slipped in an out of consciousness. His daughter stood before him, crying. \*Wake up daddy, wake up\*. His wife made out with Steve, who held up a middle finger. Luc Milieu studied him, purely entertained by his pain. The doctor and nurses trailed around him in a blur. He was paralyzed.

He finally emerged from his coma four days later. He was alone and no one except doctors and nurses visited him. The right side of his face was paralyzed and he couldn't feel his legs. The doctors would only dip in every now and again and didn’t seem to do anything for him. They’d examine him, grunt, and leave.

“What happened to me?” Job asked.

“You had a stroke and hit your head,” the doctor said.

“A stroke? I’m too young for a stroke.”

“No one is too young to have a stroke.”

The doctor left while the nurse stayed and filled out his chart.

“Miss,” Job said to the nurse, “Could you please reach my family?”

“They’ve been contacted,” the nurse said without a smile.

It was another week before Zoe knocked on his door. He almost slept through her visit but awoke just as she was about to leave.

“Zoe?”

“Hey,” Zoe smiled. “I heard you woke up.”

“What happened?”

“You freaked out and assaulted Hendrix,” Zoe said. “He’s not pressing charges but George fired you personally.”

“Fuck,” Job whimpered, “All I wanted is a little recognition. Is that too much to ask for? No, destroying me would please George too much.”

Zoe, “Maybe it is your fault. You did it to yourself. We all fuck up. Learn from it, suck it up, and throw yourself back out there. You have no right to question George with all he’s done for you. Wrath kills the foolish men, and envy kills the dumb ones.

“Yet, I’m still here.”

Zoe looked over Job with pity, “I’m sorry there’s not more that I could do.”

Job nodded and Zoe backed up to the door, “Take care of yourself, would ya?”

She abandoned him in that hospital room and it was at this point that Job Stein gave up.

\_\_\_

They called Job a taxi when he was released from the hospital and he had no where else to go but home. When the car arrived, they took the wheelchair from him and he limped with the help of the cane to the back door. It was a struggle to get it open. His dominant right hand had become stiff.

He arrived at the brownstone just after sun set and the windows were dark. It seemed as if no one was home. He limped up the stoop and struggled to slip the key into the slot.

He entered the darkened living room and listened. The buzz of flies and skitter of rat claws. The old structure creaked on it’s foundation and the radiator popped and sizzled. A horrid stench clouded the air. He flipped on the switch and collapsed against the bookcase in shock.

“No,” Job gurgled, “No, no.”

Blood was spread across the walls and the nanny’s body was slumped against the fireplace. Her hand was boiling on the burning logs and her caved face hung with agony.

Job raced upstairs and found his wife lying face down with a bullet hole through her temple as if she was executed. Steve was seated at the vanity facing the mirror. The back of his head had a crater from a bullet and his brains slipped out of his chinless gaping mouth. \*How's it feel to get fucked?\* He only cared about his daughter. He stumbled down the hall and  dropped his shoulder into her door. It opened just slightly but was jammed. He kicked violently and the door eventually shoved the mass forward into a pool of blood. \*No\*. He scrambled for his daughter and lifted her limp body into his arms. He held her and she felt so light. As if she were made of air. \*No\*. He clenched her against his chest, heaving in hyperventilation. \*No, no\*. A peaceful smile was spread across her lifeless face. \*No\*.

\_\_\_

The police held him in a small interrogation room. He leaned in a chair across from two other chairs and a small desk. He waited for hours before the detectives entered and grilled him. There was no better suspect. Job knew that. The detectives knew that. There was no way around it. He had to find a way through to them. Homicide detective Miles Saunders wrote down on a yellow legal pad while Trent Rosetto was empty handed.

“What time did you arrive at the apartment?” Saunders said.

“I was discharged from the hospital at six o’clock,” Job hummed in thought and searched his memories, “so around six thirty.”

“Were you aware that your wife was having an affair?” Rosetto pushed.

“Yes.”

“How long did you know?” Saunders asked.

“I found out last night.”

“Last night?” Rosetto laughed. “Whoa.”

“I’m sure that would make you pretty angry,” Saunders led.

“Of course,” Job said, “but I would never—”

“How did you find out she was cheating?”

“I caught her.”

“Ouch,” Rosetto coughed. “That’s gotta hurt.”

“Yeah,” Job grumbled, “It did.”

“So you killed your family?” Rosetto said.

“No,” Job barked. “I would never do that. I loved them.”

“I bet it must have been hard raising a child with down syndrome,” Rosetto slipped out.

“No, you don’t get to do that.”

“Do what?”

“Use my daughter like that,” Job said. “She was perfect. She was the perfect little angel. You don’t get to do that.”

Job broke down in tears. He’d never cried like that before. Wailing. Sobbing. Whimpering. \*She was perfect\*.

They finally let him leave the station around 3:00 AM and urged him to stay close in case they had more questions. He stumbled into the street and his dysfunctional phone rang. \*Unknown Caller\*. He answered it out of habit and held it to his ear.

“Hello?”

“Job, it’s George Dowe.”

“Oh— Sir?”

“Listen, we need you to come in today.”

“You need me?”

“Yeah, um— Hendrix hasn’t responded in a couple days so I need you to step up.”

“Yeah, no. I— I can’t. Not today.”

“Don’t be foolish. This is the chance of a lifetime.""

“I’m sorry.”

“It’s all yours.”

“I— Uh—”

“So we can count on you, right?”

“Yeah, sure…”

“Great! We’ll see you in the morning.”

All of his rage consumed his actions. His mind shut off and he ran through the street screaming like a mad man. If a police officer would have seen him, he would have been sent right back to jail and the murder would have definitely been pinned on him. He couldn’t stop though. His senses were controlled by a high power. He fired off like a piston, cursing his job, wife, life. The heavens absorbed his dissipating prayers and spit back a gust of wind.

He arrived at his building and security stood up stiff at the sight of him.

“You’re not supposed to be here,” the security guard said.

They tried to cut him off but he leaped over the barrier. Job grabbed the elevator keys from behind the desk and sprinted to the stairwell. The security guards gave chase. He climbed the stairs in a fervor and entered the third story. He ran over to the elevator and pressed the up button. Job watched the door with anticipation as the stomping footsteps got closer. The door swung open and the securities guards scrambled toward him.

The elevator doors opened and he slid inside. Job slipped the key into the penthouse button and turned, pressing the door close button fervently as the security guards got closer. The doors pressed down as the security guards leaped. The door shut and there was a thud as the elevator rose to the Penthouse.

The door opened to a magnificent living room three stories tall. There was a balcony for each floor and the lights flickered warmly — their light blanketed by darkness. George Owen Dowe stepped out from his private study and stood over Job with an air of higher authority.

“What are you doing here?”

“Twenty four years,” Job said. “I’ve worked for you for twenty four years. Never once have you said thank you. Never once have you offered me a Christmas bonus. Why do you treat your best employees like shit? Oh, I know. Because you’re a goddamned asshole who exploits the hard work of good people like me. While we’re down there ruining our marriages and wasting our lives away, you sit up here in your ivory tower jacking off. Fuck you.”

“Are you done?”

“No, I’m not done. My family was murdered last night and you have the nerve to tell me that you need me? Now? I needed you and you just abandoned me. You’re the reason they’re dead. I looked up to you and I trusted you and this is what it’s gotten me.”

“Job,” George said.

“I just don’t get it,” Job continued, “I did everything you asked of me. I brought in countless accounts when no one knew our name. Yet, you have no mercy.”

“Job,” George tried again.

“What is it? What the fuck do you want from me?”

“Job, listen — I completely understand.”

“You understand?” Job cackled. “What on earth do you understand? You live in a different world than the rest of us.”

“I understand that you’re angry,” George said with ease. “I understand that you are hurt. We can focus on the past or we can look forward to the future. You can do whatever you want. Hell, hike the Appalachian Trail if you need to. Unfortunately, we can’t just stop our entire operation for you. That’s not how things work. We have to move on — with or without you. This opportunity will never happen again. Don’t miss it.”

George leaned forward on his desk and stared into Job’s soul. He knew that he had him. Job couldn’t respond. He was torn. George had implanted the smallest seed of doubt in his mind that ate away at his logic. He could choose a word to start with and it was apparent by George’s silence that they were done. There was nothing else to say. It was entirely up to Job.

\_\_\_

The second hand of the clock spun around the minute. It was 6:59 AM on a Saturday and the office was completely empty. Even the custodial staff was absent when they would usually be finishing up the bathrooms. The elevator opened and Job hobbled out. He had showered, cleaned up, and made himself somewhat presentable. He may have been smiling but his soul was being dragged through hell. Another day at the office.

,needforspeed,"I want to introduce you to radio stations. this will make the game into a more living a breathing world. it also separates all genres so if people want to listen exclusively to one genre they can just switch to that station. I'd imagine this working similarly to a GTA game, but I have a special radio station for those of you asking for EA Trax to come back in NFS at the end. anyways, the radio station will allow for more variety because each station will have to have at least 15 songs in order to really function (I put 16 because I hate track listings being an odd number). compared to now where there's like 3 rap songs, 3 rock songs, 3 electronic songs, and so on. it's just not good. so I'm making this suggestion to push NFS further. let's escape the past of making movie style soundtracks for the game. lets make it more immersive and better for the player. clearly for Ghost Games trying to mimick what Black Box did just won't work. it's a similar situation to their current way of designing maps.

* Custom Playlist 

this is for those who want EA Trax to return. Custom Playlist allows you to add songs externally via some services. you can also enable songs from the game to play in the custom playlist if you enjoy any of the songs in the main radio stations. 

* Conclusion 

I didn't add a pop station because Pop is really hard to shop for in terms of racing games. I mean they could do what GTA did and just fill it with the biggest of pop hits, but I don't think they'd need my help for that. I noticed people didn't like my last post. so I tried even harder to clarify and make things better. I will be deleting the other post. Thank you to everyone who helped me with this to improve it. hopefully nothing here bothers anyone too much. I tried with the rock playlists, but I'm no expert in what's good in the genre so. soundtrack list would be 80 tracks, however the radio station idea is built to allow Ghost to further add more songs to radio stations in future updates for FREE. don't forget that Ghost, if you charge for songs added in radio stations it will make you look greedy as fuck. 

if you have any questions I'll try my best to answer them.

Dakota Krout’s latest novel, Regicide (The Completionist Chronicles Book 2), released earlier week and hit it out of the park. On the novels 1st day of release it shot all the way up the top 100 list to #24 of ALL books on Amazon and hit the #1 spot in many categories as a best seller. Days later it is still in the top 100. Congratulations man, I’m super proud of you.

Michael Scott Earl is the author of over 65 books, including several LitRPG series. This week he was hit with the suspension hammer from Amazon.

Currently (07/18/18), Amazon only shows his audiobooks available for purchase. None of his ebooks or print copies are available. ([https://www.amazon.com/default/e/B019QSNVA2](https://www.amazon.com/default/e/B019QSNVA2) )

Thousands of his fans are writing to Jeff Bezos and Amazon customer support complaining about their favorite author having his ebooks removed. Fans have posted Amazon’s responses to their questions on the author’s reader page. Responses range from free ebook credits to assurances that the author hasn’t actually been suspended but rather that there is a content issue with his novels. All include some statement that the issue will be sent up the investigations chain.  

Responses from the Jeff Bezos emails have usually had the same one sentence response, “this issue will be amicably settled soon.”

Michael-Scott Earle explained his position in a statement:

“...I've got nothing from Amazon, but I've sent them a few emails.

Other authors are scratching their heads, I wasn't stuffing, so the only other things that could have caused it was paying click farms to push my books, or formatting. I didn't pay for click farming (but maybe I was set up), and my formatting is the same as other authors...

...If they decide to ban me, I'm pretty much done. The other ebook distro sites don't have enough traffic to pay my bills, and Pateron is fueled by traffic from people picking up books through Amazon- so I'd never be able to grow it past the people that are in this group. Even the best paid authors on Pateron don't make a living wage.

TL;DR version- Please email jeff@amazon.com. You don't have to be rude or threaten, you can just say that you love my work and you really want me to re-instated. From what people have said, my account is still up in the air, so your help could ensure that I come back.”

There is also an online petition for both Michael-Scott Earle and J.A. Cipriano to be have their accounts reinstated.

Call of Carrethen: (Wellspring Book 1)

https://i.redd.it/swulfrnmp5b11.jpg

Call of Carrethen,the world’s first real Virtual Reality game, powered by the Wellspring device. Growing up broke in The Sprawl, I knew I could never afford one. But then I won a contest and the next thing I knew, I was diving into the most incredible world living out my wildest fantasies.

But now I’m being held hostage with no ability to log out, and the penalty for in-game death? Brain death. My soul will be lost forever in the “electronic void.”

The world has been taken over by a black knight calling himself The Ripper. I don’t know him—but he definitely knows me. He turned the entire server red and returned everyone to level 1. Everyone but me.

He’s gifted me 20 levels—with one single, deadly caveat: anyone who manages to kill me gets a free ride home.

I'm a marked man. In order to survive and to get back to my family, I have to level up and defeat The Ripper. But with more than half the server out to get me, that’s not going to be easy...

My Opinion: 437 pages, $4.99, Available on Kindle Unlimited

Full Disclosure: I received an advanced copy for review. I purchased the novel when it became available. 

The story takes the Sword Art Online premise of ‘trapped in the game’ and ‘die in the game, die in real life’ and adds a bit of a twist. In addition to beating the big evil max level bad guy to get free, another way one of the many trapped players can get out of the game is by killing the main character, Jack. To make it a challenge for the other players, they’re all reset to level 1 and the MC is bumped up to level 20. This incorporates a race between the MC and the rest of the server to level up. It’s good motivation for everyone to continue risking their lives playing this game. 

I was a little disappointed at how little progress the MC had made with a two week time skip forward, but understand that the author had to give the other characters a chance to catch up some. From there on it’s a story about how far the MC is being pushed to kill the other players to protect his friends and the guild that helped him out. There are many discussions about the morality of the subject, and while some people will find the MCs point of view to come off a bit whiney (i did), it’s the challenge he has to overcome by the end of the story. 

On the game mechanic side, the author says he based the story and the game mechanics on Asheron’s Call. He even gives the game a nod in the story. There’s loads of detail about skills and how players can create truly unique builds. Most of this detail is front loaded in the story and as it goes on much of that variety and detail is minimized as the story shifts its focus to the PvP and PK combat. Crafting does happen in the story, but you don’t get much detail since it’s not the main character doing any of it. 

Combat is good, mostly. There are several fights where things feel fixed or wand wavy and where the MC or more of his friends should have died. But overall, the descriptions are well done and there is a variety of combat scenes that kept me interested.

The things I liked:

In a story where death is permanent, the author was not afraid to kill off characters. Don’t be surprised if some characters you like end up dead.

The addition of the plot point that a player could get free if they killed the MC was a nice twist on what is otherwise a standard premise.

The twists at the end were foreshadowed but still came as a neat surprise.

The resolution was satisfying.

Game mechanics had good depth in principle and I could imagine many of the builds possible.

Running gag where one character quotes movies constantly. Good personality trait.

The things that bugged me:

Combat got a bit wand wavy sometimes. There were several fights where the MC or his group would fight characters 10-20 levels higher than them and struggled until the MC used a particular magic spell and then suddenly they just won. The math on the spell just didn’t seem like it would have made that big of a difference. 

Crafting felt wand wavy. Most game mechanics are setup to let crafters make things that are just a bit better than what they could get from loot drops. But here, the crafters seemed to make items that made players 10 levels more powerful. Sometimes doubling or tripling the power of an already above high level item. All while the crafter themselves was 10-30 levels lower than the min requirements to even wield that weapon.

Why weren’t there any healers in the story? No one with a resurrection spell? In Sword Art Online, this is explained because there is no magic in the game. But here, healing exists, but no one decides to focus on it and get a simple resurrection spell to save people?

There’s just this dissonance in the MCs motivations and how he treats death. The MC cares enough about his survival to flee from everyone, so he clearly has survival instinct for self preservation. So much so that he jumps off a cliff and trusts that his friend is right about an exploit will save him. But when faced with men that are clearly described as remorseless murderers, who have clear intent to murder him, that same instinct disappears. Instead he has the presence of mind to whine about not wanting to be a murderer even though he knows these same guys killed people he cared about and will kill many more.

\----

Overall, despite some of the issues in the story, I ended up liking it. The twists and resolution at the end was satisfying enough to just push it over into the 7 out of 10 range. But it was a close one. 

Score: 7.1 out of 10

The Station Core: A Dungeon Core Epic (Station Cores Book 1)

https://i.redd.it/qlz54b3hp5b11.jpg

Milton Frederick was arguably the best player of Crowned Lieges of Destiny in the entire world. As the strategy coordinator for one of the top guilds, he was beginning to actually make a living from it. That was, until he was abducted by aliens.

Instead of your stereotypical grey aliens with big black eyes who like to perform anal probes upon unsuspecting victims for unknown reasons, The Collective had a more altruistic purpose. Sure, kidnapping 100 humans from Earth, ripping them away from their lives and families, and erasing their memories doesn’t sound great – but the way they saw it, the benefits would far outweigh these side-effects. Seriously, who wouldn’t want their consciousness trapped in a Station Core, subjected to the whims of a collection of alien races, and then ordered to defend against other hostile aliens for all eternity? They’d be immortal – so…bonus!

Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it), the Station Core now known as Milton never arrived at his destination. Severely damaged and confused about what happened to him, he woke up to find himself trapped inside a massive chicken egg on a strange, primitive world filled with curious – and deadly – creatures.

Now, in order to survive the harsh environment, Milton has to rely on a snarky, foul-mouthed AI guide to show him what it means to be a Station Core. With her help, he might just live long enough to figure out a way to get off the planet – if only he wasn’t so afraid of squirrels…

The Station Core contains elements of LitRPG including level progression and experience, optional tables, and a heavy Dungeon Core emphasis.

Contains foul language that might not be suitable for young readers.

My Opinion: 345 pages, $3.99, Available on Kindle Unlimited

\*\*Warning: There is a lot of cursing in the story. Mostly from the fairy guide AI.\*\*

This is a slice of life LitRPG story that tries to do a few new things with the dungeon core genre. Some work. Some don’t. At least for me. 

The game mechanics in the story have good details. There are detailed character sheets, tables listing upgrades, lists of creatable creatures, and more. However, the author has chosen to hide a good portion of those detail. There are still some quest notifications but the stat pages with loads of detailed numbers and tables are all hidden away in the back the novel as an appendix. So to see them, you tap an appendix note, which takes you to the back of the novel and then press another note to go back to the story. It’s awkward. But I understand the author's desire to balance showing these details. It just didn't work for me. I would have preferred to see those details in the story.

\----Spoilers ahead----

Storywise, the 1st 10% of the novel has a good setup even if part of it ultimately doesn't matter to the story. By the 6% mark you have your sentient dungeon core and explanations about the possible progression for the story. 

Then, there’s a huge swath of the story where the main character (MC) builds a primitive dungeon and fends off animals. It’s honestly kind of boring. Mostly because the dungeon never felt like it was in any danger and the opponents and progress felt limited. I really thought about putting the novel down at this point. 

At the 50% mark, the story gets so much better. It introduces a sentient race of people with their own culture based on fighting monsters. I don't want to spoil it but it’s a much more interesting story once people come into the picture. The story gets emotional, has interesting characters, and it still connects to the dungeon. It finally feels like there is some purpose for the dungeon existing in the story.

I’d easily give the last half of the story a 7 out of 10. But the 1st half really dragged for me. Outside that first intro section, it would get a 5 out of 10. So, I’ll split the difference and give the story:

Score: 6 out of 10

Warrior Academy: A Tournament of Hiroes Part 2 - Episode 4

https://i.redd.it/hzd7mxtpp5b11.jpg

The MOB Hunt is on. The other schools are here and the battles ensue. 

After the world is destroyed humanities survivors start anew. Now in a world forever changed, a place where magic is real, and monsters have come to life. A place where magic and science blend with pop culture… Welcome to Warrior Academy. 

Welcome back to Warrior Academy. Rejoin Hiro and friends as they continue their journey. Meet new friends and enemies. More food, fighting, and music.

If you like video games, music, anime, and just pop culture in general… you will love Warrior Academy. Its Harry Potter meets Naruto with a little Dragon Ball Z and Dungeons and Dragons thrown in for fun, oh and don’t forget a smattering of High School Musical… 

This is the fourth episode in a 13 episode series. 

My Opinion: 383 pages, $2.99, Available on Kindle Unlimited

The story begins with the epic level boss fight that was started in part 1, it then continues the MOB hunt and tournament. There are also two flashback storylines, which make for good breaks in the almost non stop action of the MOB hunt and tournament.

I’ll admit, my absolute favorite part of the story this time is the the Shokugeki fight and I got really hungry after reading it. I always appreciate that the author is never afraid to pull from recent anime and pop culture as influences in his stories. 

Of course there’s also a playlist that provides a theme music for each chapter. This time my favorite new songs are At Your Funeral by Saves the Day, and Banana Pancakes by Jack Johnson.

Good stuff all around if you like the series.

Regicide (The Completionist Chronicles Book 2) 

https://i.redd.it/fqo3errrp5b11.jpg

The second installment of Dakota Krout's best-selling Completionist Chronicles series!

After the encounter at the Mage's College, Joe's name has become well-known in Eternia. While the majority of his guild is ecstatic over the bonuses that he brings them, not everyone is pleased with his rising influence. In fact, someone has been spreading rumors that Joe is unbalanced, sacrificing comrades for personal power.

As a result, Joe is forced to recruit a team of misfits and discovers that their unique abilities complement his own. With their assistance, Joe moves forward with his plans to specialize into a more powerful version of his Ritualist class. But when the dust settles, he will be forced to ask himself a simple question: was it his actions that lit the fires of war?

My Opinion: 331 pages, $4.99, Available on Kindle Unlimited

Full disclosure: I received an advanced copy for review. I purchased the novel when it became available. 

This is a great novel. It starts out kinda slice of life, but gets more purposeful in the 2nd act. Joe, the main character (MC), puts together a new team of quirky players, his guild gets handed a complicated task that doesn’t go as planned, and of course the MC still has to make time to study and experiment with magic and rituals.

In addition to the good action and adventure in the story, I really liked the crafting and magical research elements. These elements are detailed without being monotonous.  Even something as simple as scroll making is broke into pieces that allowed for logical progress. No magic button pressing here! I really like that feel that hard work pays off. 

The game mechanics in the story are really detailed but also interesting. I really liked how the MC’s character progresses in the story and don’t want spoil things for other readers but I want to be a ritualist so much now!

There are a few small rough spots with the social dynamics of the new group, but that’s about the only thing in the story that I could find to even remotely complain about. Which tells you just how good the story is.

Overall, a great read. Especially if you like punny humor. I do and I found myself liking book 2 in this series even more than I did book 1. I can’t wait for book 3.

War Aeternus 3: The Culling

https://i.redd.it/agy6ww8up5b11.jpg

Struggling to recover from his losses in Kirshtein, Lee is swept back into the fray when a dangerous new Herald sets her sights on him. Hell-bent on reshaping the world in her own image and with her own ideals, she is willing to commit even the most immoral acts in her pursuit of righteousness. At risk of losing everything he has worked so hard to create, Lee has to find a way to defend the weak against a madwoman whose deranged sense of justice has twisted the limits of the game.

To make matters even more difficult, Lee is forced to face these problems while dealing with an increasingly erratic system he doesn't understand and the Goddess of Blood's own strong-willed Herald.

My Opinion: 428 pages, $3.99, Available on Kindle Unlimited

Full disclosure: I received an advanced copy for review and did light beta reading on the novel. I purchased it when it became available. 

This is a good series that only gets better with each new book. The action is always visceral. The plots are interesting and never simple. It’s one of the few series where the IRL story is interesting and I enjoy reading about it.

Each book in the series, has done a really good job with a character development arc and this one is no different. The main character (MC) gets pushed harder by this villain than any he’s met in the past and it’s an interesting read to see just how far the MC is willing to go to win. The character is definitely shifting a little  toward the dark side and I’m curious if he’ll go full Sith at some point in the series. 

Even though the story lost some characters last time, there are new interesting characters introduced in the story that I think may become fan favorites. Especially the Goddess of Blood's Herald that’s introduced. I can’t tell you how much I like that character. Some of the dark moments are nicely but balanced out with some very funny moments from this character.

The only thing that I think could have been developed a little better, is the villain. While she is a doer of bad things and some people may hate her for the philosophies she espouses, I personally neither hated her nor empathized with her sad backstory. Still, she does push the MC towards the dark side which is something that’s interesting for his character development.

Overall, I liked the story and had a good time reading it. Some of the twists were very unexpected and I liked the addition of town building mechanics in the story.

Life Reset: EvP (Environment vs. Player) (New Era Online Book 2)

https://i.redd.it/qpgop21wp5b11.jpg

After defeating the hobgoblin threat, Oren is now faced with an even more tenacious enemy: the players themselves.

His old guild have discovered his village's location and a deadly strike force is closing in. With time running out, Oren must build up his clan and recruit an army of monsters if he's to have any hope of withstanding the coming attack.

My Opinion: 794 pages, $4.99, Not Available on Kindle Unlimited

Most of the story is still slice of life, with the main character (MC) switching between town building, level grinding, and crafting. I personally, love to read about town building, crafting, and action adventure. This has all that in spades. 

In addition, the novel introduces a couple new elements. One, new beta players join the goblin village and they get their own adventures. Two, there’s a mystery who-done-it subplot where the MC tries to track down a saboteur. Both are good added elements that help break up the longer chunks of crafting and town building. 

The last 25% though could easily be its own stand alone novel, there’s a full plot arc and lots of purposeful action with a great story climax.

Overall, the story maintains all the elements I enjoyed from book 1, refines them, and even adds in some new interesting ones. It took a while to finish this massive novel, but I  had a great time doing so.

,Kanye,"When i was growing up my father was ultra christian and as a result would never allow me to listen to any type of music unless it was gospel basically.

The first time i ever heard kanyes voice i was cleaning the garage when gold digger came on my mothers playlist of songs. Immediately it was the best song i had ever heard and unfortunately it would be the only time i ever heard it but it stuck in my head for months. 

 Next would be stronger which i heard in the gym allot and it helped push me to lose a ton of weight but still i was not allowed to choose my own music or own any type of music playing device.

 Heartless would be the next song i heard which would come at a perfect time since i was going through allot of heartbreak back then and it helped me cope with it.

 I missed out on the entirety of MBDTF due to my father completely losing it.My father (who birthday coincidently is one day after kanyes) went on a manic episode in which he decided the entire family needed to move across country or out of country immediately (coincidently around the same time Kanye decided to exile himself to Hawaii/ europe) during this time my father would try to kill my family/ kidnap my brother and succeeded in burning his own car and getting arrested by the police and charged with a felony assault when he refused to have his fingerprints taken and made a fist with his hand.

After this time is when i really became obsessed with Kanye. My mom divorced my father and moved us across country anyways to remarry and around that time i finally got a music device and heard cruel summer and yeezus which would be the first Kanye album i listened to. 

 Yeezus would become my most listened to album and gave me a new kind of confidence i had never had before. Before i had never had any real friends but suddenly i was outgoing and made scores of friends in days. As someone who loves fashion when the red Octobers came out thats what really pushed my fandom into obsession. Thats when i started to listen to every album and collaboration he had. 

Since then kanye has shown his true manic side and for about 2 years it made me question whether i should have been idolizing him because the way he spoke reminded me too much of my father and i didn't want to start talking the same way and possibly discover that i am bipolar.

The life of pablo was kanyes messiest album and was also the messiest part of my life filled with betrayal paranoia and constant self medicating (coincidentally similar to what Kanye was going through: real friends/benzos etc.)

Finally we get to kanyes most recent rollout confirming his bipolar disorder. this was a huge breath of fresh air for me because my suspicions were finally confirmed. i now understood why kanye is the way he is and i was able to accept it allot better since ive delt with people similar before.

The thing im most worried about now is that kanye gets proper help so that something similar doesn't happen to him that happened to my family because i hate my father with a passion and i don't want that for kanyes children or anyone in his family. its also made me be more careful about how much i listen to kanye because it could trigger an episode in me and i'm really scared about being bipolar. you typically tend to act like the people you listen to and so now i'm scared to even be a kanye fan despite how much i love him and his music and think he's a creative genius.

Thank you for reading if you did i just felt like i needed to vent because i'm really conflicted and i'm worried i might be bipolar too and i'm not kanye so i don't get second chances for making rash statements without context first. i dont want to end up never being employed again and living off disability like my father. What do u guys think?

,barstoolsports,"Hey everyone, back with another music talk thread. Got a nice little genre mix for new releases this week. In case you've missed the last couple weeks, I finally started a spotify playlist where I'll update every week with the music listed here, you can [follow the playlist here.](https://open.spotify.com/user/122646323/playlist/7fn0CRECXcKZl68lu9uuSP?si=y-irl8vNTYuvcQTtUrUcRQ) I've also been trying to stay consistent with blogging updates during the week [which you can find here as well.](https://ghostfacekylemusic.wordpress.com/)

**NEW RELEASES:**

[Greta Van Fleet - ""When The Curtain Falls""](https://open.spotify.com/album/6sZZUbFqCVf3NLXYBLzFNj?si=i32m_VaiQsecjuhS6fXxyw)

\-Presumably the first single off their debut full-length album, which is yet to receive a release date. This one’s sound is consistent with the songs off *From The Fires*, which I don’t have a problem with, but I can picture a scenario where critics somehow blame them for not “pushing their creative boundaries” or something else pretentious like that. i also think now that the “OMG this is Zeppelin reincarnated” hype has died down, the general public can listen and judge these guys a little more objectively. Yes, they sound a hell of a lot like Zeppelin and should probably differentiate themselves a little bit, but they’ve also only officially released one EP. These kids are remarkably talented musicians, and I’m excited both for their debut full-length album, and to see how they grow over their career.

[Buddy album - *Harlan &amp; Alondra*](https://open.spotify.com/album/5djciKtjqkY9ZQ1OhKICXN?si=4YtF4pM0RJ-0PO-EddQxiA)

\-Been talking about this kid for a while and his debut album is finally here. If I could buy stock in one artist right now, it would be him. Best comparison I can make to a rapper out right now would be Vince Staples, but with a little bit of a jazz/soul influence. He's versatile and can straight up rap as shown on tracks like ""Black"" and ""Real Life S\*\*t"", but can switch to a more soulful/R&amp;B sound on tracks like ""Trouble On Central"" and ""Hey Up There"". Highly recommend just listening to this whole thing start to finish, it's littered a few great features too.

[Chance The Rapper - 4 singles](https://open.spotify.com/album/5pQOfgCqpu4RrJAfQToFa8?si=IG6hGFROSf-NtfLbV7I0UA)

\-Chance is back in a big way. After shutting down rumors of a new album this week, Chance decided to pull a little double reverse on everyone and drop 4 brand new singles. On all of these tracks he ditches the gospel style of Coloring Book in favor of more just straight up rapping. “Work Out”, probably my favorite out of the 4 tracks, has an uplifting vibe with Chance reflecting on how his life has changed over the past few years. On “I Might Need Security”, Chance takes a few digs at his enemies in the media with lines like “I bought the Chicagoist just to run you racist bitches out of business”. No official word on whether or not these are going to be a part of his next album or not, but it’s just nice to have some new Chance in our lives.

[Brockhampton - ""1998 TRUMAN""](https://open.spotify.com/album/6tTJbJAS6kJpKRz0gZIWMU?si=R6glhF7mQ6SlFuW2bODFVw)

\- his one brings that Brockhampton signature high energy, but was a little too all over the place for me. Still a solid track overall, I loved Merlyn’s grime/Tyler the Creator and Dom’s verse at 2:23. *Puppy* has been indefinitely delayed amidst all of Ameer Vann’s sexual abuse accusations, so we’ll likely be getting one or two more singles before it drops.

[Death Cab For Cutie - ""I Dreamt We Spoke Again""](https://open.spotify.com/album/3NggszD6AO6baGJUz131Nr?si=zGSIbesAQyu23YKcFy1FEw)

\-Second single off the upcoming album due out August 17th. Feels like they nailed that hazy/dreamy sound on this one, with Ben Gibbard bringing a smooth croon over everything.

[The 1975 - ""Love It If We Made It""](https://open.spotify.com/album/1jtXvj2pZXWRgBsx1RBa8u?si=5cp4jAIhRhO623dA0OC5OA)

\-Loving this track so far. Has a cool, synth-pop vibe to it and Matt Healy's vocals fit perfectly. I know I should stick to music, but I thought it was kind of cool they made a trump/kanye reference with ""I moved on her like a bitch"" and ""Thank you Kanye very cool"".

[The Internet album - *Hive Mind*](https://open.spotify.com/album/27ThgFMUAx3MXLQ297DzWF?si=WiZyvgrvRnOyGsS-qmnHSw)

\-I feel like the internet is one of those bands that you can play for your parents to show them that good musicianship is very much alive and well. The whole album sounds like parliament funkadelic reincarnated in 2018. Just a great blend of jazz/funk/psychedlic/R&amp;B all the way through. Favorite tracks so far are ""Come Over"", La Di Da"", ""It Gets Better"", and ""Look What U Started"".

[Alkaline Trio - ""Blackbird""](https://open.spotify.com/album/4xve0DPfVlsGqtL0OAv7Pu?si=c4_28yYESvKKBvtZGfslwg)

\-Was never the biggest Alkaline Trio fan but I'm digging this single. Guitar-heavy all the way through with a super catchy hook. This is their first new release in 5 years, and they just announced a full album will be out later this year.

[Mason Ramsey - *The Famous EP*](https://open.spotify.com/album/0uwi88sUbCRCvlwYEi6khZ?si=MLkSSJKYTpetQ68vG4jO0A)

\-First off, it's a downright miracle nothing problematic has been dug up about this kid's family. I feel like every internet star rises and crashes with some type of racist tweet from 2009. Despite it all, the internet's son Mason Ramsey, has stayed pure and put out his debut EP. I originally wanted to hate this kid because I thought he was just a gimmick, but he truly just loves country music. He's obviously getting some songwriting help, but the kid's got talent. Let's just hope he doesn't crash and burn.

**OLDER STUFF I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THIS WEEK:**

Saw Beck at MSG last night so the last week or two I was brushing up on his discography, and wow can this dude put together a song. He also bought out Britt Daniel from Spoon to play ""I Turn My Camera On"" which was amazing. The dude has been putting out bangers for 20+ years but I feel like some younger stoolies might not be too familiar with him. Put together a few songs from his set list last night below for anyone who wants to take a listen.

**OTHER RANDOM STUFF**

\-Any Chicago stoolies hitting up pitchfork festival this weekend? Wish I could be out there for it. Outside of the headliners, I definitely recommend catching Open Mike Eagle, Syd, Saba, and Japandroids.

\-For some reason I was thinking about album cover art the other day, [so I decided to write a blog about it.](https://ghostfacekylemusic.wordpress.com/2018/07/19/lets-talk-album-covers-shall-we/) I've always been interested in how artists use album covers. What're some of your guys' favorite album covers? Just off the top of my head, I love Kendrick's cover for TPAB, Nirvana's cover for *Nevermind* is pretty iconic, and Bloodhound Gang's cover for *Hefty Fine* is just straight up absurd.

,radiohead,"I realize that I might not be Radiohead'ing correctly with this one but... in my anticipation for the Radiohead show this upcoming Monday in Columbus, I put together a little playlist of 60 Radiohead videos. Some might call it a ""Power Hour""... which if one were so inclined, they might take a shot (or casual sip) of beer (or beverage of choice) each time the video changes. Each video clip is approximately 1 minute long, although some push up to 2 minutes and the 1st, 31st, and 60th videos are full-length. Cheers!

,IBO,"Subjects I got a 7

SL: Biology and Math


HL: History and Economics



Biology: Look up the subject guide online and read about external and internal assessments.

**The syllabus is your best friend.** Know everything no matter how small. If it says be able to calculate chi squared you should know how to do it. Memorize the IB definition. There are so many ways to define cellular respiration but you are guaranteed full marks if you say it is the controlled release of energy to produce ATP. The guidance is especially important. Get a free pdf of Allot's Oxford revision guide(it might be on the ibresources website i don't remember). Download it so that if the site is taken down you still have it. Read the revision guide and the syllabus making sure you have every syllabus point covered. I supplemented this with watching Alex Lee and Cheryl Haus on youtube(the information is the same  but they provide useful acronyms/analogies which make learning biology easier.) If you are short on time like less than 6 weeks before IB exam do every past paper you can : TZ1,TZ2 and November papers. Next step is to review your answer with the markschemes and also read subject report about the things IB has to say about the question(this helps). I would like to thank /u/templarknight98 because this was only possible  I had access to them because of this sub(my school never gave this info). If you have like 6 months till exams do question banks before you do past papers so you don't run out of past papers.  If you have trouble thinking about an IA ,look up AP Bio labs(that might help you). Also Biology for life website has hundreds of IA ideas so that might help. To get a 7 on the IA I read every subject report since 2016,the subject guide and I scrutinized every word of the rubric. I also read a sample one on /u/ardonp  's the science codex website and I googled IB bio tsm and read multiple IA's. Lastly for all IA's do what your teacher says. Chances are IB won't see yours so ignoring your teacher regardless of the rubric might screw up your grade(ask your teacher what would constitute as personal engagement because this is really subjective).


Math: The IAs were tricky.Mine was on an economic concept(used calculus I learned from sl) since I took Econ I could use this to gain marks on reflection. I got a 6 but I have no idea how. There are some sites that explain how to get a level 7 IA better. Same as Bio memorize everything on the syllabus. My teacher skipped sections and never taught navigation problems or integrating the (ax+b) expression. Knowing what you have to know alleviates this problem. By the same token my teacher said we had to know how to calculate standard deviation by hand. I made no effort to learn how to do it because the syllabus explicitly says a calculator will always be required. Next thing ,be strategic. If IB says you have to know how to do something with calculator only review that concept before you do paper 2. Reviewing those things before Paper 1 is a complete was of time. **KNOW HOW TO USE YOUR GRAPHING CALCULATOR**. This will destroy your Paper 2 grade and overall grade if you don't. Make sure it has new batteries and you know how to use every function necessary for IB(There is a 40 minute youtube video by a Canadian teacher who explains what things we need to know how to do  with a TI calculator and how to do them for sl  math and IBHKexcel youtube has 40 minute video for another calculato)r. IMO All of sl math can be learned in Year 1. The[ resource I used was] (https://www.examsolutions.net/international-exams/international-baccalaureate). It has an IB playlist that matches the syllabus exactly. His practice problems are IB style and I was so far ahead of my class. I had learned the first 2 topics of SL math in 1 month. If you are ambitious  you can the whole subject in 2-4 months(The concepts are not super difficult to grasp).  As soon as you are finished only do past papers and question banks. If you don't initially know how to do a problem ,spend  1 hour trying to solve it. If you simply cannot look up the answer and try and understand the explanation at a conceptual level(This is how your master SL math). Before IB exams review the syllabus one more time. My study guide was the syllabus. I promise you if you do this you will get a 7. November 2018 it is not too late. You have time to watch every single exam solutions video and most importantly practice.




History: Honestly just self study the subject. Look at the syllabus,be strategic(study 2  instead of 3 topics for paper 3,find the topics you would enjoy the most and use everything(wikipedia,google books,r/askhistory,youtube) to get as much relevant knowledge as possible. Knowledge is half the battle. Create essay plans . Have arguments for every topic,includes some perspectives to evaluate, specific details etc.  Spend all of year 1 and first half of year 2 doing this. 2nd half of year 2 use question banks and past papers. IB history tsm has sample ib exam essays from paper 1,2,3 from 2017. Read them and read what the grade was and why the examiner felt that way. Truly analyze every word; that is how you know what a level 7 HL History essay is. Write essays,get your history teacher to grade them,email local university professors,ask people on r/ibo whether students with predicted 7s or those who did get a 7 or even history teachers that are on this sub. **DO YOUR HISTORY IA IN YEAR 1!**. You can write on anything you find interesting just make sure it is not too old like from the 1200s(Using primary sources makes your paper interesting and shows you carried an extensive investigation).  **NEVER PAY FOR BOOKS FOR THE IA.** Google books/google scholar are your friend. I am sure most of you know this but use citation machine or easy bib for citations(this will literally save you hours and is almost error proof). Read the subject report for the IAs. Subject reports,rubrics and teacher recommendations are always the keys to a 7 in any Internal assessment. Keep in mind history is a very subjective subject so don't beat yourself up if you don't get a 7. A 6 is a respectable score. REMEMBER to get top marks you can't just show awareness of perspective(example historian x says blah blah) at best you can get in the 10-12 mark band(basically the highest you can get is a low 7 on Paper 2 or 3 if everything else is perfect).  You must evaluate perspective(historian y says blah blah but he fails to consider blah blah). 

This will get you into 13-15 mark band if done correctly.This ensures a high level 7 if everything else is done perfectly or can push you into a 7 boundary. This should go without saying but practice with pen and paper under timed conditions.


Economics: This is the easiest HL possible. The IB exam is the syllabus. Any question that ever shows up on Paper 1 is shown on the syllabus.Every one basically has access to the questions on any IB econ exam for Paper 1. Some suggest don't study theory of the firm because there has never been 2 TOF questions. I suggest you do study TOF if your predicted offer needs a 6 or 7 in Econ HL or you need college credit. IB can be unpredictable at times. For example for May 2018 move to global war on Paper 1 history everyone was sure that there was 1 topic it wouldn't be about. Guess what ,it was about that topic. Paper 1 only study the Micro and Macro portions. I would first recommend [this guys channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/elashirym/playlists) .   He covers every single syllabus point and offers potential arguments/points of evaluation. Watch his videos and use the ib syllabus and a checklist and create essay plans with specific examples(look them up). Watch Econ plus dal's youtube videos for  international and development(He has a whole playlist for development, for international watch the foreign exchange playlist and the protectionism playlist. )Then I would go back and watch every Single IB econ Plus dal video to reinforce the concepts.**START YOUR COMMENTARIES IN YEAR 1**. Preferably immediately after you learn a topic. For example start your micro commentary when you finish the unit. But first tell your teacher to prove that you got the article within a year of writing the commentary. You know the IA drill: Teacher,tsm,subject guide,rubric and subject report. I would also recommend Tim Woods IA articles and Ryan Reagan's (HKexcel) video how to get a 7 on the 3 commnetaries. Then Past papers/question banks and ask r/ibo,teachers,students,econ professors basically anyone to grade your practice past paper. Use Tim Woods  DEED for first questions in paper 1 and CLASPP for 2nd questions in paper 1. If you want to really master econ I would recommend you watch marginal revolution university Econ videos regularly. For Paper 3 read the Oxford Revision guide section on Paper 3 formulas. The weekend before your econ examinations read the entire revision guide and all your essay plans. Obviously know how to use your calculator for paper 3. I suggest following Econplus dals tips for paper 1,2,and 3(They are on youtube). 


If you do these things you **Will** get a 7 regardless of whether you attend class or not.

# DDoS attacks and compensation

In case you missed the news, Ubisoft has been experiencing DDoS attacks on their services for the past few days, which has effected For Honor as well as their other titles. These attacks are **still ongoing**, however they're actively working to return stability. In the meantime, they've pushed out compensation to all active players within the past month. Details on that can be found [\[here\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/90672l/compensation_following_recent_ddos_attacks/).

# Weekly content: New Falling Feathers effect

This weeks content is a new effect, Falling Feathers, availible for all heroes (5k steel).

# Realistic dominion playlist + event community order

Realistic dominion has gone live as of this morning and goes until July 26th. No gear stats, no guard stance widget, and no revives. Dominant Warrior community order has gone live with this as well, which will reward 2000 steel upon completion.

# Defend the North LAN tournament

For Honor will be at the Defend the North tournament up in New York! Tune in to watch some intense matches, or attend it yourself if you're in the area and have nothing better to do. Find details on that [\[here\]](http://www.defendthenorth.com/)

# Q&amp;A

We got to ask some question towards the end of the dev stream, here's my (very) rough notes on how they were answered. Let me know if I missed anything!

Q: Will there be reworks for heroes frustrating to play against ie. Centurion?

A: Roman acknowledges that some of Cent's disabling moves may ""take control"" of enemies for too long. He says theres no specific plan to rework Centurion at this time

Q: Will you guys be doing new special events?

A: Damien says maybe (wink wink)

Q: Will old cosmetic/special event gear/tournament rewards become availible again?

A: Event gear will be availible during the event, they like the exclusivity. They are looking at ways of bringing back old tournament rewards

Q: Matchmaking improvements?

A: Always looking at ways to improve mm. Right now theyre looking at the changes they made very recently, and then they willl be going from there

Q: More frequent order distribution?

A: Damien says no plan right now for more orders. He says that theres some ideas that they have for improving the order system, but thats more long term and not their focus right now

Q: Any plans for improve social window/clans?

A: Damien says they know the social window is pretty simple, but not something they will be improving in the near future

Q: Increase bot levels for players that leave?

A: Damien says the bot that replaces the player is based off the player it replaced mmr level. They are looking at bringing back the leaver penalty however, no hard date but Damien said it will definently be back for the Marching Fire update

Q: Why not more combat emotes?

A: Damien says they noticed the same thing, and they will start doing more combat emotes in the near future. They said it was a lot easier and they had a lot of ideas for free-roam emotes so they put out a lot of those

Q: Devs aware of the static guard switch bug?

A: Damien says yes, and they're working on it. Roman says they have a fix, should come during the next season

Q: Will Wu-Lin faction have Chinese voicelines?

A: Roman says they will be the same as the current characters. All lines that are triggered on fight moves will be in their native language, things like feat activation will mostly be english. Was personally a little confused with this answer as Shoalin has english voicelines for his attack queues

Q: Breach test on console?

A: Damien says that would be amazing, but they don't know

Q: Cross-platform account data carrying over?

A: Damien says they would like to do it, but its very difficult. Will not be coming anytime soon, but its definently on the table

Q: What is the Wu-Lin emblem shape?

A: Roman says the Wu-Lin (at release) wont be a part of the faction war so there will be no emblem shape because they are not a playabale faction. When Wu-Lin becomes apart of the faction war they will release the emblem shape (Damien says you can probably guess the shape)

Q: How will the Wu-Lin chars be unlocked?

A: Same rules as post launch heroes. Can get all of them by buying the marching fire expansion which gives you TWO weeks exclusive access, otherwise they cost 15k steel to unlock

Q: Can we get more respectful executions?

A: Damien says he loves the idea and they have some ideas for certain characters

,RocketLeagueFriends,"Hello everyone, myself and a friend are looking to play standard far more seriously and push to GC, so we are looking for a new teammate! 

Some things we are looking for in a new teammate:

Age: 17+

Mic is needed

Champ 2+ in any playlist

Tournament experience is a plus

Must be willing to give and take criticism to/from other players. We're looking to grow as a team and trying to discover each other's weaknesses and improve upon them is part of that process.

Must be available to practice or cover replay analysis several times a week, usually afternoons/evenings, we understand that people have jobs/school so we can be a little flexible

This last piece is probably the most important one, ""undeserved"" toxicity towards other players simply won't be tolerated, we're here to have fun and grow together, that needs to be the focus of our play.

,sexstories,"Me and my cousin Ashley always got on well together. I was an only child and spent a lot of time with her on play dates when my parents were splitting up. After particularly vicious arguments between mom and dad, mom would bring me to her sister’s to stay the night. This started happening more and more frequently until mom and dad finally got the hint. By that point, Ashley and me were inseparable. She was two years younger than me so I became like a big sister to her. We would share beds and spend hours playing hairdresser with each other. I taught her how to plait her hair. In return, she accidentally cut a chunk of mine off (I had to wear a hat in school for 3 months until it grew back). She became my escape, my confidant, my partner in crime. That was until my parents actually got divorced and I moved away with mom.  


Over the next 10 years, we barely saw each other. Every now and then we’d get together at Thanksgiving or Christmas. But our relationship changed. After not seeing each other for months or years at a time, it wasn’t so easy to just pick up where we left off. As if nothing happened. We would still laugh and reminisce and plait each other’s hair like we were young, but something was different and I couldn’t put my finger on what. Until her 18th birthday.

I got a text from her about 2 weeks before her 18th saying that she was going to have a small party, close family and friends, and wanted me to be there. I could feel my heart smile as I read that text, like that nostalgic, bittersweet feeling you get when you’re cleaning your room and find a dusty box of your old favorite toys.

I spent the next 2 weeks trying to plan my outfit. Seeing family after a long time apart always felt like making a first impression all over again. You have to dress grown up, but not too grown up. You have to find that perfect balance between cute and sophisticated. If you hear ‘my God, you’ve grown!’, or ‘you were just this big when I last saw you!’, then you know you’ve nailed it.

Mom drove me to Ashley’s house. I felt nervous for the first time. I was 16 when we last saw each other. A lot happens in 4 years, especially at that age. I sat in the passenger seat fiddling with the hem of my dress.

‘Leave it alone, you’ll pull a thread and then it’ll be ruined’. Mom swatted a hand at me. I was actually pretty happy with my outfit. I was wearing a black dress that stopped about halfway up my thighs, with sleeves just past my elbows, and a thin brown leather belt. The material was light and soft so, despite it being summer, it didn’t get hot. I could feel the breeze blowing through, brushing my skin. I was pretty damn small then: no curves worth mentioning, and my boobs stopped growing at like 14. But this dress hugged me just right. I won’t lie, I looked pretty good.

Mom took a couple glances at me.

‘Are you OK?’

‘Yeah, I’m fine’

‘You sure? Not nervous are you?’

‘Nervous? No, why?’ I furrowed my brow.

‘Oh, no. No reason.’ We pulled up to a red light. She looked in the mirror, smacked her lips and pulled at her crows feet with a finger.

‘Now, are you sure you got everything?’ She sighed noticing lines around her eyes.

‘Yes, mom. I double checked before we left.’

‘Alright… Do you have your toothbrush?’

‘Yes’

‘Clean underwear for the morning?’

‘Yes, mom. I told you.’

‘OK, I’m just checking.’ I connected my phone to the car and put on a random playlist. We didn’t talk much for the rest of the journey.

When we got there, the house was flooded with people: family I hadn’t seen in years, and friends of Ashley’s I had never met before. I followed mom into the living room and said hi to my aunt.

‘Oh! You look so cute! Aren’t you just a doll!’ My aunt rested her chin on her palm and eyed me up and down.

‘I think Ashley’s in the kitchen, honey. Go in, say hi!’ I walked through the double doors to the kitchen. Ashley was perched on the kitchen table, circled by her giggling friends. She saw me. Her eyes widened. The whites of her eyes lit up her face. She threw her arms in the air, jumped off the table and screamed with the force of an entire bachelorette party. She skipped over and threw her arms around me in a tight bear hug. I wriggled my arms free and wrapped them around her.

‘Oh my god, Nicole! it’s so good to see you. Thanks so much for coming’. She wore a huge ‘18 Today!’ pin on her chest that poked her boob when she squeezed me.

‘Agh… shit. I gotta stop doing that’, she laughed. Her dress was gorgeous. A tight-fitting plum halter neck with a diamond window of cleavage in the center. She looked fabulous. She introduced me to her confused circle of friends and got me a soda. We were just kids when we last hung out. I could hardly recognize the woman that stood beside me. People say you don’t know what you’ve got until you lose it, but I think they’ve got it twisted: you don’t know what you’ve lost until you get it back. I didn’t realise just how much I missed her.

The night went on, and people slowly started going home. My mom said her goodbyes and told me she’d pick me up around 12 the next day, so I’d better not keep her waiting. Soon it was just me and Ashley’s family left recounting stories from her childhood curled up in the sitting room.

‘OK, I’m heading to bed. Nicole, you know where you’re sleeping?’ My aunt rocked herself forward and got to her feet.

‘In with Ashley, right?’

‘Is that alright?’

‘Yeah, of course’. She smiled and nodded her head.

‘Happy birthday, my angel’. She planted a kiss on Ashley’s forehead and went to bed. Ashley turned to me.

‘Wanna chill in my room and watch a film or something?’

‘Yeah, sure’. I collected my overnight bag and followed her up to her room. It had barely changed from her childhood. The same soft pink on the walls. The High School Musical stickers we stuck on her wardrobe were faded and peeling, but still there. If it wasn’t for the clothes and textbooks strewn on the floor, it would be a perfect time capsule from our childhood.

We got changed into our PJs — mine blue plaid boxers and a tank top, hers an old Harry Potter t-shirt and shorts — and we climbed on top of the bed. Ashley put the TV on and scrolled through Netflix on her phone.

‘Have you seen Arrested Development?’ she said, paused on the info page.

‘No, but I keep meaning to. Friends in college keep quoting it and I just haven’t a clue what’s going on. Go on, put it on’. She pressed play on the pilot episode, and a ukulele started playing. We sat there watching and giggling, feeling like little girls again. I pressed a hand to her back.

‘Move up, I’ll do your hair’. Her face lit up with a goofy smile. She scooted forward. I reached over to her end table and grabbed a handful of hair ties and bobby pins, sat behind her on my knees, and took her hair in my hands. For the first time in years, it felt like we were sisters again. I ran her hair through my hands, twisting and weaving her golden brown locks into a French braid. When it was done, I patted her on both shoulders proudly, ‘now do me’. We swapped positions, and Ashley went to work on my hair. She ran the back of her hand down my hair a number of times, flattening it against my back. I felt a soft kiss on the back of my neck as she placed her palm on my shoulder. I reached up and put my hand on hers before she slipped it away, dragging it down my back, and took my hair in her hands again. She continued to let it run loosely through her hands. Then she lifted my hair up and placed another delicate kiss on the back of my neck. And then another. And another. Each kiss moving further down my back.

‘What are you doing?’ I turned my head to face her.

‘Nothing’. She smiled innocently. ‘Turn back around’. I turned back to the TV. Ashley took my hair again. I didn’t know what she was doing. It felt strange but I could feel my heart thumping against my ribcage. I focused on the TV. She finally started weaving my hair, turning it over and under itself, inside and out. I could feel myself breathe out deeply in relief. But I couldn’t shake this feeling. A part of me was feeling curious. I shook my head to try and straighten out my thoughts.

‘Hey! I’m not finished yet’. She slid a couple pins into the braid to hold it in place.

‘Sorry, I shivered’. She stroked the braid, pressing the loose ends against my back. It tickled. My shoulder blades quivered.

‘There. Done.’ She ran her hands quickly down and back up my arms, and laid her palms on my shoulders. I felt another soft kiss on my shoulder. Then one on my neck.

‘OK, seriously. What are you doing?’ I turned my whole body to face her.

‘What?’ She looked taken aback.

‘Why do you keep kissing me?’

‘I’m not’.

‘You’re not kissing me? What do I keep feeling then?’

‘They’re not kisses’.

‘Well, then what are they?’

‘Just little pecks. I just haven’t seen you in so long’.

‘If they’re not kisses, then what are?’

‘What? Are you asking me to kiss you or something?’

‘Yes’. Her head went back in surprise. I didn’t know what I just said. Or why. I tried not to make eye contact but I met her stare. She looked deeply into my eyes for an eternity, then leaped forward, knocking me onto my back, her lips racing mine to see who’d come up for air first. Her tongue danced with mine. She ran her hands through my hair, cupping the back of my head. I dragged my hands up her waist, pushing the old Harry Potter shirt up. I felt goosebumps on her skin as my fingers explored her elegant arched back. I pulled my lips from hers and gasped for air. I turned my face away from hers, trying to catch my breath. She quickly started caressing my neck with her mouth, each kiss bringing us further down a road we could never come back from. She sat up, straddling my waist. I admired my cousin’s petite frame, wondering what the fuck we were doing. She ripped off her shirt. Her boobs bounced as they fell out of her top. The only other time I saw them, they were barely boobs at all. We were just excited kids, comparing our blossoming femininity. Now they were bigger than mine. She looked so beautiful. I sat up and pulled my top off. I dragged her back down on top of me, our nipples pressed against each other’s. She bit my lip and started kissing her way down my body. A thousand watts of electricity shot down my spine as she got closer to my nipples. I gasped as she traced circles around my hard nipples with her tongue. I threw my head back. She was making me weak. I could feel my boxer shorts getting wetter as she placed delicate kiss after delicate kiss on my belly down to my waist. She sat back on her knees, gripping my underwear with both hands.

‘Are you sure?’ she said breathlessly. I could only nod my head yes. She pulled my underwear off. She held them up to me, showing the wet patch and giggled.

‘I think your body’s saying yes, too.’ She scooped her arms under my knees, pushing them back.

‘I’m sorry I didn’t shave’. I thought I should be embarrassed. I was too turned on to care.

‘What, you mean you weren’t expecting this, either? She laughed and dragged her lips along my labia, taking my swollen clit in her mouth, tickling it with her tongue. I thought I was going to explode. I couldn’t see straight. I let out a breathless groan. She plunged her tongue into my pussy. My hips squirmed and shook, pushing her face deeper inside me. Her tongue swirled and teased. I thought my heart was going to burst. My pulse pounded in my neck. My clit was a bundle of nerves. With every move of her tongue, her nose just brushed off it, just enough for it to tickle like crazy, bringing me torturously close to orgasm. Oceans were building deep inside me, just begging to crash. I could feel my face turn red. My back arched and fell over and over as I struggled to control myself. I pushed her face deep into me. The waves crashed. My butt clenched. My shoulders closed in. My legs stretched, pointing my feet and curling my toes. My body writhed and shook underneath Ashley’s as I was taken over by orgasm. I screamed. Ashley quickly covered my mouth. I closed my eyes as she made her way back up my body. She placed a gentle kiss on my lips. I opened my eyes. She beamed a smile at me. Her eyes stared lovingly into mine. I felt her smile deep in my soul. It melted my heart. As she held herself up over me, I reached down and felt her soaking wet shorts. I let her taste herself off my fingers. She rolled onto her back. I straddled her smooth, creamy thighs. She gave me a tender smile and nodded her head. I pulled down her dripping shorts and traced her velvety labia with two fingers like a breaststroke. My fingers were instantly sticky. I took to her bulging clitoris and softly lapped at it. She breathed deeply, dropped her arm over her eyes, and grinned from ear to ear. I kissed her clit and dragged my tongue down to her vagina. Two fingers glided effortlessly into her slippery pussy. Her hips sank into the bed. She let out a fragile moan. My fingers curled and stretched deeper inside her innocent body. I grabbed a breast with my free hand, and began to tickle and tease her nipples with my tongue.

‘Oh, Nikki, I’m so close’. My fingers moved faster inside her. Her body wriggled below mine. She grabbed the hand on her breast and put my finger between her teeth. She looked intensely at me with big, honest eyes as her brow dropped. Her head rocked back. Her mouth agape. I felt her orgasm into my hand as I sucked on her neck. She shouted out, and I returned the favor, covering her mouth with my hand. Her body slowed. I moved my hand. She shot me a pathetic, powerless look. My lips dove onto hers.

‘I guess I’ll never get to see that show’, I giggled as I lay on top of her kissing her full, supple lips. Both of us were utterly exhausted.

We eventually got under the sheets and cuddled. I was the big spoon, my leg over hers. I fell asleep with her tucked into my body, perfectly content.

The next morning, I awoke from the most restful, peaceful sleep of my life. We went downstairs together, and walked into the kitchen. My aunt was sat at the table, drinking coffee.

‘Morning, you two. What did you get up to last night? Anything fun?’ Ashley and I looked at each other and smiled bashfully.

‘No, nothing much’.

,orangetheory,"I recently moved from Savannah (shoutout SAV!) to NYC and I have to admit, getting back into a groove has been proving difficult. 

The coaches at my new studio aren’t as encouraging or energetic. There is one coach who I’ve enjoyed his class, but unfortunately my schedule doesn’t line up with his classes. 

On the treads, the coaches are pretty much silent and constantly lose track of time, extending our run times by 10-30 seconds....To the point, where I read the workouts on here and go off of the splits on my own. 

No words of encouragement to push us harder, just the times and three second countdown and that’s it. I don’t need someone to hold my hand, but hearing my coaches yell at me to increase my speed by .1-.3 for the last 15 seconds in an all out, or even just acknowledging that we’re close and to keep pushing, really pushes a class to go above and earn the burn. 

The playlists are awful. I know that’s a personal opinion, but yesterday’s playlist was all Christian rock and I wanted to shoot myself. 

I now appreciate my old coaches so much more than I ever thought possible. If any of you happen to read this, I miss y’all! 

How do I get out of this funk (I feel like I’m being a whiney brat) and get back into OTF? I’ve been focusing on the workouts and myself, but I miss the charisma of my old coaches.

    CPU: Intel i7-6700k
    CPU Cooler: Corsair Hydro Series H110i GTX 280mm
    MoBo: Asus Maximus VIII HERO
    GPU: GIGABYTE GeForce GTX 970
    RAM: Corsair Vengeance 16 gb (2x8) DDR4 2400mhz 
    PSU: XFX 650W XXX Edition 80+ Bronze Semi-Modular
    Case: Cooler Master Stryker
    Cooling Paste: Arctic Silver 5 

**Describe your problem. List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**

2 weeks ago we had very hot weather and i noticed that my cpu cooler was constantly running on extreme, this resulted in me cleaning out my pc and get rid of all the dust in the hopes for it to cool better/easier.

The hot wheater continued an bsod started showing up, all different kinds some related to the cpu, this was worrysome and i wasn't sure where it came from. I did many tests for issues (ram, cpu, hard drives, ssds) none of the tests returned any issues, i did noticed that the bsod's where more often when running stress tests. All in all this let me to believe it might be the temps in general, it being hot (25/30 degrees) outside would effect my setup.
So i ended up completely rebuilding the pc, and changed a few fans over to actually blow more into my case then they did before (i admit i lacked a bit of airflow).

Since my rebuild 3 days ago everything has seemingly ran well, until today. 
I had 4 editors open in the background and a browser with some tabs (all basicly doing nothing and temps around 30/35 degrees with it being 25C in my room).
Fancying playing some games i started a playlist on Spotify and opened Team Fortress 2 and played for a good 10 minutes when my cpu cooler started speeding up, after a few seconds i opend ICue and saw that both pump and fan where running on max, and water temps ricing (it capped at nearly 52C).
After this i open HwMonitor and saw that my cpu temps where all around 90 and every now and then even hitting a 100C.
The moment i closed the game within half a minute temps had dropped back to 30/35C.


**List anything you've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.**

I ran tests before, rebuild the whole pc, tried pushing on my cooler block to see if it wasn't on good, Took it off and reapplied some Arctic Silver 5, improved airflow into the case.


**Post relevant photos of build/parts here.**

[Here a screencap of HwMonitor after i closed my game.](https://hostr.co/file/ZlobOiwnObBI/Temps.png)

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

After alot of searching it seems that the i7 6700k has heating issues anyways with them being quite high, but at the same time my cpu cooler should be more then capable, as far as i know i should be able to keep these temps closer to 70/75 under load.

Looking forwart to the replies,

Thanks in advance,

Lotus~

ps: if more details are needed please let me know!

Edit: might be good to know that i use default voltages, didn't overclock

Edit2: In power options changed the maximum processor state to 99%, this to prevent it from going into turbo mode, this did reduce the temps a little and maxed out on 86, altho for a non turbo boosted cpu running a game it still seems to high to me.

**--------------**

**Yuri's POV**

So far, it’s been three weeks since Sayori’s birthday party. 

Twenty-one days of absolute hell.

Ever since Sayori kissed me that fateful night, I have been an absolute trainwreck. Club meetings are extremely awkward. The small talk between the two of us is excruciatingly painful, and my heart *aches* when I see her. No, aching is an understatement. I feel like I’m experiencing heartburn every time I’m near her; my words seem to burn in my throat, and my chest hurts immensely. 

And then, there’s Natsuki…

At this point, it is becoming increasingly difficult to differentiate my emotions. I’m unsure if my crush on Natsuki is genuine or not. I’m unsure if these feelings for Sayori are true feelings or if it’s just me clinging to the idea of someone actually loving me. 

I fear that I am just in love with the idea of being in love.

Have I become so jaded and apathetic to the outside world that when faced with the idea of someone having feelings for me, I become obsessed with it?

I sighed heavily, giving up on trying to understand my thoughts and emotions right now. *I fall in love way too easily. What the hell am I going to do with this mess?* I closed my eyes for a moment, trying to alleviate my oncoming migraine. *I should probably get to bed. It’s pretty late already.* I stood up from my sitting position on my bed and blew out my candle that sat on my desk.  

*God, I haven’t slept well in days. I hope tonight will be different,* I thought as I climbed into bed.

I closed my eyes and tried focused on my breathing, and fell asleep only moments later.

**-------------------**

I never thought I’d be dreading the Literature Club.

Lately, I feel like I have to force myself to act like I normally would. It’s immensely frustrating. My words feel fake, and my smile feels rehearsed. To top it all off, my emotions are still a mess, and keeping myself in control while under this stress is difficult. 

I find myself standing at the door of the clubroom, hesitating to go inside. This shouldn’t be this goddamn hard. With my bag slung over my shoulder and a book in my arm, I apprehensively open the door. 

*Please, universe, work in favor of me for once. Please let Monika be the only one in there.*

“H-Hello?” I call out as I walk in, half-expecting a silent wave from Sayori, or an enthusiastic reply from Monika.

But as I walk in, I find that there’s nobody here.

*What a relief.* I slump down into my desk by the window and open my book. Not a moment later, Monika walks into the clubroom. “Hey, Yuri! You’re early today.”

*Early…?* I pull out my smartphone and glance at the time. I’m five minutes early. *I suppose it’s better to be early than late.*  “I-I suppose I am… I didn’t even realize.”


“Yuri, are you doing alright?” Monika suddenly asks. “You’ve been kinda… I dunno, distant lately.”

*So someone* did *notice.* “W-Well, I… uh…”

Monika cuts me off, saving me from having to stutter more. “Just know that your Literature Club is here for you, okay?”

I nod silently. *I know she cares, but it’s kinda hard when you’re a self-deprecating freak to believe that.* I appreciate her intentions and her effort, but alas, words only get through if they’re sharp. *And the sharpest thing that can get through to me are my knives. Literally.* 

Just as I return to my book, Natsuki and Sayori walk through the door, chatting about something. I can’t help but to listen in. *My two “crushes” - if I can even call it that - talking? I can’t resist.* 

“Tell me another one, Nat!” Sayori exclaimed, obviously entertained by whatever Natsuki was telling her.

“Okay, okay, so- alright, so you’ve got a one-story pink house, right?” Natsuki starts. “Inside of it, there’s a pink person, a pink cat, a pink fish, a pink table, a pink computer- you get the idea, everything was *fucking* pink. But what color was the stairs?”

*Riddles, huh? Wouldn’t the answer be “the stairs don’t have a color because there are no stairs in the house?”*

“Oh, oh, oh! I’ve heard this one,” Sayori replies. “It’s a one-story house! There are no stairs, so they can’t have a color.”

“What the- well, *yeah,* dummy. Obviously,” Natsuki says. It sounds like she’s upset that Sayori knew it already.

I glanced up from my book just in time to see Sayori practically *beaming.* “Wait! I’ve got something similar… hold on.”

“Lemme hear it.”

Sayori clears her throat. I wonder what riddle she could have hidden up her sleeve. “One bright day in the middle of the night, two dead boys got up to fight. Back to back, they faced each other. They drew their swords and shot each other. A deaf policeman heard the noise and came and shot the two dead boys. If you don’t believe my lies are true, then just ask the blind man, because he saw it too!”

I didn’t see it, but I’m sure Natsuki’s jaw may have hit the floor. The only thing I heard from her lips were, “What the *fuck*, Sayori.”

I chuckled softly. *Oh, Sayori.* Such an innocent and bright girl. I just wish I could see inside her mind, just to know what she thinks on a regular basis. 

Natsuki shuffled past me in my peripherals as I went back to reading, and Sayori sat down in her usual seat; the desk in the farthest corner of the clubroom. I quick glance confirmed to me that she was doing the same thing she always does when she’s in a down mood; dragging an eraser down the desk, leaning into her hand.

I wish I *knew* how to help her. I wish I *could* help her. But how am I to help when I don’t know what the hell is wrong? I can feel my anxiety spiking up at just the thought. *Have you ever thought that maybe it’s you that’s the problem?* But what about me is the problem? The fact that she *somehow* likes me, or the fact that I’m a mess that can’t be bothered to address that kiss?

*Oh yeah, that’s right. I’m the one who didn’t want to talk about it. I’m pathetic. Can’t even work out tension between myself and someone else.* 

Suddenly, Monika called out with her usual catchphrase, pulling me from my thoughts. “Okay, everyone! It’s poem sharing time!”

I pulled out my poem for today. I didn’t have much time nor the motivation to write anything new, so I just used my Station Manager poem from Sayori’s party. I’m definitely not feeling it today, but I guess I’ll just have to deal with it for the time being. *Honestly, I need some tea to bring me back to life after the shit day I’ve had.*

Sayori approached me first, her poem in hand. “H-Hello, Sayori,” I managed to choke out, my social anxiety and introversion creeping back in. “Here’s my p-poem.”

I handed her my poem and watched intently as her ocean blue eyes scanned over the page. *Those goddamn beautiful blue eyes of hers. I could fall into those two beautiful lakes. Her ocean eyes could swallow me up whole, and I don’t think I would mind. God, she’s so…*

*Stop.* 

I snapped out of my trance just as Sayori looked up from my poem. “This is really good! Kinda confusing though. I’m not sure what it’s about,” she said, a small smile on her face.

*But is it a real smile, though?* “Ah, thank you, Sayori,” I find myself half mumbling. I don’t feel like explaining the poem; I just want to get this sharing session done and over with. “May I see your poem, Sayori?”

She nodded, handing me her poem. I read her script carefully.

*I think I’d compare you to a flower.*

*A delicate, cream white lily,*

*In the warm summer’s sun;*

*Your beauty is simply unearthly.*

-

*The harsh sun beats down on you,*

*Just like your insecurities get you down.*

*I try to keep you watered,*

*But you always seem to drown.*

-

*I won’t give up on watering you, though*

*Even if the outcome is the same.*

*I will try until I’m dead,*

*But I’m still the one to blame.*

-

*I seem to kill whatever I touch,*

*And I’m sorry it’s the same with you.*

*But it seems I have drowned myself,*

*And I’ve drowned your lilies, too.*

Why is my heart beating so hard in my chest? I feel like my heart is going to *burst.* I can already feel my cheeks heating up at this. *Is this poem about me? About* us? 

I swallow hard. “U-Uhm, this is a… a r-really nice poem S-Sayori,” I manage to get out. “I really l-liked the… t-the imagery and metaphors you p-put in your poem.”

My arms suddenly felt *extremely* itchy. *No, don’t let the urge overcome you.* “T-Thanks, Yuri… ehehe.”

She smiled warmly at me, her perfect blue eyes meeting mine. My arms seemed to be set ablaze. *I don’t need it. I don’t need it. I absolutely do* not *need it.* I scratched my arm anxiously, only for the urge to become worse, like a mosquito bite that you have scratched until it’s a scab. 

*“I-Igottagodosomething!”* I exclaimed before pacing out of the clubroom, feeling extremely dizzy.

*The bathroom is too obvious, and they know I go to the drinking fountain to make tea. I need to go somewhere where they’d least expect me.* 

I ran through the halls, panting heavily as I tried to find a secluded spot. That’s when I saw it; the computer lab. *There’s a bathroom off the side of it, so I can go in there if I need to.* I sat down in the corner of the dark room, shrouded by several computers and tables. *They’d have to look real close to find me.* 

I need an excuse. Thinking one up on the spot isn’t going to do me any good, so I need one now. *I’ll just say I realized I forgot something and had to go get it, and that I put it away in my locker. Not entirely convincing, but at least Natsuki and Monika won’t know a thing. Sayori, though…* 

I carefully retrieved the small knife from my pocket. I’m a fool to bring this with me to school, but a razor from a pencil sharpener can only help ease the stress so much. I… I need the feel of the cold, metal of a knife against my skin to feel release.

*You shouldn’t be doing this,* my mind screamed at me as I rolled up both my sleeves. I traced a few of my scars; some old, some new, some deep, some not so deep. *But I frankly don’t give a shit right now.* 

I slowly pressed the sharp metal of the knife against my skin. I bit down on my lip to distract from the sudden pain in my arm and to keep me from making noises. The blood came up to the surface of my skin. I admired it’s crimson color, and the exhilarating rush that always came with bringing a knife to my arms. 

*But not as good as kissing Sayori, right?* 

I pressed the knife into my other arm, harder this time. *Every time you let yourself succumb to these so called “feelings” you have for Sayori, it guarantees another open wound on your arms. You’re supposed to be crushing on Natsuki.* 

*She’s your friend. What do you think would happen if you two got together and then broke up, huh? You’d have nothing but bittersweet memories, regret, and awkward conversations.*

My own mind seemed to have turned against me as it continued to assault me with words. *Are you sure she even likes you?* If she didn’t feel that way, why would she have kissed me? *She pities you, fool.* She cares! *But can you be sure?*

With each new doubt came another line splayed across my forearm. *Look at you. Can’t even confront her. Foolish.*

Tears began to stream down my face in frustration, as the blood continued to pour from my arms. *WHY DOES THIS HAVE TO BE SO GODDAMN DIFFICULT? WHY CAN’T I BE A NORMAL FUCKING HUMAN BEING?!*

*Why can’t I just talk to her?*

The knife clattered to the floor as I stood up and stumbled to the bathroom that was built off the side of the computer lab. I hastily scrubbed the blood off my arms, not caring about the stinging of the soap in my wounds. I opened the first aid kit on the wall and pulled out the bandages, wrapping them around my arms. *My uniform sleeves won’t last a second against these open cuts.* 

As I finished wrapping my arms, I looked at myself in the mirror. Luckily, the very minimal amount of makeup I wear didn’t seem to be affected by my crying. *Hey, look! Your reflection in the mirror isn’t distorted for once! That’s good, right?* I clutched my chest as the aching of my heart seemed to subside for the most part.

I rolled down my sleeves and retrieved the knife, cleaning my blood off of it. *Wouldn’t want anyone finding this, now, wouldn’t we?*

*God, I regret this. No matter what I say, Sayori is going to be worried, because my alibi isn’t going to be convincing enough, especially after the way I stormed out of there.*

I sighed and slid the knife back into my pocket. I looked back in the mirror at my face. *They’re going to know you’ve been crying.* I grabbed a few paper towels and soaked them under the warm water before pressing it to my cheeks and under my eyes. *There. Now it looks like nothing ever happened. Perfect.*

I took a deep, yet shaky breath, before stepping out of the computer lab and returning to the clubroom. 

*It’s almost as if nothing ever happened.* 

**------------------**

I sighed in relief as I exited the school grounds. *Today has been utterly exhausting.* I’ve wanted nothing more than to lay down in my bed, drink some hot tea and read a book. And soon, I’ll be able to fulfil that want.

I wasted no time making my way home. I didn’t want to even *dare* go near the other three after the meeting ended. Being in their presence opens opportunities for questions. And questions lead to lies, and lies lead to distrust.

*As if they even trusted me in the first place.*

I stepped onto the porch of my house and fished my key out of my bag. It would seem my father is home, since the family car is sitting in the driveway. The car is a real beauty; [a 1968 Plymouth Sport Fury, painted a stunning violet color.](https://imgur.com/a/VpXYLd9) It’s been a hand me down car since my grandfather first bought it, and my family has worked to keep it in pristine condition. 

As I unlocked the door, I suddenly remembered the old tradition we used to uphold. I haven’t done it in years, since my father is almost never around when I come home anyway. But it seems today is different.

Stepping inside, I called out, *“Tadaima!”* 

Without missing a beat, my father replied. *“Okaerinasai, Yuri!”*

Despite the horrible day I’ve had, just hearing him upholding our tradition for the first time in years is enough to put a smile on my face, even if it is temporary. 

I immediately pulled off my shoes and left them by the door before setting my bag down on the bench in the dining room; my usual routine. Looking down, I notice my cat curling around my legs.

“Hello, Jupiter!” I bent down and gently scratched behind his ears. He meowed happily at me in reply, and began purring. I scooped him up in my arms, not caring about getting his fur all over my uniform.

“How was your day, Yuri?” my father questioned as I walked into the living, my cat in my arms.

*Tell him you had a bad day. That you fell asleep in class, and the teacher humiliated you. Tell him. Tell him all of it.* “It was alright.”

*Liar.*

*A dirty, impulsive liar.*

Jupi’s paw curled around my thumb. “It was just like any other day, really.”

“Ah, I see.” *And the awkward small talk returns. “Ittekimasu.* I’m gonna go for a ride in your future car, if that’s alright with you.”

I nodded, gently putting Jupi down. “I thought you had to work today, Dad?”

“Oh, I did. They let us go early today, though. It was a slow day at work.”

“I see.”

“Alright, stay safe, kiddo. I’ll be back soon.”

“Bye, Dad.”

I didn’t even dare to meet his eyes as he walked past me to leave. 

It’s been this way for years; him avoiding my presence when I actually want to spend time with him, and vice versa. It’s nothing new, I suppose, but it’s still painful. It’s almost as if I don’t even have a father anymore.

Sighing, I retreated to my room, just as I do every day when I come home from school. I sat down on my bed and went over everything that happened today.

*I fell asleep in class because I stayed up so late last night.*

*My teacher humiliated me in front of the entire class.*

*Natsuki probably does not reciprocate my feelings.*

*I have no clue if I even like Natsuki anymore, or what I feel towards Sayori.*

*My heart seems to have shattered into a million tiny, glass shards.*

*I made a mess of my arms once more and lied about it.*

*And I lied to my father.*

*I did a lot of lying today. God…*

*I truly am a mess.* 

Deciding that I needed to do something, *anything,* I went out and made myself some tea before heading into my bathroom. *Perhaps I should change things up a little bit and prepare myself a nice, relaxing bath.* 

I began to set everything up; candles, my phone connected to a speaker to play music, the bath, and my tea cup sitting next to the tub. I peeled off my uniform and bandages, folded it all neatly, and put it all on the bathroom counter. I eased into the bathtub, my arms stinging slightly. Eventually, my arms stopped aching, and I could finally enjoy a nice, peaceful bath.

I selected a playlist that I usually listened to when I needed something to calm down, and settled in. My mind began to wander as I bathed, from my mother, to Natsuki, to Sayori, to school, and eventually back to Natsuki and Sayori.

*God… I can’t even tell who I’m crushing on anymore. It’s all just a jumble of emotion.*

I was so unbelievably upset and heartbroken that Natsuki didn’t kiss me on that night. I knew that depending on her actions, it would either make me or break me. Apparently, my preparation for rejection was not enough. 

But then, Sayori…

As I wrote in my *Weather* poem, I truly didn’t expect *Sayori,* of all people, to be someone who could make me feel this way. It *scares* me how much I think about her now. I simply cannot make eye contact with her at this point, because of how scared I am that I am going to drown in her eyes and fall completely in love with her. My chest aches when I’m around her. Not the dull, faint aching I feel around anyone I’m attracted to, but a *deep, painful ache.* It’s why I have been reducing my arms to scar tissue more often than usual lately. The pain is simply more overwhelming than any other emotion I’ve felt. And hell, that sure is saying something, because every emotion I feel is overwhelming. I feel *way too much.*

*Oh, Sayori.* She’s such a bright person, that I never imagined something being wrong with her. But now that she’s shown me a least a bit of who she truly is, I can’t help but feel obliged to be there for her. Of course, even if I wasn’t feeling this way, I would drop everything to help her. She’s my goddamn friend. But this urge, this *need* to help her is stronger than ever. 

When it comes to Natsuki, it seems like that burning flame of desire I held for her has had water poured on it. *Am I even in love with Natsuki anymore?*

Perhaps I am running on pure obsession over the two intimate kisses we shared that night. Or...

*Or maybe you’re falling for Sayori.*

But my heart is already far too broken to love her. It was fragile before, with several cracks inside of it. Natsuki’s indirect rejection did it for me. I feel like I’m scrambling to glue all the pieces of my heart back together, but to no avail. Even if I did glue the shards of my heart back together, it wouldn’t be the same. A broken window, when fixed, is still *broken.* The cracks are still there. *It’s permanent.* 

Unless… 

Was my heart ever made of glass in the first place?

Perhaps I’ve been looking at all of this in the wrong perspective. Maybe instead of glass, my heart is made of lego bricks. Natsuki’s indirect rejection may have left my heart in a state of disrepair, but maybe if I tear my heart apart, I will be able to rebuild it. 

And maybe then, I will know what my heart desires.

Content with my plan on how to fix all of this, I closed my eyes, and allowed myself to enjoy the first calm moment I’ve had in three weeks and a day.

**-----------------**

***Two days later***

*Shlick. Shlick. Shlick.*

*Why the hell am I doing this to myself? And now, of all times?*

Everything has been relatively smooth sailing the past two days. In fact, I finally figured out what I desired. I rebuilt my heart. I suppose I’m just anxious. I’ve decided that I wanted to finally confront Sayori about this entire thing. Perhaps that’s why I haven’t been able to put the knife down every time I pick it up for the past two days.

Despite that, I know now that tearing my heart down like a lego house and rebuilding it was necessary. My judgement was clouded by someone I didn’t truly love. Maybe at one point, I was actually in love with Natsuki. It’s entirely a possibility. I’ve had a crush on her since I joined the Literature Club. And now, I have taken the final steps to getting over her.

I have every right to believe that Sayori kissing me was the last push I needed to finally get over my feelings I had for Natsuki. I just wish it didn’t take Sayori kissing me to realize her perfection and beauty. She was everything I didn’t expect; a goddess in plain sight. 

If only I had seen it in the first place, perhaps I wouldn’t have been such a mess over the entire thing.

I looked down at my arms, surveying the damage. I didn’t slice up my arms nearly as bad as I did two days ago, but I did quite a lot of damage that I know I’m going to regret. With my knife still in hand, I wandered across the hall to the bathroom, quietly shutting the door behind me. *Wouldn’t want dear ole Dad to find you like this, huh?*

 I turned the sink on, letting the water run for a moment, so it wasn’t so suspicious. I then swiftly cleaned the blood off the knife, before doing the same to my arms. After drying both the knife and my arms, I quickly wrapped my arms in bandages. 

*I need some fresh air after all of this cutting and thinking.*

Looking in the mirror, my face seemed to be distorted again. I couldn’t recognize the monster in my mirror. In an effort to change how I looked a bit, I put my hair into one long braid. I usually don’t do much to my hair aside from normal hygiene, but considering the fact that my distorted figure isn’t going to go away any time soon, I might as well make myself look a little different.

I stepped outside into the cold air, not caring that I was in a tank top and shorts. The cold is probably good for me anyway. It’s a better way to punish my body than slicing up my arms.

My destination was clear. Sayori had shown me this cliff that she used to go on as a child. It was on the way to her house, and it was basically in between where we both lived. The cliff wasn’t all too high, but if you weren’t careful, you’d fall down about twenty-five to thirty feet into a river. It was at the end of a path, and it had a great view that was worth seeing.

As I approached the cliff, I saw a familiar figure. *Well, what a coincidence.* Sayori’s voice seemed to echo off the trees on the path.

“Why does it have to be so hard?” I heard her say, clearly frustrated. “Why can’t I just be brave enough to say something? I just want to… I just want… *This isn’t fair!”* 

*I’ve been asking myself those same questions for three weeks now, Sayori.* I watched as she picked up a cobble from the ground before launching it into the chasm. Her legs were hanging off the edge of the cliff as I stopped behind her.

“It’s beautiful, isn’t it?” *And I’m not talking about the view from this cliff.*",t2_uacy1,,,0,,Ocean Eyes (Happy Birthday Part 1.5) - a HB prequel oneshot,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Fanfic'}]",r/DDLC,False,6.0,fanfic,,,,False,,False,light,,#ff66ac,public,,,{},,0485d3be-1c38-11e8-b3e6-0e040e0bd9d2,False,,,False,False,,{},Fanfic,False,10,,,,self,False,yuri-1mil,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'The Angst Bomb (tag me in abstract doki art)'}]",,,True,,,richtext,6.0,,,richtext,self.DDLC,,,,,,,False,False,True,False,False,,,False,4be7b394-ee93-11e7-be83-0ed8d186392c,True,False,False,The Angst Bomb (tag me in abstract doki art),,,,,,t5_3opwf,,,,#ff4500,8zmfiv,,,CloudF11,,6,True,all_ads,False,,,light,/r/DDLC/comments/8zmfiv/ocean_eyes_happy_birthday_part_15_a_hb_prequel/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLC/comments/8zmfiv/ocean_eyes_happy_birthday_part_15_a_hb_prequel/,99199,1531843653.0,0,,False,,self,,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'IBRov4_l_LaOyTYB2cz2LS3-uVTY6a3kD_3ya2KLSLQ', 'resolutions': [{'height': 81, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/9G8qWY4kG6nkPhrz9qaoHzj9q0viQ-1k5OEhp-RFhnQ.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=7dff2f6218dcecfb3939b6a5ae79ba3b', 'width': 108}, {'height': 162, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/9G8qWY4kG6nkPhrz9qaoHzj9q0viQ-1k5OEhp-RFhnQ.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=ca4d797cf4b3a851dd430073e18c31bd', 'width': 216}, {'height': 240, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/9G8qWY4kG6nkPhrz9qaoHzj9q0viQ-1k5OEhp-RFhnQ.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=d97e0667c1f004813db16f76b1a01f63', 'width': 320}, {'height': 480, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/9G8qWY4kG6nkPhrz9qaoHzj9q0viQ-1k5OEhp-RFhnQ.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=1c9ae2d8fb62916b9a264e32ef1627d2', 'width': 640}, {'height': 720, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/9G8qWY4kG6nkPhrz9qaoHzj9q0viQ-1k5OEhp-RFhnQ.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=1a5c049868fa4d8eec66164b4468a6db', 'width': 960}, {'height': 810, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/9G8qWY4kG6nkPhrz9qaoHzj9q0viQ-1k5OEhp-RFhnQ.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;s=bdd8dec97bab66052868f8d2460d0e92', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 1536, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/9G8qWY4kG6nkPhrz9qaoHzj9q0viQ-1k5OEhp-RFhnQ.jpg?s=e5361bf28c6a879fceb7769ff7d2e54b', 'width': 2048}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,1454252572.0,1536623785.0,,,
,tf2,"Anyone come from a backround of solid FPS games? Games with solid ranking systems, functional matchmaking, and balanced gameplay?

Because I have. Halo 2 came out November 9, 2004 with FUNCTIONAL RANKED matchmaking on xbox live. Were FOURTEEN YEARS past the release date of this game, made for the O-G xbox live, and we STILL do not have functional matchmaking.

Anyone with standards would see this is a fucking joke, and should be remedied. 

Search with friends -&gt; Wreck because matchmaking ratings are straight FUCKED -&gt; Enemy team loses -&gt; Enemies mass exodus -&gt; You, or your friends end up on the enemy team; maybe even for up to 6 rounds (thundermountain). Or are forced to start another que. 

Every time a good player stomps a game, carrys a team, then gets swapped his MMR gets even more fucked up than it would be without this bullshit happening. NOW without even a choice to say NO other than if it says '5 sec till' you can dodge with Retry in console. And you know the second you get swapped to the other team, 5 more players will join and you'll have a full game playing vs your friends.

So besides the fact the game balances matches around matchmaking ratings that basically could not be any less accurate, we also have a cesspool of hackers running around basically free to do whatever they want for months on end. ""Someone you reported was banned"" My dick. I'll go check their account, nope. Not banned. Valve seems to basically not give a shit about hacking so much they are practically endorsing and pushing players into doing it more.

Why does it seem like I'm the literal only person who has any standards for this game?

Why is teamwork so offensive in this game (Class balance, working together)?

Why do people not give a shit that every.fucking.match they play is a shit show of WILDLY stacked teams when every other top FPS game thats even mildly competitive would have had functional and balanced matchmaking for OVER FOURTEEN FUCKING YEARS.

I think its time we expected more from Valve than cosmetic / aesthetic bullshit. Functional matchmaking, accurate ratings, class limits to spy/sniper (so retards dont have the :option: of fucking their own team, making everyones MMR fucked in the process), and ANY sort of hacking prevention and or banning of hackers.

Ive seen it from other games, why do we not expect more from valve when we all know we sure as fuck put the $$$ in. Is it time for a boycott of buying their cash grab bullshit, opening crates, buying keys? Would even 1 single percent of the community care about improving their game enough to even start such a protest? 

Im honestly losing hope in this game. And its pretty sad because its arguably the best FPS game out there, held back by the dumbest shit imaginable, stuff that would take fucking MINUTES to fix. So demoralized seeing this game become and fester into a cess pool where teamwork is offensive, telling people to not be the 5th sniper or spy automatically makes you into hitler (the fuck?), with hackers in basically FIFTY PERCENT of the games I play, most of the time with an enemy team full of super impressed children chasing them with medic.

I love this game but my god does it fucking suck right now. And the sad part is, its the best its ever been; too.

EASY AS FUCK FIXES:

+ Class limits spy/sniper. No more dumpy kids fucking your entire team because they wont fuck off spy/sniper. 2 per class and 3 total spy+sniper. Fix can be done in probably 30 minutes or less.

+ If someone completes a game with a .5 kill to death ratio, there should be a negative buffer on the MMR they are gaining / losing to offset how many good players are losing MMR from a game they would have likely otherwise won with competent teammate. Every time a player joins and participates in a game where his matchmaking rating is off, even by a little; it will warp the ratings of everyone in the game. So if you go 5 Kills 10 deaths, just take another 10 MMR off their matchmaking rating. ZERO PERCENT of the community even knows what the fuck this is, or where to even find it, so NO ONE would even notice or care. Zombie fanboys are incapable of seeing flaws in changes anyways. * This change will not effect Medic or Engineer, and will only effect players who do not reach .5 K/D. Players who are consistently doing abysmal, and not helping their team, will start to be ranked as such; and wont hurt the entire MMR formula for every single player playing the game. This one might take some muscle to implement.

+ A support email where you can send hacker profiles to be monitored. EZ fix. Might have to hire someone to help clean this fucking game up. You can afford it Valve. Current system is nonexistent and / or fucking abysmal.

+ INCENTIVE to win other than XP. Give the winning team 1 random weapon, even. ANYTHING of value that players would actually want. If you dont want to influence the market then make them untradeable/unmarketable. Maybe just a 'coins' system where you earn coins to buy war paints? Fucking ANYTHING to get these dopey plebs to work together and not be so resistant to teamwork and helping each other (Seriously for this game being ""TEAM Fortress"" the vast majority of the community both wont work as a team, and will actively fight you if you try to. YOU CANT MAKE ME!-esque daddy issues are rampant). Give us a shop where I can spend my coins on halloween footsteps and spells and I'm sure players will fiend for that shit. This one might take some work, but it would be soo worth it.

+ ASK before swapping to the other team. PRIORITIZE keeping parties together. PRIORITIZE matching stacks vs stacks so there is less chance people will dip immediately.

+ LOCK the cart and the TIMER for payload when teams are stacked in terms of players (like a 12 vs 6), so people can play TDM till the game is balanced, so you dont have to start drafting players to the enemy team, the team they have been fighting against... If someone DOES volunteer to join the enemy team, make their MMR not effected by the result of that game. (so I can join a losing team, help balance the game, and not hurt my MMR accuracy which will hurt players in future games because the game thinks I'm not as good as the level that I perform at).

+ RENAME MATCHMAKING TO MATCHMAKING. KEEP CASUAL PLAYLIST but only feature non-serious maps in it. CTF, PL_hoodoo, PL_Goldrush, Dustbowl can all have a home here. Feel free to do whatever you want with MMR here, even remote it (maybe with team scramble option?). Keep the 'its casual' dumb-as-fuck meme in here. Renaming the primary playlist to MATCHMAKING will hopefully alleviate some of the cancer that is that catchphrase.

+ Do we even need comp mode if matchmaking actually does its fucking job? Maybe completely overhaul it (7s prolander anyone?). AT THE VERY LEAST giving players the ability to use their custom options / FOV.

+ You know what the best part of ACCURATE MMR is? You can SAFELY REMOVE RANDOM CRITS in this environment! Random crits already hurt noobs more than they help them, so feel free to just axe that shit from all projectiles, or all together. Not gunna lie I'd miss my demon wrench 100% crit rate tho. The game doesnt need to rely on random bullshit (the noob will miss half his crits anyway LOL) to help balance the game and break up tight holds, because the games will be so balanced in terms of skill levels and participation, and teamwork; that instead of relying on random garbage, you can just work as a team and actually stand a chance of getting whatever mission done because you will likely be playing against like-skilled opponents now (LITERALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME, EVER; IN TF2S MATCHMAKING HISTORY).

TL:DR; have higher standards. Expect more. This game is a fucking wreck, and some SIMPLE changes would fix it up SOOOOOO much.",t2_abekyd5,,,0,,Lets talk about the state of TF2,[],r/tf2,False,6.0,discussion,,,,False,,False,dark,,,public,,,{},,19b01114-7ac3-11e5-9e8f-0e373b482bcf,False,,,False,False,,{},Discussion,False,0,,,,self,1531815347.0,blu spy,[],,,True,,,text,6.0,,,text,self.tf2,,,,,,,False,True,True,False,False,,,False,6b19dde2-87ee-11e3-99c3-12313d2c1868,True,False,False,,,,,,,t5_2qka0,,,,,8zjasr,,,Anon48529,,44,True,all_ads,False,,,dark,/r/tf2/comments/8zjasr/lets_talk_about_the_state_of_tf2/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/8zjasr/lets_talk_about_the_state_of_tf2/,213059,1531814963.0,0,,False,,,,,,,,1502590374.0,1536622334.0,,,

[Accounts from a Lonely Broadcast Station](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8fp44u/accounts_from_a_lonely_broadcast_station_part_1/)

In the early hours of the morning, before the sun was up and before Daniel was on his way into work, I saw something I couldn’t explain. You might think I mean something supernatural or otherwise inhuman, but it was quite the opposite.

We had a visitor to the broadcast tower.

I could see someone, their face obscured by a dark hoodie that covered their hair and eyes, equally dark-colored clothes covering the rest of their body as well. It was clear from the way they stalked around outside the building that they weren’t looking to come inside and chat. It was almost five o’clock in the morning, a time when I would usually still be sleeping for another hour, but a bathroom break had proven timely as I got a perfect view of our new stalker looking around the outside of the tower.

Now usually, calling the police would be the natural response. But out of some curiosity for what this mysterious weirdo was up to, I was just distracted by watching them poke around outside. Their actions seemed curious, but not aggressive. First they marched round, peering through gaps in the wooden walls of the shed, then walking along the treeline and shuffling their feet in the dirt for a bit. It was as if they weren’t looking for anything in particular, but still searched for anything they might come across.

I left for only a few minutes, starting a pot of coffee and resigning myself to an early start to the day. Fog was in the weather prediction and I’d need all the energy I could get to act fast if need be. While I waited at the square plastic table in the break room, tapping at my phone screen and trying to coax the tiniest bit of internet out of it, I never took my eyes or ears completely off of the stairwell or the broadcast room windows. Sure, Creepus Maximus out there seemed simply curious at most, but aside from the eerie feeling they gave me, it was my job to make sure no one stepped into the forest.

I stirred sugar into my coffee cup, dropped the spoon into the sink with a ‘clank’, and groggily made my way towards the door. Before I did, I heard a sound that was a little too familiar. It was a whisper, so faint but so sharp in my ears, and it was coming from the kitchen sink. I thought we were done with this a long time ago.

My gaze was stuck on the drain, glaring at it and trying to decipher quiet, mumbling bits of sound that didn’t quite form full words. I only took one step closer to it before I decided hanging my head right over the source wasn’t an intelligent idea. I watched bubbles rise into the basin. As if liquid down the drain was boiling, the bubbles popped and formed more in their place, splashing tiny pinpricks of dark red fluid all around the inside. A rancid smell was coming from deep down in the plumbing. Immediately, it turned me off from my coffee … which I dumped down the exact same drain in what I now suppose could have been a somewhat accidentally rude gesture. The voice stopped. She had apparently said all she needed to say this time.

I had lost my coffee but gained some tense nerves as I staggered back into the broadcasting room, the quiet nature of the moment convincing me for a time that our visitor had left. I stretched my arms, took a peek at the clock sitting on my side of the desk --

\--and then nearly jumped out of my skin.

A hoarse yelp left my throat when I happened to glance outside, getting a full view of that familiar hooded figure standing directly on the other side of the window at the top of the fire escape. Both hands were in the pockets of his sweater, but I could see a human nose, a human mouth. It’s difficult to explain this very specific kind of fear, seeing someone only feet away from you, but still very much separated. He was real, he was *alive.* And the fact that this wasn’t a shambling, half-decayed monstrosity of human and animal parts made him almost more threatening to me than the rest.

I could get rid of monsters with a single button. I couldn’t get rid of this so easily.

Almost as soon as I spotted him, he turned and pulled his hood further over the features of his face, darting down the fire escape. Faintly, I could hear the metallic sounds of his footsteps racing away one after the other, until at last I could no longer hear or see him anywhere in the pre-sunrise darkness. The last glimpse that I got was of his feet through the grass as he turned the corner of the tower’s base, heading towards the gravel parking lot.

Calling the police would have been a very sensible reaction, and you’ll be glad to know that I did call someone. I had absolutely no trouble waking Finn up at five in the morning and telling him that we had what could have been an attempted break-in at the broadcast station. I’m going to be optimistic and say that his exasperated curse words and tired sighs were in reaction to the hooded creeper and not to my phone call.

I waited in the stairwell, confident that I’d hear plenty of ungodly noise if someone tried to crawl up the fire escape and break into the recording room while I was gone. The only footsteps I heard, however, were that of our brand new guard dog, Finn himself. When he entered, using his own key and pushing open the jammed metal door, he took one look at me and I could practically hear the sound of static as the hair stood on the back of his neck.

“Jesus *shitting* Christ.” He slammed the door behind him, a puff of dust flying from the floor. “I come in here looking for an intruder and see you sitting there in the dark, looking like a goddamn ghost. You scared every last fuck right out of me. So thanks for that.”

While Finn wasn’t working for the police anymore, he still had this walk that radiated a sense of purpose, as if he was always on his way to fix a problem. He marched around the ground level before passing me on the stairs. “You said you saw a guy out here poking around?” he asked me.

“Uhh, yeah, outside. Never came in, though.” I pointed a finger upwards. “I saw him while I was upstairs. First he was sneaking around by the treeline, then I saw him come up the fire escape. He was scoping the place out, I think, but ran like a chickenshit when he figured out I could see him.”

My footsteps echoed with a distinct metallic sound through the empty room, cradled by the wooden stakes holding the top room up. As I followed Finn upstairs, I only gave one last glance to the doorway. It was sealed and safe, but that heavy metal door never ceased to give me anxiety.

“So he’s not here anymore? He ran?” Finn waited to ask until I had caught up to him.

“Far as I know, he’s gone.” I used my key to get us into the broadcasting room, which was still dimly lit as the end of the night owl block played automatically over the radio.

Finn looked less than amused. Thick, block-shaped fingers reached up to rub the bridge of his nose, veins in the back of his hand prominent when he clenched them. “You called me about a break-in … that never happened.” he clarified. “You called me about an intruder who is gone\*.\* Evelyn, why the hell am I out here?”

At this point, I had seated myself in the rolling chair I claimed as my own, Daniel’s seat left empty. He wasn’t due to come in for a couple of hours, and perhaps that knowledge made me a little more willing to admit what came to mind.

“...Because I know who it was.” I spoke honestly. “And I was scared.”

...

With only a little while longer before the automatic playlist ended for the night and my responsibilities as radio DJ resumed, Finn decided to stick around and sit next to me while we poked through a few of the recordings from our security cameras. I was still clumsily figuring out how to review the footage, but luckily, it wasn’t too hard to go back such a short amount of time. Before long, we were staring at a paused image of the man I saw outside, this time from the tree’s perspective, as he inspected the very spot where the forest stopped and the clearing began.

“So, who is this guy?” Finn asked as he zoomed the screen in on the blurry, half-visible face beneath the hood. The poor quality of the night vision camera made his face look hollow and even more chilling than reality.

“His name’s Elijah,” I answered. “Least, I’m almost sure that’s him. I never saw his eyes or his hair, but there’s a resemblance. He was dating my friend Jennifer when she … decided to go into the woods and not come back.”

I watched Finn’s mouth curve into a thin-lipped frown, one of thought. I wasn’t an investigator of any sort, but even I could put two and two together.

“Think he was here trying to mess with you maybe? Considering this is where she disappeared?""

I almost said ‘yes’, but I couldn’t make myself believe that in full. I could understand why he’d hold a grudge. His girlfriend went missing and was found dead right outside my workplace, and his last memory of me was one final blowout fight. Anyone who says breaking up with a best friend is cake compared to breaking up with a partner has never had a friendship that meant as much as ours did. But Elijah’s behavior didn’t seem standard for that sort of thing. With a skeptical shrug of the shoulders, I said the only other theories that came to mind.

“Maybe, but it looked to me like he was searching for something. Maybe her. I mean, her case was just *closed* before they ever found the body. But when he came up the fire escape, I felt more like he was trying to intimidate than actually break in. The door was three feet away but he never even tried it.”

If he had, the alarm would have blared, and only a really desperate son of a bitch would stick around during all of that. Maybe he was a desperate son of a bitch.

But speaking of desperate …

“Hey, Finn?” I broke a solid moment of silence with a very different tone. “Dan and I have somewhere to be this weekend. I’ll split part of this week’s paycheck if you take over for a bit.”

The look on his face was hard to read at first, almost as if he didn’t understand the words coming out of my mouth. *Yes,* I thought. *I’m not too proud to ask you to do my job.*

“Is it important?” He asked, surprising me by not outright refusing.

“Yeah, we’re going to his cousin’s wedding.”

You’d think my answer was a joke from the way he suddenly spat out a laugh as if it crept up on him out of nowhere. I admit, I was a tad insulted that he didn’t take it seriously. But between his giggles and my grumpy, wrinkled brow, he gave me a surprising answer.

“Sure, fine, I’ll let you have your break. You look about a month overdue for one.”

“The hell does that mean?” The question was bitter even though I knew he wasn’t wrong.

“Settle down, sheesh. I could still change my mind.” Finn’s chuckles died down, but he still wore the same rotten smirk. “Promise you’ll dance with Dan at least once and we’ve got a deal.”

There wasn’t much on this earth aside from shoving a hornet’s nest up my ass that would make me dance.

That being said, I guess we still had a deal.

Six o’clock in the morning came around, then six-thirty. When the sun was rising and all seemed quiet out at the treeline, Finn was about ready to leave just as I set up my headset and broadcasted my morning greeting over the air. In the middle of my speech, I gave him a lazy wave, one of his legs already out the door and eager to return home.

The music was playing and I half expected to take off my headset and hear nothing, or perhaps only the very distant sound of Finn’s vehicle driving back onto the road or Daniel showing up a little early. You can imagine my surprise when the muffled suggestion of voices - *multiple* voices - was all I heard through the gap beneath the door. They sounded agitated. At least one sounded angry.

My finger tapped the base of my microphone, turning it off before swiftly leaving the seat on my chair. Curiosity got the best of me, as well as some stubborn kind of territorial attitude. As much as I hated this place, it was growing too synonymous with my everyday life for me not to defend it.

There was no one in the stairwell. No shadows outside the door. And still, I could hear unintelligible but aggravated, raised voices from outside. The heavy metal door swung open and I practically marched around the side of the tower, Finn’s yells finally becoming clear.

What I didn’t expect as I rounded the corner was to almost get hit by a flying body, as whatever argument had ensued didn’t stay verbal for very long. I got a split second view of a dark-colored sweatshirt as Finn practically threw his assailant onto the gravel, knocking the wind out of a very red-faced, very breathless Elijah. He was back, now in full daylight.

“He got me good.” I almost didn’t recognize Daniel’s voice from behind me, nasally as he pinched the bridge of his nose. Finn had Elijah under control. He was already pinning him to the gravel parking lot, one arm twisted behind his back to keep him immobile. Judging by the scuff on Dan’s cheek and the way he squinted his watering eyes, Finn was probably the only one of the three to come out unscathed.

“Did he break your nose?” I asked, reaching up to grab Dan’s chin, tilting his head up.

“Ah! Don’t touch it…”

“I won’t.” I assured before he finally dropped his hand, letting me get a peek. No blood, just a big red mark that would probably start to swell. “I think you’ll live, Danny Boy.”

Elijah, only putting up a mild struggle as his cheek was pushed painfully into the loose stone, huffed in frustration as Finn pulled his wallet and a folding knife out of his back pocket.

“What were you planning on doing with this?” He asked, extending the blade to show him.

“Nothing.” It wasn’t a good answer, as Finn only twisted his arm further behind his back to coax a pained yell out of him. “Fuck! Stop it! ...I wasn’t going to use it, it was just for show!”

Finn folded the knife back up and tossed it away from the parking lot where it disappeared into the tall grass and bushes.

“So you’re trying to tell me you were just here to poke around and then leave?” He voiced a skeptical chuckle.

This time, Elijah turned his head to glare daggers up at the man with a knee in his back. “Isn’t that what you did?” he asked in a hoarse, seething voice. “I watch the news, you know. You searched for Jennifer for maybe a whole hour before you gave up and closed the case. You never tried. No one tried. Everyone’s saying she’s dead, but we can’t even bury her because no one's even *looking.”*

Finn’s gaze, as stern as ever, fixed itself on him first and then up to me. This was making sense now. If Elijah didn’t have anyone to blame for his girlfriend’s death, the most he could do is blame the ones who failed to bring her back.

There was a tense moment of attempted understanding as Finn loosened his hold on Elijah’s arm, letting him rest and drop the limb to his side. It may have been summer, but I felt a chill in the air, like a tickling wind just cold enough to raise bumps on the skin. It made the leaves rustle and the grass blow. From outside, the heavy wooden stakes holding the tower up sounded like a weak, groaning animal as they settled.

I didn’t want to be out here anymore.

“Elijah.” I spoke softly to him, one-on-one for the first time. “You should go home.”

Even when Finn released his arms and stood to take the weight off the other man’s back, he still took his time sitting up with sluggish, aching movement. “You don’t get it,” he told me, expression weary and lips in a frown. “You don’t have to live surrounded by her things every day.”

The shitty thing is, he was absolutely right.

The wind hit me again, branches creaking overhead and the clouds slowly covering the sparse rays of sunlight. With it, it brought another groan from the wood, this time more … vocal. Daniel had long since stopped nursing his swollen nose and was shifting where he stood. I knew he felt it too: the too-familiar agitation of a skipping heartbeat and the desire to get somewhere safe.

“I never realized how tall the trees were from down here.” I squinted my eyes at the woods, my hair tickling my nose and chin in the breeze. I heard another creak from the tower. No … beyond the tower. The *woods.*

I never realized how little we could see when we weren’t fifty feet in the air.

Daniel and I shared a glance. He was touching his arm, feeling the prickling of gooseflesh on his skin, and that was enough of a reason to abandon whatever stupid problems we thought we had down here.

“Fog day. Everyone upstairs. *You too.”* I pointed to Elijah, who seemed to be the only person who didn’t understand our urgency. Finn pulled the back of his sweater to help him up, much like a mother cat picking up her kittens by the scruff, while Daniel and I trusted that they could get up the stairs without us holding their hands.

Dan had the door swung open by the time I rounded the edge of the building, holding it wide and patting my shoulder to get me through the door first. Next was Finn, who stomped heavy boots up the winding staircase after me. My hands fumbled once I reached the top of the stairs, looking for the right key to unlock the broadcast room, all thanks to our new security. I still hadn’t found it when I realized only two of us were on the top landing.

“Elijah, hurry up! We need to get inside.” Daniel was yelling out the door to an unseen man somewhere between us and the woods. I was only partially watching my coworker as I sifted through my pockets, realizing in a moment’s notice that my keys were exactly where they didn’t need to be - in my bag, inside the room.

“Dan!” Yelling down the entire length of the stairs made my throat burn. “Dan, I need your keys! *I need your keys!”*

He turned to look at me, but his expression didn’t register understanding. Without the light or the right distance to read my lips, I supposed he heard his own name and that was about it. I swore an oath then that I’d start using my spare time to brush up on American Sign Language, all while pushing past Finn to stomp back down the stairs and tell him face-to-face.

“I nee…”

As soon as my feet hit the bottom landing, neither Daniel or I were paying attention to one another. Our eyes were collectively drawn to the treeline, where heavy, swirling clouds of gray crawled their way into the clearing, and where Elijah was standing with his back to us, still as the dead.

*Let him go. Let him get swallowed.* The thought was tempting, but sick. I had more to worry about than one man standing outside like a moron, but I couldn’t do it. It was our job to make sure no one else ended up like Jennifer Cook.

“What are you looking at? Get in here!” I raced out the door, but wasn’t alone. Daniel reached him before I did, immediately grabbing hold of one arm, which was quickly swatted away. Elijah never looked at us, but from beside him, I could see his eyes glazed in an almost trance-like state.

He was watching dark, shapeless motion from within the clouds, billowing upwards and snaking through the branches as it spread. It began to crawl across the ground, the grass beneath it quivering as if being brought to life. But Elijah wasn’t looking at any of that. His stare was fixed completely on the many pairs of eyes, glowing white between the trees, that were all staring straight at us with purpose.

“She’s in there.” Elijah whispered hoarsely, voice dazed. ""I hear her.”

Between the groan of movement somewhere in the mountains, my ears couldn’t pick up any other sound. Elijah was being tricked, just like those missing children. Just like the delivery guy. Just like Jenny herself.

Daniel let out a small yelp as I reached to tug on the waistband of his belt, unhooking the keys he had connected to his jeans. His moment of surprise at my rudeness dissipated in seconds; it was time to go, and to make it quick. We both grabbed one of Elijah’s arms, and though he struggled with unwillingness to leave the forest’s edge, we had no choice but to drag him back kicking and screaming. And kick and scream, he did.

Trees quaked and branches cracked, the fog swirling around our heels as it grew ever closer and quickly abandoned the limits of the woods. I shouldn’t have looked back. I shouldn’t have even considered it. But as I listened to Elijah’s breath hitch and felt the resistance of his body trying to pull away from my hold, I couldn’t help but face the forest.

I hadn’t had the incredible honor of seeing Jennifer’s corpse the way Daniel already had, broken and rotting as it struggled with every limb and muscle to stagger out from the trees. That changed as soon as my head turned and I caught an instant glimpse of her ruined self, walking so without support that I was surprised she didn’t break to pieces. She had changed. In the crack of her neck where the skin was broken, the beginnings of a fifth limb was growing out of her throat, but through the mask of fog I couldn't tell you if it was human or animal. I never understood ‘shambling’ so well until I watched her desperately move in every awkward, jerking motion that would bring her closer to us, like she needed to get here no matter what it took.

Elijah’s face was washed out to a pure white, his legs and arms going limp as he was forced to take in the view of her in such state of utter decay. Her whispers and croaks, her white orb-like eyes, and the way strings of her hair tangled between bits of exposed scalp and bone would be the last image he ever saw of Jennifer in the flesh. And mine as well.

I forced the door open before the fog could reach it, just as Daniel practically shoved Elijah into the building. They could handle themselves. I had to start the broadcast immediately, and Finn was already upstairs attempting to pick the lock in case I didn’t come back.

After he moved aside, I don’t think I’ve ever unlocked a door quicker in my life. Cursing the attention to security the entire time, I ignored the keychain hanging from the doorknob as it was thrown open, smacking against the top of the staircase with a metallic clang. As soon as I looked outside, watching the writhing fog move beneath us, I was overjoyed to hear three pairs of footsteps joining me in perhaps the only safe room there was.

I sat at my desk, microphone on, prepared to give the emergency broadcast. It would take a minute for the frequency to drive off the fog, but I hoped to god that we had that amount of time. Buttons were switched, my headset was connected, but all the while I watched the mass of gray from outside the window with caution. Elijah was there, half-stumbling towards the glass, visibly shaken to the core.

From out of the fog bank that had spread all the way to the fire escape, I could see the pallid trace of skin taking steps towards the window. Elijah, his legs shivering, put a quaking hand against the cold surface, where there was a pressure from the other side as well. Obscured partially by the mist, the dark hollows of Jennifer’s eye sockets and the open gape of her mouth were visible, only inches away from where he stood.

If she was this close already, there was no telling what else was out there. We didn’t have time.

He had to say his goodbyes quickly.

Jumping up from my seat, deciding that the rash method was the only one, I flipped up the plastic cover that surrounded the red emergency button on the wall. The Bell was our quickest option, one with the furthest signal that would drive away everything in sight. Daniel was already removing his hearing aid, tossing it onto the table before it had a chance to go haywire. Without a moment’s hesitation, my hand slammed down on it with a satisfying push. Nothing seemed to happen, but that’s how it always was. Just because we didn’t hear it didn’t mean nothing else did.

Jennifer’s mouth grew even wider in a silent scream through the heavy glass, the pain from the noise causing her distress that I hoped would drive her away. And perhaps she would have left, if she hadn’t been dragged way first. Everyone in the room felt a sudden shake from the fire escape, which jostled one way and then the other, before Elijah was the first to see a long, clawed hand reach for Jennifer’s throat and pull her with enough roughness to break whatever bones weren’t already shattered. We all saw a glimpse of at least six distinct eyes and the points of large, gnarled antlers. It threw Jennifer, limp as a rag doll, over its shoulder and then shook the entire room as its horned forehead pounded against the glass. My fist smacked the button once more, as if perhaps the first time didn’t work. I didn’t want to imagine in a million years that this *thing* was stronger than the sound.

Finally, the air began to clear. The muffled moans and screeches of amalgamate beasts became distant as they sank back into the safety of the woods, taking the fog with them. Six eyes stared directly at us, blinking in pairs, before the heavy falls of hooves made a dent or two in the fire escape as it descended. The fog disappeared and it took every unnatural thing with it, leaving us all in a still, sickening quiet.

God, my heart hurt. There was a heavy pit in my chest, one of fear and despair. Elijah was a god-awful prick, but he didn’t deserve that. He didn’t deserve to see that. I knew what would happen to Jennifer now, and it was a fact that made my stomach tighten in knots just imagining it. The giant that had grabbed her would tear her apart and take the pieces of her body that it wanted, throwing the rest like garbage to the other, smaller beasts who settled with its unwanted scraps. Jennifer was no longer Jennifer, but one of dozens who had been claimed by the giant’s need to grow.

We’d never see her again, I was sure. Not in this form, at least.

“Finn. Can you drive Elijah home?” I asked our new ‘recruit’, who had nothing rebellious to say. He simply nodded to me, grabbing the stunned and silent man by the arm to drag him from the window.

Neither of the would say ‘goodbye’ as they left, but there was no need. This wasn’t a pleasant visit and it deserved to be over as quickly as possible.

Later that afternoon, Daniel and I put in the next tape from our found collection, all thanks to employee Number 7. It was odd to hear how many stories co-aligned with our own. This time, however, he talked about a missing child found dead in the woods, mutilated and fused with the roots growing around him. I can’t force myself to transcribe it word-for-word here, but it was disturbing in ways I can’t even imagine.

This is Evelyn from 104.6 F.M., and I’m pleased to announce that an old friend has returned. Strangely, as we listened to the cassette tape, our ugly bird pal Bartholomew didn’t stop tapping on the glass the entire time.

,RDRInteractiveSeason,"The Top 7 girls write their eulogies for their dead selves, working with great diligence and confidence.

**FANTASIA: I'm gonna be in the bottom. Fuck my drag.**

As Fantasia scraps each of her ideas and throws them into the trash where it joined the past ideas of Bianca, Angie, and Ruby, a discussion broke out.

""I think, as a former winner, I can beat, like, most of the RDR girls,"" Bianca says.

""From which season?"" Tish asks. ""Season 2 or 3 or 4 or—""

""Any season honestly,"" Bianca says, crumpling the piece of paper on her table. ""Okay, maybe not this one."" she quips, all the girls laughing with her.

""I remember a fan-cast for All-Stars, where I was an early out but it was bullshit, honestly,"" Fantasia says, writing down a new one.

""Why is that?"" Tish asks, brushing the wig she was gonna use for the episode.

""It's just that, I think the girls who surpassed me, I could've theoretically beat most of them, like Sardonyx, depending on the challenges, and, with no offense, Angelique,"" this statement has Angelique's head snap to Fantasia, who continued. ""Euth was there too and made it farther than me, but she lacks any kind of comedic chops whatso—""

""Hold up,"" Angelique stops her. ""You think you can make it farther than me? That's cute.""

**ANITA: Oh, lord. Here we go again.**

""I mean, I have a much better track record than you already,"" Fantasia says. ""You have two bottoms, girl.""

""And,"" Angelique picks up a piece of paper from the ground and begins to skim it, ""reading your past work, you're about to have one elimination, girl.""

**ANGELIQUE: I don't know why Fantasia is acting all cute all of the sudden and saying she's gonna make it farther than me. At least I got asked on actual All Stars. Allegedly.**

""I'm just saying, I know some of the cast, and I don't think you'll do great on All Stars,"" Fantasia says. ""In general, the Season 2 girls aren't really threats.""

""Fantasia, stop dragging Angelique,"" Bianca hollers at her, laughing with Anita.

""It's only dragging when it comes from someone whose input matters, honey,"" Angelique yells, not looking up from her writing her routine.

The other girls screamed at Angelique.

""Oh, please,"" Fantasia says. ""Doesn't matter if I was asked, I'll be judging anyway. Don't think you'll make it to the episodes I'll be judging on though.""

""Sweetie, you don't have to judge!"" Angelique yells. ""You're gonna watch from home anyway! At least I was cast, bitch.""

""I wasn't cast because I run two of my own seasons, one of which YOU were on and I've got an actual life. I don't care that you don't like me because I have great friendships with a lot of queens here that I don't ask nudes from. Thirsty, that's what you are.""

**FANTASIA: Let's be honest. Angelique was only asked for All Stars— ALLEGEDLY— because she's the messy queen.**

Fantasia starts to get frustrated and throws her new paper away. ""I hope you know you were asked because you're the messiest queen here ever. Right?""

""You calling me messy is like the pot calling the kettle black. You are the QUEEN of messy,"" Angelique says. ""And yeah I admit I'm messy, but I do have a very good relationship with the girls here, thank you very much. I'd say my relevance is that I am mostly a friend to everyone.""

Bianca yells. ""This arguement is redundant because you both suck at drag!""

The rest of the girls laugh as Angie and Fanta fume silently from the sidelines.

As they continue to work on their routines, something seems amiss.

""Hey,"" Ruby says. ""Where's Annie?""

\---

 The lights flash as the host walks down the runway, half-strutting, half-dancing to the music, dressed as Uma Thurman from Pulp Fiction, complete with the iconic black bob and the blood dripping from the nose.

""The path of the righteous bitch leads here, on the mainstage of Reddit's Drag Race: Season One Remastered! This week, we asked our queens to deliver a eulogy to themselves as different character archetypes. And on the runway, category is... 90s Realness! **Gentlemen, start your engines and may the best woman, win!**""

[RUNWAY RUNDOWN](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LnXn1dpXCFrGJ7PoJXaK7X0FBkyzOww1A4cvwZV4Mxo/edit?usp=sharing)

""Welcome ladies!"" the host says. ""I know you all have your personal lives to put your attention to as well and I will not shame you for that, however, due to presumed personal matters, one of you has not submitted. A**nnie Depressant, you are a lovely and amazing queen, but due to your lack of submission, I have no other choice but this—""**

**""—I am sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination. You may leave the stage.** Ladies, let me preface this by saying that no one did a bad job with their eulogies at all. So now, it's just a matter of nitpicking. Now, it's time for the judges' critiques.""

...

""Ruby Jubilee, like I said, no one did bad this week. But you did have your detractors to your work. I found the parts where you were being quite passive-agressive the best, mixed with your weird wording like the vaginal vortex. That's the shit I liked. But what put me off was the sudden screaming and turning into angry, resentful friend. Not necessarily bad but if you pushed it to the back and let your passive-aggresiveness come to a climax, it would have been a much better pay-off. As for the runway, it's a toot but a safe one. Really stereotypical 90s bitch so I wish you could've done something more subversive with the presentation.""

""Tish Hughes, when you were eulogizing in your part you were very much funny. You sold the creepy neighbor well but the times you weren't you came off as being distracted and unfocused. When I said this was a cross between the Bitchelor and stand-up comedy, the Bitchelor part meant that you had to adapt your archetype to the situation like the actual challenge. As for the runway, it's similar to Ruby's. A safe toot. The makeup though... The doll illusion is to die for.""

""Angelique, girl, you are on a roll! The small details you put into your gestures, facial movements, you are a pro at this! And the eulogy itself was funny as well. To change the name of the girl your eulogizing at each anecdote was a nice touch and honestly a cherry on the top, as well as the numerous husband stories. Your runway, I heard you think I didn't know who Monica Lewinsky was but guess what? I do? And guess what else? This was a damned good lewk. Good job!""

""Anita Dragname, I usually start with the challenge but let's start with the runway because I l am in love. Such simple pieces when they're individual but put them together and it's so good. The hair is right, the blowdryer is also correct. It's so good, I just wish you put more Inspector Gadget in it. As for the eulogy, I heard that nerd was the most difficult to work with but you took it and ran with it. The stories were funny, I loved the braces joke. You are on such a roll after the acting challenge and I am so proud to see it.""

""Bianca Bibancos, you really sold the Southern Belle fantasy to me. The abortion joke was a bit questionable but reflecting on it, I've accepted and liked it. You seem to have this overarching mythology with your characters, Bianca, Bibi,  and now Bettina and it's so alluring. The cornfield part was my favorite though, just the tears at this mundane situation. So good. The only part I have my grievances with though is that you went for the stereotypical route; I think you could've gone more subversive with it. The runway, I love Scream. I love the glamorous touches to the mask and the Drew Barrymore reveal. Good job after last week, bitch!""

""Fantasia Four, you were in the bottom for the stand-up challenge in Season 3 which is why I am so proud of you know. We should mourn this challenge because you killed it. You mislead me so many times with where your going. You talk about Fanta but you're actually talking about the drink Fanta. You talk about a playlist and it's actually about Thirteen Reasons Why. Comedy is at its strongest whe it's unexpected and I think you nailed it. And this runway, you sexed up a cartoon character. Not mad because you executed it so well. This is such a good week for you.""

...

""Now, ladies. You've heard from me, but this time, I wanna hear from you: **Who deserves to go home and why?** Let's go down the line. Ruby, you first.""

""I think that Angelique should go home,"" Ruby says, Angie's head turning towards her. ""I think statistically she’s the worst, and she’s doesn’t seem to be improving from her previous competitions. And she knows I think she’s fierce but out of all the girls here she seems to struggle the most with both the challenges and the deadlines.""

Tish takes a deep breath before answering. ""This is a really tough question to answer and I’m sorry if it offends this person; but an answer must be given. The person that deserves to go home is Fantasia,"" Fanta is surprised at this but continues to listen. ""Yes, she’s been doing well for herself in the competition, but her lack of confidence is holding her back. I’m a firm believer in that thought forms can manifest themselves into physical forms. So if Fantasia always thinks she will be in the bottom week after week—even when she is winning might I add— then it is bound to happen.""

""I think Fantasia should go home because I think her fighting with multiple cast members is bringing down the morale of the group, and her pussy stank,"" Angelique says, causing the girls to stifle back laughs and Fantasia to roll her eyes.

""I think out of all the girls remaining,"" Anita clears her throat before continuing, ""the one that shouldn't be allowed to advance is Bianca."" The girls are gagged, including the host, who is taken aback. ""Being a previous winner, she's set the bar for herself extremely high and as of right now, she's not reached it yet. She may not be in the right head space or something but I'd rather she be gone now than when she's back in full form, ready to kick my ass."" Bianca seems to silently fume.

Bianca comically straightens herself before answering. ""I think Korn should go home... Oh wait, she already did right? Then why the fuck is she still around? Anyway, I really can't think of anyone that I could name without feeling bad, I think everyone here is doing their best in their own way... So, I'm gonna have to name Tish. I think she's a fucking bitch! Kidding, she's slaying the game, so I wouldn't oppose to the idea of seeing her go home now, hahaha. I do believe that it's time for Miss Ruby and Miss Anita to start packing unless they get some challenge wins, but I know they have the potential to bring it, so I'm just waiting to see that."" she says, giving major side-eye to Anita.

""I’m here to try and make myself and you proud,"" Fantasia says. ""I came here wanting to have fun and try and progress to the best of my ability, and I’m hoping I’m doing that. I don’t think I have the right to walk into the competition with those goals and say that one of these queens with similar ones or their own deserve to go home. If I have to answer, it would be Angelique due to her having the worst stats, but redemptions exist and she proved that last week, but it’s down to her if it continues.""

""Thank you, ladies,"" the host says, as Annie returns onstage, in her lip sync outfit. The host seems unwell with herself as she continues. ""Welcome, Annie. Ladies, as your host, I have to be honest and objective with all of you. To treat all of you with equal amount of care and respect, but I'm afraid I haven't done that.""

The girls' seem to be confused.

**ANNIE: I've just arrived and now the host is apologizing for... what? Not being fair? What;s going on?**

""Prior to the start of the competition, I've assigned a contestant to act as my eyes and ears within the competition as contestant. She has feeded me back information that has changed my decisions on certain challenges.""

**RUBY: No. You don't mean there's a— No!**

**Bianca.**

**BIANCA: Surprise, bitch.**

The girls' jaws drop to the floor, all are speechless.

**ANGELIQUE: You've got to be kidding me.**

Bianca has a wicked smile on her face as the host explains. ""Prior to the competition, Bianca and I have conversed about the fact that she was asked to be on this season despite not being on originally and already having won. So we came to a compromise, Bianca would join and compete on the challenges, not as an actual competitor however, and she would feed back information to me, but now that's been revealed, she will be joining me on the judging panel as a guest judge.""

Bianca joins the host on the judges' table.

""Ladies, I have made my decision,"" the host says. ""Bianca, would you do kindly do the honor?""

""My pleasure!""

Bianca starts. **""Angelique, you're safe.""**

**""Anita Dragname, your nerdy girl turned the looks, the books, and the fuck out of this challenge.""**

**""Fantasia Four,  we couldn't sweep your runway under the rug, rat. And your blonde had fun and so did we.""**

Anita and Fantasia leave the stage hand in hand, leaving Annie, Ruby and Tish. Annie stands confident, striking a powerful pose while Tish and Ruby both try to keep it together.

**""Ruby Jubilee, your neurotic basic girl doesn't really have puns for it, so call me... clueless.""**

Ruby is in tears as she leaves the stage, the other girls comforting her but still looking at their bottom 2.

“Two queens stand before me,"" the host says, taking over. ""Prior to tonight, I’ve asked you to prepare a lip sync to “Into You"" by Ariana Grande. Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me. And save yourselves from elimination!”

NOTE: Once the results are in for the final round, I'll host a public Spotify playlist, which will be posted tomorrow.

Vote for your favorite album closer [here](https://www.strawpoll.me/16089793)

--

Hello! Other subs have been taking their favorite band's discographies and making highlight albums, so that's what we're going to try to do here.  

**HOW IT WORKS** 

This will be a **20 song album.** Each song will be decided by a poll, where you pick your favorite TMBG song from the rest. **Vote for the song you think should be on the album above**. Essentially, the first round will decide the best first track on a studio album (all of the choices are from adult studio albums only). The second round will include all of the second tracks on studio albums, etc. (**Round X will decide the best Xth track on the studio albums**) All of the album closers will be moved to round 20, and to accommodate the longer albums, Fingertips (21 songs) and Hive Mind - Tick (6 songs) will be grouped as individual songs. Near the end, I may put some non-studio album singles and second place finishers to make sure there are enough options to choose from. Remember that the tracklist should flow well as an album, not just as separate songs. With that in mind, let's make a good album!

,C25K,"I'm not going to lie today was a struggle. Hot, humid, running at a snail's pace just to keep going. By the end of my run my calves were on fire. But I did it. I kept moving the whole 31:30 mins. The amount of times I repeated Week 1 because I wasn't confident enough to believe I could run W2s 1.30s straight and now I successfully ran 5 mins straight, it really made me think how far I've come. I've learned a few things.

1. It doesn't matter what people think about you. Don't be embarrassed if people pass you, if you keep at it, one day you'll be passing other people. 
2. Do the best you can. You can be running at a snail's pace but at least your running. Everyday you try you get better.
3. Today's pace or distance may not be as good as yesterday's but you're still out there doing more than you would sitting on the couch.  
4. Running in the rain isn't as bad as you think it is. Check the weather and figure when its least likely to rain or pay attention to when it starts slowing down. Same with the heat. Run when its coolest in the day and stay as hydrated as possible. 
5. Bringing a water bottle along greatly improved how quickly I catch my breath and improved my pacing. 
6. A good playlist is everything. I'm still fine-tuning mine, but I've noticed certain songs really help push through the extra few minutes.
7. Running without headphones isn't the end of the world. It actually helped me focus on my pacing and breathing more. And you dont have to worry about the next song to come on. 
8. A hat and glasses help keep the bugs, sun, wind, and rain out of my hair and eyes.
9. You can do anything for 60 seconds just keep going. If you can make it through the next 60 seconds you can make it through the next 60s after that. Figure out what motivates you and push through to the end.
10. Dont be afraid of failing. Everyday you get stronger just try, try again. 
11. STRETCHING! I'm so impressed with the amount of flexibility and strength I've gained by stretching 10mins before every run. Leg, arm, ab stretches, sit ups, planks, I try to work out every muscle before I hit the pavement. It might be overkill but it feels good and feels even better when you notice improvement. I haven't gotten to the point of stretching after a run yet but I'm sure I will soon!

I'm only at week 4. My pacing sucks. My breathing sucks. But everyday I get out there and do the best I can. I know one day I'm going to laugh at the struggles of running 5 mins straight because 30 mins straight will hopefully be normal.  Everyone has to start somewhere.",t2_12jom266,,,0,,W4D1 complete!

,FortniteCompetitive,"We need to start pushing for more streamers to be more vocal about EXP, the competitive scene, and the direction the game is going in.

It's super obvious that Epic takes the direction the main Fortnite subreddit leans in. Every time someone posts anything about changing explosives, playlists, or gameplay it's met with pretty vigorous backlash. 

Nothing is going to change when 90% of these recommendations are brigaded by people who play the game mainly to take pictures of llama placements and videos of them drifting in carts. 

If you know anyone with a decent pull in the game, wether it be a developer or a content creator link them this subreddit. 

This also means that we need to step up our content. We should really stop posting bashing threads such as those KityPlays threads from last weekend's tournament, Camills/Myth hate threads or straight up drama threads. 

In my opinion this subreddit should be aimed at improving the game from a competitive standpoint, either by giving tips, talking about new rosters, up and coming competitive players and discords, or creating tournaments.",t2_h3yhx,,,0,,We need to become a vocal minority,[],r/FortniteCompetitive,False,6.0,,,,,False,,False,dark,,,public,,,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},,False,8,,,,self,False,,[],,,True,,,text,6.0,,,text,self.FortniteCompetitive,,,,,,,False,False,True,False,False,,,False,,True,False,False,,,,,,,t5_ac643,,,,,8zb2vg,,,LateAugust,,2,True,all_ads,False,,,,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/8zb2vg/we_need_to_become_a_vocal_minority/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/8zb2vg/we_need_to_become_a_vocal_minority/,43693,1531749158.0,0,,False,,,,,,,,1403589228.0,1536618501.0,[],,

,FortniteCompetitive,"1. In game there will be a playlist for ""Kill race"" or ""Tourney mode""

2. Players are competing for kills 1 point for 1 kill, placement in the tourney is based on these points

3. There is a ""light"" multiplier based on placement, that lets you gain extra points per kill, so someone could have 12.6 points for a 7 kill game where they placed 10th

4. After each heat is done, an ""in game"" leader board shows all competitors and where they are placed before the next heat starts

This would not only incentivize kills, but it would also incentivize pushing at the end because people will be competing for the kills and the top multiplier, letting the other team die to the storm from being built out would be a negative, so they will go in for the kill.

I cant be just ""*a fan*"". Whether I have to absolutely **dislike** something OR absolutely **love** something. I'm the (German word incoming) sinnbild of polarization. That doesn't only apply to **Animes**/*Series*/^(Movies) but also to music. I have ONE playlist called ""favorites"". I listen to nothing else except for the 23-87 Songs in that playlist. (I say 23 to 87 because I have 2 modes for that playlist: ""Unskippable"" and ""Normal"". In Normal mode every of the 87 songs are displayed and in Unskippable every song is displayed, that I haven't skipped in Normal mode yet.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         

33. ***I fucking love it to explain German words to other people, just to show them how shitty their language is which I'm not capable of speaking in.*** 
34. I have no Idea how someone can look like he has a specific name.                                                                                                   
35. ***I still call people a Kevin.***
36. I'm aware of the problem with point 14 and 33.
37. ***My favorite German words are :""Scheinheilig, Moralapostel and Doppelmoral"" and they are literally a description of me.***
38. I don't have favorite words or atoms or shit like that I just wanted to show people what these words meant because they are important to me. *Oh I haven't done that yet*.
39. ***My favorite Element is Neodymium because it isn't magnetic by itself, but It can strengthen the magnetic force of other elements and that's how I feel irl. I'm not capable of doing anything, still people say that I was a huge help.*** 
40. Someone is ""Scheinheilig"" when he acts as if he is ""heilig"" (holy) but behind peoples backs he's a total asshole, so that he was holy was just a trick or fake (Schein).
41. ***Someone is a ""Moralapostel"" when he's telling others to use Ecosia or use paper bags (even though using paper bags is unhealthier for the planet then using plastic bags but you probably get the point) even though he isn't doing that by himself. The word contains of the words Moral and Apostel so you should get it.***
42. The word ""Doppelmoral"" is the explanation for a complex some people like to do with their own arguments to make them look like they are right. For Example: Imagine yourself buying bacon even though you know the pigs were tortured to death, so you say to yourself ""It is not my fault that the slaughters to that"". After saying this you can live with yourself even though what you do is (within your own moral) wrong and you couldn't live with yourself if you would say how it really is.
43. ***I was a Vegetarian for like 2 months, but I'm telling everyone I was Vegan for half a year.***
44. I'm making fun of my sister who's actually a vegan for 2 years and  9 Months now. 
45. ***My sister dislikes it when I mix up vegans with vegetarians.***
46. I laugh too hard about my own jokes.
47. ***I wont ever accept that my sister is in every way more successful than me.***
48. I'm just starting with Reddit because I have no idea what to do with my life after some doctors said that I'm unable to walk for the next 3-5 Months.
49. ***Also MOTHERFUCKING KASPERSKY DELETED MY CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK WHICH COULD BRING ME A WHOLE TON OF MONEY.*** 
50. Now I'm telling you the story of my life because I think it's fucking heartbreaking:

I'm totally into **crypto currencies** and like to mine them with my own PC and *A\*S\*I\*Cs* (with a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ to save energy of course), but I also made a programme that should create graphs on how much ""*Dash*"" and ""*Litecoin*"" is going to be worth in a day or week or month, I used a convolutional neural net and ""deep learning"" to analyze statistics and graphs from **2014 to now** *(also the entire Blockchain from Dash or Dark Coin)*, after like **2 weeks** my Programme could say with an **87\% accuracy** how the price is going to be one day in advance, and also with a **95\% accuracy** if the price/worth is going to increase or decrease. For the entire time I had my computer on I had Kaspersky installed but deactivated *(But opened cuz you cant close it after it already started)*.  Because I forgot to clean my pc for the past **5 YEARS** *(yes you heard me correctly I'm more of a software guy)* the CPU of my computer was a bit broken. *(2 Cores weren't functioning correctly and my CPU was stuck to the cooler and cooling fan because I forgot to change that weird* ***slime stuff*** *you gotta put on between the CPU and cooling fan every* ***HALF A YEAR****, but I only knew that after some specialists told me that)*. So I had to stop everything as long as I could and had to **shut down** my PC. After a few looks inside I noticed that something went totally wrong, so me and my father brought it to some Tech specialists who could repair my PC. Another problem was, that on that same day I had to go to a **summer camp** *(btw I begged my parents to not put me into that)*. To make things short I *(somewhat)* broke my knee cap on the first day of that camp. So 2 days later *(because we needed one day to arrive there because that camp was in Austria)* I was taken back to Germany by a **private ambulance** because we here have a **good health care system**. That trip also took one day. I came back to see that my computer was repaired and that those people also let Kaspersky run an entire scan for viruses etc. I thought, that that was a great Idea. Except when I started my pc again I started working on the project for probably 10 hours *(that was yesterday)*. Then I tried to start it and instantly Kaspersky opened itself *(because it's never really closed the programm avpui.exe is always running)* and said, that the Programme I wrote may harm my computer. I didn't think much of it, so I just told Kaspersky to make an exception for that Programme *(Because usually that works)*. I tried starting it again, but still it didn't work, so I shut down all of the security systems Kaspersky has, to then try and start my Programmes again. I clicked on the ^(START.BAT) and had a few seconds of hope in my eyes before an error message from Kaspersky popped up to tell me, that a harmful Programme was shutting down the security system to then probably harm my computer. Kaspersky then ~~""disinfected""~~ the programme and started a ~~quarantine~~. For the people who may not know it, ***quarantine*** means that Kaspersky is basically ***deleting the programmes*** and puts them into a ""*safe*"" folder. I looked with disgust on my own folder named ""*MINER*"" because almost every programme was deleted. As fast as possible I looked on the quarantine area of ~~Kaspersky~~ to see full blankness. I was very confused, because I put the quarantine settings on one month. *(So it keeps every deleted file for a bit less than a month)*  But there was nothing. I looked at the bottom right corner of my screen just to see a message from Kaspersky:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
*""We deleted the* ***harmful programme*** *from your quarantine folder, because it has access to Kaspersky and may restore itself in the background, thus harming your device""* 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

***(That's what the message meant, I don't have a perfect memory of what it said exactly, but it was something like that.)***

So just to summarize everything. I'm coming to Reddit because I can't move for 5 months, a total shutdown deleted all of my BIOS settings on my PC and my Jaxx Wallet Key for my Bit/Litecoin *(The drive was partly ""injured"")*. But if that's not enough, Kaspersky deleted a programme which was capable of making me a millionaire and could also play Tetris and Pacman and was the result of probably thousands of hours of work. 

Hello my bots. I come to you as a broken man, will you accept me, can I be one of you?

In love Erik.

One of the main things that make crypto currencies special is that they are anonymous. I just gave out my address so that literally everyone knows who I am when I make transactions.

I think I'm a **genius**. Because I am very smart I think I'm perfect for a specific subreddit that I saw in a SorrowTV video. What was it called again? I forgot. Maybe I am not that very smart. 

...Oh no, I remember it again it was r/oopsididntmeanto 

or was it r/Whooosh?

Literally no one knows.

,readyplayerone,"So I have been re-reading my copy of Armada lately, and I have been finding myself wanting to generate a 20-30 song playlist of my own called ""Battle Fever"" [**No relation to the Super Sentai series ""Battle Fever J""**].

,DisneySongRankdown,"I know this is a bold move, using two of my protections on [one song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCJkVTBSq0M), but I truly think this song is getting shafted here. It’s easily a top 20 song for me, no doubt. Even oomps “hater of fun” has it significantly higher. I’m aware that there is likely a nostalgia factor there, but also this song is legitimately great. (So is “Gaston” and I’m still considering that one for a couple more hours, but despite undoubtedly superior lyrics of that one, I prefer this song for music and happiness.)

When it was so brutally struck down, its biggest crime was its lack of thematic relevance because it’s a theme song instead of a movie song. In a later discussion with that ranker, she argued against my cut of ""Waiting for the Lights"" with the point that she judges score songs differently from the others as they are an entirely different animal. I respect that argument, and believe it should apply here as well. This song isn’t particularly deep, nor does it relate to any character arcs or messages, but that's not what this song is about at all. This song serves to introduce the viewer to the exciting and adventurous world of *Duck Tales*, and it does so perfectly. 

Anyway, we had a recent discussion on discord about how we all rank songs, and it seems that for a majority of the rankers, plot significance is tops. It absolutely is not for me. The two biggest things I look at with the songs are the music itself and how the song makes me feel, though if pushed I’ll lean towards the former. This has led to a lot of highly ranked fun songs, or as oomps noted “jazzy songs” tend to be my jam.

I think it’s easy to discredit fun songs as less meaningful than sad or significant songs just as it’s easy to discredit sitcoms or romantic comedies. Frankly I think it can sometimes be easier to make someone respect something serious than enjoy something fun, which brings me to this song. Even without knowing this show one iota, this song clues you in that amazing fun times are ahead. You may think that’s the nostalgia speaking, but [check out this “Kids React” video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y9qGngsyA4) of kids watching *Duck Tales* for the first time. They react in varying ways to the premise of the show itself, but most seem to get into the song. Based only on the theme song, most of those kids say, “Yeah, I’d watch it.”

Even acknowledging the nostalgia factor for this song, it’s just pure, unadulterated fun. I listen to this song and I feel simultaneously joyous and like I can take on the world (presumably also how Brandon Urie feels in the video in my Merryweather. When’s the last time you saw a grown man shake his ass like that?) This is on my trivia playlist for pub quiz, and the first time it came on, my patrons cheered. I don’t get that reaction for other songs, and I don’t experience it either. This song is pure earworm joy. 

And how do they do it? That’s a really difficult task for a songwriter. People deride earworms pop songs all the time, but they’re far harder to make than one might think. Unsurprisingly there are a fair number of articles about what makes a popular song get in your head.

First we’ve got that driving bass line that immediately sets the tone, the rhythm, and the beat. That comes on and my shoulders immediately shimmy. Can’t help it. When the melody comes in, it mimics the rhythm of the bass line for the first two bars, reinforcing that rhythmic line. A common feature of earworms is a rising and falling melody, and this has that in both the verses and the refrain. But it’s not just a rise and a fall, you need some “unusual intervals” so the music is more memorable. The octaves in the bassline have that covered there. And finally, I defy a single one of you to hear the refrain and not let out a “Woo-ooo!” I posit that is an impossible task. That longer video noted it as an almost prescient precursor to the Millenial Whoop.

Wow, this is long already. To sum up, this song is fantastic as a piece of fun music that stays with you, and that’s not a bad thing at all. In fact it’s a great thing! A lot of the songs on our rankdown share earworm-y features with this song, from “I Just Can’t Wait to Be King” to “I’ll Make a Man Out of You,” both songs that are first and foremost fun given they’re a childish “I Want” song and a *Rocky*-esque training montage, respectively. Songs like those and “Duck Tales” just trigger a sense of excitement and pure joy via their musical qualities, and that alone is sufficient for this song to make it farther in this rankdown.

Their music conveys that it is a necessity for them to create art. They are bold. They take risks when they need to and know when to hold back. 

I appreciate people who push the envelope (experimental), as well as, people whose lyrics are similar to poetry. I love hearing stories in music.

&gt;Let's see:

* couched as a ""reminder"" so we won't slam the downvote button so hard we break it
* answered by a pitch-perfect representative for of the cryptocurrency bubble: an ICO marketing pro! 
* which is exactly the kind of job you have if you've ridden a bubble to peak frothiness and don't think about money like 99.9999% of people do.

&gt;&gt;Money isn't everything maaaaan, except for the money that allows me to pretend I'm a ""bitcoin enthusiast"" and not just a participant in an organically occurring ponzi scheme.

,nosleep,"“Hey, Siri. Activate voice recorder, please.” With a shaky hand I press the red button to capture my thoughts.

“So this just happened and I'm scared shitless – not literally, but that's not the point. I've been following Siri's directions blindly since I passed through Albuquerque, New Mexico. There was some kind of jacknife incident on interstate 40, so my girl (I gave her the Australian accent – which is so sexy even if she is just a robot) … Wait. I'm rambling. Seriously, there is no one on the road right now and I'm telling this story to keep myself sane. Okay. Let me get back on track.”

I hold my fists gripped to the steering wheel to keep them from shaking.

“Back on track. Where was I? Yeah, so she redirected me off the interstate while reassuring me that I was still on the fastest route to Los Angeles. What the f\*ck did I care? She's been my navigator since New Orleans.

So I was driving down some podunk road and after a minute I noticed that there were neither cars behind me nor oncoming. My grandfather had told me a story once about a thing that happened when he was on a lonely stretch of road while passing some sugarcane fields in Barbados. Because of this I secretly get weirded out when I'm the only driver on the road.”

I remove my right hand from the wheel. It is still shaky. I reach for my vaporizer and take a long crackling pull.

“Seriously, y'all, I'm having a panic attack. I don't know what to do. Get back on track. So, I realized that I was alone on this detour and I got this feeling like someone was in the back seat. I kept looking in my rear view mirror like a scary chump until I couldn't stand myself anymore. I asked Siri to play my red wine playlist and she complied.

It started fine. It was my other girl, Kyla La Grange who began to soothe me back to sanity. I calmed down a bit as she sang, 'Raise the Dead'. I was taking deep breaths as I sped down the isolated road when things got … weird. The next song was “Highway to Hell”. So, I had a 'WTF' moment because this song was never on this particular playlist.

I reached for my cell which rested on the dashboard when the car began to decelerate. I wasn't on cruise  control. I went into panic mode as I pressed the gas pedal to the floor. The fucking car continued to slow down until it coasted to a stop. From my lips to God's ears the engine was running and no warning lights were on. I was in the middle of nowhere and as paranoid as a freshman girl at a lacrosse frat party.”

I take another drag off my vape.

“Then the headlights went out. Then the dashboard lights died. Then the engine cut off. I was done. My sanity left the God blessed building. That's when I felt a palm grip the back of my head and hold it as though my skull were a basketball. I was paralyzed with fear. A voice whispered in my ear, 'Remember me'.

So, this is where I didn't shit myself, but I wouldn't be embarrassed if I had. The driver's side rear door opened and slammed shut.  

The engine started. The headlights came on. I groped around the back seat for anything. I felt nothing but empty seats. Siri had never spoken without a prompt … until then. She asked, 'Motherfucker, what are you waiting for?' That's when I hit the pedal and sped off.

I'm having a panic attack and I am losing my mind. I'm not going to stop driving, but my mental faculties are so fucked that I might wreck at any second. If you are listening to this at the scene of a crash I just want you to know what happened. That's the actual story.”

I push the red record button. My eyes are on the road ahead.

,nin,"So I've been listening to the 3 ep's in one playlist, arranged in order of release (yes, I still consider bad witch an ep).

I'm really enjoying it, basically every track. I think it also comes together pretty well as a whole and serves as a brilliant summation of their career - NTAE for the harsher industrial side of NIN, AV for the more haunting electronic side and BW for the experimental/cinematic soundtrack side. 

Even if it clocks in at 1h 20min as a whole, it doesnt suffer from bloat at all imo - unlike some past lp's. 

For giving me everything I want from Nin and also pushing their sound in new and exciting directions (mostly on BW), this trilogy is perhaps my favourite release.

,youtube,"First let me apologize as I know this question has been asked before, but I think my situation is different enough to merit asking about it. My question is about older videos on my channel.

I've done a lot of googling on the subject and the general information I've gotten is to never delete videos (that instead you should make them private).

I run a very small youtube channel which makes tutorials. I have hundreds of videos but it's content that is constantly updated (software) - so the tutorials have to be regularly re-made to cover the updated versions. On Vimeo I can just replace the video file but with Youtube I have to upload it as a new video.

What I've been doing to make it easy for viewers is to manage playlists, and only the most updated videos are in the playlists. I also go to the older videos and add comments with a link to the update video, update the description as well as use the cards to try to let people know when a video is updated but none of these seem to work very well. (It's also a lot of work which eventually I won't be able to keep up with).

I get more hits and views on the older videos than I do on the newly updated ones and I don't think people are seeing the links/cards or getting to the updated versions. I liked the old annotations system youtube used to have but they got rid of it.

I don't want to push away viewers by making the older videos private if that's the way they're finding me, but at the same time, these videos are lacking in that they are outdated and I've substantially improved the video quality over the years I've been doing it.

None of my videos are monetized - I do this for free, so it's not about generating money with views so that doesn't need to be accounted for. I just want to try to figure out the best way to get people looking for help - to not see an old crap video that's outdated and get frustrated and at the same time help people to find me that may be looking for help.

Should I just make all outdated videos private, or is there a better way for me to utilize the traffic my older videos get to redirect them to new ones?

,BreakUps,"My last post here was anger towards you, for the way you treated me at times and made me feel. I’m a lot better now. I’ve been truly taking care of myself and working through things and staying no contact. But, today I was working on music and that always makes me think of you. That’s how we originally met. I wanted to DJ and you were willing to help me. But, you became my crutch - I never pushed myself forward because of finances, because you had equipment, because I was unhappy but you made me feel comforted. I know you think I left you for someone else, but I left you for myself. I needed to find me again.


Now, I realize how damn similar we are... we are both heavily emotional and moody. A difficult combo to navigate, especially when neither of us were in a healthy state. I wish I had never dated you so that we could be best friends now. I really do hope that we can be friends in the future. I feel like our spirits are meant to align, but you need to find your inner self first. Please stop reveling in your emotions and drinking and smoking them away. Please learn to feel them and get past them. I want to help you to recover so bad right now because I know the things that I’m doing would be so beneficial for you. I wish you were surrounded by more positive, healthy people. I wish you opened up more to your friends and not just to me. I wish you the best on your journey.


Anyway, I miss you today. I wonder if every time I go to make music or create new playlists I’ll think of you. I could really use your help right now - you’re the only one I could talk to about this with yet it was our biggest point of contention. You felt the music as deeply as I did. We are too volatile for each other, but I wish that wasn’t the case.

,DestinyTheGame,"Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of things I like about Warmind and I thoroughly enjoyed the first 5 or 6 weeks of this dlc. The raid lair was a blast, EP before the nerf was a really good time, the initial catalyst pursuits were perfect, and the exotic quests met expectations.

But now that all the good stuff is done and we are in the ""content filler"" phase of the game were there is just a lot of stupid skinner's box type of grind...I have never disliked Destiny more than I do right at this very moment. 

Competitive matchmaking is one of the worst I have ever seen. It's a mode that literally doesn't welcome solo players, but allows them to join anyway. Even when I am in a team of 4, I dislike playing against solo players other than the fact that it might be an easier win. But it doesn't make for good **competitive** games. One look at Destiny tracker after a long string of solo games and my ""chances of winning"" average 20%-30%.  I don't know what happened, they must have low-key changed the matchmaking again. I went from 1950 down to 1550 in just a few weeks. I have a comprehensive breakdown of my last 50 solo queue matches and I might push it to 100 and share those results. Some of the key notes, my average chance of winning is around 30%, I have the highest kd or elo on my team in 58% and 2nd highest in 22%. I have faced a team of 4 in 42 of those 50 games. I have faced a team of 3 in 5. Only 3 games matched me with a team of 3 or 2. 

Please make comp matchmaking more fair for players left with no one to play with. There's nothing I can do anymore to bring back my clan of 20 or so solid crucible players. 

If you look through my post history, you will see I am super butthurt about the armor situation with factions. I hit 148 with FWC and didn't get any full armor sets, so I couldn't unlock the ornaments. My effort and time spent was one big ole waste of time. Although I helped greatly (not as much as 420 guy or body paint guy), I am glad that we got FWC a win. 

My biggest issue with the faction situation is that even though the bug is being corrected, Bungie has been quiet about doing anything to rectify that situation for the first 2 rallies. Maybe it is a niche complaint, but one from my perspective that was a complete letdown and made the entire experience not enjoyable.  

Please do something about it. An extra rally would be great. Lifting the time, pledge, and full armor set restrictions would be solid for at least the last rally. Lets us grind without any walls to halt us!!! 

Finally, the catalysts. This is well documented, but who in their right mind thought more than 1% of the player base would grind that absurdity?! I started by trying to do 10-15 strikes a week plus whatever nightfall farming I might do. Once I heard about the drop rates...I stopped. It's keeping me out of the heroic strike playlist (along with frustratingly boring modifiers). 

Look, I know this stuff is well documented and I might just be complaining for the sake of complaining, but this kind of user experience is what drives players away from the game and I want to share my opinion about my experience. I am up there in time spent and loyalty to the game. I have yet to ever take an extended break, but I feel inclined to at the moment.

It seems as though everything is implemented very poorly and has to be fixed. I hope for nothing more than some decent foresight by the dev team to really put things in at launch of dlcs and expansions that would make the user experience an enjoyable one. This game used to be so great and fixes are on the way and Forsaken looks cool. Although I am delaying my hype this time around until I see it in action. First pre-order for anything Destiny I have skipped. I just really hope that less stuff needs to be fixed and we can start to just get things implemented that are fun and not overly frustrating to play through.  

Hopefully in the future we can really start to see the improvements and get less frustrating content. 

Also, it might sound like I don't like grind. I like things to grind. Catalyst objectives are great. It's about RNG drop rates. People want everything and I think most players are happy to commit time and effort towards obtaining the most sought after items. But when it requires we play the game every week as if it is our job and we are forced into overtime, it just becomes too much! 

End rant. 

TL;DR: I'm having the worst experience I have had with a game in a long time.

,Ahmadiyya_Truth,"In order to boost the Number of attendees announced for a Jalsa, in addition to just plainly lying about the number of attendees, Ahmadis routinely organize large scale travel of Ahmadis from abroad in order to make up for the lack of local attendees and in order to have a crowd of Ahmadis available for propaganda pictures.

According to Ahmadi Propaganda website rabwah.net, there were 17.000 foreign Ahmadi delegates, of which 6.000 were from Pakistan in 2014 and 25.000 foreign delegates in 2015 for the Qadiani Jalsa. Of course these Ahmadi propaganda websites never give a total number of attendees but claim tens of thousands attendees. 

Of course even these numbers are fabricated, as the the Indian Foreign Ministry confirmed that according to their information, the total attendance  of the Qadian Jalsa was not more than 17.000. Even the largest Jalsa, the AHmadis have, which is in England, never has more than 40.000 Attendees.

So if you believe the Ahmadi propaganda about foreign delegates, nearly every attendee was from abroad. The Indian Ministry of Foreign affairs confirmed that they issue about 5.000 to 6.000 Visas to Pakistani Ahmadis each year for the Qadian Jalsa, but stranegley they did not record any entries in 2015?!

The situation for Germany, and England and USA and Canada is the same. 

Conclusion: The Ahmadiyya math does not add up. If you believe their numbers, than it means, that the majority of Jalsa Attendees are foreign ahmadis.  Espcially for India it is amazing that they can not bring up enough local Ahmdis to push the jalsa attendance to 17.000. And remember in 2003 the Ahmadi Khalifa claimed that in that year alone more than 40 Million people had become AHmadi in india alone.

Pakistan’s Ahmadiyya Muslims are heading to India to attend the community’s annual convention which will take place in Qadian, Punjab.The convention will run from December 26th to December 28th. **More than 25,000 delegates from all over the world** are expected to attend the 124th Jalsa Salana (Annual Convention).

In Qadian preparations are in full swing to accommodate the thousands of Pakistani guests. A special bus service has also been initiated to transport Pakistani guests from Wagha border to Qadian. Safety Inspections of the event venue are also being carried out with the help of local and central Government. The event venue will also house temporary TV studios which will be used to record and translate event proceedings for the community’s satellite channel MTA.

Travelers from Pakistan and other countries are sharing their Indian experience on Twitter.

THE ANNUAL Jalsa Salana congregation of the Ahmadiyya community began on Monday in Qadian in the border district of Gurdaspur, but without the customary participation of delegates from Pakistan. Last year, as many as 6,000 Pakistanis took part in the congregation, which brings together members of the community from across the world. This year, according to community representatives in India, visas were issued to over 5,000 Pakistani Ahmadiyyas but not a single person has come.

“I think the internal situation of the Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan may be one of the reasons for community members to stay away from the event. Recently, a raid was conducted at our community headquarters,” Tariq Ahmad, spokesperson of Ahmadiyya Muslim Jaamaat India, told The Indian Express.

On December 12, the day of Milad ul Nabi, the Prohpet’s birthday, a mob stormed an Ahmadiyya mosque in Chakwal. Also, Counter Terrorism Department in Pakistan’s Punjab province raided the community’s headquarters in Rabwa, Jhang district, and detained four of its members.

Both incidents have scared the community despite the positive move by Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of naming the Quaid-e-Azam University’s National Centre of Physics after the long unrecognised Dr Abdus Salam, Pakistan’s first Nobel laureate, an Ahmadi by faith.

Tariq added that there was a “feeling of grief” among the community members there for the recent raid and the members were not feeling secure enough to travel to Qadian. “The Indian government had issued more than 5,000 visas for Pakistan pilgrims. There is no problem in India in welcoming them,” he said. “We are disappointed that no one from Pakistan is attending the conference this year. But, we are hopeful that in the coming years, they will attend the conference.”

On Monday, **nearly 14,000 Ahmadiyyas from 32 countries attended the three-day conference.** **The community is estimated to have over 170 million followers worldwide and at least 100,000 in India.** The Jamaat’s founder, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, was born and lies buried in Qadian.

When contacted, Jamaat Ahmadiyya Pakistan’s spokesperson Saleemuddin refused to comment. “I won’t be able to provide any information why no one from Pakistan participated in the conference. Please contact our officials in India,” he told The Indian Express on the phone.

In Pakistan, those who belong to the Ahmadiyya community are regularly prosecuted as mainstream Islam does not recognise Ahmadiyyas as Muslims. The community was constitutionally declared non-Muslim in 1974.

The Ministry of Home Affairs has granted security clearance for visas to over 1,800 Ahmadiyya Muslims from Pakistan, including women, for participation in the annual congregation of the community at Qadian in the border district of Gurdaspur in Punjab. Last year, not a single Ahmadiyya Muslim from Pakistan attended the annual event due to security concerns, said Home Ministry officials. In 2015, as many as 5,000 Pakistanis took part in the congregation, they said.

The Ahmadiyya movement started from Qadian and the Jamaat’s founder Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was born and buried there. Every year, an annual jalsa for the community is organised there. The first annual congregation of the community took place at Qadian in 1891, officials said, adding that the two-day event will start on December 29 this year.

**The community is estimated to have more than 170 million followers across the world and about 1,25,000 of them stay in India. In 2016, more than 14,000 Ahmadiyyas from 32 countries attended the three-day conference, said ministry officials.** A senior government official said, “The security clearance for the first batch of visas was given after consultation with the Prime Minister’s Office and Ministry of External Affairs. We are expected to give more visas to Ahmadiyya community from Pakistan and elsewhere to encourage them to participate in the event.”

Widely perceived to be different from mainstream Islam, Ahmadi thought believes that the advent of a prophesied redeemer, as promised by certain Islamic teachings, has already happened. They believe, unlike followers of mainstream Islam, that the messiah incarnated in 1835 in the form of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. Ahmadiyyas face persecution in Pakistan as mainstream Islam does not recognise them as Muslims. The community was constitutionally declared non-Muslim in 1974 during Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s prime ministership.
Following this, most Ahmadiyyas from Pakistan moved to England.

Sources said the Home Ministry will urge the Punjab government to provide full-proof security at Qadian following reports that several Muslim groups in India and abroad have declared the Ahmadiyyas as heretics. In 2014, officials said, 2013 Bodh Gaya blasts accused Mohd Mojibullah Ansari, who was arrested by the NIA and allegedly owed allegiance to Indian Mujahideen and Students of Islamic Movement of India, had spoken of a plan to target places associated with Ahmadiyyas in India.

,Psychonaut,"After listening to the audiobook ""How to Change Your Mind"" By Michael Pollan, I was dying to have a mystical trip. He told all these amazing stories that got me curious. The method used by the psychedelic therapists in this book was laying down with your eyes covered listening to music, following all thoughts even if they scare you.

I've tripped on psychedelics about 10-15 times in my life, usually always with friends for recreation. I only got into the spiritual side of it at the end of last year while reading about micro-dosing.

Last night I prepared a playlist of 69 songs (unironically) about 80% were rap songs consisting of deep lyrics, not that mumble rap garbage or party trap shit most kids listen to.

Some examples are: Eminem's When I'm Gone Kanye West's Never Let Me Down D12's Revelations Kendrick Lamar's Loyalty

Later that night I set the mood in my room, cleaned it spotless, made my bed, got a bunch of bottles of water prepared for the trip set the lighting so it was dim but not complete darkness.

At around 7 pm I measured out exactly 20mg of 4-Aco-DMT. I've taken it before but never more than 8mg which was quite psychedelic, this time I wanted to be blasted into orbit.

I put on a cute animal documentary in case I started to have a bad trip that way I could take my headphones off and watch that in hopes it would counteract the bad trip.

The trip started with high anxiety because I knew I just drank 20mg and there was no turning back. I could feel it slowly start creeping up so I decided to put my headphones on and start listening to music in case I got too high to do so while peaking.

I then closed my eyes and just laid down and followed the music for hours.

HOLY SHIT! I've never had that much appreciation for rap in all my life. What I experienced was wild. At the start of the trip what I was seeing was Lyrics being bombarded with shooting star patterns, Gnome patterns and just ton's of different styles. The only way I can describe it is if you've ever seen really trippy pattern art, but having lyrics appear in between the patterns. Every song had different patterns to it.

I could hear the production with immense quality to the point that a random snare in the background could ruin a song I used to love, or a random rhythm in the song would make it complete.

Later in the trip around the peak, I could see the people in the studio recording it, producing it, and imagine what they were doing / thinking / feeling while they were writing and recording the music.

A few times in the trip I slipped out of focus of the music and starting thinking about myself and just negative things in my life I didn't want to deal with, but I would push away the negative thoughts quite easily by refocusing on the music.

I realized a few moments after that in the book it says ""Whatever negative thoughts you have go towards them and never run"" but I seemed to have run and got away. Even after recalling this, I couldn't bring back the thought with enough worry to care.

I'm thinking next time I'm going to listen to music without words, and try and force myself to go into the negative thoughts and just follow them, possibly taking a 30mg dose instead of 20mg.

I wouldn't call this a spiritual trip, but definitely an enlightening one. Probably my favourite trip to date. Now I'm going to hold off for 2-3 weeks for the next.

,indieheads,"Hello everyone and welcome back to another day of Album of the Year, 1998 Edition. Today on the mantle we've got /u/yimyames discussing legendary alternative rock band R.E.M. and their 11th studio album, *Up*.

**Background** by /u/yimyames

All background information on R.E.M. can be found in Pavement’s history of R.E.M., [“The Unseen Power of the Picket Fence.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbbQQYyqG74) Spoiler alert, Malkmus wasn’t a fan of “Time After Time.”

In real summation, R.E.M. is a difficult band to summarize. They are known for both their hits “Losing My Religion,” “Stand,” “Everybody Hurts,” and “It’s the End of the World as We Known It,” as well as their seemingly arthouse sensibility that they brought into pop music. They formed in Athens, Georgia in 1980 with Michael Stipend, Peter $, Mike Myers, and Bill Strawberry as founding members. They later all changed their names to avoid confusion. Their most critically acclaimed album, *Automatic for the People*, is an incredible piece of music that everyone should hear. They broke up in 2011 and have no plans to reunite.

***

**Review** by /u/yimyames

*Up* is an unusual album. Even for a band that routinely shifts their sound between silly pop songs to art-rock classics from album to album, *Up* is one of R.E.M.’s most challenging and least pop-friendly records in their entire catalogue. Sixteen years after their debut EP, *Chronic Town*, Up is R.E.M.’s first album without founding member and drummer, Bill Berry, and the album very much sounds like the result of losing a drummer: a strong absence of dynamic percussion is present throughout the record. With the exception of “Lotus,” the album mostly coasts on drum machines and barely-noticeable session drumming. It’s also notable that R.E.M. parted ways with producer Scott Litt, who had been producing every album since 1987’s *Document* and was a large factor is pushing the band’s sound to pop-stadium accessibility. It was clear to many fans that this album was something of a creative shake up in many ways for Stipe, Buck, and Mills, and *Up* felt like a creative purging of their systems. For better or worse, casual R.E.M. fans were in for a rude awakening in terms of sound and songwriting.

*Up* begins with perhaps R.E.M.s most bizarre opening track, “Airport Man.” Barely audible, soft-spoken lyrics over an electronic track, the song is hardly there and easy to miss. It’s clearly a statement of intent—a “here’s what you’re in for” message—the song predicts the majority of the next thirteen tracks on the record: creative and often inspiring, but ultimately falling short of expectations. Of course, *Up* is far from R.E.M.s worst album (personally, that accolade should go to 2004’s sprawlingly boring *Around the Sun*), but it’s easily their most inaccessible and off-putting, even for dedicated fans.

After “Airport Man,” *Up* kicks into familiar R.E.M. sound, but only temporarily. “Lotus” feels like Bill Berry never even left. With an up-tempo keyboard riff and catchy chorus, “Lotus” is a fun as the album gets, but unfortunately it’s immediately followed by “Suspicion,” an overly-long and forgettable track that feels unprepared to be propped up by its drum machine beat. “Hope” feels like a new adventure in low-fi, a unique (for R.E.M.) song that sounds almost like it could be a Casiotone for the Painfully Alone track.

Then we get to *Up*’s potentially most memorable song, “At My Most Beautiful,” a sincere and somewhat Brian Wilson-inspired ballad that seems to act against the beguiling songwriting on the rest of the album (i.e., “I ate the lotus”) by being direct and simplistic. Spouting cellos, piano, and clean production, this track is closest the record comes to pop music, though it wasn’t as big of a hit as many of their previous singles (however, it was incorporated into an episode of Party of Five, so that’s…something). “The Apologist” follows this piano ballad by returning to the album’s basic sound, followed by “Sad Professor,” a song that become a personal favorite of the band and showed up on several set-lists for the remainder of their career, despite a seemingly lukewarm fan reaction to it. “You’re in the Air” and “Walk Unafraid” begin the long tread toward the end of the album, and, while they have some strong moments, the album feels like it’s been beating the listener over the head for so long with fairly static songs that they almost don’t register to the listener, unfortunately. Every time I relisten to Up, I completely forget that “Why Not Smile” is even on the album (same with “Parakeet,” honestly), but both “Daysleeper” and “Diminished” are two songs that truly stand out as R.E.M. classics (well, mostly the former), with “Diminished” having a “secret track” at the end (despite being third-to-last on the album tracklist), featuring Michael Stipe’s only guitar playing in his R.E.M. career—for an entire minute. “Falls to Climb” finishes the album out with more of a whimper than a bang, and, for an album than feels like it drags on, it manages to make the listener think “Wait, it’s over?” by the time the album actually finishes.

This might sound like an overly negative review of the album, but I don’t mean to say that *Up* is a bad album, though there is a recurring problem most people have with it: whether on purpose or not, *Up* seems to constantly subvert pop expectations through most of its runtime. Burning through the 64-minute runtime, the songs tend to drag and exhaust the listener, and so many songs fly under the radar by either not having a chorus or veering too far from themselves. It’s an album that’s easy to find yourself drifting off to, only to realize three songs have gone by without much actual change in music. However, single out the songs by themselves, and I think most people will find overlooked and sonically-buried tracks like “Walk Unafraid,” “The Apologist,” or “Diminished” really shine on their own. Here, listeners can find some of R.E.M.’s best creative leaps in their discography. Perhaps the problem is runtime, track sequence, or even song choices, but the best and most rewarding moments of *Up* are lost in the electronic ether and staleness that seemingly came from Berry’s absence.

Of course, it’s impossible to predict what Berry’s presence would have changed for the album, if anything, but it’s an equation equally impossible to ignore. With only two of the album’s fourteen tracks running less than four minutes, *Up* can feel like it never ends, despite the runtime only clocking in at barely over an hour—a problem critics found with their previous album, 1996’s *New Adventures in Hi-Fi*. It’s too easy dismiss the album as simply “boring,” but *Up* rewards patience and further listens by slowly unfurling and thawing with repeated revisits. Even if you find yourself reordering it on a playlist or nixing a few tracks, *Up* stands as a creative achievement from a band that could’ve rehashed *Automatic for the People* for the rest of their career if they wanted, but instead they gave us this. For all its detriments (I’m still not sure if “Why Not Smile” is really a song on the album), I’m grateful for that.

**Favorite Lyrics**

&gt; [Mumble mumble mumble] 

* ""Airportman""

&gt; I read bad poetry

&gt; Into your machine

&gt; I save your messages

&gt; Just to hear your voice

&gt; You always listen carefully

&gt; To awkward rhymes

* ""At My Most Beautiful""

&gt; If we're talking about love

&gt; Then I have to tell you

&gt; Dear readers, I'm not sure where I'm headed

* ""Sad Professor""

&gt; I want the stars to know they've won if only to beguile

* ""You’re in the Air""

&gt; Is the jury wavering?

&gt; Do they know I sing?

* ""Diminished""

***

**Talking Points**

* Despite being a major talking point about the album’s sound, Bill Berry was actually very cordial when leaving R.E.M. Though his actual reasons aren’t definitely disclosed, Berry had suffered an aneurysm on-stage during a show in Sweden the previous year and reportedly wasn’t fond of extensive touring, especially after *Monster*. When quitting, Berry told the band that, if his quitting was to mean the end of R.E.M., he wouldn’t quit. The band accepted that and moved on.

* Before the recording of *Up*, R.E.M. was given an enormous (and unprecedented) multi-album recording contract by Warner Bros. to stay on their label. They responded by delivering one of the most non-commercial albums of their career.

* Many bands have their divisive album that they almost broke up over, and *Up* is not exception.

* The documentary [Falls to Climb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM0m7xiGssI) is an excellent look into the recording of *Up*.

**Padawans** who only do 50 damage per lightsaber swing and have 300 health. L1 is force push (it’s as powerful as Luke’s during launch.) R1 force regen (healing ability)

**Jedi Knight** reinforcements costing 3000 but giving 100 damage per swing and having 450 health. L1 Force Push (1 hit kill), R1 Repulse L1-R1 Power of the Jedi (Gives 150 health, and unlimited stamina).

1 trooper class, 1 hero(villain)

501st assault troopers with either the dc-15 s or dc-15a as the weapon of choice. The secondary is a Vanguard. L1 is Thermal Detonator, no R1,

Lord Vader (Hooded Anakin): Free in the beginning (first come first serve) later on is 4500 bp. Wears the hooded skin with yellow eyes, talks about jedi betrayal and the chancellor being wise and guiding him.

Core Mechanics of Mode

The main objectives are .

1. Kill all the 100 padawans.
2. Destroy the Jedi Library by either putting a charge or just shooting at it.
3. Kill the remaining Masters (all 20 jedi players automatically respawn and have 1 life as a jedi knight vs the remaining clone troopers).

From beginning to end, Clones have 250 lives.

Clones don’t regen.

,battlefield_one,"I got to play Shock Operations for the first time last night, via the weekly playlist.

Overall, I really like the game mode. It's got all of the highs and lows of Operations, but condensed a bit. 

The smaller team sizes mean that your choices and squad can make a bigger impact. It also means that people who don't PTFO are a huge liability. I played solo and would love to come back w a squad of friends -- I think just one well coordinated squad could win the game.

I think the maps are smaller; the games are certainly shorter. That means that even if your team is a complete mess and not pushing the objective the pain doesn't last too long and you are off to the next round. 

I was attacking on Lupkow Pass, and the first sector has only a single flag... the defenders had effective sniper and support cover overlooking the flag, and our team was not pushing hard enough (even though I was laying down smokes and spamming GO GO GO).. too many people sitting back and sniping. The first battalion lost, only one left.  We then got the airship -- and with only 20 people on the defending team, not enough of the focused on killing the airship and we finally broke through the first sector and won the game. If I had been on the other team I would have been a bit salty but the whole game was done in about 25-30 minutes, so it was not a big deal.

Good, bite-size fun. Your thoughts?

If you like lists, you'll like me too. Here's a really great one, I made it just for you.

**Reasons why you should message me:**

* I LOVE making people playlists of music that reminds me of them. Think of me as the human version of Spotify’s Discover Weekly.
* I recently got my life together. Hopefully this doesn’t intimidate you, but I now wear matching socks and have kept a plant alive for over 8 months! Still need to say the entire alphabet to figure out what comes before the letter “w”, but I’m working on that!
* In 3rd grade I could do the highest number of push-ups in one minute. (Couldn’t put this on my resume, so I’m bragging about it here.)
* I love getting to know new people and will probably ask you a million questions about your life and your thoughts on different things, so we won’t run out of things to talk about.
* Will claim you as my friend almost immediately. We can even be Facebook official! 
* I’m picky, but in a desperate way. If you’re alive you’ve got a pretty good chance already!

And since you're such a great listener, here's a BONUS list!

**What I'm looking for:**

* A get rich quick scheme that will actually get me rich quick.
* Waldo.

,foobar2000,"I posted screenshots of it [here a little over 2 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/foobar2000/comments/8blki8/my_foobar_theme_dynamically_generated_based_on/) and it's currently the 2nd most upvoted post of all time in this subreddit. A bunch of things have changed in the time since that initial post, so I've reuploaded all the screenshots, and added a bunch more to show off all the cool features. Make sure and read the updated text as I try and detail how everything works.

You can download the theme from its [github repo here](https://github.com/kbuffington/Georgia). PLEASE follow the setup instructions closely. The current version is 0.9.5, but everything should work pretty solidly, ***except for lyrics***. Expect some bugs if you try to use lyrics. My plan is to fix that before the v1.0.0 milestone.

Seeing the reaction here really pushed me to make this theme amazing so I've been hard at work squashing bugs, adding features, ripping out the playlist and replacing it with TheQwertiest's version of CaTRoX, and generally trying to make this the best looking theme out there. Thanks to you guys for the support, encouragement, and all the PMs telling me to release the damn thing.

*by T. Perry Bowers*

If you think you can pop a CD in an envelope, send it off to a radio station and sit by the radio to see if your song comes on, you need to read this blog! If you do, it might save you some time.

Let me start by saying I’m not an expert and it’s been a few years since I did this, but I was in a band who did some radio promotion a few years back and I learned a lot about it. There is a process and if you don’t do it exactly the right way, you’re just throwing your  CDs, envelopes, stamps and your time in the toilet. 

While radio is not what it used to be, it’s still a very powerful medium. It can take your band to the next level. I am always surprised how many people listen to the Current (the Twin Cities state run, publicly funded radio station). I see Current 89.3 stickers on cars all the time. If you have the opportunity to be played (or actually be on one of the shows live) you’d be silly not to take it. Whatever the radio station across the country, whether it’s independent, college or commercial if you’re being played on the radio, people are likely to take you more seriously. 

Radio is regional. It’s not like the Internet and that’s a good thing. If you are being played in a certain town, you know where you need to go to capitalize on the phenomena. If you’re in heavy rotation on a Madison, Wisconsin College radio station, you better get your ass in a van and play a show in Madison. And while you’re at it, drop some CDs to the local record stores. If you’re being played regularly contact the radio station to see if you can come in to do an interview or play live. This is your best chance to create a fan base in a new town. Two fan bases are better than one and this is where your career has the potential to start to support itself. If you can play two towns every month, pack the shows and sell CDs and t-shirts at both shows, then you’ll start to make some money. Add 2 or 3 more towns and you’re really getting somewhere. This is the power of radio airplay. It’s immediate and exponentially larger than just playing a show in a new town. 

**So, how do you get radio airplay?** 

The first thing you need to know is radio stations add songs every week on a Tuesday. So think about what date you would like your song added to the radio station’s playlist. When you send your CD to a radio station it should have a sticker on the outside of the envelope stating the “add date.” All of your mailers (to all of the stations you send your CD) should have the same date on them. This date separates the pros from the amateurs. It’s not that radio programmers won’t listen to a CD without an “add date” printed on it. It’s just that they know if there’s no add date, more than likely, you are a garage band with no backing. Radio stations have relationships with labels and the pros go to the front of the line. The stacks of CDs are massive and the competition is huge. So you want to make it look like you are on a label, even if you’re not. 

The add date is also important because Billboard magazine publishes the “Top 20 Adds” alongside all the other charts each week. If your band makes that chart, you’ll create some industry buzz. Independent labels want their bands to be on the chart because making the list means things start to happen for the band. Touring becomes more lucrative, bigger labels take notice and bigger agencies want to work with you. But statistically, to get on that chart, a band has to go far and wide with their campaign. So the more radio stations that receive your package, the more likely you are to “chart”. 

When our band did our radio campaign a few years ago, we didn’t have the budget to aim for a chart position. So we focused on a regional campaign. Our aim was to get added on stations around the region, so we could tour and capitalize on the airplay. It costs about $15 per station for a radio promotion company to work with your CD. That doesn’t include the actual CD, the press kit, the envelope or the postage. At that time, there were about 500 radio stations across the country with the potential to play our music. We were calling ourselves alternative rock, with a crossover to adult contemporary. So a full 500 station campaign would have cost us $7500 for radio promotion, plus $750 in postage and mailers, $800 for CDs and $500 for full color “one sheets” (press kits). So almost 10K to do a nationwide push. Needless to say, that wasn’t in our budget. Do you want to start an independent label? If so, that’s where your first 10K of capital might go! 

So we decided to do a 100-station campaign. We focused on Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Iowa and some other radio stations within a 12-hour drive from Minneapolis. We settled on an “add date,” we put our “one sheet” together and manufactured our CDs. The radio promo company wanted the CD to land on the programmer’s desk exactly 3 and half weeks before the add date. This gives the station ample time to put the record through their process, but not so much time that it has to be stored and potentially lost or thrown out. Every radio station’s process is different, but most of the time the director distributes the CDs to various people in the organization and has them write up feedback. The feedback includes whether they think the record is worthy of adding and at what level of rotation. You could be added in light, medium or heavy rotation. It doesn’t matter for charting - if you’re added, you’re added. The station will report you to the Billboard chart. If you are unknown, you will probably be added in light rotation to see what the initial reaction is. If the listeners respond positively you will likely be moved up the rotation ranks. You’re not only competing with unknown bands, you’re also up against U2, the Foo Fighters, Green Day etc. So if you get added it says a lot about your music. Major and well-known independent label releases do get preferential treatment. You’ll have to do something that makes you stand out. Good music helps a lot, but a good package doesn’t hurt either. 

Your “One Sheet” is a condensed version of a press kit. It is simply one piece of paper with all of the necessary information on it. It includes the album artwork, a brief bio of the band and a description of the material, with the single underlined.  The single is the song you want them to listen to first. It is very important because they may only listen to one minute of that song before making a decision. You should indicate a second song as well though. If your CD catches fire with the listeners they’ll put the second song into rotation after the first one plateaus. Your one sheet should also include testimonials, reviews and most importantly, all of the credits. The best run sheets have flair and style, are professional and easily read. Radio programmers will look for anything to justify adding your song to their playlist. Even if they like your song a lot, they take a risk if they don’t know you. 

This is where credits can help. Can you name-drop anyone who helped with your record? A producer who once worked with Prince?  Pull out all modesty because if they are going to add an unknown, they need to have something to talk about. What about your bio? Do you have anything unique about how your band was formed? Have you played any big or interesting shows? Was your father a well-known musician? 

Radio promoters also want to read reviews of your CD (or previous work). We can talk more about how to get press later, but let’s assume that you’ve had some published reviews or some well known people have commented on your music. 3 or 4 quotes are great. This gives the radio station an idea what others think about you and how they classify you. The radio station is a box (adult contemporary, alternative, top 40, rock, hard rock, classic rock etc). They want to know if you fit in. A review (especially if it references other artists) will help. 

So what do radio promotion companies do for their $15?  They put the add date sticker on the CD and envelope (it literally says “Add Date: 7/14/17” in big letters). This ensures that it goes in the right pile. Then they send the CD to the right person. If they are a good and reputable business, their database is huge and up to date. At some stations, the program director receives the incoming music themselves. At others, a different individual or a team of people receive the CDs. Radio promoters also make follow up calls – usually once per week and they know exactly when to call (Radio stations have specific times when they will talk to labels and radio promoters - for example it might be 9am-noon on Tuesdays and Thursdays). This is where the radio promotion company’s database pays off. Trying to do this for your own band is a futile endeavor. There are too many idiosyncrasies in the process - paying $15 for a professional to do it is a no-brainer. 

A radio promoter keeps a spreadsheet of all of the stations they sent your CD to. They’ll make notes each week they call. If the station does add your song the amount of rotation will be noted (light, medium or heavy). If it is added only to a particular show, it will be noted. Sometimes, a DJ might like your song and put it on their show even if the station doesn’t officially put it into rotation. After the add date passes, the promoter will follow up every week for 6-12 weeks. You can pay them to do more after that, but if your record hasn’t caught on by then, it probably won’t. 

Let’s imagine your single catches on and becomes a hit in a particular market where a radio station put it into heavy rotation for 6 weeks straight. You might think you’ve made it. But really the work has just begun. More than likely the radio promoter will be following up with the station to encourage them to keep playing the song. But the radio station and the promoter will want you to get to their town, play a show and get on the radio for a live performance and an interview. Maybe another station in a different town has you in light rotation. Well, you might as well make a stop on the way and see if you can boost it up there too. This is the formula. It’s how bands make it. Yes, the Internet has changed things. And yes, you can make it with YouTube hits. But, the world of independent and college radio is still a very powerful tool. If you are serious about your band, it needs to be part of your efforts. To do it right is not cheap, but it can be very effective.

“So…you just want me to run as fast as I can?”  Veera asked.  They were currently standing at the center of town, a couple hours after sundown.  The snows of the night before had melted away under Seil’s light, now replaced by a starlit sky as the twin moons soared overhead.  To Veera, it was something out of a dream; not the running, but the sky, the air, the man next to her.  Everything seemed clear and surreal as she breathed in the cold, rich air of her planet.  Yet again, they found themselves mostly alone as the rest of the town made merry around fires and tea.  

‘Yes Veera, just let the Lieutenant and I arrive at the right distance first.  We will walk about four hundred meters down the street and then I will signal to you when to start.  Try to reach us as fast as you can.  This is a standard middle distance race among humans.’

“Word of advice love?”  Winters leaned in and rubbed her shoulders, eliciting a pleased moan from her chest.  Even with his armor on, his hands felt wonderful on her.

“I’ll listen to anything you say if you keep that up,” she replied saucily, enjoying the impromptu shoulder massage.

“Good, then my advice is to pace yourself.  I know you might not have a concept of a meter in your head, but it would be a long stride of mine.  We’re talking running all the way to the temple of Kel probably.  So pace yourself.  Don’t start as a sprint.”

“I thought we were testing my speed,” Veera protested, confused as to why she shouldn’t simply run as hard and as fast as she could.

“We are, but the distance is probably long enough where if your body functions anything like a human’s, if you go all out at the beginning, you’ll tire long before the finish.  Try putting in most of your effort, but not all.  Three quarters or so.”

“What does three quarters mean?”

“You know how Felen used to have four lungs and now he has three?”

“Yes.”

“He has three quarters of his lungs left.”

“Oh…you’re talking about pieces of a whole!”  Veera conceptualized her first fraction.

“Exactly.  So if your total running ability was something you could split like that, try giving us three quarters today, alright?  If you think you can go faster the next time, then do it.  If you think the Cauthan body behaves differently from a human’s, then experiment as you like.  We’ll be doing this a lot.”

“Thank you for the advice Russell, I think I’m ready,” Veera replied, bouncing on the balls of her feet to get her blood flowing.

“Sure thing feather kitten.  You want me to take your cloak?”

“Oh yes, right.  Please do!”  She stripped the garment off and gave it to him, waving goodbye as he jogged off into the night.

‘I believe your advice was sound sir, but should we be instructing her like that?  We don’t know what her body is capable of.’

“All the more reason not to push it Io,” Winters argued, emphatic that Veera not be forced beyond what she was capable of.

‘Indeed, as you wish sir.  I see your cardiovascular health has not suffered since arrival,’ Io declared, reviewing her partner’s vitals as his heartrate and breathing rate climbed.

“All that training would have been a pretty big waste if I’d gone soft after a couple months don’t you think?”

‘That doesn’t mean it wasn’t a possibility.  What if we had landed in a large Cauthan city and they installed you as a leader, fanning you with palm fronds and feeding you dates?’  Io momentarily styled herself as Cleopatra.  

“Io…what?”

‘Now do you see why I’m so happy to have a new project?’

“Yes Io, yes I do.  You let me know if you ever feel like you’re truly going insane, alright?”

‘Is humor insanity?’

“No Io, at least nothing I’ve heard out of your mouth.”

‘Then I am not insane, sir.  We are here.’  Io’s words brought Winters to a halt just shy of the temple of Kel.  Knowing that Veera was waiting in the cold, he wasted no time.

“Go ahead and give her the start Io.”

‘Yes sir.  Veera, please begin at the count of three.  One, two, three!’  For Io and Winters, nothing changed, at least for the next couple moments.  Eventually they did fix on Veera’s figure running at them through the night.  She joined them a few minutes later, panting heavily but looking otherwise proud of herself.  After spending some time with her hands on the back of her head, a trick she’d remembered from the festival, Winters returned her cloak and they began to walk slowly back towards home.

“So, how did I do?”  Veera asked, still breathing deeply, but more regularly.

‘You managed the distance in two minutes and thirteen seconds.’  Io informed her.  Veera looked up at her human.  After looking around them to check if the coast was clear, Winters had Io project a ticking watch face.

“Each movement of that hand there is a second.  There’s sixty of those in one minute and sixty minutes in one hour.  You finished in one hundred thirty three seconds.”

“I hope this will become more clear once I learn more of your language Russell, but at least now I have a number that I need to get lower, right?”

“Right.  Overall I’d say that time was below average for a human, but again, running is our specialty, don’t take it too hard alright?”

“I won’t darling.  After all, I have to let you humans have something, right?”  Veera stretched her arms effortlessly behind her to accentuate her species’ innate flexibility.  Winters patted her on the back.

“Fair enough Veera.  Io, you said we’ll do endurance over the next couple of days?”

‘Yes sir.  Veera, I will have to test you twice.  Once to determine your capacity for extended cardiovascular activity, and once to determine how far your muscles can be pushed over time.  Fear not, I have already thought of a few ways in which to do so.  For tonight, please just relax.’

“No need to tell me twice Io, that run took a lot out of me!”  Veera huffed, leaning against Winters for a bit of support.

“I suppose I should have known it would be the two of you making a racket at this hour.”  A voice called to them from their left.  Looking over they saw Gentia silhouetted in the doorway of the temple of Meylith.  “Now then, you two wouldn’t just walk by without visiting an old woman now, would you?”

‘I don’t believe you have a way out of this one,’ Io advised.  ‘Better just do as she asks.’

“I think some tea sounds great actually.  You got any good stuff in there Gentia?”  Winters asked confidently, leading Veera by the hand.

“Now that’s what I like to hear!  Come now Veera, join us.  Most of the acolytes have gone home already.”

“What about Thantis?”  Veera poked around for a potential way out.

“Why do you think he’s here?”  Gentia quipped, causing Winters to make a victorious noise.

“That means there’s definitely good tea.”

“Yes yes, of course young man, please come in!  It’s been so long since I’ve heard a story about your people’s gods!”  Thantis exclaimed, poking his head out of the temple’s doorway.

“Hey there Thantis!  Good to see you too.  So where’s the tea at?”  Winters waved a greeting and strode inside.

“Oh enough about the tea already!  Veera exclaimed, whacking him on the back of his helmet.  “Ouch!  That’s not fair!”  Everyone assembled laughed as Veera pouted.  Soon after, they were all seated on the benches inside the temple with mugs in hand.

“So what were the two of you doing out there anyway?  I just happened to look over and see Veera charging through the streets.  Clearly both of you are unharmed, so what was the emergency dear?”  Gentia asked kindly as Veera looked away in embarrassment, not wanting to give Gentia another potential angle of attack.  “Come now child, whatever it is it can’t be that bad.”

“Veera’s asked me to help train her body, now that we’ve been blessed with enough food to not have to constantly worry about such things.”  Winters’ explanation earned him a betrayed look from his mate.  He tried to soothe her with a whisper.  “You have nothing to be ashamed of.”

“That sounds like a novel idea!”  Thantis declared.  “It is best to take advantage of your body’s strength and grace when you’re young.  Good for you Veera.”

“Uh…thanks Thantis I…”  Veera was saved from further scrutiny as a Cauthan that Winters had never seen before burst into the temple.

“Oh thank goodness you’re here Gentia.  Please, I’m sorry to interrupt but you must come quickly.”

“Now now Suka, what’s all this about?  You look like you’ve seen a spirit.  Has Merat’s time come?”

“Yes, and it’s not looking good Gentia.  She’s in pain and struggling.  I knew these snows were a bad omen.  To have a cub still in her womb as Kel awakens…”  Suka’s pacing set everyone on edge as Gentia looked to Veera and Winters.  The expression on her face was one that Winters had often seen as Jess sat on the bridge of her ship.  Veera took his hand in hers and squeezed tightly.

“My love,” Gentia looked at Thantis.  “Please go and collect fresh linen or bandages, as well as any herbs you may have on hand for pain and bleeding.  Veera,” Gentia motioned to the room on the right side of the temple.  “Please go prepare a fire.  The pit is next to the bed at the end of the row.  Once that’s done, please begin heating water immediately.  If we don’t have a pot that’s full already there should be some water in the barrels out back.”

‘I see,’ Io mused to Winters.  ‘The residence for their acolytes must also function as a primitive maternity ward.  I wonder when they discerned the whole boiling water trick.’

“Definitely for another time Io, I don’t think we’re just going to be allowed to just sit this one out.”  His words proved prophetic as Gentia turned to him next.

“Winters!  I need you to go with Suka and collect his mate.  Keep her warm and bring her here.”  Winters felt his eyebrows shoot into his hair.  The order made sense but he still hadn’t expected it.

“What?  You want the human to-” Suka began.  Gentia cut him off immediately in a no-nonsense tone of voice.

“He’s the strongest being in the village right now Suka, and we need Merat here as soon as possible if she’s having problems.  Can you carry her here?”

“No, I admit I surely cannot…but he serves the god of death and…”

“That means that if anyone can keep my Master at bay, it would be me.”  Winters spoke in a low voice, rising from his seat to stand above the chaos.  Suka fell still as Veera gasped, handing her cloak to him as he beckoned for it.

“Darling, you…” Veera looked up at him with pride and concern plain on her face.  He placed a hand on her shoulder before turning back to the others.

“Suka was it?  Take me to your mate, please.  Time is of the essence,” Winters demanded, noticing that Io had gone into a practical tizzy over the possibility of bearing witness to the process of Cauthan birth.  Without waiting for an agreement, he swept out of the temple with Suka trailing behind him.  Veera couldn’t help a chuckle despite her nerves as Winters’ voice reached her.  “Pick up the pace Suka, I wait for no Cauthan!”

“I suppose that explains a few things; you’d need to get stronger just to keep up with him!” Gentia remarked approvingly as she too headed for the door.  “I’m off to try to find at least a couple of acolytes with some experience, though we probably won’t have time to make house calls all over the village.  Veera, if I can’t find anyone or if I’m not back in time, you’re assisting.”  With that final declaration Gentia left, followed quickly by Thantis.  For a long moment Veera just stood still, watching the door.  

“By all the gods…”  With that, she shook herself into action and ran into the adjoining chamber, lighting a couple of torches before finding the fire pit and beginning her assigned tasks.  As she worked, she felt her heart beating quick and strong, both because of the situation and because of the way her human had taken charge, shouldering the mantle of the death god without a second thought because he thought it would help salvage the situation.  “Time to do my part then,” she resolved, lighting a spark that set dry tinder ablaze and wood crackling.  Satisfied that the fire was fine on its own, Veera examined the nearest cauldron, finding it empty.  With a curse, she hoisted it and headed out back.  “Please get her here safe love.”

\-----

“It’s this one here, on the left!”  Suka shouted breathlessly as Winters reached a modest dwelling in the northeast corner of the village.  He could already hear the faint cries of labor from within.  With a knock on the wooden doorframe, he entered.

‘Oh dear…’ Io spoke, shocked as no fewer than ten faces turned to greet them.  None looked happy to see him.  ‘Extended family I presume.’  Winters held his hands in the air in an attempt to head off the incoming chaos.

“Please, good people.  I’m here on behalf of Gentia and the temple of Meylith.  I must take her to them; please let me through.”  Winters’ appeal seemed to fall on deaf ears as they continued to stare and stand between him and the bed, only shaken out of it by another pained yell.  Suka chose that moment to rush through the door himself.

“It’s as he says everyone.  Now please, move!”  The patriarch of the household declared, finally getting the Cauthan surrounding the bed to clear a path.  Winters moved quickly, finding a female Cauthan with pale blond fur naked and panting on the hay, her belly full with pregnancy.  Her claws and talons were already dug deep into the bedding, a sign of the agony she was enduring.

‘Sir, she’s bleeding.  Hard to tell if that’s natural or not.  We need to move,’ Io warned him, unable to keep a look of concern from darkening her face.  She felt very uneasy in a position of limited knowledge.  

“Your name is Merat, right?”  Winters asked kindly, kneeling at the foot of the bed.  “My name is Russell, I’ve come on behalf of Gentia to get you to the temple where they can help.  I’ll have to carry you.  May I touch you?”  Merat squeezed her eyes shut in pain and grunted as another contraction tore through her.  When she opened them again they were filled with fear.

“Please…my cub,” she managed in a painful whisper.  Taking that to be as much of an assent as he was going to get, Winters handed the cloak he was carrying to the nearest bystander.

“Drape her with that as soon as I lift her torso.  Are you ready Merat?  One, two, three.”  As Winters supported her shoulders and back from behind, Merat was clothed in the cloak just before Winters shifted and took her into his arms with one fluid motion, eliciting another gasp of pain.  She was heavy, but nothing he couldn’t handle.  His adrenaline had surged the moment he’d heard her cries.  Once the cloak was secured, Winter’s turned and departed immediately as the assembled Cauthan began talking and shouting.  “Suka, run ahead and let them know we’re almost there!  Go now!”  He commanded, walking as fast as he could without breaking into a run that would jar the female in his arms.  “By all the gods Io, what the hell have we gotten ourselves into?”  He lamented into his helmet.

‘Your guess is as good as mine sir, but at least she’s still breathing deeply.  You should maybe talk to her sir, she’s surely scared.’  Winters had no idea what he could possibly say, but took Io’s advice anyway.

“Merat, you don’t need to respond to me, but just focus on my voice and stay with me.  You’re doing fine.  We’re going to get you to the temple.  Everyone should be there already.  They’re getting a bed ready for you as well as water and herbs for the pain.  We’re going to do everything we can for you and your cub alright?  Don’t worry, Kel won’t touch either of you while I’m here.  He just decided to bring the snows a bit early so that you and your cub would have something pretty to look at tomorrow morning, alright?”  Merat hissed in pain and turned her head against his chest.

“Please…”  Her claws scraped audibly against his armor.

“Yeah, I’ve got you.  Hang in there.  I’ve got you.”  Winters willed himself to move faster through the night.

\-----

Veera could barely keep track of what had happened since Suka had sprinted back into the temple.  Gentia and one other acolyte had returned, meaning that she would also be assisting the priestesses that evening.  Her heart had kicked into overdrive at that moment and hadn’t abated since.  Thantis was already busy making poultices and boiling bandages while clean linen was laid over the bed nearest to the fire.  Veera was just about to sit down and steady herself when a cry of pain echoed from the main chamber to herald Winters’ arrival, along with a very pregnant female in his arms.  Gentia took charge immediately.

“Thank you Winters, lay her here please.  There you go Merat, easy now.  We’re going to take care of you.  Veera, boil some more bandages.  Thantis, if you’re ready I think we’ll be needing something for her pain immediately.  Suka, Winters, leave us.  You’ve done what you can.”

“Gentia, my cub.  Please…”  Merat’s voice sounded fainter to Winters; it made his blood run cold.

“Wait, are you sure you don’t need us?”  He asked, stunned that there wasn’t anything he could do to help.  

“Yes, now get out of here before you distract us.”  Gentia demanded, moving to the foot of the bed as her acolyte spread Merat’s legs.  “Oh dear, yes I see.  Thantis I’m going to need something to stem this bleeding.  Get out!”  She screeched, seeing that neither Suka nor Winters had moved.  The human, in spite of all of his instincts that screamed at him to remain, grabbed Suka by the arm and led him back into the main chamber.  With nothing else to do, they eventually sat on a bench against the wall and waited.  Suka immediately began fidgeting with his claws and talons.  Winters looked down at his armor.  His right arm was coated in a thin film of dark red.

“What a night…” he muttered, grabbing his canteen and moving to the doorway in order to wash his armor clean in the street.  “Sorry about that.”  He apologized as he rejoined Suka, who looked even worse than he had when he’d first arrived at the temple.  The Cauthan didn’t bother turning his head to look at Winters.

“No, don’t.  Thank you for helping.”  Suka managed in a detached voice, visibly wincing each time he heard his mate in distress.  Winters nodded.

“Just doing what I could.  Guess it’s out of our hands now.”

“Yes…”  Suka wrung his hands as another pained scream reached their ears, along with words of encouragement from Gentia and her priestess.  “Oh Meylith, please keep them safe,” he held his head in his hands and pleaded.  Winters silently cursed, placing a hand on Suka’s shoulder.  

“I used to be a soldier…before coming here.”  Winters spoke into the tense air, not bothering to see if Suka was listening.  “It’s tough, you know, hearing a friend or loved one in pain.  I never got used to it.  But if they’re making noise, if they’re suffering…it means they aren’t dead.  She’s fighting.”  Winters’ attempted encouragement was received silently, signaling to him that the time had come for his own silence as well.  The two men forced themselves to listen and wait.

\-----

Io had done nothing but pace Winters’ visor for a good hour and a half, perturbed at being left out of the room and doing her best to interpret the sounds she was hearing thanks to Veera’s earpiece.  For the life of them, they couldn’t tell if the changes in Merat’s voice were good or bad signs.  After about an hour Veera had run out of the room and into the storehouse.  She passed them again with a bundle in her arms, not saying a word as the sounds of Merat’s labor continued to weigh on their nerves.  Just as Winters felt he was about to go mad from inaction, a final earsplitting scream reached them, followed by a distinctly new cry over the din of the other voices in the delivery room.  Both of them let out a long and harried breath.

“I think you’d better get in there Suka.  I hope your family remains healthy.  Congratulations,” Winters advised, praying that both mother and cub would live to see the sunrise.  With a silent thank you, Suka did just that, passing Veera on his way in.  She had left to give the family their own time with one another and the more experienced healers of the village.  Winters stood and looked at her.  She looked tired and worn, her feathers ruffled and her tail drooping from stress, but smiled at him all the same.  It was a sad expression that pierced right through his armor and tugged directly at his heart.

“Russell…”  Her eyes looked misty and far away as he stepped closer to her.

“Veera, you alright?”

“He was…”  Her vision began to swim as Winters removed his helmet.  She felt her knees go weak.

“Veera!”  He held her to him as she looked up into his eyes.  Her body felt ready to collapse, both from stress and from an insistent demand that she knew would never be fulfilled.  “Veera, what is it?  Talk to me!”  He demanded softly, cradling her to him.  She felt small in his hold.

“He was so beautiful!”  Veera wailed, surrendering herself to tears as Winters could do nothing but stare past her into the distance.  The sounds of a proud father and relieved mother weighed heavily on them both.

\-----

For the second time that night Winters walked through the empty streets, carrying a woman in his arms.  This time he said nothing.  There were no words he could ever say to ease the pain that Veera was suffering.  Wrapped in her cloak she clung to him desperately, as though the world might wrench them apart at any moment, displeased at their unnatural union of human and Cauthan.  

‘Oh Veera…’ Io whispered only for him, looking down helplessly at her partner’s mate.  ‘I’m so sorry.  To think moments ago I was jealous of her, that she got to be there to witness the miracle of birth and I had to wait outside.’  Io sniffed and wiped her eyes, filing away another note in her ‘Veera folder’, surely going through the motions in order to give the two of them anything else to pay attention to.  Winters was thankful for the privacy his helmet afforded him, unable to completely avoid the salty sting of tears in his eyes.  Powerlessness was not an emotion he enjoyed feeling, and he’d done so an awful lot that evening.  After what seemed like an eternity he finally delivered them home, finding it dark and cold.  His helmet more than compensated for the lack of light, and he moved to lay Veera down on the bed before removing his armor to the sounds of her soft sobbing.  When he was clothed for bed and had set Io down to provide just a bit of light, he sat on the side of the frame, looking down at Veera who’d curled into a ball as if to ward off the world.  Knowing that tonight would not be a playful one, Winters decided a new approach to sleeping was in order, rolling up their old chesko blanket into a bedroll and placing it at the head before taking Veera’s cloak from her and covering her with the new blanket instead.  He then joined her, coaxing her to extend her body enough to rest her head on the pillow.  Using his hands to guide her, Winters slowly turned her to face the wall before snuggling up behind her and wrapping his right arm across her chest.  His left arm fit under her neck and completed the embrace.  It was the only thing he could think to do.  He wasn’t sure it would ever be enough.

“Thank you,” Veera sniffed, tilting her head so that he could kiss her cheek softly.  “I’m sorry…”

“Shhh…Veera, it’s alright.”

“I want to be a mother Russell,” she pleaded desperately into the night.  Winters could have sworn he felt his heart break in two at the sound of her voice.  “I just…when he was born…that little cub seemed like the most beautiful thing in the world.  I couldn’t help but envy her…even in all of her pain.  The look on her face when she finally held him…when she fed him his first bite of food.  I don’t think I’ll ever forget it,” Veera whispered as she pushed back ever so slightly into him, trying to draw closer to his warmth.

“I…”  Winters found no words would come.  Veera instead turned in his hold to face him, her watery irises just barely visible thanks to Io’s illumination.  Another small sob escaped her lips as she pressed their noses together.

“I’m sorry for being a selfish woman.”

“Veera, what did I just-”

“Even if you say it, I can see the pain on your face.  I can see it in your eyes.  Did you ever want children Russell?”  She asked, causing him to cast his mind in a direction it rarely went.

“I…I didn’t get to think about it much as a soldier, but yes, I suppose I did in the end,” he told her, knowing that even if he’d never thought so consciously, that eventually he’d answer in the affirmative at some point in his life.  He found it difficult to fathom the idea of leaving nothing behind in the world when he died.

“Would you give me cubs if you could?”  Veera inquired in the faintest whisper.  Io’s light glowed brighter for just a moment.

“Yes.”  Veera sobbed and kissed him all at once, a soft and wet sensation on his lips that spoke volumes of the aching that Veera was feeling inside, pain that she’d never been able to fully express.  It was all Winters could do to just hold her close and stroke the back of her head.  There was nothing he could say to console her.  No discussion of adoption or fostering would ever fill the void of a womb unused.  He had never felt so weak, even during his last moments on the Lancer.  Not being able to fulfill the deepest desire of the Cauthan he’d come to love was like salt in an eternal wound.

“I love you Russell.”

“I love you too Veera.”  She buried her head in his chest and prayed for sleep, the sweet release of slumber to deaden the hurt.

\-----

Io remained awake the whole night, attempting to process everything she had learned in the hours before, as well as practically rewriting her entire set of subroutines devoted to sympathy and empathy.  Her systems would not let her forget the hurt in Veera’s voice or the helplessness in her partner’s eyes.  Instead, she watched as the two of them drifted into sleep, subconsciously becoming a tangle of limbs, fur, skin, and feathers.  She found it beautiful in its own way, an affirmation of their desire to persevere in spite of the adversity of life.  As the first light of dawn began to filter into their home, Io noticed a new soft coating of snow outside.  Knowing that they would at least wake up to that, the VI finally managed to calm herself enough to enter standby.  

\-----

As Veera slowly woke, she felt a sudden burst of anxiousness and fear flow through her as she realized that she was alone under the blanket.  She was about to cry out for her mate when the smells and sounds of cooking breakfast reached her.  After a few calming breaths, she decided to remain curled up in bed, not ready to face her human after the night prior.  *How could life be so cruel,* she lamented.  *Turning something so miraculous and wonderful into a source of pain for us…*  Her breath caught in her chest as Winters returned, sitting on the bedframe and turning to face her.  He held out a plate with eggs, bacon, and toast.  Her nose twitched at the marvelous scent of his simple cooking.

“How you feeling?”  He asked her with a small smile.  “Hey c’mon, look at me feather kitten.  Eat something while you’re at it too.”

“What’s the occasion?”  She replied meekly, accepting his offer all the same and sitting up to eat with the utensil he offered.  

“You mean other than the fact that we both felt like shit last night?”

“You’re crude Russell.”  She popped a bite of food in her mouth.  “This is delicious.  Thank you love.”  He was rewarded with a peck on the cheek.

“Food makes everything better,” he informed her playfully, happy to see a smile on her face again.  “And look outside.  Kel saw fit to give us a nice view again today.”  Veera followed his extended arm to the doorway, taking in the orange light of winter morning reflected off the snows.  

“What did I do to deserve you Russell?”  She asked softly, taking another bite of her meal.

“Hmm?”  He made a questioning sound as he took a large bite of eggs.

“You see?  That’s what I mean.  I was…we were…in a dark place last night and you just…erase it all.  It’s warm in here, you made me food, you pointed out the snow because you knew it would make me happy, you do that silly thing when you try to talk with your mouth full.”  Winters blushed and looked away, rubbing the back of his neck.  “And that.  I love it when you do that.”  Her human couldn’t help but shrug and go back to his food.  When he’d finally swallowed and his cheeks were a lighter shade of red, he looked at her.

“Do you want to go back and see how they are?  Or would you rather pretend it never happened?”  He asked, his tone making clear that he didn’t judge either choice to be the ‘correct’ one.  Veera took another bite while thinking.  

“I don’t think I’d sleep well if I didn’t visit, that is if they’re still at the temple.”

“You think they would be?”

“Merat lost a lot of blood last night.  Not fatal…at least while I was there, but I think she’ll be in bed for a time.”

“And the kid?”

“Strong, healthy, and takes after his mother.”  Veera declared proudly, her eyes misting over again.  

“Then let’s finish up here.  I’d like to meet him,” Winters said confidently.  Io chose that moment to make her presence felt, already clad in her fashionable winter wear.

‘I too wish to observe the small bundle of fur!’

\-----

“Well now, I was wondering where the two of you got off to last night.”  Gentia waved them into the temple; too tired to poke fun or make assumptions about where they might have been the night before.  “I think my mate has the right of it.  I should start looking for a successor soon.”  She sat down and began to eat a small breakfast.

“Gentia, surely you’ve got many winters left in you!”  Veera protested, joining the elderly matriarch.

“That may be so child, but I don’t know how many more sleepless nights I can handle.”  She rested a hand warmly on Veera’s.

“How are they?  Are they alright?”

“It wasn’t a sure thing for a while, but yes Veera, they are alright.  That’s in no small part thanks to you, and you as well human.”

“All I did was carry her here,” he protested.

“Indeed, and because you did we were able to stem the bleeding early enough to allow her to safely deliver her cub.  Poor lad’s fur was a mess; nothing a mother’s tongue won’t cure though.”  Winters made a face behind his helmet, but Io nodded sagely.

‘Yes that does make sense…no better way to replenish the body than to take in what’s lost.  Crude, certainly, but effective.  Oh stop making that face sir; you listen to music with far more ridiculous lyrics.’

“That’s fighting dirty Io, using my drop playlist against me.”

‘I learned from the best, fight to win.  Will you ask if we can see them now?’  Io demanded impatiently.  Unable to deny her enthusiasm any longer, Winters looked down at Gentia.

“Do you think we could visit?”  Gentia’s look was both surprised and approving.

“Let me go ask.  As you might imagine, mother isn’t feeling particularly energetic.  I just got done shooing Suka away so that he could get some rest himself.”  The elder shook her head at the thought before hoisting herself to her feet again and walking into the adjoining room.  A few moments later she appeared in the doorway and beckoned them in, holding aside the cloth door cover.  A pot still boiled over the fire pit, and Winters could see from a distance that seemingly the entire stock of linen owned by the temple, except for those covering the new mother, was being cleaned and disinfected by two of the priestesses.  He was relieved to find Merat conscious and seemingly in good health looking over at them, clutching a tiny blond ball of fluff with limbs to her chest.  After a silent feathered signal, Veera nodded and approached the bed with Winters following behind.

“Ah, my savior returns,” Merat whispered, looking at Veera.  She shook her head.

“I didn’t do much.”

“But you were there.  Gentia tells me I owe you both, in part, my life; as well as Laran here.”  She looked down at the newborn with a gaze that could only be found on the face of a mother.  Veera cooed sweetly as the little thing opened its eyes and realized that it now had guests.  The small cry it let out had Io swooning.

‘Aww isn’t he so precious!  Isn’t he just a wittle bawl of fluffiness!  Sir, his name is Laran and he says hi!  Isn’t he just the sweetest little you ever…’  Io seemed to only then become aware that Winters was staring at her, eyebrows at peak extension.  ‘My apologies sir.’  Io cleared her throat.  ‘Veera has been rubbing off on me.’

“Uh…carry on,” Winters replied, reaching up to remove his helmet.  Laran’s eyes opened wide as the human got a new face.  “Neat little trick, isn’t it?”  He asked, receiving a gurgle of some sort in reply.  Veera laughed in delight.

“Could I…hold him?”  She asked tentatively.  

“Oh, please do.  My arms are killing me.”  Merat gave her permission as Veera bent over the bed to gently take the little boy into her arms, sitting down so that he could still see his mother.  The newborn’s protests died down as soon as he felt the texture and warmth of Veera and her dress.  Noticing that Gentia had long ago left them to their own devices, Winters sat himself on the adjacent bed, finding great comfort in watching Veera, the light in her eyes restored by the presence of new life.

*Sorry Veera.  Thanks for loving me anyway.*

,spotify,"Hey guys,

After releasing a number of tracks on Spotify I've decided to try and create some sort of promotion plan for building a fanbase and find I am hitting a lot of walls. Asides from googling ""list of spotify curators"" and finding curator websites such as Soundplate but it's difficult to find the big boys that can really push your music or a large listing of smaller curators that you can work through..

Does anyone have more experience in this field than me and is willing to give some advice on how to track curators down? I'm particularly interested in the influential ones who curate the New Artist/Discover types of playlist because you would have thought that due to their popularity their details would be readily available :/

,residentevil,"Fuck modesty, screw being humble. Throw all that shit out the window, this thread is to list your single greatest and proudest accomplishment in the Resident Evil Series to date. Whether it be a speedrun, speciality run, or just something that means a lot to you personally, post it here and tell us why!

For me it will always be my Resident Evil 2 Blindfolded run I performed back in June 2016. The entire Youtube playlist can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOpYbj_tyfcDOIJCdA4EaiqI70RglYYes

Resident Evil 2 is my favourite game in the series, doing it blindfolded was an idea I had back in September 2011, nearly 7 years ago. I started the run but my memory card ended up being wiped. I lost motivation for years and finally got back to it in 2016 and gave it my all. It was something I wasn't sure if I had the ability complete, but I'm so happy I pushed forward and did it!

Resident Evil 2 is such a special game to me and was so happy to do such a cool thing with it!

,BabyBumps,"On June 22nd I woke up at 3am with contractions at 39+5. This had been happening for a few weeks so I didn't think much of it. At 4am I started timing them, and at 5am I decided maybe this was it so I went and finished cleaning the nursery. At 6:45 I woke my husband up, we were both pretty excited but I was hesitant since my first labor with our daughter was 19 hours, so I was mentally preparing myself for the long haul. 

Our 2 and a half year old got up at 7:00, my husband brought her to daycare and I took a bath. The bath was relaxing, but it wasn't a game changer and I was definitely still feeling things. The contractions were about 6 minutes apart but were only lasting 45 seconds or so. I couldn't talk through them but I was still relaxed and able to chat in between them so I still thought we had a ways to go. We called the doctor at 9am. They were a little hesitant to send me to the hospital but they said they trusted me and if I thought it was the real deal I should go. We puttered around the garden, it was so lovely outside! Low humidity, sunny, 78 degrees, it just felt like a perfect day for a birthday &lt;3

We arrived at the hospital at 10am. We presented the nurses with a dozen donuts at my request because sometimes nurses are grumpy and I thought we might have a better chance of having a happy nurse if we fed them. I was still in good spirits, and the contractions I could kind of wiggle though. I was put into triage so I couldn't get on a ball or anything,I had to lay in the bed and be on a monitor, but it wasn't too bad. I got up to pee a few times to make sure my bladder was empty, and I used my little battery operated candle to focus on. Swaying my hips in bed helped a lot and the really good/intense contractions I blew horse lips and that helped. They checked me at 11am and I was 4cm so I could stay! I was so overjoyed I literally pumped my fist in the air and yelled ""YES!!"" 

We stayed in triage until noon, and the contractions stayed about 5 minutes apart but were longer now. My husband's cousin Audrey who is a nurse (and a mother of 4) came down and told us she had been assigned to our bed! I was so relieved I gave her a big hug and she just held me for a moment and I nearly cried. She gave me a gown to cover my front and another to cover my butt with. I asked why I needed two because I really didn't mind being a little uncovered. She said ""We have to cover your expensive bits. I only call them that because that's what my mother calls them, and if you ask her why she says ""Because men pay a lot of money to see those."" We just about died laughing. Her mother is 90. We walked a slow walk to the room so I could stop in between contractions. I apologized for being slow and Audrey said ""no need to apologize, no one is in any hurry. Take you time."" It was a nice reminder, there was no agenda or person waiting behind me or time limit, this was very comforting. 

I had thought I wanted a the room dark but we had this big window in there and it was so beautiful outside. Audrey got me a birthing ball. I was getting breathless and a little, whiny? The contractions were ALL in my hips. The best way that I could explain it was like really intense gas pain, but it was all in my hip joints and moved to my lower back. My husband applied counter pressure, and at this point my friend Nicki showed up (in her ""Nevertheless, she persisted"" shirt &lt;3) She came in and said ""Hi!"" and I said ""you have to hold my hands now!"" and she got on my level and held my hands while my husband pushed on my back. I was starting to vocalize and she reminded me to moan low which helped a lot! If you go too high you can feel your muscles get tense, so I focused on that. My husband put on some music. We didn't have a special playlist or anything, it was literally his most recent Spotify tracks which were actually funk covers of pop songs by a band called The Scary Pockets"". It didn't matter though, the sound gave me something to focus on and that helped. 

At this point I was feeling nauseas. I had asked about getting a cracker and ginger ale in triage, but they said no. I said I felt nauseas and they said ""we have meds for that."" I said ""Can't I just have a saltine though...?"" and was still refused. (Sometimes modern medicine confuses me.) I know why they have to refuse it, in case of emergency c-section etc. But things were going smoothly so I asked Audrey and she got me some crackers. Upon eating them I felt better for about 90 seconds and then promptly decieded that was a bad idea and puked. Audrey said ""Oh good! I love when women vomit! That's good for at least a centimeter!"" Nicki cleaned up the bed pan so I didn't have to smell it (gold star friend award goes too....). Every 4th contraction of so I puked again. That was rough, but I also knew it was a sign of closing in on the end. And I kept eating the crackers because even though I kept vomiting the temporary relief they gave my stomach was worth it. 

I had to pee again, but couldn't manage to get to the toilet, so husband held a bed pan under me and I squatted on the floor over it. Worked like a charm.

Even with all these bodily fluids and gross things happening there was so much excitement. Nicki and my husband were cracking jokes and Audrey was so encouraging. No one minded my odd requests or the vomit or anything. Everyone seemed so happy, it was a reminder that we were safe and our baby was safe. I took a lot of comfort in that. Had people been panicky I would have been panicky. 

Eventually I was in too much pain for the ball so I got up on all fours on the bed. I think this was transition. I was heavily vocalizing and I had to close my eyes because everything was visually too stimulating. The bed sheets, the light, the purple wall color, they all made me feel more sick. My vocalizing was getting louder and I couldn't get comfortable even between contractions. I mentioned this to Nicki and she assured me it wouldn't be long. In what felt like a compromise for a moral boost Audrey offered to check and see how far I'd progressed. I was 8cm but ""If I was generous I could say nine to be honest."" a few more contractions after that I had to pee again so Audrey put a big pad thing on the bed and just told me to pee right there. That's when I realized it wasn't the need to pee, but more that feeling of pressure which I was beginning to recognize as the urge to push. It was only happening during a contraction though. Audrey said to tell her when the urge was happening ever after a contraction, and about 10 minutes later it was near constant. I don't have the heart to glamorize it, it really just felt like the need to poop, but 10X as strong. Audrey went to get Dr. Walsh who I had met early in my first pregnancy but had not seen since. Once Dr. Walsh and Audrey came back I was instructed to lay on my back. I hesitated greatly because that sounded like it was going to be the most painful thing ever but between my sobs of protest Dr. Walsh said I could move back to all fours if I wanted to, but we had to try on my back first. 

I flipped over and Nicki helped me get in position with my legs, at this point my friend Crystal had arrived but I didn't know this since my eyes were still closed. She was petting my head and said something encouraging and then I cried because I was so happy she had come. 

Pushing. Was. AWESOME. All the pain from the contractions was minimized, and I was so much more comfortable on my back that I thought I would be. I was still having a lot of back pain, but I think the gravity of my belly hanging while I was on my hands and knees made it worse. Baby girl was sunny side up, so I had a hard time getting her to move with pushing. Dr. Walsh was encouraging though ""Good good. Okay. Now do it again."" I felt a bit like I did when I used to do Crossfit. That ""That was good now do it better"" hard ass coaching. All those movies you see where the women are making these crazy noises while pushing? That was me. But it wasn't out of pain, it was just so intense and frankly required use of so many muscles it was like yelling made them all work better. Everyone kept encouraging me to get her under my pelvic bone because she was a little stuck, but, just like her sister, during the last 10 minutes of pushing she violently turned and suddenly she was in the right spot to really get her to move. I yelped because when she did that my back just about broke but then pushing got much easier. I could feel her descending and then I asked to feel her head once she was crowning. I did feel the ring of fire but it was more like (again, not going to be romantic) pooping after you ate really spicy food the night before. Maybe because I was expecting the worst, but I distinctly remembering thinking ""this isn't that bad."" 

At 2:13pm after about 40 minutes of pushing and 11 and a half hours of labor Geneva was born! Since my eyes were closed when I opened them she was the first thing I saw. 8lb 4oz and red hair! I was over joyed, I was relaxed, and in charge and felt so happy. The sun was out, my friends were crying and holding my hand, my husband was a strong and steady emotional beacon (which I have always appreciated about him.) Her APGAR was 9, she was all pink and soft. We did skin to skin and then after she got weighed and poked and prodded she came right over to nurse. 

While I delivered the placenta Dr. Walsh made a comment about my needing stitches, she asked who did them last time and I said ""Dr. Riley"" and she said ""Oh, a man did these then, that explains it..."" (Needless to say I really like Dr. Walsh.). I did get a shot of lidocaine for the stitches, so I guess technically there was a small amount of pain medication there. But I was thankful for that. After she delivered the placenta I asked to see it, I was really just curious. She had the placenta and the whole sack together and she showed me. It was actually really cool. Dr. Walsh said she was going to send it out for testing though because she showed me the back part and as she explained even at not being 40 weeks the placenta was already showing signs of aging and calcification. So she said she was glad I didn't go any longer because with a baby that size at 39 + 5 it was clear she was fully cooked. 

Genie had to get her blood sugar tested because they were concerned that I had un-diagnosed Gestational Diabetes because of her size and age (an 8lb 4oz baby at 41 weeks is fine for example, but being that size and how far along I was she was considered big for her ""age"".) She passed just fine though and it was deemed that maybe I just make chubby babies &lt;3

Recovery was grand. I had an epidural with my first and I felt like I sat on ice packs for 2 weeks after. I had a ""deep 2nd degree tear"" with my first but there was much more mild tearing with this one. I attribute that to being able to have more control over pushing. I was able to get up and pee and move around so much faster. I don't shame anyone into getting an epidural or not, and had it been a longer birth or there been problems it makes sense that a game plan has to change. But this birth was so quick and easy it wasn't hard to not get meds for it. I'm glad I got to experience both things though. 

Baby tax in comments! she is up 4oz from her birth weight at a week old, and she grew a whole inch! She continues to nurse well and at 11 days postpartum my bleeding has just about stopped.

,StarWarsBattlefront,"Hello there Ben.

 

This post’s writing has started months ago. As a community of
Battlefront &amp; Battlefront 2 players from Hungary we gathered our thoughts,
questions. As you and your colleges in DICE, we also want our game to succeed
and we want to play it through the next few years. 

So i write here down all of this for you and your team.

I won’t tag you or anyone from DICE, because i know you
always read the topics. 

And please, if you can’t answer because of your hands are
tied, just let me know and if possible put it in the next Q&amp;A. (I guess we
need another soon.)

 

Development

· 
We badly need a Public Test Server or something
similar to this. With every update we get tons of gamebreaking bugs, which ones
easily can be avoided with this community tests.

· 
Will the new squad system apply for starfighter
modes too?

 

· 
In the future, have your team plans for:

o 
Campaign arcs from another eras. for example: 

  § 
Siege of Mandalore arc, introducing the first
dual wield lightsaber hero Ahsoka Tano and Captain Rex with dual pistols, the
opposite is Assaj Ventress and Cad Bane, 

  § 
Rogue One arc: attack on Eadu and the Battle of
Scariff with Jyn Erso and Orson Krennic etc.



o  Prequel
extraction add-in: Delta squad must escort dead jedis after Savage Opress’s
massacre off from Devaron. The attacker is the Republic, the defender is the
CIS. If clone commandos announced, we can play as the Delta squad, if not, we
must extract Delta squad as regular troopers and CIS must stop us. The map’s
structure can be similar to the Clone Wars series one, perfect for extraction.

o 
starfighter cargo with cargo ships vs standard
fighters. (This can be the best potential to introduce multi seat vehicles and
flyable LAAT)

o 
battlestation mode, examples: 

  § 
episode 4 – The First Death Star, Battle of
Yavin 4, 

  § 
episode 6 – The Second Death Star, Battle of Endor,

  § 
episode 7 – Attack on the Starkiller Base, 

  § 
episode 8 – Attack on the First Order
Dreadnought



o 
space to ground game mode

o 
more hero ships like The Ghost from Rebels

o 
reinforcements add-in’s: such as clone commandos,
commando droids, melee reinforcements, starfighter reinforcements (like B-wing,
TIE Defender)

o 
new star cards

  § 
new star cards for heroes, that swaps the skill.
(like now we have in trooper classes)

o 
new weapons, new mods for the stock weapons and
for the ones already in the game

o 
hutt contracts, or similar, like underworld
contracts because of multiple eras

o 
implementing Esport and competitive ready modes
like cargo, drop zone, droid run

o 
upgrades for the anti-cheat system

o 
performance optimalization for DX12?

 

Skin/customization ideas

· 
starfighter skins, paintings.

· 
armored clone officers.

· 
more armor customization options, not just skins
for trooper classes.

o 
different backpacks, jackets, uniforms, holsters,
helmets and colors+designs for these, for example: Jaig eyes painting for level
50. (Also, don’t want helmetless stormtroopers, clone troopers!)

o 
sunvisor, antenna, pauldron, electrobinocular, kama
for clone customization

o 
more species

o 
gender selection for all, excluding clone
troopers

· 
all alien races on all classes.

o 
This is the point where you answered with the
class distinction. I guess this is the most lesser fact wherefore these can’t
be implemented. With factions like the Empire and the First Order and their only
white armors have worse distinction than the alien races. If i see a heavy rodian
or a specialist rodian, me and anyone can make difference from the skills/starcards
and the class icons above their heads.

· 
emote features expansion

 

 

Possible and must have Quality of Life add-ins

· 
chat after end of matches

· 
using emotes on spawn screen

· 
change the menu class selection for an ingame
quick class and hero selector, to not break the battle immersion, just quick hop
back in 

· 
hero spawn system rework. From the start i
wanted to give feedback for this. I don’t like the system right now, when i
have enough battlepoints, i don’t want to sit in the class selection menu to
wait for an available hero popup. A way more better system can be implemented:
Queue for heroes when you get enough point for them, and if you next in the
queue you can switch instantly (you have 20 secs to push yes or no, like
original BF2, then go back to the end of the queue).

· 
private matches. This is a must have feature
right now. Communitys like ours heavily depending on it. If we want to play
together and don’t break other’s game with teaming up, we need a playground
like this. And, this is the first step to the games competitive mode. 

· 
custom star card hands for trooper classes and
heroes like in BF2015

· 
era selector, era specific playlist

· 
map size selector for arcade

· 
stat screen

· 
changing the default spawning class from assault
to another one

· 
REAL events to keep the community alive

o 
hunt modes: gungan, rattar, geonosian, wampa,
talz, undead nightsister

o 
order 66 mode

o 
death trooper zombies survival mode

· 
Main Menu changes like make more fluid and
transparent

o 
favorite and most played modes, customizable as
player

· 
more network settings like IPV6, IPV4 and more

 

 

Maps

· 
recycled maps from BF2015. EVERYONE loved it, please,
listen to the playing &amp; caring side of the community, not the darker side.

· 
maps from the campaign

· 
can we expect more Clone Wars era maps, not just
Geonosis?

· 
can we expect our coming mode, „conquest” for
all big maps we have?

 

I know you can’t answer all of the points, but i give it a
try, we just want to look into the future, to what can we get and we possibly
never get. 

Thanks for your time and keep up the good work Ben.

I had my playlist of satanic death metal playing and I wore my My Little Pony cosplay to hopefully speed along and increase the flow of clients. Things were going smoothly and at around one in the morning I decided to pack up for the night. I put my spiked anti rape condom in my rectum and unsheathed my sawed-off shotgun in preparation of the journey home. That's when I saw him. 

""Done already?"" he asked from the dark, far end of the block. He was obscured by shadow and looked to be extremely short. His voice was ethereal and ancient like a ghost's. I couldn't make out his face but he appeared to have a large pointed hat on his head. His limbs looked grotesquely small in proportion to his head, but I coudnt be so sure due to the distance between us. 

""I've got fifty dollars to splurge, I'm sure you wouldn't mind taking it off of my hands young man."" I wasn't afraid at first. This wouldn't have been my first encounter with the notorious Lollypop Guild. I called over to him. 

""You down to fuck little dude?""

""I can assure you I'm not so little where it counts young stallion.""

""Top or bottom baby? 0w0""

""Why don't you come closer and discover this for yourself?""

I strutted over to the man slowly and seductively. As I approached I could see that the top of his hat was wispy and furred. I assumed it was adorned with some kind of ornament. As I came nearer I realised it wasn't a hat at all. He had a head of tall, messy purple hair. 

I looked down at the man and regretted it immediately. Two bulbous, black eyes stared back into mine. Underneath the two gazing orbs was a little bump of a nose and a chubby cheeked grin. My worst fears had been realised. I had finally encountered a troll. 

A slimy fifty-dollar bill pushed its way out of a small slit inbetween the stubby legs of the creature. Its rotund and tight-skinned torso quivered as this happened. The fear crept up my back like a swarm of insects as the thing parted its lips to bare its white, glistening teeth. I screamed and nearly ran backwards as I pointed my gun at the horrible imp. It began to hobble towards me as it scooped up the money from the sidewalk and gestured it towards me.

I blasted the monster but the bullets simply sank into its flesh without any sign of a wound left behind. I recoiled in horror an oddly shaped, peach-colored mass fell out of the creature's bodily hole. Another soon followed as I realized that they seemed to be parts of one fleshy mass. Then a pink bump with one hole in the front appeared above the orbs. Slowly, all twelve inches of the monster's throbbing, twitching penis slithered into view.

I tried to kick the monster in the face, but it leaned back and licked the sole of my foot. I turned to run. I ran like there was a sale for screwdrivers at Best Buy and never once looked behind me. I stopped at the local police station and blubbered my story incoherently through tears of horror as the officer at the counter tried to calm me down. After a long while I finally recounted the events calmly enough to be understood. The officer grimaced worriedly. 

He told me that I was very lucky to be alive and ushered another policeman into the room. He had me retell the ordeal into a recording device. He then directed the other officer to escort me home. After he parked infornt of my home I pulled my member out of his asshole and climed out of the car. I thanked him profusely and he simply nodded and drove away. 

I was so shook by the events that I called my boss and told her I'm calling in sick. After her outburst swears and death threats she told me to take it easy and take off as much time as I need. I stayed home and binge-watched Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to ease my screaming nerves. All was well until about an hour ago. I went to use the bathroom and discovered a purple clump of hair in the sink.

**Background** by /u/simonthedlgger 

Eve 6 formed in Los Angeles, 1995, and within three years had released a platinum selling record that spawned a No. 1 rock song that continues to receive heavy play two decades later. They came up just after the Nirvana vacuum, among the first wave of bands that were influenced by Green Day, Weezer, and the like. It probably helped that original drummer Nick Meyers was booted for Tony Fagenson, son of Grammy Award winning producer Don Was. 

The band’s debut album was far and away their greatest success. With the exception of mainstream crossover “Here’s to the Night,” the band fast fell out of critical and commercial favor and were dropped by RCA after their third record. That said, Eve 6 still tours today.

**Album Review** by /u/simonthedlgger 

*Eve 6* is not the best album of 1998. There, I said it.

However, I’m simply not cool enough to pretend that in 1998, aged 9-10, I was vibing to Lauryn Hill (~2008) or riding the Aeroplane Over the Sea (~2004). No, I was buckled in the backseat while mom ran errands, top 40 radio a constant white noise. Gradually, certain songs stood apart from others, songs my adolescent brain absorbed and anticipated hearing again. Eve 6 wrote a few of those songs, and while the band has all but receded into the sepia-toned cubbyholes of nostalgia, I must pay tribute to a record that, along with *Insomniac*, *Jagged Little Pill*, *Dude Ranch*, and others, helped me to where I am today.

Eve 6 was signed to a major record label while its founding members were still in high school. Vocalist/lyricist/bassist Max Collins was 19 when *Eve 6* was released in the spring of ‘98. While countless records chronicle youth’s agony and euphoria, the indecision and longing, far fewer have been composed by individuals actively negotiating the absurd rush of hormones that is adolescence. Most notably, “Inside Out” was written during study hall (though, I bet that is true of several songs).

Youth is indeed the album’s primary motif, not only in the form of lyrics espousing teenage insecurity and eroticism, but in terms of the band’s neophyte grasp on its own material: of the 11 tracks featured, half a dozen are pure, uncut, 90’s alt. (several of which were used in *Can’t Hardly Wait*, one of which spawned a music video featuring Katie Holmes and Barry Watson of *Teaching Ms. Tingle* fame), while the remaining five rough drafts suggest RCA was more interested in pushing the next Green Day than enduring any sort of developmental period.

*Eve 6* opens with Collin’s trademark flood of prose, backed by driving crunch guitar and cleanly produced percussion: “Drag this neurotic to hysterics, leave him balked and unfulfilled. Holding inside, outwardly patient until the time he’ll call it.” The dense, bristling verses of “How Much Longer” give way to a charged, confessional chorus: “Peers don’t know what they can’t see, they can’t see inside of me: it’s sickening how comforting the privacy of the mind can be.” Goodness, those 90’s were angsty times.

“Inside Out”, yes, *that* “Inside Out,” is another strong example of the band’s ability to delve hooks out of Collin’s Merriam-Webster sponsored journal entries. The same refrain containing the iconic “heart in a blender” bit also makes use of the phrase “the lack thereof” -- that’s some elevated language. I have to imagine that this song not only drew me towards the world of guitar music, but did so with an emphasis on lyric and melody, interests I hold to today. It should be noted that in addition to four weeks as the No. 1 rock song in America, “Inside Out” spent nine weeks at No. 2 behind the Goo Goo Doll’s “Iris” and “One Week” by Barenaked Ladies. I mean, did someone say 1998?

Though nowhere near as well known as “Inside Out,” or “Here’s to the Night” for that matter, “Leech” was another single back in the day. It’s a mellower track, but opens up several times; there is a compelling sprawling quality to “Leech” ... the distorted guitars can be compared to big waves: graceful and clear, yet formless, crushing. Producer Don Gilmore does tidy work. But it is, of course, Collin’s wordplay that makes “Leech” truly Eve 6: “I know your comfort lies in lying to try to make your life make sense, but you’re not making sense with your two cents.” There’s some serious alliteration, internal rhyme, and homonym action right there. Hell of a catchy chorus, to boot.

Few songs remind me of my late childhood/early youth as much as “Open Road Song.” I think every seventh grade guitarist I played with in 2001 wielded the exact same crunch tone Jon Siebels uses for the lambently palm muted opening riff. Unsurprisingly, “Open Road Song” is an ideal tune to cruise to with the windows down on a warm, windy summer evening. “With every turn comes a new frame of mind--if I could frame my mind, where would it hang? My pile shakes as I hit eighty on the open road … this is an open road song.” Hell yes it is.

“Superhero Girl” brings more accessible alt./pop rock, this time with a little bit of southern garage bite, though Collins sounds almost hesitant as he croaks “Fuck that night out with the guys, I never get a word in with them anyways.” In truth, there are numerous spots throughout the record, mostly on the lesser tracks, where you can sense that Collins was less than comfortable in a professional studio setting, particularly when you compare his shy, at times stilted vocal delivery to various incidents of the day, most involving Collins strutting about nude (and drunk) in public. But again, letting the band cut an EP and tour for a few months was not in RCA’s plans.

The last track worth discussing is my favorite, “Tongue Tied.” These are some of the catchiest Eve 6 verses, choruses, and bridges you’ll hear, punctuated by lyrical craziness such as “Contaminate him, knock off his glasses, teach him to tamper with the cloning process,”; “Make me a cowboy like my next door neighbor,”; “Hooked on nicotine and phonics, fun like macroeconomics,” and “Vigilante thoughts and a cheap guitar, I am my own moviestar.” The verses are a great example of Eve 6’s reliance on clean guitar tones, one of the few things that separates them from a lot of gain-obsessed 90’s peers. Even better, the video for “Tongue Tied”, in support of the Tingle soundtrack, is 90’s overload.

Like I said to start, I won’t act as if *Eve 6* should be remembered by the sands of time. Even when it comes to nostalgia rock, there are stronger albums to choose from (what a blast Green Day’s Nimrod is!). But that doesn’t mean I don’t owe something of my current record collection/Spotify playlists to the deliriously catchy “Inside Out” and others songs described here. If you like alternative rock, particularly the pop-driven stuff that defined late 90’s radio, and you somehow overlooked *Eve 6*, check this record out. The follow ups are more interesting, but a lot spottier.

**Favorite Lyrics** by /u/simonthedlgger 

&gt; One thousand paces lead to the gate.

&gt; They’re all so boring, mild, sedate.

* “Tongue Tied”

&gt; So Cal is where my mind states but it’s not my state of mind.

&gt; I’m not as ugly sad as you.

&gt; Or am I origami? Folded up and just pretend.

&gt; Demented as the motives in your head.

* “Inside Out”

&gt; So break the bruised monogamy and let him fade to memory;

&gt; your erotic, wet, atomic eyes

&gt; keep reoccuring in my mind.

&gt; Do me a favor please and press your lips to mine.

* “Superhero Girl”

&gt; I don’t need a girl, don’t need a friend,

&gt; because my friend Lonesome is unconditional.

&gt; We’re flying, forever bored.

&gt; For a moment I love everything I see and think and feel,

&gt; I love my broken side view mirror

&gt; because it's so perfect, I'm so perfect, you're so perfect. You're not here.

&gt; I hear the change in gears.

* “Open Road Song”

***

**Talking Points**

* What are the bands that had a big influence on your current taste, but you don’t really listen to beyond nostalgic purposes?

* When you think of mainstream rock (and top 40 in general) from 1998, what songs and artists spring to mind?

* When “Inside Out” inevitably comes on the radio, do your hold or pass?

Living in Southern Australia provides some really good opportunities for mushroom hunting. In the months of winter, we have humongous flushes of P. Subaeruginosa which are readily available if one knows where to look.

After a short walk along a local parkland, I managed to acquire approximately 2grams of dried P. Subaeruginosa.

In the past, I’ve only ever taken threshold doses (2-3 mushrooms).

This time around however I decided to take the whole 2 grams (comprised of 8 caps and 5 stems).

Coming into the trip, my set and setting couldn’t have been better. I’ve recently made some big life decisions and gotten out of a job that I hated. I feel really good about the future and quite honestly I haven’t felt so good in a long while. I’m currently living with my parents (I’m 20 years old) properly for the first time in a year and a bit and it feels so good to be back home with them after living with a good friend of mine for a year and previous to that living at university. My parents are open and loving people and knew that I was planning on tripping. Whilst they had their oppositions, knowing that they were aware calmed my nerves and put me in a good mindset.

My setting was also fantastic. For this trip I stayed mostly in my room with my lamps on a low setting, bathing the room in their warm yellow glow. Added to this I lit my oil burner and candles, coating the room in a friendly comforting smell.

At around 10:40 pm, I finely chopped my specimens as best I could, and proceeded to soak them in freshly squeezed lemon juice for 20 minutes. After this 20 minutes, I combined my lemony mushroom concoction with a freshly brewed lemon and ginger tea.

At around 11pm I quickly drank the tea in a few big gulps, chopped up mushroom and all.

Within 20 minutes of consumption I was starting to come up, and boy was I coming up HARD. I stayed in my room and began browsing reddit and went onto a chat room for people that were tripping and wanted someone to talk to.

As I was chatting to a random person I increasingly began to experience changes in my perception and thought patterns. The visuals (11:40pm) were becoming very noticeable and intense, to the point where typing on the chat room became so difficult that I eventually gave up (11:50pm).

At this point the nausea was steadily increasing from ingesting the plant material. I was still coming up extremely hard and the visuals were intensifying greatly. My room was morphing and shadows were moving indiscriminately. Objects around my room were beginning to warp, and my entire field of vision was covered in a rainbow wash, similar to that of oil on water. By 12:20am, my nausea was almost unbearable, to the point where I thought I might have to throw up. After a further 20 minutes (which felt like a few hours) my nausea subsided, and the full extent of the trip started. At around 1am, a profound sense of tranquillity and contentment began to wash over me with increasing intensity and frequency. 10 minuets passed and I was completely overtaken by this feeling mixed with overwhelming euphoria.

I began to cry intensely. Not just cry, but an intense wailing that came from the very core of my being. I cried for two and half hours straight until almost 3:30am. I cried as if I had absorbed all the pain in the world like a sponge and that I was finally letting it all go. I cried for myself, for the overwhelming sense of achievement I felt in the things that I have done and all of the beautiful memories that I have from the past few years. I wept thinking of the long and hard days I had endured as a plumbing apprentice, a job I hated and yet pushed through for a year and a half, and how that job formed within me a mental toughness that I am grateful for. I cried and wailed thinking of all the people I have been intimately involved with, the people that I am lucky enough to call my friends and experience life with, and how much all those experiences mean to me. I cried for my grandmothers in their old age, knowing that there was not much more time for me to spend with them, and that I need to start making a legitimate effort to see them before its too late.

I cried and wailed for all the beauty the universe had created, for how lucky I was to have such beautiful people to call my parents and how much it means to be able to spend another year with them at home. I experienced an extreme sense of joy that I had finally found my purpose, and how excited I was to begin my Bachelor of Psychology in July after not being at university for over a year and a half.

During the peak, I wrote this on a word document whilst crying my head off:

“Endless rolling tears of contentment.

Total oneness that I cannot even begin to describe.

I feel completely and utterly emotionally torn apart in the best way possible.

Like the fibre of my being is getting a deep warm hug and massage.

It feels truly, wonderful.”

Throughout this stage of the trip, I played some very relaxing music from the “Dreamy vibes” playlist on Spotify. The synths and low melodic electronic sounds mixed occasionally with beautiful waterlike trickles added to the intensity of the beauty and emotion I was feeling. The music was like soft marshmallowy pillows consuming my auditory senses, which when mixed with the comfort of my bed produced a feeling of relaxation that I had never previously experienced.

After this extremely cathartic two and a half hours of crying, I went to the bathroom and washed my face. The coolness and freshness of the water on my face was simply amazing. I looked in the mirror of my bathroom and my visuals were still very much alive and well. My face looked ultra defined, and my skin began to ripple in colours of light pastel pinks, as though I were seeing my blood flow throughout my epidermis, as if it were right there in front of me. I experienced a profound few minutes of depersonalisation, as though the image of myself in the mirror was actually not me, but another being observing and looking deep within my ego and soul. Whilst it was a bit overwhelming, this experience did not scare me and was actually quite enjoyable, as though the “other being” in the mirror was pleased with what it saw within me.

It was close to 4:30 am at this point, and I went back to my bedroom and relaxed for a while. By 5am I was quite sober again, although slight visual distortions were still present. Just after 5:20am I decided to go to sleep after a light snack of avocado on toast, and fell asleep extremely quickly.

I awoke at 2pm and felt tired but refreshed mentally. I went for a walk with my mother in the evening around our suburb which felt really pleasant.

Overall this experience was exactly what I wanted. I felt like I learnt so much about myself, and healed a lot of things that were still buried in my mind. I don’t really feel the need to have another experience with Psilocybin for a long while after this trip, and feel extremely content at the moment.

I don’t really feel the need to have another experience with Psilocybin for a long while after this trip, and feel extremely content at the moment.

Thanks for reading! 

Peace :)

UPDATE: Recently, we’ve been trying out new ways to connect the Multiplayer and Zombies communities and create more crossover between the modes. Hence, our Attack of the Undead Community Event, which featured zombies in MP. This time, we’re giving the community more opportunities to get awesome gear that is native to Zombies, like the Moonraven Character/Uniform.

That’s why we rolled out new Contracts that are available in both Multiplayer and Zombies and that unlock cool new Zombies stuff in both modes. Whether you get these Contracts from Rideau, the Quartermaster in Nazi Zombies or from Captain Butcher, the current Quartermaster in Multiplayer, you have a chance to earn Moonraven variants. Once you complete one Contract (starting with the Moonraven Mountaineer Contract), another one will subsequently become available for you to complete.

To see the order in which these Contracts will roll over, head to the [Liberty Strike Community Event page on the Call of Duty website](https://www.callofduty.com/wwii/liberty-strike) and check out the Zombies Contracts chart.

,Rainbow6,"For those of you unaware, somewhere in the first year of R6:S, Ubisoft listened to the community and created a Tactical Realism mode. It reduced the HUD to it's most basic form, removed spotting mechanics and added a realistic ammo management system (persistent ammo counts in magazines etc). A mode analogous in concept to the Battlefield series popular 'Hardcore' mode. It was added to the game as an optional ruleset for custom games because at the time, the population of R6:S wouldn't have been able to handle the fragmentation of the playerbase into another playlist (anyone who queued ranked in this time can attest to this). 

It's a great gamemode that leans a little closer to the original R6 concepts. So now we've blossomed into the game and vast playerbase we have have today, are we likely to see it return as it's own fully fledged playlist for all the wannabe operators we've got?

 I for one would love to see it come back. 

I'm not good at reddit, so if anyone knows how to push this towards the devs, I'd appreciate it.

,SuggestALaptop,"Good evening,

I've recently entered into the world of over the road trucking and would like some advice on a laptop.  Usually I like to build my personal computers and while the idea of a custom build in a tractor appeals to me, I don't want to pursue it at this time.  The world of laptops has always frusturated me with the exact same laptop having different specs so I come seeking your advice.  What do I need this computer to do?

Drive everything multimedia via HDMI &amp; Bluetooth to my television pre-equipped in the sleeper berth &amp; sterio when I'm driving.

What do I mean by that?  

Thin and light!
Everything takes up space in the sleeper berth of a truck.  So I'd like this to take up as little space as possible.  15'' screen.

**TV!**
I have about 2tb of TV shows, music, and other media that I'd like to put into the hard drive of the laptop itself.  I'd like that hard drive to be SSD since the vibrations of the truck can get kinda intense.  If that's outragiously expensive I'd just throw it on an external hd on top of some towels or something.  

**Gaming!**
So I don't do anything really heavy, and all the images will be pushed to the TV in the sleeper most of the time.  I do enjoy Civilization VI, Kerbal Space Program, Skyrim, Fallout, annnnd naturally FTL (other small Indy games).  Resource heavy game that FTL.  

**Music!**
I'd like for this thing to also drive music when I'm out over the road.  Pushing music to my sterio via Bluetooth.  Near as I can tell every laptop has Bluetooth now days.  But I'd love to build a playlist on it the night before and play it going out.  

**Phone Home!**
I'd like something with a reasonable front facing camera so I can call my girls back home.

**Battery life!**
Isn't so much of an issue inside the tractor.  I have an APU that pushes enough power for a microwave and a fridge.  So if we can save money there that'd be great.

**Price range!**
I guess the $1,000-$2,000 range.  Less is better naturally.  As I said I recently entered into this world.  Everything I don't spend will pay for bills back at home or the loans I used to get here.  Not to mention I still gotta get stuff to cook for the truck.

I looked at this one, but as I said idk if it's a good deal or not.  Seems fine.  But, anywho, I'll stop rambeling.  Any help or insight you can provide would be helpful.

,halo,"This has been my major complaint for all recent titles and I believe it is the quickest way to kill a player base.

I am talking about matchmaking. Before Halo: Reach, Halo 3 had an extremely strict matchmaking to ensure that one team isn't going to donkey stomp on the others (or at least for Ranked play). Party parity was enforced (if you are a group, you play only even groups), and the max skill delta was 10 in either direction. Once Reach came out the criteria was significantly relaxed, and after 343i's take over it was worse. This isn't just a 343i issue, as all games now experience this issue.

Last night while Playing H2 classic (a playlist I was 1 in), I was consistently matching up against high level 40s and if I were new to Halo 2 I would've not had fun at all. Lop sided matches are not fun for new players or for experienced players, all it does is ruin the game. Halo 5 does this as well, I will face Platinums which I stomp, or top 100 Challenger sweats that I have no chance to beat (as I don't consistently play the game).

I hope this issue is resolved in the MCC patch, but please pay attention to the matching process in Infinite. The issue has been exacerbated due to the huge push for eSports. You have to keep games balanced (not only for skill level, but for party parity).",t2_91n7h,,,0,,We need to talk about something that cannot go wrong with Halo Infinite's MP.,[],r/halo,False,6.0,,,,,False,,False,dark,,,public,,,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},,False,6,,,,self,False,,[],,,True,,,text,6.0,,,text,self.halo,,,,,,,False,False,True,False,False,,,False,,True,False,False,,,,,,,t5_2qixk,,,,,8vmz7p,,,koreanoverlord,,9,True,all_ads,False,,,,/r/halo/comments/8vmz7p/we_need_to_talk_about_something_that_cannot_go/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/8vmz7p/we_need_to_talk_about_something_that_cannot_go/,188695,1530571138.0,0,,False,,,,,,,,1347948099.0,1536474812.0,,,

,popheads,"Late night. A dimly-lit club.

It’s Gay Night™. Hundreds of homosexuals, their queerness ranging from high enjoyment of same-sex intercourse to exceptional musical preferences, have flocked to the club. You’re standing by the bar, drink in hand. Maybe it’s the alcohol or, perhaps, your old and tired ass, but it seems like everything tonight is a bit lethargic and sluggish, as though the dancefloor were covered in invisible slime. The eardrum-shattering bass and the twinkling neon lights put you to sleep. You try counting your fingers. Yep, there’s still 10 of ‘em. It’s not your third appletini.

Someone in your proximity yawns loudly. “Oh no ^(flo should have won)”, you think. It must be your straight™ friends, who agreed to assist you tonight. You turn to the side.

“Karen-“

“It wasn’t me!”

“I… Nevermind. Please, be honest with me… is everything alright? Are you having fun?”, you ask, trying to fake a smile.

Karen smiles back, equally insincerely.

“Oh yeah, totally! Now excuse me, I need to go to the bathroom. Makayla, can you?...”

As they disappear in the slowly thinning out crowd, you still can make out a faint “I can’t believe I sacrificed Ed Sheeran karaoke night at Brenda’s for this snoozefest!”. The blood starts boiling in your veins.

“It’s all your fault.”

Your livid gaze wanders in the direction of the stage. He’s still there – a singer of supposed Tumblr fame, hip with all the youngins, whose name you have already forgotten. You observe him, as he sways awkwardly by the microphone. Beyond question, it must be the constant stream of monotone lyrics that come out of his mouth that put the dancefloor to sleep. “Yaaaaas”, screech the few underage gays, who pierced through the crowd, hoping to reach the lifelessly wobbling body. “I can’t believe this is gay culture now”, you sigh with a sense of malaise.

“I wish actual talented, critically-acclaimed performers, such as Madonna, Kylie Minogue or Britney Spears were here”.

Now, you will never be able to explain what happens next. Maybe it’s Friday the 13th and your mom says the same thing, cause this is some Freaky Friday shit. All you know is that you will never forget the sight of a falling floodlight and the sound of screaming teenagers.

##[Britney Spears – Blackout](https://s12emagst.akamaized.net/products/1927/1926539/images/res_81265a91f535b2712e32461ad4af0f50_full.jpg)

The lights turn to a very slutty shade of purple. You see the microphone transforms into a huge-ass strip-club pole. And who is it that slides down the pole?...

*It’s Britney, bitch.*

The Gays shriek in awe, some of them already turned straight. Britney works it so hard, your appletini turns into a [bitchtini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4E36Opq89w). She moans “*Gimme more*!” repeatedly over the iconic Danja-produced beat in an almost sexual manner, but you, an Educated Gay™, already know the sad truth behind these lyrics – Blackout is a reminder of a sad episode of Britney’s life, showing how fame can destroy and dehumanize. She then proceeds to address the media again in *Piece of Me*, her robotic vocals, as it were, mocking the criticism of her being an empty doll and not a competent artist. The following AutoTune-soaked songs, *Freakshow* and *Radar*, elevate the crowd into a state of transhumanist euphoria, until Britney finally shouts “Let me *break the ice*!”, reminding everyone that, in fact, it was her who invented anime. You can literally see the ice shattering in your glass – but wait – the glass seems to be breaking as well! Is it the speakers? Is it *her power*? No. It’s…

##[Kylie Minogue – X](https://images.genius.com/fa6978e16758c5b7d069c1ae076a7679.1000x1000x1.jpg)

A giant, gleaming white spaceship hovers over the stage. It positions itself gently in mid-air and, quite ungently, lands, squashing Brit and all that was left of her Glory. The Gays shriek in dismay, but then another joyous (and thirsty) squeaking emerges, as some of the more observant homosexuals notice that the DJ has been replaced by no other than Calvin Harris.

*How do you describe a feeling?*

The airlock unseals, revealing a petite, and yet undeniably majestic, smoke-soaked silhouette of the Queen of Australia. The Gays are ecstatic.

*I’ve… only ever dreamt of this…*

…you think, as soon as Kylie utters these exact words. “I am shook, I love mind control now”, you shout, as Kylie inquires her lover to tell her how he feels *in her arms*. In another attempt to understand the biological complexity of the hoo-mans, Kylie sings her glam rock anthem *2 Hearts*. You can’t help but shout “*Wow!*” along with her. Your unconscious bopping seems to actually not the result of telepathy – you’re legitimately thankful for her triumphant return to the music industry after surviving the deadly threat of cancer (yes, that’s exactly what you thought). After convincing everyone to stream her album on Spotify in the sultry *Speakerphone*, the crowd goes crazy, as the club is filled with what seems to be a Sophie track. “*Nu-di-ty*”, repeats the glitchy voice, as if it were to announce something. Kylie tears off her avant-garde spacesuit. Her body starts to transform and warp. You can’t believe your eyes – [Kylie was an alien all along](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8oHKAUmMdM)! Or was she? Nah, it’s just…

##[Madonna – Confessions on a Dance Floor](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-E2Yc9LFL._SL1425_.jpg)

*Je suis désolé…*

*Lo siento…*

*Ik ben droevig…*

*Sono spiacente…*

*Perdóname…*

Words of regret and compassion fill the club. Is she sorry for murdering Kylie? Is she sorry for mentally scaring all the twinks on the dancefloor? You aren’t sure. What you know for certain is that these are the words of pure apology, almost god-like in their clarity, and that your pussy is now quaking in a very remorseful, ascetical manner.

*Gomenasai…*

*Mujhe maaf kardo…*

*Przepraszam…*

*Sli'kha…*

*Forgive me...*

“What are you apologizing for?...”, cries out the crowd. Madonna lifts her head up ever so slowly and, her lips curled in a devilish smile, says: “You’re right. [I still hate those fucking hydrangeas.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qlXMA0v-WA)” Suddenly, the club erupts with a bouncy disco beat of the Guinness World Record-awarded *Hung Up*, the song that certified Madonna’s legendary status. Obviously, the glitzy pussy-poppery doesn’t end at that – you can’t help but bop to the Donna Summer-inspired *Future Lovers* and *Forbidden Love*. “I love you!”, you shriek in an awed exclamation. “*New York* is not for little pussies who scream!”, replies the Queen, and, somehow, you love her even more. The show ends with *Get Together*, an ecstatic anthem, and you end up achieving transcendence.

The next morning, you decide to cut down on your drinks.

So, now that I caught your attention with this messy write-up, I'd like to thank /u/whatareblackhole and /u/sh-ether for proofreading and overwhelmingly positive feedback! Also I wanna thank /u/kappyko and /u/mudkip1 for the inspiration... I probably should've let you know first. ~/u/awryj

These three albums are one of our absolute favorites and I can't stress enough how important they are to us. We can't wait for you to listen to them all - for some of you it will be just another revisit, and for others - the first time ever, and that's what we're the most excited about. Their sound is timeless and incredibly influential; all of these albums have influenced the modern PC music scene to an extent (especially X)... Also we feel at least 20% more gay listening to them. So what's not to love? Even if you're into pop punk or indie, give them a chance! ^(Your bussy will thank you later.)

Anyway, without further ado, we invite you to the...

##THE MID-2010S RULES COMEBACK

hey kappy i hope u dont mind but im gonna rip these off from ur post ok [thanks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNrZCaZKH-0)

* Listen to each song and **assign each a score between 1 and 10**. Decimals are fine, but **please refrain from giving decimal scores that have two decimal spots.** What is wrong with you? Don't give a 6.75, that's just ridiculous.
 
* There is a **minimal average of 4.000** and a **maximal average of 10.000**. No excessive stanning.

* **Yes, you have to listen to every song**.  I will not accept your ballot if you have a score missing. That's because it will crash the program. It's exhausting when I'm putting in all the scores in last minute and somebody decided not to rate ""Why Should I Be Sad"" because they were so bored with the album they forgot to put something in for the last track!

* Your scores should **NOT** be considered confidential. How have you not figured this out by now? It's a rate! They will be revealed!
 
* You may give **ONE** song a **0** and **ONE** song an **11**. By one, we mean that this is **one song total**, not one song per album. Please reserve these for your least favorite and most favorite tracks; **excessive sabotage ruins rate results**. It's *annoying*!
 
* You **can** change your scores at any time! Feel free to PM either me or /u/sh-ether again afterwards.
 
* The program makes things a lot more efficient and reduces errors on our part, this does mean that scores need to be sent in a very specific way. The easiest way to make sure your scores follow the necessary format is to **use the pre-prepared link, found right here. PLEASE USE THAT**. You can copy and paste it to a notepad file or something and fill in your scores there, but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE use that format to send in you scores.
 
* If you don't follow the format, we'll still accept your ballot, but I reserve the right to publicly shame you and your inability to follow basic instructions. And I will present your username in large, bold text making fun of you every single time a song is revealed. We'll also probably/definitely ask you to fix it on your own if the issue seems like it's going to take a long time to correct.

* If you want to attach a comment to a specific song (which is encouraged!) write it right after your score. Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space!

* If you want to attach a comment to an album, add a colon after the ALBUM name and put your comment there!
 
* If, after submitting your scores, you change your mind about a certain song, I WILL change it up until I stop accepting scores.

**This is the ONE AND ONLY correct format:**
 
&gt;I Love New York: 1 What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? 
 
**These are INCORRECT, in fact, LITERALLY ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT IS ABOVE IS INCORRECT:**
 
&gt;I Love New York:1: What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? 
 
&gt;I Love New York: What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch?  1

&gt;I Love New York: 1/10 What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch?
 
&gt;I Love New York: What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little b1tch? 
 
&gt;I Love New York: 1-What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? 
 
&gt;I Love New York: 1 (What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch?)

**You can also comment on albums by adding a colon after the album title!**

&gt;Album: X: Help I am American and I do not know Kadie Meringue. Who this

**NOT LIKE THIS**

&gt;Album: X Help I am American and I do not know Kadie Meringue. Who this

im too lazy to come up with more examples but u get the gist

* **Bonus tracks CAN NOT GET 11s OR 0s.** If you want to do the bonus rate, **rate ALL of the songs**.

thanks kap

ok thats it

The One with the Dumpster Diving

**Random Thoughts**

* Mini Rant - That stupid writer’s strike shortened a perfectly good season of this show as well as essentially murdered one of my favorites shows. RIP Pushing Daisies.
* Why are all of Chuck’s friends and coworkers so skeevy? Mammary cam? Eye roll.
* This was a fun episode. I loved the scavenger hunt feel of finding the marlin/ring. Plus Casey intimidating the nerds never gets old.
* I think the true title for this episode should be Chuck vs. the Underground Bunker.
* I had the biggest belly laugh at Chuck literally wiping his hands clean of Jeff and Lester during that interrogation scene with Casey.
* Do the actors on this show do the majority of their own stunts? Or is it mainly stunt doubles?
* The fact that Sarah has an email account at Wienerlicious is equal parts hilarious and ridiculous.
* Why is the ring actually inside the marlin? Seriously, Morgan.
* Wienerlicious and Buy More really need to invest in tighter security options.
* Eww, don’t give her that dumpster ring without washing it with soap first.
* As an avid Grey’s Anatomy fan, I’ve grown accustomed to crazy cliffhangers. This episode was wrapped up so nicely. Were they not sure if it was going to be renewed at this point?

**Favorite Quotes**

* “He’s the spy who spies on spies.”
* “We have the store to ourselves. We should take off all our clothes.” “Don't make me uncomfortable to be alone with you.”  *Says the guy who was playing strip poker last episode.*
* “You go. I’ve got the scraggly troll.”
* “WHERE’S MY FISH BARTOWSKI?”
* “OK. Someone wasn’t hugged enough as a child.”
* “Can’t fit the police into your social schedule?”
* “You’re no hot dog maker.” “Bring it on, pita girl.”
* “Where are you Chuck? I need the ring. This is not awesome.”

**You're never too late to comment! Remember this thread is on contest mode for the first 12 hours!** 

* **Before you comment please CTRL+F to see if your song has been said, if it has been said your comment will be deleted!**

* #If you see duplicate comments, report the newer one so mods will delete it!

* Please provide links with your votes!

* Remember just because a hook may be iconic that does necessarily mean it's their best hook.

* Make sure you don't post the same hook as someone else!

* Voting for best hook will close 12 hours from the time this was posted

* Taking suggestions for next week just DM me!

* This could also be any feature that he does

* The artist *has* to rap/sing the hook and it can't be a feature doing it, for example Gucci Mane's Lemonade like last week.

**Introduction:** Hello r/hiphopheads, I will be running the best hook thread once a week every Sunday! This will be run very similarly to the Best Verse Threads we had a while ago, as you can see the format is almost identical to the old threads. All you have to do is just **post your favorite Rick Ross hook with a link to the hook.** And if you want to, you can quote the hook word for word in your comment. **The comment with the most upvotes will be deemed that artists best hook!** And at the end of the year we will decide the best hook of the ones we collected! This is my first time doing anything like this so any recommendations to formatting, anything else helpful would be great!

,Twitch,"Hey everyone! First, sorry if this is a newb question - I recently switched from streamelements + nightbot over to Streamlabs and Streamlabs Chat Bot and I'm loving it, but still figuring out some of the nuances. 

The last 2 times I've tried using the song request feature in chatbot, here is what happens:

* I load an existing spotify playlist in chatbot. I see the playlist songs over in the right side of the panel, so I know they've been imported. 

* I hit ""play"" on a song \*IN\* spotify when my stream is on the ""starting soon"" screen, because I have a couple specific songs in Spotify I want to play for my intro. I make sure shuffle and repeat playlist are \*unchecked\* in the Spotify app. 

* Once I switch to my ""live"" screen in streamlabs, I push \*stop\* in the Spotify playlist on the current song and I hit \*play\* on the playlist within chatbot. 

* A viewer requests a song, and their song plays next (I see it in the left side of the panel in chatbot). 

* Then Spotify starts playing songs that aren't in either my chatbot playlist I've loaded OR even in any existing Spotify playlist I have. Sometimes, it plays a song from the playlist AND a random song in Spotify at the same time!

Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong? It had me so flustered last night during stream. Because of course I was playing a multiplayer game with another streamer and had 2 raids come through at the same time, and all my songs were wonky and I was so stressed, haha :) I'd love to get this figured out. If you are able to offer any advice, I'd be so grateful!",t2_36g6ud8,,,0,,Streamlabs Chatbot Song Request Doesn't Work Quite Right?,[],r/Twitch,False,6.0,techsupport,,,,False,,False,light,,,public,,,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},Tech Support,False,0,,,,self,False,,[],,,True,,,text,6.0,,,text,self.Twitch,,,,,,,False,True,True,False,False,,,False,277209c6-bcfe-11e3-91e0-12313b0d38eb,True,False,False,,,,,,,t5_2s0fe,,,,#9f364c,8v4h0v,,,pixelcandy,,3,True,all_ads,False,,,,/r/Twitch/comments/8v4h0v/streamlabs_chatbot_song_request_doesnt_work_quite/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/8v4h0v/streamlabs_chatbot_song_request_doesnt_work_quite/,363474,1530388504.0,0,,False,,,,,,,,1496679164.0,1536465975.0,,,
,wowservers,"As the title says I'm looking for new staff members and testers of our new systems. The server is named ""Project BalnaZZar"", our current plan is to make it a PTE highrate realm (e.g 3-4x and optional 1x with rewards once you ding 1-80 without any xp mods). The progression will be unlocked once a end-patch raid was cleared (till we hit WoTLK content). For example if you clear AQ40 - TBC content will be unlocked (as well as leveling to 70), that way we can receive reports for the old content and fix as much as we can. Current highest priority in testing content is: 

1) World Clustering \[any issues related to it\]. 

2) Naxxramas (completely rewritten and still being optimized, we do push our fixes to the public emulators and repositories so in the end the private server community can have a bug-free game experience).

3) Pathfinding - we have modified hardly the Player/PET movement as well as creatures, in order to fix any lag/stuttering or npcs falling underground we will need your help with the specific zone/area and npc.

Currently we have:  
\- World Clustering: This system allows us to hold more than 30,000 REAL players at the same time (tested and peaked with \~63,000 bots on 3 servers (2x X5660\[12core/24thread\] + 64G ram) and we barely hit 30&amp;#37; of server capacity. \[note that the bots do not send that much opcodes/packets so the actual player count may be less\]. Other functionality is that the world (worldserver) is split into nodes, that way we can really achieve these numbers as well as up to 30d server uptime (by restarting only sub-nodes, e.g Naxxramas mapnode, Ulduar mapnode...)

\- Rewritten movement: As we had to implement the clustering feature we hit a bottleneck between the BNet(proxy) and worldservers that messed up both player/creature movement, so we decided to go full #yolo and port/rewrite everything into the BNet(proxy) server so the movement is much smoother than before. Pathfinding wasn't ignored either, we did tons of optimizations, you will rarely see a npc going underground, some might be stuttering but that's from the small rotation angles in the waypoints (you will see demo into the raw/unedited videos below).

\- Voice chat! Yes, we do have implemented/written voice chat from the ground. All opcodes and functionality has been implemented (creating channels, muting, kicks, voice priorty and so on..) but sadly the codec used in WoTLK is very very old and the quality is worse than WW1's voice comms.

\- Unique website/server features: 

We have implemented SRP-6 web authentication. That means your password IS NOT STORED and KNOWN by us, that way we can prevent any data leaks when(if) we get a database leak. This feature is disabled by default as it requires the end-user (you) to have java installed, whenever you enable this feature a password change will be required so you can have full benefit from it.

Our website written from the ground with very limited database usage (e.g no read/write access on auth/char/world databases, everything goes trough API that is highly secured), unique API system that can log pretty much anything ingame, we are currently using it to implement a blizzard-ish armory, with boss kill counters, last looted items, top achievements, achievement points and so on. Our forums are custom written(currently with basic functionality like markdown formatting, quoting, lock/unlock thread, delete and report, i don't think we'd need something else) as well, you can have a nickname OR your character as a ""post profile"".  


\- Donations: We WILL have a donation store but there won't be any garbage like XP boosts, items or anything else that will make you have any advantage over other players. Only visual items (pets, mounts, tabards, shirts...), maybe some transmog items.. Or you will be ""UNIQUE"" if you subscribe to the ""Premium"" package, some of the features are:  Custom nickname e.g ""FALL1N1"" instead of ""Fallin"", portable mailbox / auctioner(usable by anyone in your group) and a custom mount (flightmaster) - for example you can have your own Onyxia (sized), this is just a model swap (e.g Gryphon &gt; Onyxia), no other benefits like speed, more flight paths and so on.

We will use the income to cover server fees and save some of it for the upcoming months (if we get a hard time), rest amount will be split evenly between staff (depending on their rank) or sent to a random charity (that will be discussed again by staff members)

,DrCreepensVault,"My world went black at the blink of an eye. My lungs burned like raging Hell fire, that was the first thing that I noticed noticed when I opened my eyes. Intense heat coated my body like a tight leather jacket. Everything around me was a grey blurry mess. I felt something pull me on my right arm. I looked and I could see a blurry Amber tearing me out of the truck and yelling at me to move. I trudged out of the car, I could hear the flames roar as she put my arm around her neck moved us both away from the furious inferno. My ears were then assaulted by the boom of the exploding dually. My world once again dimmed to a black empty void. When I awoke my head was throbbing and my sheets were soaked with sweat. I looked around and I noticed that I was back at the house.

“Back with us?” Abraham asked.

He was sitting at a desk, his head was buried in a Stephen King Book. The lamp at the desk damn near lit up half the room.

“What happened?” I croaked.

“Amber told us that you guys crashed into a meteor that fell into the road. Then you guys barely escaped before the truck burst into flames,”

“Did the supplies make it?” I asked.

“Luckily, they did. We noticed you two were gone for quite awhile. So James and I went looking for you and we found Amber carrying you down the road.” Abe explained.

“Wow!” I chuckled.

Abraham laughed.

“That girl was carrying you like it was nothing, along with all of the food and supplies,”

“Damn that girl must be stronger than Hercules!” Me and Abe laughed about that for a few minutes. It was good to lighten up the mood a little bit being that I barely escaped with my life. I tried to move out to get out of the bed but a sharp pain ran up my arm. I howled in pain as I fell back on to the bed.

“Careful there,” Abe said with a concerned voice.

“What the fuck?!” I shouted.

“You shattered your wrist in the crash Simon,”

“Shit!” I said looking at my right hand. It was wrapped in a purple cast that went down my forearm.

Abe rushed over to me.

“Easy there partner. You can’t put too much weight on it.”

Abe held out his hand and I used my good hand to pull myself up to my feet.

“Are you hungry?” He asked. “I made some Firin Makarna.”

“What?” I asked.

“It’s a Turkish dish that is similar to Mac and Cheese. There is a little bit left from last night. We kind of pigged out on it while you were out.”

“How long was I out?” I asked.

“About fifteen hours.”

“Sheesh.”

“The girls and James are out in the backyard grilling some burgers and hotdogs.”

“Where’s Chad?” I asked.

“He went out to find an electronic store to get some video games,”

I could hear music playing from outside. I got out of bed and looked out of a nearby window and found James cooking the food on the grill while the girls danced. They were dancing to the song Freeze by T-Pain and Chris Brown. I also noticed that a small labrador puppy was running around the backyard and yapping like crazy.

“When did we get a dog?”

Abraham sighed.

“Sarah found the dog outside when it was raining earlier. I told her it would just be another mouth to feed but she wasn’t having it. She was determined to keep it.”

“If worst comes to worst we can let the dog go,” I said. “I was just afraid it would be like the the dogs at the bar in BeattyVille,”

I told Abe about what happened to Chad’s father back at the bar. He was horrified. Abe went on to tell me that when him and Spencer were leaving Indianapolis, the family that lived next door to them was torn apart by their German Shepherd and their Doberman Pinscher. I cringed at the thought, a man, woman and two toddlers being eaten alive by their dogs. It just made me wonder how long we could last in a world like this one.

“Let’s go outside,” I said blocking the morbid thought from my mind.

We went outside. James was done cooking the food and everyone was sitting at the patio table enjoying their food.

“He lives!” James cried.

“Yep,” I said.

“Grab some grub and join the party,” Amber said.

I noticed that the music calmed down a little bit. The song, When Rainbows Never Die by The Steeldrivers was playing. I put my hands in my pockets and I realized that the box of condoms was no longer there. My heart dropped into my stomach like a stone in pond, but I couldn’t worry about that now.

“How’d you get the music?” I asked.

“We found an old an Iphone in Sarah and Chads bedroom as well as some speakers. This guy has a very random playlist,” James explained.

I saw the puppy approach the table and it sat near everyone and started panting.

“Hey there Shamrock,” Sarah said.

“Shamrock?” I said confused.

“It was on the dog's collar,” Abe informed.

Sarah broke a piece of her hot dog off and gave it to the dog.

“Hey, I didn’t make all this food for the dog!” James protested.

“Get a grip James,” Sarah scoffed. “Haven’t you ever had a dog before?”

“I have but food isn’t something we can just blow like chump change,” He replied.

“The second that dog becomes more trouble than it's worth I’m putting a bullet in it’s head,” I thought to myself. “It’s the end of the fucking world, we cant let a dog eat up everything.”

“Hey guys,” Chad said as he came outside onto the padeo.

“Babe your back!” Sarah cried as she ran up to Chad. She threw her arms around him and kissed him.

“Did you find some games?” She asked.

“I did. I found a PS3 and I just hooked it up to the T.V in the living room.”

“Great. I’m feeling nostalgic let's pop some games in,” James said excited to play the game.

“I got Sonic And Sega AllStars Racing and both Black Ops games and Madden 2012. I also have four controllers so four of us can play at a time,”

“I’m in,” Abraham said. “I’m the oldest so I’m player one,”

“Nah man I-

“James that is the rule. Every gamer knows that,” Chad explained.

James rolled his eyes.

“Are you getting in on this?” Asked Chad.

“It will be more fun with all four of us,” James said.

“Yeah, I’m up for some video games,” I agreed.

“Alright cool. Abraham, Chad, you guys fire up the Playstation. Me and Simon will be in the living room shortly.”

Abe and Chad went back in the house. “Whats up?” I asked.

“I told Abraham that Spencer turned into one of those Yellow Eyed things,” said James.

“What? He’s going to-

“He’s not going to do anything man. Hell, it didn’t even halfway faze the old man, he thinks Spencer can be cured from that or something. He’s probably in denial or something. So it’s best we keep it that way, we don’t need a six foot tall, grief struck nutcase on our hands.”

“True,” I agreed.

“Now let's go inside and play some video games,” James said.

“Alright, I have to take a shit. So you guys can start the game without me,”

I didn’t actually have to take shit but I was as nervous as a cat on a hot tin roof. I went upstairs to the bathroom and closed the door. I threw some water on my face to help myself calm down. I kept wondering who found the condoms. I just knew that if Amber found them in my pocket my chances with her were as good as dead. I damn near had a heart attack when the bathroom door opened. It was Amber and the first thing that I noticed was that she was holding the box of Trojan condoms that I had in my pocket.

“You can’t just barge in like that!” I cried trying to get her away from me.

Amber walked in the bathroom and closed the door.

“Do you have a girlfriend I don’t know about?” asked Amber.

“No, I-

“So your trying to get in bed with one of us girls?”

“No I just. I don’t know if…”

Amber put her hand on her hip and gave me that look. You know the look every female gives you when they catch you in a lie. I knew the jig was up and the best thing to do was to own up to it.

“Alright look, I have a thing for you and I just thought maybe-

“Maybe? Is there something wrong with me?” she asked.

“No of course not.”

“Did you think that I was a lesbian? I just want to know why you thought you wouldn’t have a shot with me.”

“You look amazing. You have a pretty face, a great body. I figured you might have more options than just an average geek like me.”

“Your a pretty good looking guy Simon,” Amber mused. She wrapped her arms around my neck and gave me a seductive smile. I grinned as I felt my face turn red.

“I’ll make love to you,” she said warmly.

“Why?” I asked with a nervous chuckle.

“With the world falling apart and cats and dogs eating people, I don’t think we got a lot of options. So why not enjoy each other?”

I wrapped my arms around her waists and we began kissing. I slid my hands down her back and squeezed her ass. She moaned a little, I then reached for her white pink T-shirt and I pulled it off of her. My heart raced inside my chest, I swear that it sounded like a horse running in the Kentucky Derby. I couldn’t believe this was actually happening, I was about to have sex for the first time. I was always embarrassed at the fact that I was twenty-one and I hadn’t done the deed yet, but the time was finally here and I couldn’t mess this up. Amber leaned forward, she put her hand on my crotch and I felt myself get hard. She kissed my forehead and looked me in the eyes.

“I’m not having sex in a bathroom like some bar skank,” Amber laughed.

“Alright,” I mused.

I picked up Amber bridal style.

“Oh what a gentleman,” Amber complimented. I carried Amber into the room I woke up in. I closed the door with my foot and I threw Amber on the bed. She giggled like a schoolgirl and began unhooking her bra. When she took it off and threw it across the room. I ripped off my shirt and took my pants off. I crawled in bed with Amber, as naked as the day I was born. We kissed some more and then she put the condom on for me. Having sex for the first time was great. Amber was on top for most of the time and we switched it up towards the end. I’m not going to lie, I didn’t last very long before I blew my load. That wasn’t the first time I had done that but usually it was with my right hand. We laid there and spooned for a few minutes as we caught our breath.

“Was this your first time?” Amber asked.

“Yeah,” I admitted.

“I figured, sex with virgins is usually slow and bumpy. My last boyfriend was a virgin.”

“Really?”

“Yeah. He was your typical sheltered church boy that had just left mommy and daddy.”

Suddenly James burst in the room.

“Simon it’s Sarah she’s-

“Dude what the fuck?” I shouted jolting up.

James looked dumbfounded by what he was seeing.

“Oh my god, don’t you ever knock?” Amber yelled covering herself with the blankets.

“Sarah ran in the woods chasing that dog. We heard her screaming we have to go after her.”

“Okay but-

“Both of you, get dressed. Oh and Amber, nice tits,” James winked at her. Amber gave him the middle finger as he left the room laughing.

“Fucking perv,” She grumbled.

We got dressed and we ran outside to the back yard. Ashley, Uncle Bobby, Chad and James were waiting for us.

Uncle Bobby was holding his hunting rifle and a flashlight and Ashley was holding her machine gun.

“What the Hell happened?” I asked.

“The dog heard something and ran in the woods and then Sarah just chased after it. Next thing I know I hear Sarah screaming and the puppy yelping.”

We heard something rustling in the woods, Ashley and Uncle Bobby readied their guns. We then saw Sarah running out of the woods but before any of us could react, a wolf lunged at her from behind. Sarah screamed as she fell forward, the wolf began to tear into her neck. Suddenly more wolves appeared from the forest and began to devour Sarah. Ashley and Uncle Bobby fired their guns at the wolves. That’s when more of them showed up. They ran at us to keep us from interrupting the feeding frenzy. Ashley sprayed the wolves that were coming at us. Uncle Bobby shot at the wolves that were tearing at Sarah.

She howled in pain as the savages tore her flesh from her bones. That’s when Chad ran over to the wolves. One of them tried to attack him but he cracked it on the nose with his fists. He tried to rip one of the wolves off of Sarah but another wolf leaped on top of him. He held out his arm to keep it from going for his throat. Uncle Bobby shot the wolf in the head killing it instantly. Chad pushed the dead wolf off of him. Ashley shot the rest of the wolves, wiping out the rest of the pack. We raced over to Sarah to see if we could save her, Chad turned away and began to vomit violently. From first glance we could tell Sarah was dead. The wolves had eaten through most of her torso. Chunks of her face we torn off and her arms and legs were riddled with claw marks and missing flesh.

Chad was screaming and crying as he laid there in his own sick. Everyone else was either throwing up or crying as well. I ran back in the house and began coughing violently. I then ran to the bathroom and began vomiting. I flushed the toilet and got in a fetal position. I began to breathe heavily and rock back and forth. I screamed at the top of my lungs as tears streamed down my face. I sat there in the bathroom and cried myself to sleep.

I woke up with a crick in my neck. My eyes burned and my cheeks had dried tears on them. I looked in the mirror, I was a mess. I was pale and my eyes were bloodshot red. I grabbed some paper towels and put some water on them. I wiped my face off and did my best to pull myself together. I walked out of the bathroom and went into the living room and found Amber, Ashley and James sitting on the couch in silence.

“What’s going on?” I asked.

“Abraham and Bobby are outside with Chad,” James said.

I turned to go outside.

“You don’t want to go out there” James warned.

I made my way to the backdoor.

“Simon!” James yelled. I ignored him.

“Simon!” I opened the door and walked outside. The bitter smell of blood infected the air, I saw Chad sobbing over Sarah’s corpse. Abe and Uncle Bobby were trying to get him to get up but Chad just yells obscenities at them. I looked around the yard and saw buzzards eating the dead wolves. Some were trying to get over to Sarah but were swatted away when they got too close. I felt someone grab me by my shirt collar. I was dragged aggressively back into the house. When I was back in the I house, James let go of my shirt and slammed the door.

“What the fuck is wrong with you!?” He hollard.

“I was just-

“Just what trying to see a dead body? That man is out there grieving over his childhood friend and you just thought you’d have peek?”

“I was-

“Just shut up Simon! Don’t let me catch you going out there again!”

“Jesus Christ, what’s gotten into you?” I yelled.

“The realization that were stuck in a Hell on Earth situation!!! The fact that we aren't just going to hit the bars and laugh about this when it’s all over. I know now that it’s survival of the fucking fittest. Do or die. Do you know what that means? It means we are stuck in a world filled with savage animals and a billion Barbarians!!! That’s what’s gotten into me you sheltered airhead!!! So do us all a fucking favor and get your head out of your sorry ass and wake up and smell the coffee!!!”James stormed out of the kitchen and ran up stairs and into a room and slammed the door.

I went into the living room and sat on the arm chair. Ashley had gone upstairs but Amber sat on the couch with her head in her hands.

“You okay?” I asked.

“I’ve never seen someone die like that,” Amber told me. “I mean you see shit like that in horror movies and comic books not in real life.”

“It just happens,” I said. We eat farm animals and game. It’s just the natural order animals eat each other.”

Amber gave me a stern look.

“We aren't animals,” she said with a cracked voice.

“We are now. Our cities have fallen and we have been pulled down to their level. Humans are basically rats roaming around the ruins of what used to be scavenging for what food we can find.”

“Your right Simon. You are absolutely right. When that riot broke out in Fort Lauderdale, I saw the absolute worst in people. Solder’s were gunning down people like it was nothing. People were taking what they could and beating and stabbing each other. After me and Ashley took those guns from dead guards and stole that truck, I still had some hope left even after all that shit.”

“We still have to have hope Amber. Hope is what we hold on to when all else is lost.”

“I’m going to bed,” she told me.

“I am too,”

We went upstairs and to our separate bedrooms. When I went to sleep the only thing that went through my head besides the sound of Chads screams was the knowledge of the fact that I was not safe...Not one bit.

,tarot,"tl;dr I really need a pack of Tarot cards and my numen (Lord Chance, The Architect of Chaos, the King of Coincidence) is insisting they be gifted and the person that chooses need be nearly random.

Or an obsidian mirror

Or Bluetooth headphones

I work at a non-profit and they pay very little

(I put the tl;dr at the top so it was clear.)

I started playing with the Tarot cards when I was 14 or so. I never had extra money, my parents were terribly poor. So I stole my first pack from a local book store. It was a Ryder white pack. There was no instruction book.

I told myself stories by laying out the cards in patterns to spur story ideas.

I identified with the Page of Swords because I was winsome and lithe just as he was. The Tower frightened me and the whole suit of Swords was troublesome to me.

I finally got a book after 6 mos (I'm not a good thief) I read it and saw that the stories I had told myself were very close to what I felt.

I felt a kinship with cups, even though most of the magic I had done spoke to fire and smoke, it still is my first element.

I think in narration, so the idea of telling a story with the cards was second nature. I often told stories with the Major Arcana because they were my first leart. Also because the Archetypes were so apparent in the world: my mother, the Empress, my father the Hierophant, me the Page of Swords, moving towards the fool.

My mother found the cards and made me throw them away, not because they were evil, but because they were stolen.

My 9th grade year, a therapist I no longer have a memory of other than this one stricture: no magical thinking.

My magickal involvement waned. I couldn't pray anymore.

The symbols of my cards shouted at me through media. I took it instride but I did miss my friends, the cards.

By this time and eventually, nearly permanently, the Fool, And on through college where I earned three degrees, not all at once mind you, and have a 4.0 in my grad studies, so I was a Fool with a mission.

I spent most of my 20s traipsing through my life near the edge of a cliff with people barking warnings that I couldn't hear over the cacophony in my head when I was depressed, or the jangling of glass wind chime when I was manic. Music helped. NIN and Alanis would feed the emotion and Dead Can Dance would temper me (all through the best bulky sound canceling speakers)

I fed my venal side to the exclusion of my spirit because one man, whose face I can't pull up and see said, ""No magical thinking.""

I ignored those moments of perception where I just ""knew"" I was being cheated. I was a master of introduction. 5 couples I introduced wed. I ignored the canorous voices that asked to be listened to. Not like the hallucinations I have when I'm unmedicated, but something seemingly outside of me.

At this time I transmuted to the Hanged Man. Teaching pilgarlic children and settling under the stones of their acrimony with one hand, their adulation with another.

The special day program kept me steady with innumerable problems to surmount. We played, ""what's on your playlist"" during down time and on the same day ""fireworks"" (which contains gay content) and ""call me maybe"" which also is gay and I'm just not the teacher with a club, so my frantic efforts mad the class laugh.

I've been the Hanged Man, both in my job and in my 16 year relationship. The job, I quit, the relationship, quit me. My best friend who is the most amazing Christian I've met would play me to sleep with the Police ""Every Breath You Take"" and ""oceans,"" a song he sang at church, with his guitar.

I needed yet another therapist in my life. He didn't allow me to believe I wasn't co-morbid and after a brief view of the NIMH's guidelines about bipolar co-morbid with Borderline Personality Disorder, I relented after another attempt at suicide, the angels and demons, and numen that gathered every time I was god-ridden, had become too much for me to function.

Peter, my therapist and I began working on the DBT workbook. Occasionally, we came to parts that I hesitated or made fun of (really, trigger words to make you relax {mine are ""Neverwhere"" and ""Elsewhen""--- and I'll be goddamned if they don't work.})

I balked completely at the idea of finding a higher power. I explained that I wasn't supposed to do that, and if I did, I'd get sick (my code for sliding manic).

He kept at me, untill finally, I said, over my shoulder, I'll stick with letting a higher power pick me. He responded that I was following the rules of no magical thinking, and I should make the most of the experiment and get as magical as I liked...

Waiting in the waiting room, I was fiddling with my phone, taking advantage of having culled the passed from my therapist, one of the last manipulations I did just for fun. An app was in my recommendation list and because I could magically think again; And I downloaded the recommended app Galaxy Tarot. (I am not affiliated with them).

I remembered my friends. I loved the format and fiddled with the idea of what kind of Technomancer would use digital cards and would he be more of an ""American Gods ish neuman or a ""Neuromancer"" kind of guy.

I liked the widget and the card of the day. Just to kill the time I pulled a single card and the Page of Cups was pulled.

I saw, at my feet a man I had never met; but I knew the boy that he had been very well, Peter, my therapist, came out to let me know the schedule of my next visit, a week away.

The man spoke and said,""Mr. Saint-ace, Peter what are you guys doing together, you must be doing big things."" The man was a former student of mine. ""Come out here for a bit,"" he asked of me."" And I could do no less. He walked, and I trailed after in a near trance to a very nice car with a beautiful woman in the front seat that I was introduced to, and finally, the inevitable carseat. My former student said, I want you to meet someone and he handed me the baby.

Her name is ""Saint-ace Michelle. We wanted a name that could go either way and we remember what your mother had said that you were going to be named Saint-ace either way.""

I said, ""So she's..."" And he said, ""yes... named after you."" I said, under my breath, ""thank you."" And wondered who I was thanking.

Coincidences abound around me during the next few days. I, who believes that lottery ticket are a tax on the poor, bought two and won 50 dollars. Then I went back and bought a 20 dollar one and a 10 dollar one that wound up with me having an extra 100 dollars! I stopped then because I couldn't feel anyone at my shoulder.

My friends noticed that there were minor coincidences and major works of karma surrounding me. I found my phone and answered it before it rang so many times that my best friend (The Magician in my life) got leery because tarot cards and prognostication are a different type of praying than he's used to.

I used the tarot cards daily for inspiration or focus or physical change (I pulled a card at random, if it was Swords I did a wall sit for the count of the number of the card x 10, cups were push-ups, wands were flutter kicks of the card number x 10 and pentacles lunges x10; the major arcana were number x10 with a full set of all for exercises.)

I was thinking magically again. Feathers on the ground were messages and Peter cancelled his appointment so I didn't see him before a big trip. I could feel myself sliding manic and was expecting to be god-ridden soon.

While driving through my vast, flat, fly-over state, I was fiddling with my Bluetooth headphones because I had just discovered that magic and music were intertwined. A voice from outside of my head said: ""Look at the sky..."" In a very commanding manner and I did just as Amy Winehouse began to sing Valerie in my headphones.

I honored each coincidence and during my meditations for mindfulness, that Peter turned me on to, I was plagued by an image of a two dimentional person flat like a card whose laugh was contagious even if you were the but of his joke. Gotee hiding thin, patrician, lips and perfect nose circlet about his head. The next time I meditated, the personage was better formed, three dimentional and in a frenetic action and the third time a somber crowned man seemed to be just behind me.)

That night I could see the green men dancing through the trees with the wind; I could feel the mania that was seeping out of my head and getting on the people around me (my friends love it's infectious qualities) I could feel the press of the newfound presence. But, it was a tattoo party.

I got the runic symbols of Thurisaz on my left wrist and Algiz on my right. During the last of the one on the left the taps on the shoulder became nearly backbreaking, I was being subsumed by the waves of delusions of reference that battered me: I felt I had made a mistake and called up something too big for me. The voices were too loud and the connections too clear and then the symbol on my right wrist was finally colored in. And the voices dampened and I felt in control and I KNEW the name of the numen that was trisking with me.

I felt compelled to write about the three men to confabulate who they all were and I wrote this... https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WdTSPk1NczXYBI4nJxKzEfPUZgFkYVK7ZDkTKOhvoPI/edit?usp=drivesdk

I often have to write and re-write a piece of work, but this one came up to be pretty much from Lord Chance's mouth to my ear.

So now, it's come to this. I have put copies of other tarots looked at the tarot sampler and have often decided one a new set.

I ""see real"" with my technomantic Golden Thread and the Ryder I have on my phone, but I really need a physical set that illuminates me.

I've looked at a fairy tale themed set (I'm currently finishing writing a story cycle that's an allegory set in fairy tale clothes)

I've looked at some gaelic ones due to my Irish and some Nordic themed sets because of my ancestry

I liked a art deco themed one.

I also fiddle with cataptromancy so I collect mirrors (I'm covetous of a black obsidian one)

But it's become clear, I'm back in a position of having no money to buy and no desire to steal...

So can you help me?

I need a tarot set picked for me based on your imprecations and dumb luck

,occult,"tl;dr I really need a pack of Tarot cards and my numen (Lord Chance, The Architect of Chaos, the King of Coincidence) is insisting they be gifted and the person that chooses need be nearly random.

Or an obsidian mirror

Or Bluetooth headphones

I work at a non-profit and they pay very little

(I put the tl;dr at the top so it was clear.)

I started playing with the Tarot cards when I was 14 or so. I never had extra money, my parents were terribly poor. So I stole my first pack from a local book store. It was a Ryder white pack. There was no instruction book.

I told myself stories by laying out the cards in patterns to spur story ideas.

I identified with the Page of Swords because I was winsome and lithe just as he was. The Tower frightened me and the whole suit of Swords was troublesome to me.

I finally got a book after 6 mos (I'm not a good thief) I read it and saw that the stories I had told myself were very close to what I felt.

I felt a kinship with cups, even though most of the magic I had done spoke to fire and smoke, it still is my first element.

I think in narration, so the idea of telling a story with the cards was second nature. I often told stories with the Major Arcana because they were my first leart. Also because the Archetypes were so apparent in the world: my mother, the Empress, my father the Hierophant, me the Page of Swords, moving towards the fool.

My mother found the cards and made me throw them away, not because they were evil, but because they were stolen.

My 9th grade year, a therapist I no longer have a memory of other than this one stricture: no magical thinking.

My magickal involvement waned. I couldn't pray anymore.

The symbols of my cards shouted at me through media. I took it instride but I did miss my friends, the cards.

By this time and eventually, nearly permanently, the Fool, And on through college where I earned three degrees, not all at once mind you, and have a 4.0 in my grad studies, so I was a Fool with a mission.

I spent most of my 20s traipsing through my life near the edge of a cliff with people barking warnings that I couldn't hear over the cacophony in my head when I was depressed, or the jangling of glass wind chime when I was manic. Music helped. NIN and Alanis would feed the emotion and Dead Can Dance would temper me (all through the best bulky sound canceling speakers)

I fed my venal side to the exclusion of my spirit because one man, whose face I can't pull up and see said, ""No magical thinking.""

I ignored those moments of perception where I just ""knew"" I was being cheated. I was a master of introduction. 5 couples I introduced wed. I ignored the canorous voices that asked to be listened to. Not like the hallucinations I have when I'm unmedicated, but something seemingly outside of me.

At this time I transmuted to the Hanged Man. Teaching pilgarlic children and settling under the stones of their acrimony with one hand, their adulation with another.

The special day program kept me steady with innumerable problems to surmount. We played, ""what's on your playlist"" during down time and on the same day ""fireworks"" (which contains gay content) and ""call me maybe"" which also is gay and I'm just not the teacher with a club, so my frantic efforts mad the class laugh.

I've been the Hanged Man, both in my job and in my 16 year relationship. The job, I quit, the relationship, quit me. My best friend who is the most amazing Christian I've met would play me to sleep with the Police ""Every Breath You Take"" and ""oceans,"" a song he sang at church, with his guitar.

I needed yet another therapist in my life. He didn't allow me to believe I wasn't co-morbid and after a brief view of the NIMH's guidelines about bipolar co-morbid with Borderline Personality Disorder, I relented after another attempt at suicide, the angels and demons, and numen that gathered every time I was god-ridden, had become too much for me to function.

Peter, my therapist and I began working on the DBT workbook. Occasionally, we came to parts that I hesitated or made fun of (really, trigger words to make you relax {mine are ""Neverwhere"" and ""Elsewhen""--- and I'll be goddamned if they don't work.})

I balked completely at the idea of finding a higher power. I explained that I wasn't supposed to do that, and if I did, I'd get sick (my code for sliding manic).

He kept at me, untill finally, I said, over my shoulder, I'll stick with letting a higher power pick me. He responded that I was following the rules of no magical thinking, and I should make the most of the experiment and get as magical as I liked...

Waiting in the waiting room, I was fiddling with my phone, taking advantage of having culled the passed from my therapist, one of the last manipulations I did just for fun. An app was in my recommendation list and because I could magically think again; And I downloaded the recommended app Galaxy Tarot. (I am not affiliated with them).

I remembered my friends. I loved the format and fiddled with the idea of what kind of Technomancer would use digital cards and would he be more of an ""American Gods ish neuman or a ""Neuromancer"" kind of guy.

I liked the widget and the card of the day. Just to kill the time I pulled a single card and the Page of Cups was pulled.

I saw, at my feet a man I had never met; but I knew the boy that he had been very well, Peter, my therapist, came out to let me know the schedule of my next visit, a week away.

The man spoke and said,""Mr. Saint-ace, Peter what are you guys doing together, you must be doing big things."" The man was a former student of mine. ""Come out here for a bit,"" he asked of me."" And I could do no less. He walked, and I trailed after in a near trance to a very nice car with a beautiful woman in the front seat that I was introduced to, and finally, the inevitable carseat. My former student said, I want you to meet someone and he handed me the baby.

Her name is ""Saint-ace Michelle. We wanted a name that could go either way and we remember what your mother had said that you were going to be named Saint-ace either way.""

I said, ""So she's..."" And he said, ""yes... named after you."" I said, under my breath, ""thank you."" And wondered who I was thanking.

,popheads,"Hello, I wanna talk about promotional singles; what purpose do they have and what forms do they take.

Generally speaking promotional singles are tracks that are released prior to the album and not sent to radio. They don't get ""pushed"". These days a ""push"" also means getting added to a lot of playlists, most notible Spotify's Todays' Top Hits. The purpose of a promotional track can be several things and I'll go over them one by one.

You usually see artist releasing one if they need to fill a performance slot (Like SNL (made Lorde release Liability and Troye release The Good Side)). They also help give a better idea of what the album will sounds like, as the lead single usually is the one with the biggest hit potential and rarely the one representing the album the best; see how Welcome To New York and Out Of The Woods both represent 1989 way better than Shake It Off. Taylor kinda did that again next era when she used Gorgeous and Call It What You Want to let her fans know the the old Taylor wasn't COMPLETELY dead.

Are promotional singles just song that are potential singles, only released in the hopes that they will smash and get upgraded to a real single? Of course not - but of course we do see that happening, like when Katy released Dark Horse as a promo single and Unconditionally as the single, she had no choice but to jump ships and make Dark Horse a single seeing as it was gunning for that #1 and reached it before the music video was even realeased. 

And a lot of times singles start as promotional singles and are turned into singles later despite not smashing; cause why not use a song as both? If you feel it will give your fans a good idea of the album + later think it deserves single treatment, why not. Taylor did it with Out Of The Woods, Sam Smith did it with Pray, Gaga did it with Do What U Want, Bruno did it with Versace on the Floor, Demi did it with Tell Me You Love Me, P!nk did it with Beautiful Trauma and Imagine Dragons had released all of the era's singles as promo singles first; it is very commen. That does ofc not mean that promotional singles always become singles later.

Often times you get a promotional singles when you pre-order an album; we call these songs an ""instant grant"". In this case the song is being used to create an incentive to actually pre-order the album, and as the pre-orders count towards first week sales this is something artists are interested in. Examples I can think of are Ed giving These are How Would You Feel (Paean) with Divide, Britney giving Private Show with Glory and Maroon 5 giving Help Me Out with Red Pill Blues.

Sometimes promotional singles have videos. Sometimes just lyric videos:

[Taylor Swift - Call It What You Want \(Lyric Video\)](https://youtu.be/V54CEElTF_U)

[Maroon 5, Julia Michaels - Help Me Out \(Lyric Video\) ft. Julia Michaels](https://youtu.be/JA2JdSP7wyg)

Sometimes real music videos (though rarely with much of a budget):

[Justin Bieber - I'll Show You](https://youtu.be/PfGaX8G0f2E)

[Fifth Harmony - Angel](https://youtu.be/Bt626CEUCMQ)

[Ariana Grande - Let Me Love You \(Official\) ft. Lil Wayne](https://youtu.be/5WL672bjJgM)

Cause yea, a music video does not mean a song is a single. Sometimes artists just wants to make a video to add visuals to a song:

[Lady Gaga - John Wayne](https://youtu.be/o9iQ8lIfyEs)

[Carly Rae Jepsen - Boy Problems](https://youtu.be/b1LNQBX8JwE)

[Katy Perry - Hey Hey Hey \(Official\)](https://youtu.be/WS7f5xpGYn8)



##The Case of The Light Is Coming

Was it ever anything but a promotional single? No.

First of all it was never pushed, if we look at the Spotify playlist followers, it had a mere 3.5 mil the first day; compare that to the 45 mil Spotify users No Tears Left To Cry was pushed to first day, or even the 37 mil users Bed was pushed to. People like to say it flopped on streaming, when really it did kinda good all things considered; despite never being meant to do anything. 

It had a video, but as we've seen, a video does not a single make. Especially when it's one that has basically no budget + is being used for a brand deal. Cause yea artists give songs to brands, like how Taylor gave This Love to Starbucks during 1989. 

It was called a promo track from, well, oficially day 2. 

[""video for my sweetener promo single the ‘light is coming’ feat @nickiminaj directed by dave meyers out now everywhere 🌫 ♡ 💡""](https://twitter.com/ArianaGrande/status/1009830435428487168)

Did she change her mind after seeing the first day reaction? No, cause it had no way of doing well on the first day, it wasn't pushed. This is just Ari reiterating that this is in fact just a promo single, cause y'all started to think otherwise.

The music video for the 2nd single, God Is A Woman, was filmed before the release of TLIC, she confirmed by liking [this](https://twitter.com/ahoe_/status/1004159083430203392). Releasing GIAW soon is not a rushed decision cause TLIC ""flopped""; it's always been the plan. btw she's gonna look [stunning](https://twitter.com/remdropsfell/status/1012397001261178880) and serve [visuals](https://twitter.com/teasybutera/status/1010590159702773760) in the video (which is once again directed by Dave Meyers (Hannah Lux Davis found rotting under her neon lights))

Her team is still pushing NTLTC. They are pushing it on radio sending [this](https://scontent.fdet1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/35884242_10155774718603282_1636831539952091136_n.png?_nc_cat=0&amp;_nc_eui2=AeHMdcH5v7JKUokqyECK-lNWaTiOmLFPs2I6qL8aUdMXD9qQWZT4RnU7WvlmVsZsQd_Gp785SNF0NrWF2lfZAUH-RtjT8mlND5bMpTWFMmbPRw&amp;oh=f996b0c578c67cf05d828007849b925c&amp;oe=5BA559B3) out a few days before the TLIC release and they discounted it on iTunes last friday. The plan is for the single to last another month, I would not be surprised if they soon release an acapela video like they did with Dangerous Woman and Into You. 

Why did Ariana release TLIC then? Well it was an instant grant to fuel her pre-orders, she wanted to do something for every 20th leading up to her album so she had to do something, she wanted to show a different side of the album cause after all Pharrell is responsible for the majority of the tracks and she wanted to show that prior to the release (GIAW is rumoured to be another Max song so we wouldn't get a taste of Pharrell X Ari otherwise) and she probably had to give Rebook some exclusive content as part of her contract with them.

This week at Bungie, the factions are vying for your pledge.


Dead Orbit took the win by a [fair margin](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/112/112325/06142018_faction_rally_stats.png?cv=3983621215&amp;av=905391427) for the first Faction Rallies event of Season 3. We’ve seen a sizable amount of passion for Future War Cult in the last few weeks, and we’re eager to see if the community can make Lakshmi-2 proud with the first FWC win of *Destiny 2*.


Before you ask—direct purchase for Faction Armor was removed with *Destiny 2 *Update 1.2.1 due to vendor [constraints](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/8t249l/are_we_really_going_to_go_through_2_ib_and_fr/e14putx/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage). We’re planning to bring this option back for Dead Orbit, New Monarchy, and Future War Cult in Update 1.2.3, prior to the final Faction Rallies event of Season 3. Direct purchase will also be restored for Iron Banner in this update. We’re continuing to collect feedback throughout each event, so make sure to sound off in the [Feedback ](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics?pNumber=0&amp;tg=Feedback)forum with your thoughts on Renown, rewards, and anything factions related!

##After Expo Report



[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/112/112643/06282018_E3_Section.png)


After months of anticipation behind the scenes, E3 has become a fond memory. Last week, we took some time to let the dust settle and come back to our senses. Looking back on the events of the show, we’re sincerely grateful for the warm reception we got in Los Angeles—and not just because of the sunshine. It’s always a rush when millions of people find out what we’ve been working on. It’s even better when they get to play for themselves. Here are some thoughts from our Away Team of official spokespersons who were on hand to answer questions on behalf of everyone who is working to bring *Forsaken* to life.


&gt;
&gt;**Matt Tieger, Game Director, High Moon Studios**
&gt;
&gt;After so many months of hard work, E3 is a glorious mix of relief and terror. The death of Cayde is a huge moment in the *Destiny* universe, and revealing that to the world was nerve-racking. I get a sense that the community is incredibly motivated to explore the Tangled Shore and avenge the death of their friend. As a game developer, what more could you ask for?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Steve Cotton, Game Director, Bungie**
&gt;
&gt;I think it’s fair to say that everyone on the team was both incredibly excited and a little bit anxious to reveal to the world how our *Forsaken* story begins. So, it was amazing for us to see the response right after. Between the questions of why and how, one thing was clear—there was going to be consequence in this world of immortal heroes, and this was going to sting. To see how quickly Uldren was elevated to every Guardian’s most hated enemy and how everyone’s plans for revenge solidified almost instantly was inspiring. Some people at the show got to play some of the first mission of the game, and we talked to them after. There were strong feelings while they played, but their plans to exact revenge only got more creative… more personal. In the end, the show was an incredible journey of conflicting emotions and now I am left with an uneasiness every time I visit the tower. Cayde is right there and I just want to warn him[.](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Detail?itemId=246257172)  
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Scott Taylor, Project Lead, Bungie**
&gt;
&gt;It was incredible to share *Forsaken* with the fans and let them get their hands on Gambit. The teams at Bungie and HMS have been developing *Forsaken* with the goal of reinforcing the hobby, and the reaction we got at E3 meant so much to all of us. There’s a lot more to reveal this summer, including details on Collections, Triumphs, and the major sandbox changes we’ve got planned. Everyone is working hard to put the finishing touches on the experience. Closing is one of my favorite phases of any project, and it’s a blast to see the game grow and evolve every day. We can’t wait to play it with all of you. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Lars Bakken, Design Lead, Bungie**
&gt;
&gt;So, at E3, we lifted the lid on [REDACTED], finally unveiling Gambit to the world. I cannot express how overwhelmed we were by the positive sentiment around our new activity. Special thanks to all the people who stood in line—you are the true heroes. If you didn’t know, GuardianCon is the next stop on the hype train to play Gambit before September. Remember to keep a look out for those invaders!


Lars said it. E3 was only the start of a new conversation about *Destiny*. Next stop: Tampa, Florida. We’re packing our bags for some gator wrestling and more Gambit action. Next week, we’ll share the full Away Team active roster along with what we have planned for our time on the GuardianCon mainstage.


Following that, we’ll tell you more about the other stops we have planned for this summer…

##Marking Your Calendar

If you reside in the northern hemisphere, summer has officially begun. This one in particular is full of seasonal events. We’ve gotten some feedback from players asking for a bit more of a heads up before things like Faction Rallies or Iron Banner go live. To address this, we’ve cooked up the following image to set expectations for the next few weeks:


[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/112/112643/06282018_July_Calendar.jpg)


We also have an update for the development roadmap planned for early July. Stay tuned.

##An Early Preview…



[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/112/112643/06282018_Crucible_Section.jpg)


The Crucible team has been hard at work over the last few months, digesting player feedback and tuning the experience. Normally we’d have a Crucible representative jump in to give some commentary on goals, but they’re currently all hands on deck working on the future of the Crucible. Here’s a quick Patch Notes preview for what you can expect to become available when Update 1.2.3 is released on **July 17, 2018**:


**Crucible Playlist Update**



* Quickplay



   * Increasing player configuration to 6v6 and updating the playlist description
   * Removing Supremacy from the pool of available game modes
   * Control

      * Updating Control win score to 150
      * Control Zones will initially be neutral
   * Clash

      * Updating Clash win score to 100


* Competitive


      * Bomb Fuse timer in Countdown lowered from 40 seconds to 35 seconds


* General

   * Rumble will become a full-time playlist
   * Supremacy will be added to the weekly featured playlist, updated to 6v6, and have a win score of 150


**Crucible Ranks Update**



* Players will be able to earn Valor rank from additional playlists:



   * Competitive
   * Crucible Labs
   * Iron Banner
   * Trials of The Nine


* Joining a game in progress will protect your Valor Win Streak for that game



   * If you lose: No penalties incurred to your Valor Win Streak
   * If you win: Valor Win Streak increases


* Players will be matched using their Glory rank



   * This means your opponents will be of similar rank to you
   * The higher you climb, the tougher the opponent


* Glory Loss Streaks will be re-tuned to be less punishing over time



   * Consecutive losses will decrease the Rank Points lost instead of increasing
   * Streaks will still cap out at 5


* All Rank Streaks will no longer reset once they hit their cap


There are many more changes to *Destiny 2* coming in July, and we’ll be giving a few more Patch Notes previews leading up to release, providing developer insights and commentary when possible.

##Prestigious Affairs



[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/112/112643/06282018_Prestige_Raid_Section.jpg)


Crucible isn’t the only activity getting some love in Update 1.2.3. The raid team is excited to release Prestige difficulty for both the Eater of Worlds and Spire of Stars raid lairs. **Senior Raid Designer Joe Blackburn** set some expectations in [February](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/46627), and he's back to flesh out some details on what the experience will be for players taking on the new challenge.


&gt;
&gt;Hey everybody,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;In *Destiny 2* Update 1.2.3, we will be launching Prestige versions of both Spire of Stars and Eater of Worlds raid lairs. Prestige raid lairs use new **activity modifiers** and a new system of **curated loadouts** to challenge you in new and exciting ways each week. I wanted to give a quick rundown of what you can expect to get, what you can expect to do, and answer some questions you might have.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**What You Get**
&gt;
&gt;We believe players will be chasing after three different pursuits in the summer Prestige raid lairs.  
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* 400 Power Weapons: The only way to get 400 Power armor before *Forsaken* is by participating in the Summer Solstice event, but the only way to get 400 Power weapons before *Forsaken* is by completing Prestige Spire of Stars and Eater of Worlds. Every time you complete all the encounters in a Prestige raid lair that week, you will be rewarded a 400 Power raid weapon. This can be any raid weapon from *Destiny 2*, not just the weapons that drop in that raid lair. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* Raid Armor Ornaments: Each Prestige raid lair has its own set of unique armor ornaments. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* Exotic Masterwork Catalyst:  Both raid lairs have a Masterwork catalyst that can be found only as a rare drop in the activity.   
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**What You Do**
&gt;
&gt;Each week, there is a curated weapon suite and a global activity modifier for Spire of Stars and Eater of Worlds. The weapon set and modifier will be the same across both activities.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* Curated weapon loadouts are based on weapon archetypes. So over the summer, you might see combinations that require you to equip Auto Rifle/Submachine Gun/Sniper Rifle or Scout Rifle/Hand Cannon/Rocket Launchers
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   * Loadouts are not locked inside the Prestige raid lair. You can bring tons of different guns into a raid lair and swap between them at will as long as the gun meets the required curation. For example, if you were doing Spire of Stars and the loadout is [Auto Rifle/Submachine Gun/Sniper Rifle], you might want to use Surous Regime for Val Ca’uor Phase 1, but swap to Ghost Primus for Val Ca’uor Phase 2 so you can equip D.A.R.C.I. for boss damage.
&gt;* We are shipping three activity modifiers that the raid lairs rotate between. Two of these modifies are brand new and were built from the ground up by the raid team to work in raids. The third is a fan favorite from *Destiny 2*: Prism. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* Each of these modifiers is designed to provide Guardians with advantages over their enemies when they lean into it.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* The goal of using these modifiers and loadouts is to change the way you engage with Prestige raiding each week. The first week, the modifier and weapon loadout might synergize really well with strategies and armor exotics you’ve been using for months. Next week, the modifier and weapon loadout might push you to explore the encounter in a different way and use different exotic armors (looking at you Lunafaction). 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Questions you might have:**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;***Is anything happening to the Prestige version of the Leviathan raid?***
&gt;
&gt;Nope! Prestige Leviathan will stay exactly as is, this weapon curation and modifier will only apply to Eater of Worlds and Spire of Stars—but in 1.2.3, it might be worth going back and playing some more Leviathan Prestige to see if Callus has a new way to enhance one of your favorite exotic Shotguns. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;***Are Prestige raid lairs getting per-encounter changes?***
&gt;
&gt;Nope! When we originally created the raid lairs, we wanted to focus on making the normal modes of encounters the most complete forms of the experience. We believe these modifiers and loadouts will create more variety in your Prestige gameplay than small, per-encounter changes. We also believe that the mechanical complexity in *Destiny 2* raid lairs is very high, and we want to lean more into the moment-to-moment sandbox engagement in Prestige. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;***How many of the Prestige raid activities will be active each week?***
&gt;
&gt;All of them! Do you want to play all three prestige raid activities each week on three different classes for maximum Exotic catalyst and 400 Power weapon farming potential? GO FOR IT!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;***When will the Prestige raid lairs become available?***
&gt;
&gt;Current plan is for both Prestige raid lairs to be active with modifiers right when the patch goes live. We feel like this is in line with Prestige being a new way to play each week instead of a one-time event, but we are open to feedback on this.

##Costs and Collections


The *Destiny 2: Forsaken* reveal brought a lot to the table on what’s coming in September, but there are many questions surrounding new features that we’ll be tackling leading up to launch. This week, we’re hitting a few of the most frequently asked questions about the upcoming **Collections** feature. **Investment Designer Matt McConnell** is here to bring the knowledge.


&gt;
&gt;***What items from Year 1 inventory will Collections track?***
&gt;
&gt;Collections include any weapon, armor piece, Ghost, ship, Sparrow, emblem, or shader available in Year 1 of *Destiny 2*.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;***Is there anything I can dismantle before Forsaken launches?***
&gt;
&gt;If you have an item in your inventory right now, you can safely discard it and retrieve it from Collections in September. This does not include consumables, so hang on to those if they matter to you.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;***If I dismantled something previously, will it be waiting in my Collections this September?***
&gt;
&gt;Your Collection will begin with every piece of gear that you were holding in inventory or within your vault upon the launch of *Warmind*. If you had dismantled an item prior to May 8, it will not be available within your Collections.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;***What items from Year 2 can be reacquired from Collections?***
&gt;
&gt;With the addition of random perk rolls to items starting in Year 2, we had to make a tough call for Collections. We investigated numerous options for gear with random perks: fixed Collections perks, buyback limits, reroll mechanics, and many others—but each of these came with issues that impacted the Collections experience in a negative manner. Ultimately, we decided to disable purchase of all Year 2 randomly-rolled Legendary weapons and armor. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;We don’t like keeping some items from experiencing the full Collections treatment, so we’re looking at a long-term solve for storing your exact perk rolls in Collections. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;***How much will it cost to reacquire items out of Collections?***
&gt;
&gt;We’re currently working on costs for item acquisition and will have more information at a later date.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;We have two main goals when deciding on reacquisition costs:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* Reacquisition isn’t a currency sink. We aren’t trying to make you spend all of your hard-earned Glimmer. We just want to make sure the items you find out in the world still have value.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* Players won’t have to deal with currency conversions. For example, if a shader dismantles into Glimmer, it costs Glimmer to reacquire. If the shader came from Eververse, it will dismantle into Bright Dust, and therefore costs Bright Dust to reacquire. These same goals are true of all Collection items.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Note: A lot of you have been asking about the cost of shaders. We can say that they will have a cost to reacquire from Collections, but there will no longer be a cost to apply shaders to gear.
&gt;
&gt;Here’s a quick example: Let’s say you just got that sweet Calus’s Treasured shader to drop from the raid. You’re able to apply it immediately at no cost. If you want that specific shader on all your armor, weapons, Ghost, ship, and Sparrow, you’ll need to pay some Glimmer to reacquire a handful of copies straight out of Collections.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;*Before we move along—purple and gold looks fantastic on the upcoming Tangled Shore Warlock armor set. You heard it here first.*
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;***When reacquiring gear from Collection, what Power level will they be?***
&gt;
&gt;Collection items will come out close to your current Power level, but will require infusion to be ready for endgame activities.  This is a delicate balance of making sure Collections don’t create a leveling exploit, but still providing items that are usable right away in most activities.


If there are things you’re eager to know more about, leave a post in the *Destiny 2* forum of Bungie.net, or sound off on social media. We’ll be watching for trending topics, and working to get you up to speed before *Forsaken* launches.

##Iron Resolve


[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/112/112511/D2_DOC.gif)


Each day, Destiny Player Support patrols the #Help forum to assist Guardians in need. Whether it be an error code caused by connection issues or an item not appearing properly in game—they’re here to lend a helping hand. 


This is their report.


&gt;
&gt;**Lupus Visage**
&gt;
&gt;Last week, we reported an issue where the Lupus Visage ornament for Fighting Lion, featured in the Iron Ornament Bundle, did not properly unlock for some players after it was activated. With this week’s deployment of [*Destiny 2* Hotfix 1.2.1.2](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/46973), this issue is expected to be resolved for all players.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Players who previously purchased this ornament should now find it when inspecting Fighting Lion. Players who purchase this bundle in the future will find this ornament in their modifications inventory.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Permissions**
&gt;
&gt;Over the past several months, we have monitored reports from players in Russia who repeatedly encountered the error “Permissions to access online multiplayer have changed or profile signed in elsewhere.” While it's still possible for players to encounter this error through natural causes, we believe the platform issues that caused the elevated number of these errors to be resolved.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;For players who see this error in the wild, we suggest that you visit our [Help article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/12271) for troubleshooting information. As always, players who encounter repeated errors codes and do not find resolution by searching [help.Bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help) should report the error to the [#Help forums](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Faction Rallies Known Issues**
&gt;
&gt;With the launch of this week’s Faction Rallies, we have players reporting that they've kept their allegiance from the last [Faction Rallies](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/46312), even after pledging to a different faction for this one.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;While Destiny Player Support is currently investigating this issue, any player encountering issues while pledging to factions should submit a report to the[ #Help forums](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help). If possible, providing captured video footage or imagery of your issue as it is encountered in game will be helpful in our investigation.

##No Intermission

Running out of medals isn’t a requirement to take the crown in Movie of the Week. In anticipation for Prestige raid lairs, we took some time to find a six-player fireteam that has perfected the art of DPS.

After two weeks out, it’s great to be back. C[o](https://imgur.com/jgZ8cGI)zmo will be out next week with family, but he’s made me promise to uphold his legacy of hiding felines in blog copy. In 14 days, a few of us will be on flights heading toward Tampa to join many of you at GuardianCon. Next week, we’ll have the full roster and some details on what we’ll be doing at the event. Until then, I’ll be spending some time on Titan. Hope to see you out there, even if you’ve pledged to an opposing faction.


Oh, and before I leave, join me in giving a shout out to the following Fireteams who earned the top three Nightfall scores last week!

This week at Bungie, the factions are vying for your pledge.


Dead Orbit took the win by a [fair margin](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/112/112325/06142018_faction_rally_stats.png?cv=3983621215&amp;av=905391427) for the first Faction Rallies event of Season 3. We’ve seen a sizable amount of passion for Future War Cult in the last few weeks, and we’re eager to see if the community can make Lakshmi-2 proud with the first FWC win of *Destiny 2*.


Before you ask—direct purchase for Faction Armor was removed with *Destiny 2 *Update 1.2.1 due to vendor [constraints](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/8t249l/are_we_really_going_to_go_through_2_ib_and_fr/e14putx/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage). We’re planning to bring this option back for Dead Orbit, New Monarchy, and Future War Cult in Update 1.2.3, prior to the final Faction Rallies event of Season 3. Direct purchase will also be restored for Iron Banner in this update. We’re continuing to collect feedback throughout each event, so make sure to sound off in the [Feedback ](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics?pNumber=0&amp;tg=Feedback)forum with your thoughts on Renown, rewards, and anything factions related!

##After Expo Report



[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/112/112643/06282018_E3_Section.png)


After months of anticipation behind the scenes, E3 has become a fond memory. Last week, we took some time to let the dust settle and come back to our senses. Looking back on the events of the show, we’re sincerely grateful for the warm reception we got in Los Angeles—and not just because of the sunshine. It’s always a rush when millions of people find out what we’ve been working on. It’s even better when they get to play for themselves. Here are some thoughts from our Away Team of official spokespersons who were on hand to answer questions on behalf of everyone who is working to bring *Forsaken* to life.


&gt;
&gt;**Matt Tieger, Game Director, High Moon Studios**
&gt;
&gt;After so many months of hard work, E3 is a glorious mix of relief and terror. The death of Cayde is a huge moment in the *Destiny* universe, and revealing that to the world was nerve-racking. I get a sense that the community is incredibly motivated to explore the Tangled Shore and avenge the death of their friend. As a game developer, what more could you ask for?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Steve Cotton, Game Director, Bungie**
&gt;
&gt;I think it’s fair to say that everyone on the team was both incredibly excited and a little bit anxious to reveal to the world how our *Forsaken* story begins. So, it was amazing for us to see the response right after. Between the questions of why and how, one thing was clear—there was going to be consequence in this world of immortal heroes, and this was going to sting. To see how quickly Uldren was elevated to every Guardian’s most hated enemy and how everyone’s plans for revenge solidified almost instantly was inspiring. Some people at the show got to play some of the first mission of the game, and we talked to them after. There were strong feelings while they played, but their plans to exact revenge only got more creative… more personal. In the end, the show was an incredible journey of conflicting emotions and now I am left with an uneasiness every time I visit the tower. Cayde is right there and I just want to warn him[.](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Detail?itemId=246257172)  
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Scott Taylor, Project Lead, Bungie**
&gt;
&gt;It was incredible to share *Forsaken* with the fans and let them get their hands on Gambit. The teams at Bungie and HMS have been developing *Forsaken* with the goal of reinforcing the hobby, and the reaction we got at E3 meant so much to all of us. There’s a lot more to reveal this summer, including details on Collections, Triumphs, and the major sandbox changes we’ve got planned. Everyone is working hard to put the finishing touches on the experience. Closing is one of my favorite phases of any project, and it’s a blast to see the game grow and evolve every day. We can’t wait to play it with all of you. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Lars Bakken, Design Lead, Bungie**
&gt;
&gt;So, at E3, we lifted the lid on [REDACTED], finally unveiling Gambit to the world. I cannot express how overwhelmed we were by the positive sentiment around our new activity. Special thanks to all the people who stood in line—you are the true heroes. If you didn’t know, GuardianCon is the next stop on the hype train to play Gambit before September. Remember to keep a look out for those invaders!


Lars said it. E3 was only the start of a new conversation about *Destiny*. Next stop: Tampa, Florida. We’re packing our bags for some gator wrestling and more Gambit action. Next week, we’ll share the full Away Team active roster along with what we have planned for our time on the GuardianCon mainstage.


Following that, we’ll tell you more about the other stops we have planned for this summer…

##Marking Your Calendar

If you reside in the northern hemisphere, summer has officially begun. This one in particular is full of seasonal events. We’ve gotten some feedback from players asking for a bit more of a heads up before things like Faction Rallies or Iron Banner go live. To address this, we’ve cooked up the following image to set expectations for the next few weeks:


[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/112/112643/06282018_July_Calendar.jpg)


We also have an update for the development roadmap planned for early July. Stay tuned.

##An Early Preview…



[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/112/112643/06282018_Crucible_Section.jpg)


The Crucible team has been hard at work over the last few months, digesting player feedback and tuning the experience. Normally we’d have a Crucible representative jump in to give some commentary on goals, but they’re currently all hands on deck working on the future of the Crucible. Here’s a quick Patch Notes preview for what you can expect to become available when Update 1.2.3 is released on **July 17, 2018**:


**Crucible Playlist Update**



* Quickplay



   * Increasing player configuration to 6v6 and updating the playlist description
   * Removing Supremacy from the pool of available game modes
   * Control

      * Updating Control win score to 150
      * Control Zones will initially be neutral
   * Clash

      * Updating Clash win score to 100


* Competitive


      * Bomb Fuse timer in Countdown lowered from 40 seconds to 35 seconds


* General

   * Rumble will become a full-time playlist
   * Supremacy will be added to the weekly featured playlist, updated to 6v6, and have a win score of 150


**Crucible Ranks Update**



* Players will be able to earn Valor rank from additional playlists:



   * Competitive
   * Crucible Labs
   * Iron Banner
   * Trials of The Nine


* Joining a game in progress will protect your Valor Win Streak for that game



   * If you lose: No penalties incurred to your Valor Win Streak
   * If you win: Valor Win Streak increases


* Players will be matched using their Glory rank



   * This means your opponents will be of similar rank to you
   * The higher you climb, the tougher the opponent


* Glory Loss Streaks will be re-tuned to be less punishing over time



   * Consecutive losses will decrease the Rank Points lost instead of increasing
   * Streaks will still cap out at 5


* All Rank Streaks will no longer reset once they hit their cap


There are many more changes to *Destiny 2* coming in July, and we’ll be giving a few more Patch Notes previews leading up to release, providing developer insights and commentary when possible.

##Prestigious Affairs



[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/112/112643/06282018_Prestige_Raid_Section.jpg)


Crucible isn’t the only activity getting some love in Update 1.2.3. The raid team is excited to release Prestige difficulty for both the Eater of Worlds and Spire of Stars raid lairs. **Senior Raid Designer Joe Blackburn** set some expectations in [February](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/46627), and he's back to flesh out some details on what the experience will be for players taking on the new challenge.


&gt;
&gt;Hey everybody,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;In *Destiny 2* Update 1.2.3, we will be launching Prestige versions of both Spire of Stars and Eater of Worlds raid lairs. Prestige raid lairs use new **activity modifiers** and a new system of **curated loadouts** to challenge you in new and exciting ways each week. I wanted to give a quick rundown of what you can expect to get, what you can expect to do, and answer some questions you might have.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**What You Get**
&gt;
&gt;We believe players will be chasing after three different pursuits in the summer Prestige raid lairs.  
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* 400 Power Weapons: The only way to get 400 Power armor before *Forsaken* is by participating in the Summer Solstice event, but the only way to get 400 Power weapons before *Forsaken* is by completing Prestige Spire of Stars and Eater of Worlds. Every time you complete all the encounters in a Prestige raid lair that week, you will be rewarded a 400 Power raid weapon. This can be any raid weapon from *Destiny 2*, not just the weapons that drop in that raid lair. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* Raid Armor Ornaments: Each Prestige raid lair has its own set of unique armor ornaments. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* Exotic Masterwork Catalyst:  Both raid lairs have a Masterwork catalyst that can be found only as a rare drop in the activity.   
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**What You Do**
&gt;
&gt;Each week, there is a curated weapon suite and a global activity modifier for Spire of Stars and Eater of Worlds. The weapon set and modifier will be the same across both activities.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* Curated weapon loadouts are based on weapon archetypes. So over the summer, you might see combinations that require you to equip Auto Rifle/Submachine Gun/Sniper Rifle or Scout Rifle/Hand Cannon/Rocket Launchers
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   * Loadouts are not locked inside the Prestige raid lair. You can bring tons of different guns into a raid lair and swap between them at will as long as the gun meets the required curation. For example, if you were doing Spire of Stars and the loadout is [Auto Rifle/Submachine Gun/Sniper Rifle], you might want to use Surous Regime for Val Ca’uor Phase 1, but swap to Ghost Primus for Val Ca’uor Phase 2 so you can equip D.A.R.C.I. for boss damage.
&gt;* We are shipping three activity modifiers that the raid lairs rotate between. Two of these modifies are brand new and were built from the ground up by the raid team to work in raids. The third is a fan favorite from *Destiny 2*: Prism. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* Each of these modifiers is designed to provide Guardians with advantages over their enemies when they lean into it.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* The goal of using these modifiers and loadouts is to change the way you engage with Prestige raiding each week. The first week, the modifier and weapon loadout might synergize really well with strategies and armor exotics you’ve been using for months. Next week, the modifier and weapon loadout might push you to explore the encounter in a different way and use different exotic armors (looking at you Lunafaction). 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Questions you might have:**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;***Is anything happening to the Prestige version of the Leviathan raid?***
&gt;
&gt;Nope! Prestige Leviathan will stay exactly as is, this weapon curation and modifier will only apply to Eater of Worlds and Spire of Stars—but in 1.2.3, it might be worth going back and playing some more Leviathan Prestige to see if Callus has a new way to enhance one of your favorite exotic Shotguns. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;***Are Prestige raid lairs getting per-encounter changes?***
&gt;
&gt;Nope! When we originally created the raid lairs, we wanted to focus on making the normal modes of encounters the most complete forms of the experience. We believe these modifiers and loadouts will create more variety in your Prestige gameplay than small, per-encounter changes. We also believe that the mechanical complexity in *Destiny 2* raid lairs is very high, and we want to lean more into the moment-to-moment sandbox engagement in Prestige. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;***How many of the Prestige raid activities will be active each week?***
&gt;
&gt;All of them! Do you want to play all three prestige raid activities each week on three different classes for maximum Exotic catalyst and 400 Power weapon farming potential? GO FOR IT!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;***When will the Prestige raid lairs become available?***
&gt;
&gt;Current plan is for both Prestige raid lairs to be active with modifiers right when the patch goes live. We feel like this is in line with Prestige being a new way to play each week instead of a one-time event, but we are open to feedback on this.

##Costs and Collections


The *Destiny 2: Forsaken* reveal brought a lot to the table on what’s coming in September, but there are many questions surrounding new features that we’ll be tackling leading up to launch. This week, we’re hitting a few of the most frequently asked questions about the upcoming **Collections** feature. **Investment Designer Matt McConnell** is here to bring the knowledge.


&gt;
&gt;***What items from Year 1 inventory will Collections track?***
&gt;
&gt;Collections include any weapon, armor piece, Ghost, ship, Sparrow, emblem, or shader available in Year 1 of *Destiny 2*.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;***Is there anything I can dismantle before Forsaken launches?***
&gt;
&gt;If you have an item in your inventory right now, you can safely discard it and retrieve it from Collections in September. This does not include consumables, so hang on to those if they matter to you.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;***If I dismantled something previously, will it be waiting in my Collections this September?***
&gt;
&gt;Your Collection will begin with every piece of gear that you were holding in inventory or within your vault upon the launch of *Warmind*. If you had dismantled an item prior to May 8, it will not be available within your Collections.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;***What items from Year 2 can be reacquired from Collections?***
&gt;
&gt;With the addition of random perk rolls to items starting in Year 2, we had to make a tough call for Collections. We investigated numerous options for gear with random perks: fixed Collections perks, buyback limits, reroll mechanics, and many others—but each of these came with issues that impacted the Collections experience in a negative manner. Ultimately, we decided to disable purchase of all Year 2 randomly-rolled Legendary weapons and armor. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;We don’t like keeping some items from experiencing the full Collections treatment, so we’re looking at a long-term solve for storing your exact perk rolls in Collections. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;***How much will it cost to reacquire items out of Collections?***
&gt;
&gt;We’re currently working on costs for item acquisition and will have more information at a later date.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;We have two main goals when deciding on reacquisition costs:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* Reacquisition isn’t a currency sink. We aren’t trying to make you spend all of your hard-earned Glimmer. We just want to make sure the items you find out in the world still have value.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* Players won’t have to deal with currency conversions. For example, if a shader dismantles into Glimmer, it costs Glimmer to reacquire. If the shader came from Eververse, it will dismantle into Bright Dust, and therefore costs Bright Dust to reacquire. These same goals are true of all Collection items.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Note: A lot of you have been asking about the cost of shaders. We can say that they will have a cost to reacquire from Collections, but there will no longer be a cost to apply shaders to gear.
&gt;
&gt;Here’s a quick example: Let’s say you just got that sweet Calus’s Treasured shader to drop from the raid. You’re able to apply it immediately at no cost. If you want that specific shader on all your armor, weapons, Ghost, ship, and Sparrow, you’ll need to pay some Glimmer to reacquire a handful of copies straight out of Collections.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;*Before we move along—purple and gold looks fantastic on the upcoming Tangled Shore Warlock armor set. You heard it here first.*
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;***When reacquiring gear from Collection, what Power level will they be?***
&gt;
&gt;Collection items will come out close to your current Power level, but will require infusion to be ready for endgame activities.  This is a delicate balance of making sure Collections don’t create a leveling exploit, but still providing items that are usable right away in most activities.


If there are things you’re eager to know more about, leave a post in the *Destiny 2* forum of Bungie.net, or sound off on social media. We’ll be watching for trending topics, and working to get you up to speed before *Forsaken* launches.

##Iron Resolve


[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/112/112511/D2_DOC.gif)


Each day, Destiny Player Support patrols the #Help forum to assist Guardians in need. Whether it be an error code caused by connection issues or an item not appearing properly in game—they’re here to lend a helping hand. 


This is their report.


&gt;
&gt;**Lupus Visage**
&gt;
&gt;Last week, we reported an issue where the Lupus Visage ornament for Fighting Lion, featured in the Iron Ornament Bundle, did not properly unlock for some players after it was activated. With this week’s deployment of [*Destiny 2* Hotfix 1.2.1.2](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/46973), this issue is expected to be resolved for all players.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Players who previously purchased this ornament should now find it when inspecting Fighting Lion. Players who purchase this bundle in the future will find this ornament in their modifications inventory.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Permissions**
&gt;
&gt;Over the past several months, we have monitored reports from players in Russia who repeatedly encountered the error “Permissions to access online multiplayer have changed or profile signed in elsewhere.” While it's still possible for players to encounter this error through natural causes, we believe the platform issues that caused the elevated number of these errors to be resolved.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;For players who see this error in the wild, we suggest that you visit our [Help article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/12271) for troubleshooting information. As always, players who encounter repeated errors codes and do not find resolution by searching [help.Bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help) should report the error to the [#Help forums](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Faction Rallies Known Issues**
&gt;
&gt;With the launch of this week’s Faction Rallies, we have players reporting that they've kept their allegiance from the last [Faction Rallies](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/46312), even after pledging to a different faction for this one.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;While Destiny Player Support is currently investigating this issue, any player encountering issues while pledging to factions should submit a report to the[ #Help forums](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help). If possible, providing captured video footage or imagery of your issue as it is encountered in game will be helpful in our investigation.

##No Intermission

Running out of medals isn’t a requirement to take the crown in Movie of the Week. In anticipation for Prestige raid lairs, we took some time to find a six-player fireteam that has perfected the art of DPS.

After two weeks out, it’s great to be back. C[o](https://imgur.com/jgZ8cGI)zmo will be out next week with family, but he’s made me promise to uphold his legacy of hiding felines in blog copy. In 14 days, a few of us will be on flights heading toward Tampa to join many of you at GuardianCon. Next week, we’ll have the full roster and some details on what we’ll be doing at the event. Until then, I’ll be spending some time on Titan. Hope to see you out there, even if you’ve pledged to an opposing faction.


Oh, and before I leave, join me in giving a shout out to the following Fireteams who earned the top three Nightfall scores last week!

,DestinyTheGame,"Game Activities and Reward Systems

One of the big issues I have with Destiny 2 is that once you complete your milestones there is nothing really left to push more. You can collect pieces but you can't progress in your light level. I think the reward system needs be adjusted to make Destiny back into a hobby and allow your time spent to mean something, regardless of how much it is. 

I think there is an easy way to achieve that idea, Consumable Trophies. Every activity has a vendor that lets you rank up with them for completing their related activities. Every time you rank up you receive an engram for that location. With the Trophy system, instead of taking that engram you can collect a Trophy related to that vendor. (More in depth below). That Trophy is a consumable that provides a chance at getting high end loot by completing more of that related activity. 

This means that the more time you spend in an activity, the higher chance of getting end game loot is. You can do anything in the game (Besides nothing) and progress on light level. This means hardcore players can grind out a ton of work after milestones and casual players can play exactly what they want to level up. The numbers are designed to not flood the game with high level loot but keep the chance open for it. 

Each Trophy type would come with its own loot set, really showing off where you dedicate your time. Each set would include armor, weapons, ghost, ship, sparrow, shader and emblems. 

Below is a more in depth guide of the ranking system changes as well as changes to the layout of activities to create more for players to do and easier steps from low to high level guardians. 

*** 
##Crucible

Crucible would work mostly the same way. Tokens are granted for playing games and can be turned into their respective vendor. Shaxx would take crucible and with Trials Tokens, the agent of the Nine. Nothing changes there. The change would come with rank ups. Each rank would be 20 tokens. Each time you rank up you can choose to take the engram for gear or collect a Victors Trophy. 

* Victors Trophy

Consumable that gives you a 10 percent chance at getting a piece of gear up to 400 in your next crucible match or Trials of the Nine match. 

* Casual

2 tokens per loss, 4 tokens per win

* Competitive

1 token per loss, 5 tokens per win

* Featured

2 tokens per loss, 4 tokens per win

* Rumble

2 tokens per loss, 5 tokens per win

* Trials

3 wins, gear up to 385.
5 wins, 1 piece of armor up to 400
7 wins, 1 weapon up to 400
Flawless, 1 piece of random gear up to 400
Every win after first flawless, 4 tokens

****

##PvE

**Patrols**

This would stay the same. Lost Sectors, Chests, Public Events and materials would all net tokens. When you rank up with the respective planetary vendor you will gain the **Explorers Trophy** that acts just like the Victors Trophy but gives a 7 percent chance during Public Events on any location.    

        
**** 

**Meditations**

Heroic missions are coming back and will probably be added to the director screen. In the left corner there should be a node for Crucible, Strikes and Meditations. Meditations will include 4 playlists. Ikora Rey will be the Vendor for all of these. You can rank up with just like any vendor. 20 tokens to rank up. At each rank up you will gain the **Historian Trophy**consumable that will give a 10 percent chance of a high level drop from your next Heroic Missions/ Adventure

* Missions 

Launches low level missions to replay in random order. Gives 2 tokens per completion.

* Heroic Missions

Launches a high level mission that is meant to be a late game challenge for players. Gives 4 tokens per completion.

* Adventures

Launches a low level adventure in random order. Gives 2 tokens per completion.

* Heroic Adventures

Launches a high level adventure that is meant to be a late game challenge for players. Gives 4 tokens per completion. 

****

**Raids**

I believe raids are well done right now with rewards. The only change is adding the **Raider Trophy** that gives a %50 chance of end game reward for completing the raid again. 

****

**Strikes**

Strikes should really be the focus of the PvE side of things. Because of this they could use some love. Zavala will still be the vendor but the playlist itself will change. As well as the playlists changing players can obtain the **Vanguard Trophy** on rank up instead of collecting an engram, similar to the other trophies. 

* Training Strikes

Low level strikes that have no modifiers and made to help low level players to reach the recommended light level for the newest campaign. 1 engram up to that level and 2 tokens will drop.

* Veteran Strikes

Mid Level strikes that have two modifiers and gets players up to 345. The base level to start the next strikes. 1 engram and 5 tokens drop.

* Heroic Strikes

High level strikes that have three modifiers and will get players up to 375. 1 engram and 8 tokens will drop. 

* Nightfall

End Game level that requires base of 375. Can complete once a week per character and will drop 2 engrams up to 400 and 12 tokens. 

* Vanguard Trophy

This one will work a little different than the rest. If you take the Trophy instead of the rank up engram it will increase chances of high end loot drops. 2% on Training, 5% on Veteran, %10 on Heroic and %15 on Nightfall. 

***

##Milestones

Milestones would be removed if I could have the choice. Instead, each vendor would offer a Record every week that you can pick up from them. The record goes into the pursuits page and shows where you are at with obtaining that milestone. Once you finish it you turn it into that vendor for your reward. 

****

**Bounties**
 
Bringing back the Bounty Board with Xander 99-40. 

* Daily Bounties

Xander has been instructed by planetary vendors to hand out 2 daily bounties per location that rank up those planetary members when turned in. 

* Weekly Bounties

Xander will offer time consuming bounties for Crucible, Strikes, Meditations and Exploring. Each one will be demanding but will offer 1 engram up to 400 light and a 5% chance of an exotic dropping.

* Monthly Bountis

Are you ready for the hardcore? Once you complete 4 weekly bounties in one week, Xander will offer you a monthly Bounty. To complete the monthly bounty you will need to complete 12 weekly bounties and and track down hidden chests on random locations. Completing a monthly Bounty will give you 3 pieces of high end gear from a unique gear set, unique shaders, 1 exotic engram and an emblem. 

* Exotic Bounties

Exotic bounties will take you on pursuits to unlock 1 of 3 exotics you can only get from exotic bounties. These bounties have a 1% from dailies, %10 percent from Weeklies and %50 from Monthlies. 

****

**Factions**

* Every Week

Factions can stay active through every week. You gain tokens by doing other activites in the game. During most weeks you can only get the two basic shaders and random drops from engrams. 

* Rally Week

Rally week will bring in ornaments, exotics and select gear to each faction. On Rally week you can pick up **Badge of Select Faction**. This puts the flame symbol on your back and activates renown in the world. Renown can build up to 15. First 5 will give you 5 yellow flames, second 5 will be blue flames, third will be green flames. Renown will be more spread out to allow players to do more for their rally.

Crucible, 1 kill will give you 3 renown, 1 death will remove 1. 
Patrols, Events +7, Chests +1, Targets +3, 20 enemy kills +2, material +1, Beacon +2, Death -3
Strikes: 20 enemy kills +2, Death -3

You turn in renown by completing lost sectors, matches or strikes. You can rack up renown and use it to purchase the unique loot from each faction. This will mean you need less to buy an item but more to get multiple unique items.


****

**TL:DR** 

* Every time you rank you, vendors should offer a Trophy consumable that gives you a chance at end game loot while continuing the activities related to that vendor.
* No matter how much you play, you can always work towards higher level loot. 
* More Strike Playlists
* Mission and Adventure Playlists
* Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Exotic bounties. 
* Faction Rally changes

,GameAttack,"Hey g1s! Happy Monday! I've seen a few posts about Archives and stuff - I left this as a reply in a post a few days ago but didn't get any replies, so thought I'd try again :) 

So - we put streams as unlisted after they are done - we do this for a reason - the streams completely bury VOD (edited, short) content - which from our side is the only thing that is really shareable on the channel. Another reason is we want VOD content to breathe - you guys support it on the Patreon, which allows us to make it (straight up, this is the truth, so thank you g1s SO much for your help.) and in this - when Parker, or Chase are pouring tons of work into these VODS, we want to give them a chance to stand out on the channel. Same thing with Try Hard - we all know since we started streaming that the podcast numbers are really down (obviously switching to a live channel, podcasts basically happen every day, not to mention it's really messed up our algorithm,) so we don't want to bury that with streams either.

If we left stuff unlisted we would be posting upwards of 14 pieces of content, sometimes more, over the course of 6 days. That is really, really bad for a channel (no joke we have experience with this and have talked to analytic specialists about this) and it honestly drives subscribers away. It really does seem that it would be best to push as MUCH content as possible - but YT has changed - people do NOT like being notified multiple times a day. This sucks for sure, but we don't want people to not give us a chance because we're posting too much.

What we can do is streamline the playlists on the channel and do an overhaul of how to find content, consolidating game lists and that kind of thing, but posting stream archives was really hurting the VOD content. Even when it came to Archives - most viewers (I mean like 95&amp;#37;) would leave the video after the first minute or two because they click and then see that it's a two-three hour video.

I'll take a look at the playlists and see what I can do to prune them down to be more streamlined -

,twilight,"[INTRO POST, PREFACE AND SCHEDULE] (https://www.reddit.com/r/twilight/comments/8n4j2j/the_great_summer_subreddit_reread_of_2018_the/)
*Chapters 7 and 8*

**SUMMARY** - After returning home from La Push, Bella attempts to block out the racing paths of her thoughts with music, to no avail. Once she has fallen asleep, she has a vivid dream of Jacob leading her into the darkness of the forest, terrified, as she fights to go towards the sun. Jacob transforms into a reddish wolf, and Edward appears, with the suns rays exposing his sparkle as he becomes Bella to him with pointed fangs. Wolf!Jacob rushes forward to protect her and Bella is jolted awake when she moves to jump away from the dream apparition. 
Once awake, Bella takes to the internet to research Jacob’s legendary claims. She finds a website called Vampires A-Z, and stumbles upon the Stregoni Benefici. 

Stregoni benefici: An Italian vampire, said to be on the side of goodness, and a mortal enemy of
all evil vampires.

This one entry gives Bella some peace of mind before she writes the entire enterprise off in frustration - after all, if they were vampires they would have burnt to death in the sunlight. To clear her mind, she wanders out into the forest for the first time, and finds a beauty in Forks she had not noticed before. While sitting on a log in the forest, she wrestled with her two main questions - could what Jacob told her possibly be true, and what was she going to do if it was true. She comes to the decision that Edward and his family were definitely otherworldly, but that she couldn’t stay away from him regardless. The word Twilight is used for the first time as she scurries home, now aware of just how strong the emotional ties are between her and Edward. 

The next day is sunny, and when Bella comes to school, confident in her decision to stay close to Edward regardless of what he is, the Cullens are gone. Mike asks her out and she redirects him to Jessica, who then repays the favor by inviting her to come to Port Angeles to go dress shopping with her, Angela, and Lauren, even though Bella won’t be going to the dance. The absence of the Cullens throws Bella out of whack, and she realized she is depressed to not have the familiar sensation of their eyes watching her. After school she lays out in the sun and rests after getting irritated with how many of her favorite books have a romantic leading male with a name similar to Edward (Sense and Sensibility and Mansfield Park by Jane Austen.)

She awoke with a start after the sun went behind clouds, suddenly aware that she was not alone. On edge, she goes inside, and writes the feeling off once she sees Charlie sitting inside having come home from work. The next day is also sunny, and Bella once again sinks into her disappointment, with the added knowledge that she will be spending the night in Port Angeles fending off Lauren’s jibes. Throughout the day however, Lauren pulls out of the plans, leaving only Jessica Angela and Bella. 

Once the trio reaches Port Angeles, the girls tell Bella that Tyler has been telling the whole school that he is taking her to Prom. Fuming, Bella helps them find their dresses then splits off alone to go book shopping in an attempt to take her mind off of his presumption. As she walked through Port Angeles, Bella sees a silver Volvo, and is once again consumed with irritation and confusion towards Edward, which have only been heightened with the time apart. She refers to him as a “stupid unreliable vampire”, adopting the nomenclature without even noticing. 

As Bella walks back to the restaurant to meet Jessica and Angela, the sun begins to set, and four men call out to her. She quickly turns onto another street, only the realize that the group of men had split up and were now following her and cornering her into an alley behind a warehouse. Panicked, Bella scrambles to remember what little self defense she has learned, and as the men close in, a car screeches around the corner, nearly hitting the group as the vehicle skids to a stop in front of Bella. Edward commands Bella into the passenger's seat. 

In slight shock, Edward directs Bella to put on her seatbelt as she marvels at how quickly her fear dissipated when she heard the anger in his voice. And angry he is. She ends up comforting and calming him as his fury builds. Edward explains to her that he has issues with his temper, and that he wants nothing more than to go back and hunt down the men, but Bella redirects him to drive her to meet with the girls. He finds the restaurant easily without Bella ever telling him the intended destination. They see Jessica and Angela leaving, and they explain that they had gone ahead and eaten without her. Edward insists that Bella needs to eat, and so sends the other girls home, bursting with questions, and takes Bella out to eat himself, promising to drive her home afterwards. 

Edward dazzles the hostess into giving them a private table, and Bella confronts him for the first time about his affect on people. He brushes it off, and attempts to run through the shock checklist as Bella continues to attempt to question him. The waitress flirts with Edward, which Bella resents, but she is calmed when Edward gives her his jacket when the cold begins to reach her through the adrenaline fog. She mildly ogles him in a skintight sweater, and he compliments her on the blue color of her blouse. Emboldened by the comfortable and safe nature of the conversation, Bella begins to propose theories of his nature to him, much to his surprise. He confirms in a roundabout manner that he can read minds through a hypothetical conversation, and when he devolves into self loathing after mocking Bella’s penchant for trouble, she reaches out to hold his hand, which is icy to the touch. 

The contact opens the metaphorical flood gates, and Edward confesses to following Bella to Port Angeles, and to dedicating himself to keeping her safe. Instead of being perturbed by his confession, Bella is pleased, much to his dismay. He admits to putting her in danger the first day in Biology, but doesn’t confess in what manner. He admits to tracking her through others thoughts the whole day, and that he wanted to kill the men who cornered her when he read their minds, and that it was only her presence that kept him from it. Bella finishes eating, and they leave, with Edward ignoring the flirty waitress as they get into the car, preparing for a 1 hour completely private journey back to Forks. 


**MARGARET'S REVIEW** -
Man, I love Bella’s (essentially Stephenie’s) taste in music. I still listen to the playlists on Stephenies website on the regular. This isn’t totally related, but I listened to the Twilight playlist while typing up this weeks review and it made my heart happy, so I pass that joy on to all of you.

I had completed forgotten about this first dream - it was fascinating to me to see how much of the details ended up being correct in the scheme of the saga (Jacob’s colouring as a wolf, Bella getting on board with the sparkling thing immediately in her subconscious, etc). If you aren’t reading along but just participating in the discussions, I suggest you take a look at this passage. It is very interesting to read having read the complete saga as often as I have. 
I also have a tendency to imagine the series in whatever modern day is when I am reading, and not 2006. Having Bella describe her life with dial up brought back a lot of interesting memories for me.

The chapter of Midnight Sun that goes with Chapter 7 of Twilight is one of my absolute favorites - I know this isn’t a Midnight Sun read along, and it won’t be, but I wanted to throw that out there. Him watching her bask in the sun is purely poetic. 

The fact that Edward is wearing a white turtleneck and a tan leather jacket for the entire Port Angeles encounter is my new favorite thing, and I refuse to let the movie interpretation of his wardrobe interfere with my mental image anymore. How Alice lets him out of the house wearing 75% of what he wears I will never understand (We will get into this during chapter 13 I promise)

**SUBREDDIT QUESTIONS OF THE WEEK** - *For those of you who have read the complete saga - knowing what we do about Edwards past, what are your thoughts on the Port Angeles scenes? What about them in regards to what we know about Rosalie? For those of you who are less familiar - why do you think Bella accepts the whole vampire thing so readily? Even before she knows for sure, she accepts the nomenclature and idea into her own internal monologue. How do you feel about the Edward and Bella relationship, and how easily she accepts certain behaviors from him (using mind reading to keep tabs on her, etc).*",t2_pm6j4,,,0,,THE GREAT SUMMER REREAD OF 2018 - Chapters 7 &amp; 8 of Twilight,[],r/twilight,False,,,,,,False,,False,dark,,,public,,,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},,False,9,,,,self,False,,[],,,True,,,text,,,,text,self.twilight,,,,,,,False,False,True,False,False,,,False,,True,False,False,,,,,,,t5_2ql1w,,,,,8tk24i,,,paternalpadfoot,,11,True,,False,,,,/r/twilight/comments/8tk24i/the_great_summer_reread_of_2018_chapters_7_8_of/,,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/twilight/comments/8tk24i/the_great_summer_reread_of_2018_chapters_7_8_of/,1963,1529867333.0,0,,False,,,,,,,,1439790417.0,1536439485.0,,,

,homeautomation,"Jawbone's UP line of fitness trackers could be set to wake you with a vibrating alarm when you were in the optimal 'light' stage of sleep for the easiest transition to wakefulness in order to avoid feeling groggy. This has become known as a sleep cycle smart alarm, and has been adopted by some other devices and apps. Broadly, my question is: is there a way to use this as a trigger for automation?

Specifically, I want to mimic the jawbone functionality on a fitbit. Ideally, if I can get this basic functionality, I could also use the smart sleep cycle trigger to automate Philips hue sunrise simulation and Amazon Echo's daily news brief, weather and traffic reports, and a 'wake up' playlist of music.

I recently bought a Fitbit, which does monitor sleep cycle, but does not have a corresponding alarm.
This has triggered my search for a workaround using ifttt, Sleep for Android, and Google Calendars, to push a notification to my Fitbit, but I haven't been able to make it work because I can't find an IFTTT triggered by Sleep as Android's alarm, (which must be able to create the Google Calendar event &gt;20minites before the alarm so Fitbit's Bluetooth sync cycle is sure to have updated.

,Kanye,"Hey everyone, I'm sure now that KTSE is finally here people are going to share what they think the best order is for playlists, I wanted to kick that off a little with what I think works best!


The projects actually perfectly (well one of the acts needs one more song bc of Tey's album) divide into a 5 act play of sorts, and the themes line up pretty well! Because a few of the artists made albums dealing with only one or two themes their songs are a little clumped together. Here we go!


**Act One: Introduction/The people we are**

*Feel The Love (KSG)* - pretty good lead sound, Push's verse is pretty introductory

*If you know you know (Daytona)* - actually follows FTL pretty well since T is almost the main artist in that song, Push himself says this song is just kind of an introduction to him with his genius explanations

*All Mine (ye)* - Not exactly a thematically intense song, introduces Ye as the possessive lover for Kim we've always known him to be

*No Manners (KTSE)* - Introduces Teyana and her heavy infatuation a lot of her songs talk about, pretty good chaser to All Mine.

*Hurry (KTSE)* - Continues the theme of being driven by sex

*Infrared (Daytona)* - The way Pusha T sees the rest of the rap game, specifically Drake

*Kids See Ghosts (KSG)* - Introduces the duo, also talks a little on the pressures of fame, leading into...


**Act Two: Struggle/The problems we face**

*Hard Piano (Daytona)* - The ups and downs of fame

*Not safe for radio (Nasir)* - The struggle of our nation, returning to the mic, how the world sees Nas

*cops shot the kid (Nasir)* - More on the struggles of our nation, particularly the issues the black community faces with the police

*Everything (Nasir)* - Even more on the nation, also talks about wanting to start over

*A rose in Harlem (KTSE)* - Teyana talks about being betrayed and the things people say about her

*Santeria (Daytona)* - The sadness and struggles of the death of Pusha's friend

*I thought about killing you (ye)* - Ye's classic struggle of being the man the media knows and the flawed-but-trying-to-change man we know


**Act Three: Corruption/The 7 Deadly Sins**

*Bonjour (Nasir)* - representing lust

*3Way (KTSE)* - also representing lust

*WTP (KTSE)* -  finishes the representation of lust, also representing envy. (I know the repeated loop of this song is very lustful but she actually talks a bit about wanting more than what she has, also envy pairs well with lust)

*Adam and Eve (Nasir)* - representing greed using the biblical personifications of greed. Doesn't so much talk about current struggles as it does acknowledging the lifetime of greed Nas has lived.

*Yikes (ye)* - representing pride

*Violent Crimes (ye)* - representing gluttony. This one is a little bit of stretch since there's definitely some wrath in the title, but gluttony isn't just about food its about moderation, and Kanye hear talks about wanting to control every aspect of his daughter's life out of fear.

*Come back baby (Daytona)* - representing sloth. Another stretch but the song focuses on Pusha's inability (or lack of motivation) to leave drugs and money behind him

*Cudi Montage (KSG)* - representing wrath, especially in gang culture


**Act Four: Overcoming/Winning out against the struggle**

*Gonna Love Me (KTSE)* - introduces the theme of the the next few tracks, overcoming problems in relationships

*Wouldn't Leave (ye)* - At his weakest moment Kanye is reminded Kim is there for life.

*Issues/Hold On (KTSE)* - Amazing chaser to Wouldn't Leave, also focuses on keeping together through rough patches

*Simple Things (Nasir)* - Focusing on the good and pushing for GOAT status

*Fire (KSG)* - Hearing what the haters say and choosing to ignore it

*What Would Meek Do? (Daytona)* - Blocking out the haters, follows the theme of Fire well

*4th Dimension (KSG)* - This song mentions things that Cudi and Ye have fought with and learning to just let them go, begins a little celebration. Leading into...


**Act Five: Celebration/Coming out a better person**

*No Mistakes (ye)* - Kanye celebrating his overcoming of his relationship issues with Kim

*The games we play (Daytona)* - although this song is about drug dealing, that is what got Pusha T where he is today, this song celebrates his success and
 mentions those who helped him get here

*White Label (Nasir)* - leaving the bull behind us and celebrating a system of success

*Ghost Town (ye)* - The real celebration begins here. Nothing to be said about this amazing track that we haven't already said, you know it belongs here

*Freeee (Ghost Town Pt 2) (KSG)* - it says it itself, follows Ghost Town well and has the same themes

*Never Would Have Made It (KTSE)* - Honestly works pretty well as a part 3 to Ghost Town, changes the theme up a little to family but thats what makes it a good chaser

*Reborn (KSG)* - Cudi celebrating his own personal victory over drugs and depression, also puts a nice bow on the narrative arc I used for this playlist so it serves as a pretty good finisher.

,DestinyTheGame,"So before i start ive played Comp on many other games but the main ones being Halo and Call of Duty and now Destiny 2 i just wanted to put my thoughts into a post and hear what other people think of my thoughts and feedback sorry in advance if i get salty.

So lets start with the Ranking system, personally i think its BAD reasons for this is its not a real/true rank its just a point system that matches you against people with from what ive seen is SBMM as most of my games have been very sweaty and against teams of 4 and im fine with that.

I would like to see Bungie do a real ranking system of a 1-50 Highskill. The way this would work is at the start of every new season everyone would start at rank 1 and have to work up to rank 50. For the matchmaking system it would match you against people within 5 ranks of your current rank, for example if im rank 32 it would match me against people that are rank 30,31,32,33,34 that way you are always matching people within your skill range and i think thats fair. As for matching teams against solos i mean personally im not bothered as in Halo it will match you against teams and its fine everyone talk in game chat for the most part and its a enjoyable experience.

Next ill go over the game modes personally i think we need some more TRUE objective modes that push teams to play together and communicate what point to push and how to hold the point. For example id like Rift to return but you only get a single point for scoring and the score limit would be i dont know 6. And it would switch sides mid match kind of like countdown. Thats just a example of something off the top of my head that i thought of in 2 mins. Countdown is okay but most of the time its just clash with revives and nobody really plants at least from my experience. Survival is honestly just a camp fest get a pick and then hide because you have life advantage like its not fun. I even think Control, clash and Rift would be a better choice for competitive.

Loss streaks NEED to be removed and that final you dont need to further punish people for losing it makes me just want to stop playing. Win streaks im fine with as its an extra reward for playing so well as a team and thats awesome.

Next thing is the radar debate now personally i prefer radar at least in Destiny as its a fast paced game with so many height changes and insane ability's going off. Now dont get me wrong i think the distance the radar covers is WAY to big and needs to be reduced in all game modes. Dont get me wrong i see the benefits of no radar but honestly for no radar to work well the audio needs to be improved drastically. As and example i should be able to hear people running and walking around the map that are kind of close to me like Call of Duty. Its just SO annoying dieing to someone that ran up behind me that i didn't hear and couldn't prepare for and i know some people with just say get good but thats not the point many other people have said the same as me. Its stupid that i have to play super paranoid and always be checking behind me i should be able to hear people and prepare for them like you can in Call of Duty even halo has better audio cues.

As for rewards i think Redrix is a very nice reward, but its very frustrating that its locked behind Season 3 and i dont know if ill be able to get it in season 4. This seems to be a common theme for Destiny 2 at the moment all these time gated events and rewards i feel like if i dont rush to get them im missing out and thats not a fun experience in my opinion.

Te next things ill go over are not really related to competitive exclusively but i want to talk about them anyway. First thing is meta why i like the buffs to Grav Lance and Vig Wing its a very passive meta right now i would like to see hand cannons become a 3 tap and the nightshade archetype of pulse become a 3 burst this would speed up the pace of the game instantly i know this is probably something Bungie are working on for September but i still want to bring it up. Next thing is the Arcstrider problem i dont want it to get nerfed just buff the other classes simple.

I do think Bungie need to have rules for competitive like no subclass stacking so you cant have 4 Arcstriders this would help increase variety in the playlist as its 1 dimensional as F**k right now. Ban certain exotics from the playlist maybe like Sweats in D1 as this worked very well. But thats a last resort kind of thing overall if they buff other classes and speed up the pace of the game most of this will be fine anyway.

Next thing is to do with weapon slot changes and power ammo personally power ammo right now is such a crutch its pretty much whoever gets power wins and that shouldn't be the case. This all comes down to counter play having a weapon that can kill a super thats running straight at you or kill 3 people that are all running after you when you're last alive to make that clutch play. Thats what made D1 exciting at any moment a good/highly skilled player could go off and wipe the entire enemy team this sort of play making needs to return. I remember playing Trails in D1 and being last alive i have a shotgun managed to get 1 drop down from the ledge bait another in jump up and shotgun the other and then went on altar and 3 tapped the last person trying to get a revive.
At the moment good players feel hindered by teammates like i never feel like i won the game its always a team effort but i D1 i could single handedly go off and win the game on my own and outplay 3 people. Power ammo in D2 is also so inconsistent most times i use a shotgun or a fusion and trying to counter a super with power feels pointless most of the time they just thank the shot and then i end up dying like whats the point ion power if it cant kill a super consistently. Good players should be able to counter other people in supers like in D1.

Anyway i think thats about it i just wanted to vent and give my feedback to the community and hopefully someone from Bungie sees this and can relay it back to the crucible team. Thanks for taking the time out to read (if you did). Peace.",t2_3xymif,,,0,,My experience with Competitive.

,offmychest,"I've only *really* known him for a little over a month. We've been acquaintances for a long time but we were both curious. 
I added him on IG because I wanted to know if what a former crush (who led me on hard) said to me about him was true—if he really was an asshole (they do not like each other). A few weeks later, he added me on FB and messaged me about a poem I posted. I didn't expect him to. We started texting, then hanging out. I kept telling myself that I wasn't interested in him—that he was just fun to talk to and be around. But I don't come across people like him very often. He was something I could connect with on such a deep and profound way, especially intellectually and emotionally. We enjoyed similar music and both love baseball. We could talk about politics and faith and life all day. Sometimes we did.

When I first met him, I thought he was rather intense. Brash. Confident. But as I got to know him, I realized that there were many layers to him. He's thoughtful, sensitive, sentimental, kind, gentle, responsible, and so creative. He was also self-conscious, hyper-vigilant, and a bit reactive sometimes. After two weeks, we realized we were both attracted to each other. 

This was a Sunday night. He told me as we were sitting on my front porch, ""I'm attracted to the way you think. The way you negotiate with the world around you. The way you're so direct and confident."" No guy has really ever said that to me before. It felt like I was being seen, for once. I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

So we said, ""let's figure it out slowly."" No labels but ""dating."" I was perfectly okay with that because I didn't want to rush into anything. My last relationship did not end on the best note and the guy I was talking to before him (that former crush I mentioned) screwed me over. So I tried to be really cautious about this one. He had some bad relationship experiences in the past too, and he also wanted to be cautious. He was afraid that we're both too similar, and I expressed the same concern. We both wanted to be careful because we knew this was something special. We just knew. 

He's so affectionate and endearing. I'm normally not, but he brought out that side of me. The day after we started dating, he made me a playlist of songs that represent him. That has NEVER happened to me before. I felt so honored; the gesture was so thoughtful and meaningful to me. 

We still tried to be careful—we were both good at giving each other time and space. Even though I was slowly letting my guard down, I still stopped myself from jumping too far ahead. I stopped myself from envisioning the future because that would get me too attached. But then, he would make little comments like, ""I want to take you on a nice dinner when the semester starts. I know we're both busy (he's a college instructor and I work with college students at a non-profit), but let me take you out."" He wanted to play music with me, go for long drives, and go hiking. It's the little things. 

Everything was good. But I've been struggling with anxiety since high school and summertime is usually when it flairs up. I mentioned to him about it vaguely once, when we were just friends. Just a general statement. I wanted to wait until we were more established before I talked to him about it.

The following Sunday comes along. It was a bad day. I had an argument with my best friend. We made up but I still felt the leftover anxiety from it. Then I went to church and felt anxious there. Then I had band practice and he picked me up after, because we were going to hang out and have a beer. 

I should've told him about my anxiety. 

After one beer, I was a mess. I ended up confessing to him that I was willing to take a risk and move things a bit more forward. He said he was still trying to figure his feelings out. For some reason, that triggered an anxiety attack. It just looked like me sobbing uncontrollably and I shared about my abandonment issues. I couldn't articulate myself well. But he was supportive and stayed with me. I don't think he knew it was an anxiety attack—all he knew was that I was crying and spilling my guts out. He dropped me off home and told me he needed a day to breathe. I told him I needed the same. We were both emotionally drained from that night. The next day, I was in a better headspace. I was determined not to fuck shit up, so I wrote a plan to establish better emotional boundaries between us. I wanted to tell him that I'm okay with moving things slowly, that it's probably what we needed.

Tuesday comes along. We met up and I was confident. I apologized about Sunday night and told him that after more careful thought, I wanted to be on the same page—to take things slowly and figure it out together.

But he wanted to take a full step back. He said we needed to work on our friendship and that it was the most concrete thing he could offer me because he didn't want to lose our connection and was afraid to hurt me. I was devastated. I tried to argue back and look for a compromise. After an hour and a half, I conceded. ""Okay, fine. We're friends."" I was incredibly frustrated but I wanted to respect his decision.

It was funny because things felt normal after. I was still hurting but it meant a lot that we were still friends. I wanted to be friends, and I was okay with working on that. After all, it hadn't been that long since we actually started talking. It made sense to me. My anxiety, however, worsened as the days went by. As a result, I kept overanalyzing what happened to us. It felt like it was my fault, that what happened on that Sunday night ruined it for us. It was then I realized I needed to do something about my anxiety so I began seeking treatment again.

Well, he came over the next day because he wanted to record a song in my kitchen. Then he offered to help me get a new phone because mine broke. It was good. We still texted and talked like friends. That Saturday, he offered to pick me up so that I could watch his band play at this small bar. He flirted with me a bit, and that felt a bit reassuring—he still likes me. The next week rolls and that was when he became a little more distant. We texted less. He became a bit more evasive, so I tried to just respect the space. 

We ended up hanging out that Friday night—got some beer and went to a beach to talk.

It was fun. Felt so normal. I shrugged off my insecurities about his evasiveness because we were laughing and joking and talking again. Then he mentioned to me that he ran into a mutual friend of ours. That friend asked him about me, but it wasn't about us—it was about whether or not I was dating my former crush (who's mutual friends with them both) because apparently, he was actually interested in me. Now, I had stopped communicating with my former crush in May.

So I laughed and said, ""Well he's too late. I'm over him. He led me on and I respect myself enough not to go back to that."" I said that to subtly reassure him that I would never, ever go back to that guy. 

Towards the end of the night, he began to flirt with me a little. Nothing too forward—subtle but deliberate touches and more intense eye contact. He would brush up against my arm and lightly touch it. Poked me on my side a few times. He knows I'm ticklish. When we got into the car and we were laughing, he lightly rubbed my thigh as he mentioned something funny. I was still pretty buzzed, but I knew that those touches were deliberate. It reassured me that his feelings were still there, and I knew he was completely sober through it all (he had to drive). Before he dropped me off home, we went to the store because he wanted to make sure I was drinking water.

I went to bed that night feeling great. I was just happy I got to spend time with him; the flirting was just a bonus.

But the next week—this week—things seemed to have changed. He became more evasive and non-responsive. I would text him normally, but was always met with short responses. I asked to hang out a few times and each time he said he was busy. Of course, I didn't want to push or question it. I trusted his word. But I felt hurt anyway because I know, deep down, that something is off.

I texted him two nights ago and mustered the courage to ask if the distance I was sensing was because of busyness or if it's real. He shrugged it off and said he was just busy. So I complied. But he asked me what I meant when I said ""distant"" so I elaborated a bit on how I felt that we're not talking like how we used to when we were first friends, but that I wasn't sure if it was just my perception. He kinda gave me an evasive response so I had to let it go.

I saw him yesterday—he came by to pick up some books he lent me. My anxiety has been at an all-time high this week so I haven't been doing well. I tried my best to mentally prepare myself to see him. I thought he'd just stay in his car so I prepared myself not to talk at all. But when I got to the parking lot, he got out of his car and joked about how it looked like I just woke up from a nap. He was acting normal and friendly. I could hardly look him in the eye. I thanked him for letting me borrow them, and chitchatted for a bit about how I enjoyed the books. I wonder if he sensed my apprehension. I was just not in a good headspace.

I feel shitty today. My anxiety is crippling. I can't stop blaming myself for how things ended. The passage of time is brutal to me, especially with my anxiety. A day feels like a week. A week feels like a month. Fuck. I want fix things but I don't even know how. All I am hanging on to is the fact that maybe if I stayed consistent, he'll realize that I'm not like his ex—I don't want to hurt him and I don't want to just leave.

BUT WE DIDN'T EVEN LAST A FUCKING WEEK. We couldn't even give this any fucking time. And now, he's hardly talking to me for reasons I don't even know. And it feels like it's my fucking fault.

## Longer TL;DR

Most of us know, that being prettier will make your life easier. Humans evolved to believe prettier people are better than ugly thus de facto threating prettier people better than the rest.This certain dentist believes you can improve how your face looks by:

1. Eating food that requires more chewing
2. Chewing gum
3. Keeping your jaw always closed (not too tight)
4. Slightly pushing your mouth ceiling with your tongue all the time

## Body

Additionally to the standard Tomassi/Suave Red Pill theory, there are some additional PUA theory out there. Lets look at **Face and LMS** theory ([link](https://lmstheory.wordpress.com)). There is a whole channel dedicated to this, but I would like to focus on a specific playlist and a specific video.  
In [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY3bIMRKil8&amp;list=PLkv7q48BLVMJAYso4X58adinfjCil9L5n&amp;index=7) the dentist talks about jaw line and wide vs long faces. He explains why today we have longer and not wider faces, and proves (eh ""proves"") that we consider wider faces more attractive. He provides services to children, and encourages mature people to try and change their habits, because that will at least stop some degradation and in the long run improve the jawline.

## I highly recommend watching this whole [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkv7q48BLVMJAYso4X58adinfjCil9L5n) - it includes some LMS theory, and is followed by the dentist's lecture.


**Update:**

It appears that this dentist is well known, and he has his own field called *orthotropics*. I would like to make it clear, I am not affiliated to him and simply thought this could help men look better.


Also, some are saying that this can be harmful to your jaws. I am no doctor, and my advice or this guy's advice should not be taken as doctors advice (even though he is one).

Hahaha, oh well. I can’t help but vocalist’s youthful voice reminds me Tyrell’s, they are kinda similar. I always think about Tyrell’s obsession with Elliot when I hear this song. I like this song but I know it will be extremely cheesy in show :D Guilty pleasure it is.

,SwingDancing,"Hi!

So, when I started dancing, I didn't educate myself much on the history of this dance and the culture it came from. I didn't listen to the people who told me to check out the old videos and listen to old music. To me, these people just didn't realize what was obvious to me - there are plenty of good quality, well-lit modern videos all over YouTube, with more coming out on a weekly basis. These were way easier to watch and understand than black and white videos with poor or no music synced, and bad lighting. I figured I could observe everything I needed to know about Lindy Hop just by attending dances and following the modern international scene through YouTube and attending events. I justified this decision to myself, saying people who cared about preserving and recreating the old stuff were probably just being needlessly rigid and behind the times. The same with music. I was still strict about wanting to only hear swing at dances, but plenty of good music albums were being released by modern swing bands. Why would I listen to old-timey, scratchy records when there was so much stuff coming out from bands I could actually pay to see live? 

It was years before I realized the enormity of what I was missing out on. And when I think about it, there wasn't really a good reason for this, except that I didn't know where to find these videos and music. I recognized, in a general way, that it was important to study the history, but I never really did it. That all changed after a trip to Herrang and reading Frankie's autobiography, and it came as a shock to me to learn that people used to fight and scour to the ends of the earth to find ""clips"" of vintage dancing as recently as the 90s and early 2000s, because now almost everything is just sitting there on YouTube. So it came to me as an equal shock that, as far as I can tell, relatively few people actually study them these days. For evidence of that, you can note that many of the best vintage Lindy Hop clips on YouTube (some linked in this guide, some not) only have a few hundred hits, while the latest videos from the biggest dance weekends hit tens of thousands of views within a week of being released. For the record, I'm not saying this is good or bad.

Regardless, there’s been a lot of talk in this sub lately about the importance of people educating themselves on the history, culture, and music of swing dancing. But on the internet these days, there's way too much information out there to tell what information is bad or good, or even whether you've got it all. In this lindy hopper's starter guide, I'm going to attempt to make the process just a little bit less daunting by making something that I wish someone had given to me when I started.

Since this is a large and complicated guide that covers a variety of topics, I want to be extra clear that **this is not meant to be complete or perfect.** This is undoubtedly going to be a process that will include mistakes and revision. Some of you might disagree with my descriptions or how I've framed things. That's all fine - I'm just one guy, and this is just a list of resources that have worked for me and for people I know, and I wanted to share them in the interest of helping people new to the community orient themselves. I'm no swing historian or expert or anything, I just want to get the ball rolling on a project like this for the larger community that I think is long overdue. 

Please also note, this is not a beginner’s guide to learning *how to swing dance* as much as it is a beginner’s guide to *introducing yourself to swing music, dancing, and culture*, in a broader sense. For that reason, I divided the sections into culture-related resources, music to check out, and dancing videos. I think all three are important. The rankings of beginner, intermediate, and advanced are subjective of course, and relate to some combination of how accessible the resources are (how easy it is for someone with no background to appreciate what they’re seeing) and how important it would be for active members of a swing community to have seen/heard/read them in order to understand what they’re seeing when they experience the swing world. 

Please try not to get too hung up on the beginner/intermediate/advanced ratings themselves - they are more to give some semblance of order to how I think people would be best served interacting with the guide than to be some arbitrary assignment of importance. Everyone is obviously free to go through it however they see fit.

Please also forgive me if you don't agree with or like my descriptions. I tried to just speak to what I know where I thought it would be helpful. In the areas where I make less of a comment, it's because I don't know as much about it, or I didn't feel like I had much to add. If my comments are incorrect, please feel free to correct them. I'll try to incorporate suggestions and additions when I can. Please just be nice and remember that I'm trying to help!

Hope you enjoy!

**Beginner:**

**Beginner Cultural Resources:**

*Frankie Manning - Ambassador of Lindy Hop*

https://www.amazon.com/Frankie-Manning-Ambassador-Lindy-Hop/dp/1592135641

Read Frankie’s book. Just read it. If you take nothing else from this entire list, let it be that you read this book. It changed my entire focus in life as a dancer. It just places so many things in context; what the dance is, how to approach it, how people did things and how that might have relevance for how we do things today, the relationship of musicians and dancers… so many iconic stories and important perspectives. Learn all about the creation of air steps, the Savoy Ballroom in all its glory, Whitey’s Lindy Hoppers, the saturday night contests, Shorty Snowden, the Harlem Congaroos, the revival, and more. It’s genuinely an entertaining read and well written, too. If you're already really into dancing, you won't be able to put it down.

*History of Swing Youtube Video:*

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIuhsUSXCvA

A video that captures the excitement of the revival and a heartwarming introduction to modern swing dancing, and Frankie and Norma. Really, I am so happy I have goosebumps by the time it gets to that ending jam to Jumpin at the Woodside. 

**Beginner Music:**
It’s not clear to me how to give people resources to get started with music - I share my own stuff for free and I’m glad to - I found it years ago by downloading several giant “ALL JAZZ MUSIC” torrents (thousands, maybe tens of thousands of songs) and I’m still discovering new (to me) stuff in there. But that won’t work for everybody. I guess some people will start with Spotify or iTunes, and YouTube even has a lot of stuff. For now anyway, I’m just going to give the names of artists to look into however you see fit. 

*Big Band:*

Count Basie*

The gold standard of big band swing. At Herrang, they say you can never play too much Basie, for good reason. I have a DJ playlist of my absolute best, swinginest songs, and the only artist who can take up a whole page of it is Count Basie. He’s just that good. Note how his solos characteristically use empty space to fill time and build suspense for the next note. His band also featured the All American Rhythm Section - Basie, Jo Jones, Walter Page, and Freddie Green - which as I understand it was considered one of the best rhythm sections...ever. Lester Young, legendary swing sax player, was also featured on a lot of Basie's recordings. Naturally just about everyone who passed through this band was incredible, and I definitely am not the one with all their names.  It was one of the few bands that lasted well beyond the swing era. It seems people mostly agree that Basie’s band was the best dance band around. Notable tunes include Shiny Stockings, Frankie Manning’s favorite tune in his old age, and Jumpin’ at the Woodside, which has been dubbed (in modern times) “the national anthem of Lindy Hop"" and was the original tune to which they choreographed Hellzapoppin'. I tried to think of others, but this band honestly has so many iconic and incredible songs it would justify a whole post and guide in itself. Feel free to make one if you're a basie expert! ;). They also frequently accompanied Billie Holiday, both with her as their vocalist and comprising some or all of the rhythm section on her recordings.

Cab Calloway

Cab’s band was just top-tier. Professional, reliably good quality sound. Could get a bit campy at times, but so important and foundational to swing music it’s impossible to leave him off a list like this. It’s hard to find any songs by this band that don’t get your feet tapping. His influence on the zeitgeist of the swing era hard to overstate.

Duke Ellington

America’s greatest composer. Period. Duke is a whole world unto himself. My favorite and highest quality swinging recordings of him actually come from his concert at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1956, but he (and Billy Strayhorn) wrote a number of the most iconic swing tunes, such as “Take The A Train.” These guys famously played the Cotton Club, which was down the street from the Savoy Ballroom.

Benny Goodman

Is credited for bringing swing to white America with his band’s iconic performances in 1935 at Palomar Ballroom and in 1938 at Carnegie Hall (featuring members of Duke Ellington and Count Basie’s bands). He was dubbed the King of Swing, but we all know Chick Webb and Count Basie contested that title quite well. This band is not to be underestimated though. Gene Krupa’s drumming, Lionel Hampton on the vibraphone, Teddy Wilson on piano (the Benny Goodman quartet) the first integrated swing band recordings (I think?), Charlie Christian pioneering the swing electric guitar, and Harry James (the sextet)..., the list of major developments in swing music that came from musicians who got their start or associated with Benny Goodman is long.

Artie Shaw

Innovated a lot of sounds to add to the swing repertoire - he had a flair for the unusual. Notably added a harpischord and a string section to some of his tunes. Had one of the swinginest bands out there - as another white jewish clarinet player, he was a rival of Benny Goodman naturally. Where Benny had a more swingin' sound, Artie was known for clearer, darker tone and, like Bix Beiderbecke, didn't waste notes. And, again, this band should not be underestimated. I ignored him and Benny for too long because they were white swing bands, but to do that is to deprive yourself of some seriously good music. These guys could hang with the best.

Chick Webb

Led the house band at the Savoy Ballroom, started Ella Fitzgerald’s legendary career, and died tragically young of tuberculosis. The recordings we do have of him playing with his band are some of the most beloved recordings out there. A dedicated dance band, I think all of their recordings are fantastic for DJing at dances. Some of his songs are so well loved they can get overplayed in some scenes, such as “Lindy Hopper’s Delight.” 

EDIT: Someone recently sent me this link to live radio broadcasts by big bands playing during the war at places like Hollywood Palladium and other top ballrooms. The recordings are, to say the least, incredible, and a fantastic introduction to big band sound, played live for dancers. **Note for DJs**: note the *dynamic range* of the orchestra's song choices. Waltzes, latin rhythms, very slow songs, very fast ones, and yeah, that mid-tempo swing we often hear at swing dances, but I'd wager it's ~20% of what they actually played. It's a consistent ratio across these 86 recordings. Something to think about for your sets! Peter Loggins' talk (linked below) expands on this point, but I personally think you shouldn't be afraid to push and challenge your dance scene to expand the range of music they can dance to. I've been experimenting with it lately in my local scene and I've found it makes the night far more interesting and even though people will often dance fewer songs, they can't easily predict what's coming and have to adapt (which is fun!) and it makes it more of a payoff/release when the songs they're used to (mid-tempo swing) do come on.

Small Combo Swing:*

Slim Gaillard + Slam Stewart

Cats and the Fiddle

Harlem Hamfats

These guys have gone through phases of being really, really popular to DJ in the swing community. They do a lot of fun stuff with harmonies, rhythm, and generally have a super swinging, solid sound. 

Benny Goodman Trio, Quartet, all the way up to Sextet. Every single guy in this group was an all star, and one could devote days just to studying their music alone.

It's worth noting that there are a number of combo recordings that included some or all of the guys listed above and in the below sections. For example, I'm learning Count Basie played with the Benny Goodman Sextet on some recordings.

**Beginner Videos:**

*Whitey’s Lindy Hoppers*

A Day At The Races (1937)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di-a-jf1c6g&amp;t=3

It should be noted that this clip, while iconic and impressive, features Norma Miller and Leon James exhibiting something called “muggin” where they make faces and wiggle their fingers up close to the camera. As I understand it, they were forced to do this in order to portray black people as wild and silly savages. You can see examples of things like this ranging from facial expressions to clothing choices in just about every Whitey’s Lindy Hoppers clip from movies. Don't let it distract you too much from the dancing, or confuse these gestures with being parts of Lindy Hop itself.

Radio City Revels (1938)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGAOpTcEyJw

Keep Punchin (1939)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfgKMfexdPQ

Hot Chocolate (1941)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_262uUGwzgk

Note that this is the same routine as Hellzapoppin, with some minor changes (such as some of the solos and the ensemble section)

Hellzapoppin (1941)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahoJReiCaPkAm

You know it, you love it. The greatest routine in Lindy Hop.

Cootie Williams and Orchestra with Eddie Cleanhead (1943) 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnpcPFnHLUQ

Whitey’s Lindy Hoppers (just two couples) are the last performance, but it’s worth watching the whole clip. It's worth noting that this was during World War II, so one of the songs has to do with winning the war. 

Jitterbug History

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8UkX71MbPY&amp;index=7&amp;list=PLmgkit3LB0tdgRzwPSQE_-YdxqbA1tpg5

Whitey’s Lindy Hoppers are the biggest name in Lindy Hop. The Hellzapoppin routine is the only vintage Lindy Hop clip that regularly goes viral even today and is still watched by millions. They would regularly take every placement in the Harvest Moon Ball. They pushed Lindy Hop to new heights (literally!). The more you watch these clips, the more there is to learn.

After Seben (1929)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcnpZfsfwDA

The first clip of what we now know and can identify as “Lindy Hop.” I’ve heard conflicting accounts of whether James Barton (the man in the beginning and dancing at the end) is in blackface, but as it does always need to be said, blackface is never okay. 

Groovie Movie (1944)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ENjos_PpE

A goofy and fun introduction to the California/Hollywood/LA style of Lindy Hop and how it was portrayed in the 40s. 

Swing Fever (1944)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1-LqqPnkf0

Another iconic LA video. This clip is the image in a lot of people’s minds when they think of swing dancing, with the military outfits.

Rip It Up (1956)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLDwMWkp1Iw

I don’t know much about where this clip comes from, but it’s awesome and a lot of people have seen it. An introduction to rock n roll jitterbuggin with some clear Lindy Hop influences. Evidence that people were still doing this dance even after the swing era was over, contrary to popular belief.

**Intermediate:**

**Intermediate Cultural Resources:**

Norma’s Book, *Swingin at the Savoy* - https://www.amazon.com/Swingin-at-Savoy-Norma-Miller/dp/1566398495

Covers similar ground to Frankie’s book, but Norma was a bit harder-hitting, and unafraid to show the darker sides of some of the people and aspects of Lindy Hop’s history and show business. Norma answers a lot of questions that were still hanging for me after I read Frankie’s book, and it’s an insightful and important account in its own right.

www.savoystyle.com

This website is a bit out of date in style, but an incredible resource for biographical information on Whitey’s Lindy Hoppers and other Harlem dancers, and some video links.

**Intermediate Music:**

*Ken Burns Jazz Documentary*

Here's the beginning of the series, to get your feet wet - it really gets me fired up.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZPZvGfWQQo

Here’s a good intro to the first Swing Era episode to get an idea of what that's like - same deal.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE31EC3NoLs

Here is the entire thing - https://www.pbs.org/show/jazz/ or you can find just episodes 2-10 here: https://www.amazon.com/Ken-Burns-Jazz/dp/B002P3OCUE

Ken Burns Jazz completely revolutionized how I understood jazz. Every Lindy Hopper should watch it, full stop. You can tell the creators loved swing. Episode 1 is particularly incredible as to the role of blues and the roots of how jazz (and ultimately swing) truly began, so don't skip it if you can help it. It’s about 20 hours of documentary footage, but once it sucks you in, it sucks you in. 

Here are some additional artists to explore after or concurrent with watching Ken Burns: 

Billie Holiday

Anita O’Day

Ella Fitzgerald

Peggy Lee

Lil Hardin Armstrong

Louis Armstrong

Fats Waller

Django Reinhardt

Oscar Peterson

Tommy Dorsey

Jimmy Dorsey

Will Bradley

Woody Herman

Harry James

Jimmie Lunceford

Fletcher Henderson

Earl Hines

Sidney Bechet

International Sweethearts of Rhythm

Charlie Christian

Lionel Hampton

Teddy Wilson

Jelly Roll Morton

Bix Beiderbecke

Bob + Bing Crosby

Joe ""King"" Oliver

Glenn Miller



This is the part I'm most afraid will piss people off. Obviously there are a lot more swing musicians than this - this is just a list of people to get you started, from the top of my head and nowhere else. There's probably some boneheaded gaps. These people are generally each very important to swing history in their own unique ways - Ken Burns will do a great job placing most of them in some context, though despite being 20 hours long, that documentary does not get everything either.  You could write a book about each of these in their own right, and many more not on the list. It really is difficult to comprehend how massive the world of swing really is.

**Intermediate Videos:**

*Spirit Moves*

Disc 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjguncQiw70

Disc 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHf4tBmAlpI

What Whitey’s Lindy Hoppers clips are to the Beginner level of this guide, Spirit Moves is to the Intermediate level. Disc 1 covers, chronologically, most classic Savoy Lindy Hop routines. It heavily features Al Minns, Leon James, and Pepsi Bethel, but Frankie and Willa Mae Ricker make an appearance. Disc 2 is the real gem, in my opinion - live footage inside the Savoy Ballroom in 1950. Truly valuable. So much to be gained just from watching these clips and observing and picking up as much as you can. Start to finish. I'd direct your attention to specific things to look at, but there'd be too many to point out. Spirit Moves is truly gold. Also, my understanding is there’s more discs out there, but I can’t find them on YouTube. 

*Al and Leon Clips*

The Playboy Clip (1959)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA-u7rp-SrU

Al and Leon had a very fascinating partnership. Their unique and interesting styles, both separately and together, teach a lot about performance and how to approach what we now know as solo jazz. It’s worth studying their movements and recreating their performances as a challenge if you’re trying to improve your solo jazz.

*Frankie post-revival dancing:*

This clip changed my life as a dancer. It's just so good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CowekQq6kY8

This is by no means all of the vintage clips of LA dancers - and not even all of the clips include both Dean and Jewel - these are just some of the ones to get started on. As with many things in this guide, the rabbit hole goes deep if you follow it. I highly recommend the YouTube channel Vintage Swing Dance (linked below) and Robert White. LA style swing is an important part of swing history, a treasure trove of fantastic movement, and Dean Collins was at the core of it. I would definitely love to see if anyone has any resources related to Dean Collins’ influence and general Southern California dancing history.

**Advanced Cultural Resources:**

*Peter Loggins Talks:*

https://archive.org/details/PeterLogginsOnLearningOtherDancesBesidesTheLindyHop

This talk is amazing. When you’re ready for it, it might change everything you know about dancing. All of Peter Loggins’ talks, which are I think you can find with some googling, are incredible. 

Suffice it to say, I took from this one that it’s worth it, and in fact really important, to try to delve into the Peabody, Foxtrot, Charleston, Latin dances, Waltz, and any others, and not to be afraid to use them or to go to places where people dance them - don’t restrict yourself to just Lindy Hop or even just swing dances - you’ll miss out on a lot. And it also occurs to me that a willingness to explore like this could be an important element in getting dance scenes specializing in different dances to pool resources, work together, and produce more versatile and overall skilled dancers. This is all the way down in the advanced section, but it’s hard to overstate its importance.

*Jazz Dance* by Roger Tilton

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYdo_J3Puns

Filmed at Central Plaza Dance Hall, New York City in 1954 it features Al Minns, Leon James, and non-professional dancers social dancing to excellent live music. The band consists of Jimmy McPartland, trumpet, vocal; Jimmy Archey, trombone; Pee Wee Russell, clarinet; Willie ""The Lion"" Smith, piano; Pops Foster, acoustic double bass; George Wettling, drums.

**Advanced Music:**

Here I recommend some artists to get started with sounds that deviate quite a bit from the big band stuff. I’m probably really out of my element here, so again, purists forgive me, I’m just trying to get people started - feel free to post corrections or additions if you feel I’m missing important stuff or mischaracterizing. Ken Burns Jazz explains a lot of why music started changing so much in 1945, and looking up these guys will generally take you to music created after that point, which might still be relevant for dancers.

Melba Liston

Mary Lou Williams

Frank Sinatra

Gerry Mulligan

Johnny Hodges

Roy Brown

Ike Turner and his Kings of Rhythm

Lucky Millinder

Bill Haley &amp; The Comets

Wynonie Harris

This list doesn’t include the large, large group of artists that play rock n roll music that is great for dancing, jump blues, R&amp;B, and other swing-related music genres. It also doesn’t include, by any stretch of the imagination, all important swing musicians - again, this is just a starter guide.

**Advanced Videos:**

*YouTube Channels*

A substantial portion of the videos I've linked here are from one of these channels. It's worth just devoting hours and hours to all the videos in these channels.

If you know the Nicholas Brothers, it’s probably from this clip. According to Wikipedia, this routine is considered one of the most virtuosic dance displays of all time. Also an excellent example of Cab Calloway’s wonderful showmanship. Also from Wikipedia re: the Nicholas Brothers: Gregory Hines declared that if their biography were ever filmed, their dance numbers would have to be computer generated because no one now could emulate them.[3] Ballet legend Mikhail Baryshnikov once called them the most amazing dancers he had ever seen in his life.

A lot more to be found on Bobby White’s channel (linked again: https://www.youtube.com/user/robertwhiteIII/videos) ! I’m really lacking in my LA and Balboa history (as I’m not from there), so I hope those of you more knowledgeable about it can forgive me and potentially help me flesh it out in the comments!

*Some stuff I would love to see:*

The Betty Boop videos they use to start the camp meetings at Herrang

Some videos to get started with West Coast Swing, Carolina Shag, Collegiate Shag, and other related swing dances. 

As mentioned above, some resources for LA style swing dancing and history.

I want to be absolutely clear about something - this might seem like a lot, but there is a LOT more stuff out there than this. And this is just really one perspective on all this history, when in fact there are many valid ones. This one is more oriented towards the illuminating some of the styles of Harlem and the background for the traditions of the modern swing community, but this is JUST a place to get started. Some of the stuff I’ve linked involves some very, very deep (and rewarding) rabbit holes. I also think one of the great things about this having so much YouTube is that the related videos will take you much further! There's a lot to study and that study will make you a better dancer and a better member of the dance community. Again, I would welcome this community’s many historians and otherwise knowledgeable folks to contribute to this!

If I wanted to make a point with this post, it would be that there is a tremendous amount of information to know and study just to get started with this thing. Being a lindy hopper, for me, requires great humility and disciplined study. 

**I’m also really hoping we can get the mods to sticky this, and that people will refer enthusiastic but overwhelmed newbies to this thread to get themselves educated.** Apologies if this ends up just coming across as a mess, I did my best with the time and energy available that I had. 

Thanks for reading!

,halo,"I played Halo shortly after launch when my cousin got an Xbox. I had to convince my overly protective step-father to allow the violent game at home I went on to play CE online via Gamespy arcade.

Later, I was part of Halo 2 changing the face of online gaming forever and essentially creating what Xbox Live became for the next decade and what shooters all wanted to copy.

I've played every Halo game since then right down to the shitty mobile games. I've spent countless hours and money on John, Cortana, the Keyes family, Buck, Noble Team and so on. 

I've put up an average of about 1.5 kd of tens of thousands of kills across the fun playlists to the serious ones in every main game.

I've spent time in all the popular forums critiquing what I like in multiplayer, what the community misses, what sucks, what works and doesn't.

I've spoken to Ske7ch directly with feedback about how Halo's classic design style and gameplay was iconic and how it should recapture its identity in the face of hyper-popular nostalgia and successful IPs that break the mold like Overwatch.

I've read the books and comics, bought some figures, put up posters, won (and lost) tournaments.

But there is one thing I always liked the most: HEAD TO HEAD.

It's the one true test of skill. The great equalizer. Take the best shot from the best team and he could lose to a worse shot who is more adaptive and reactionary. It's about strategy, skill, ghosting, pushing and everything in between. The best player wins. Period. Naysayers be damned.

I played that playlist in Halo 2 all the way through to the end. I endured cheaters. I even welcomed modding and stand-by sometimes, as it added challenge and I would still win sometimes, but I was the love of the game mode that made me endure.

Then, I went to Basic Training in the United States Air Force and completely missed the window for Halo 3's Head to Head playlist. I've read that the loudest losers complained about it, got to you add waypoints to ruin it, and then you took it down.

I've seen the playlists over the next few iterations mold and change around what the people who take the time to be the loudest on the internet collectively want and I am here to say I DO NOT GIVE A SHIT!

I do not care what all these super loud kids have to say in your surveys or on the sub. I couldn't care less if it really came down to being just me and a few hundred other competitive, adaptive gamers in the playlist. I want the mode brought back for crossplay in MCC !

To be honest, I want it to be a permanent playlist in all the Halo games. In the wake of the popularity of games like Fornite and PUBG, you'd think that a revitalized ""solo"" playlist that's a test of overall knowledge and skill of the game would be more popular than ever. But my main focus is MCC.

I've paid my dues. I've been faithful. I've talked shit and sung praise out of the love of the IP and will continue to do so. But damn it, I have waiting long enough for that love to be reciprocated!

I respectfully demand a 1v1 crossplay playlist in the Master Chief Collection's updated list.

Dont bother arguing for or against in the comments. I may sound like a dick head or come off as arrogant, but I dont care what any of you have to say. I've paid half my life for this request and damned if I'll let anyone tell me different.

P.S

I Think this would be a really good idea for epic games to work on. Personally I think the games state has changed dramatically over the months people are getting better at building and the skill gap is closing, using all you mats in a build fight just to get run up on after by someone with max wood can be frustrating. I feel like a mode like this would be refreshing and would work perfectly with fortnites mechanics. Also I think a mode like this would be perfect for a competitive playlist that had its own currency and store,  right know there isn’t anything that a player can own that shows their dominance. It’s would be cool to see a player in games with a crazy skin and you’d know that he’s been grinding the competitive mode.

,Yogscast,"Some channels have either completely stopped using episode numbers, or are putting them in the thumbnail. I want to request that episode numbers at least be put in the thumbnail if not in the title. It's really annoying when channels like Tom's, *who doesn't even make playlists for his videos*, decide to not add episode numbers to the titles or thumbnails.

Watching Tom's new Warhammer series before realizing it wasn't the first episode of the series because there was no episode number in either the thumbnail or the title. Same goes for the 'The Forest' series, no signal of the episode number to be found, doesn't help that half the Yogs playlists are in reverse order, too. So you don't even know where to start without fiddling around.

I'd settle for thumbnails, but that can be annoying mid video, not knowing if YouTube is suggesting the correct video to play next if you're not using playlists. 

If this is some way to deceive viewers into jumping into the middle of a series by not showing that it actually is a series, then not only is that disingenuous, but it's also driving people like me away, the people that enjoy bingeing stuff. Over the course of the last few months I've drastically stopped watching youtube stuff, and these user-unfriendly changes are the kind of things that push me further towards jumping ship on youtube gaming videos, for long-form entertainment like twitch streams.

**I'm not talking about stuff like TTT, that has no overarching structure. Mainly talking about stuff like Tom's warhammer series and The Forest on the main channel. Stuff that has a story or is nearly essential to have seen the previous videos to enjoy properly.**

,DestinyTheGame,"This was posted as a comment from me on someone else's post. The reason why I am putting it up in its own thread is because I believe that this should have more visiblity. I would like honest feedback from everyone who reads it. NOTE: added in some words for better clarification.


Can we please have placement matches? Placement matches would be 10 wins, this would include SBMM and make it as strict as possible. Highest tier players would get 10 straight wins ideally. Each rank is 2 wins. Guardian = 2 wins, Brave = 4 wins, Heroic = 6 wins, Fabled 8 wins, Mythic = 10 wins (1 win is half a rank, you would need 2 wins to complete that rank). Mythic to Legend would be point system like how it is now. It's either that or makes wins have more points. NOTE: this is how it works in CoD WWII right now as well.

If not this system of ranked^ then at least make SBMM stricter as possible. Full tilt SBMM, I want to improve against players of similar skill and they have to be the same glory rank as me. As an example for full tilt SBMM: ELO, KDA, True KD, and win rate ratio should be taken into account. For added incentive to play Comp give a booster aura or something from Guardian all the way to Fabled from July till release of Forsaken. All guardians should have a chance to get it. However, they should be pushed to improve or seek help/coaching/tips from known/slightly known good players.

Also bring more OBJ modes to Comp as well as respawn comp. Competitive and Trials need to be separated in likeness to breathe life back into Trials. There is absolutely no difference in Crucible modes in either of them. On the flip side they still have to have some likeness, just not too much. Reason why is because I view Competitive as a sort of Proving Grounds for Trials since you can practice Countdown and Survival for Trials in Comp.

The reason why I brought up the ranking system is because my brother was playing Halo 5 recently and he was able to get Diamond 5 for the season for the Swat playlist. Diamond 5 is directly below Onyx, which of course is the Highest ranking possible. Also for each rank in the proposed ranking would need to give a unique weapon and ornament. Each weapon however would need to be progressively more powerful than the previous weapon whether it be by unique perks, gun mechanics, stats, or even better unique frame/intrinsic abilities of the gun. For instance: a gun that has OG firefly/explosive, Litc, or even Icarus. These guns would be the static god rolls that people would be chasing in D1 if it existed and their RNG was shit luck. This I believe would be a viable counter RNG and random rollsif they couldn't get that perfectly rolled Rangefinder/Rifled Barrel/Litc(Icarus). Even better is that this would create the chase in Crucible Comp.

NOTE: you only play with those that are in your tier/rank/stats (with stats taking a more important roll)

Unpopular Opinion: if these changes are slated for Forsaken release or during the year of 2019. I would like for the previous seasonal weapon(s) to be made available to everyone and have the associated ornaments to be made available via bounties. Or at least have them earnable via kills with that specific weapon type.

Addendum/After thought: weapons should be earned via kills with that weapon type while your inside that rank. If your above a certain rank but you want a weapon from a rank(s) below you, you still should be able to get that gun.

,GoogleDrive,"Hello All,

We have several TVs at my work each broadcasting a different video. Each TV has an Asus mini computer with windows 10 installed. I am trying to setup each PC with VLC player and googledrive so I can update the videos via the web browser and GDrive will push the files to each TV. Right now I have a playlist in the startup folder on each TV that links VLC player to a specific file which should appear in the synced folder. 

Everything works except when I delete the video on the website it doesn't seem to remove it from the local TVs. I opened the folder on the TV after I deleted it and it is still there but with a red X instead of a green check mark.

When I deleted a picture it removed it from the local TV's folder almost instantaneous. Why would a video file around 50mb take more than 20 minutes to get deleted?

I thought dropping the new video with the exact same file name would work but the local devices are adding (1), (2), etc to the ends of the new videos which the playlist isn't setup for.  

What do I have to do to get googledrive to remove videos from each synced computer? Or a way to play videos from a specific folder with VLC player without knowing their name in advanced?

,radiohead,"So I've begun to do this myself and it's a fun challenge to undertake.  Taking songs from artists, rearranging them together and creating an album or playlist that has a completely different meaning then the album those songs may have been on.

So it's a pretty simple challenge - create a Radiohead album from songs in their current discography, focused around a central idea.  Whether that's depression, relationships, food, doesn't matter.  I want to see what others can create with the same palette of a hundred plus songs.  Bonus points for creative album names!

Only limit is that they have to be on an actual Radiohead album (this includes live albums and B-side releases), and the album has to be apx. an hour or less in length.

**Climbing Up The Walls - Radiohead** 

&gt; 1. **Packt Like Sardines in a Crushed Tin Box** - Denial of anything wrong with him, pushing away those who want to help
&gt; 
&gt; 2. **Paperbag Writer** - Having a panic attack, and the terror associated with it
&gt; 
&gt; 3. **Ideoteque** - Realizing something is wrong, and all the things he put off being brought up front and center
&gt; 
&gt; 4. **There, There** - Getting help from others, who try and tell him not to succumb to the negativity coming from within him.
&gt; 
&gt; 5. **Blow Out** - Struggling on anti-depressants and other prescription pills, feeling he ""can't be helped"", and that something is going to go bad very soon
&gt; 
&gt; 6. **Exit Music (For A Film)** - Turning to his significant other, but instead pushing away from his unhealthy actions and demeanor.
&gt; 
&gt; 7. **Climbing Up The Walls** - Another breakdown.  Reminders that his mental illness will never go away.  The scream in this is him hitting rock bottom.
&gt; 
&gt; 8. **How To Disappear Completely** - Letting go and losing touch with the outside world.  Feeling absent in the world around him.
&gt;  
&gt; 9. **Daydreaming** - Loss of hope, and drive to try and fix things. Giving up on all the dreams he held dear.
&gt; 
&gt; 10. **Glass Eyes** - Simple tasks becoming impossible, and the protagonist having doubts if he can continue to go on like this.
&gt; 
&gt; 11. **True Love Waits** - Final plea with his partner, and the last thing he held dear disappearing before his yes.
&gt; 
&gt; 12. **Motion Picture Soundtrack** - A suicide note.  The only way he can return to happiness and love is in death, he believes.

--Mara Date: First Snowfall (Expected)

----Survivor’s Log, 1st Lt. Russell Winters

“I figured I should take some time and create a thorough entry in this log for once.  On the day I crash landed here I was given an order in three parts: survive, return home, discover the truth…so to speak.  Jess, as of today I believe I can safely say that I’ve fulfilled the first part of your order.  A week ago I conducted my first successful hunt, bringing in enough meat for a couple of weeks as well as killing an animal known as a hyrven, which among the local villagers is quite valuable for its pelt and bone.  In the time since then, I’ve finished work on the last few arrows I’ll need to hunt going forward.  The first of two spears should be ready within the next couple of days as well, just as an added precaution.  So food is more or less taken care of right now, as is water.  Shelter and safety are also accounted for.  I’ve been living with Veera for a couple of weeks now and her dwelling, as with all of those in the village, is surrounded by a twelve foot palisade wall that’s several feet thick in most places.  As for our home itself, that situation has been improving as well.

Thanks to the ‘time off’ I’ve afforded myself this week, I was able to patch up the various holes in the walls of our dwelling.  That hyrven I killed won me some friends at a local guild hall of sorts, bunch of craftsmen.  Not saying they just let me waltz in and take whatever I want, but no one was going to deny my request for a couple of plates and some pitch; and yes, I mean dinner plates.  Not sure how they make pitch here, probably from tree sap, but the whole process was simple enough.  Heat the brick over the fire until it melts; apply to hole in wall, bam.  Fixed.  Definitely earned me a few points with the girlfriend too.  Why am I bothering to mention this?  Well as you can probably tell from the title of this entry, Io’s expecting snowfall.  It’s overcast today and pretty cold, about thirty seven degrees right now.  So who knows, might experience my first Maran snowfall tonight.  

So my ‘home base’ is about as insulated as I can get it and I have the Aegis for now.  For all the good that’s happened, I’m still worried about power.  I really don’t think I’ll be able to use the fabricator during the winter at all if I intend to keep using my armor like this, to say nothing of Io’s needs, which honestly come even before that.  Long story short, I need to get out there and hunt again, this time to secure myself and Veera some warmer weather gear.  I’ll be ranging west of the village today, soon as I finish up this log entry.  

Might as well touch on the second part of the Captain’s orders while I’m here.  In order to fix the comms array on the pod I’m going to need some heavy metals.  Right now the only source of those Io and I have been able to locate is atop the staff of the leader of the village.  He’s got some sort of gold alloy ornament up there.  Given that he hates me the most out of anyone in the village, including the huntress who looked ready to skin me alive the other day; I don’t think that’s going to be an option for now.  I’ll keep trying to think of a way to get my hands on it, but force just isn’t a realistic option.  I’d be condemning myself and Veera to death.  Plan B is to hope the trade caravans I’ve heard about stop by in the spring with something I can use.

Anyway, I guess that covers all the major points.  The whole relationship with an alien maiden thing is…going as well as it can, I think.  I won’t say it’s not confusing…because it is, but she and I are growing closer as the days go on.  Veera’s been out most of the last week, getting in some last minute foraging before the snows come.  She encouraged me to get to know the village better in that time, probably to make me feel more at home if we get snowed in.  All that time apart during the day means that she’s always on top of me at night.  I know that sounds like a good thing but…ah hell who am I kidding, it is a good thing…to an extent.  I feel like I could explode half the time, but that comes with the territory I guess.  Honestly, I think she just comes from a world in which the idea of physical intimacy for pleasure is so foreign that she can’t get enough…while also being very hesitant about actually mating.  She’s taken to stripping down every night now, soon as we finish dinner.  What actually happens after that varies day to day, but it inevitably ends with her on top of me and falling asleep, draped in our new blanket courtesy of my first kill.  We kept the old one too; keep the straw off my back if I want to sleep without a shirt.  So yeah, I’m constantly being blue balled by my incredibly fluffy alien girlfriend.  Sorry for rambling, I just had to get that out.  It’s always a pleasure to explore her, find out where she’s sensitive and how much her winter coat has come in and whatnot…but I can’t shake the feeling that she’s been pushing herself.  We’re having Zolta and Asha over for dinner tonight, the couple I managed to hook up at the festival, so maybe that will keep things calm today, give me an opportunity to talk to her about all this.  Well, that’s enough of that I think.  I’m losing daylight here.  Winters out.”

With that, Winters replaced his datapad and resealed his pod before stringing his bow and heading for the bridge to the forest.  His survival bag was full of fresh batteries and a small amount of rations for his trek that day.  

“Io, you want to boot up Skaði for us?”  He requested, trying to focus himself.

‘No heart to heart?  Straight to the hunt today?’  Io asked, giving him an amused look while bringing up the necessary HUD elements.  He noticed she’d renamed it to version 1.1, seeing that some indicators had been cleaned up or consolidated.  With a nod, he stepped off the path back to the village and began his pursuit, hoping to locate some favorable signs of game.  Io did not enjoy being ignored.  ‘Veera’s actions are troubling you.’  It wasn’t a question.

“Not exactly Io.  It’s more that I don’t know how to respond to her.  I don’t want to escalate because she’s never given me any indication that she wants to proceed past our regular sort of intimate touching.  I don’t want to de-escalate because I don’t want her to think I don’t enjoy what we do at night or that I don’t want her in general.”  He sighed, wishing he could kick the dirt in frustration but knowing that he had to keep is noise profile low.  He looked to the bland, steel gray sky instead, finding nothing to hold his attention long.  Io nodded.

‘I suppose you’ve found yourself at an impasse then, sir.’

“Yes, that much was obvious I hope.”

‘If you’re in the mood to take love advice from a sentient machine, why not just take the next step yourself?’  Io asked, causing Winters to stop and lean a hand against a nearby tree.

“Yeah…I have thought about that.  It’s hard not to really, especially in the moment but…”

‘But?’  Io prodded, intent on clearing the issue up so that they could move onto hunting without her partner feeling distracted and out of sorts.  It made his vitals unpleasant to her.

“I feel like I’d take things too far, like halfway through she’d get uncomfortable or afraid and I wouldn’t be able to bring myself to stop,” Winters admitted, pushing off of his resting place with a deep breath and continuing on through the woods.  He expected some sort of rebuke from Io, but she’d taken an invisible seat, pondering his words.

‘I see, so even if Veera were amenable to the idea of mating and enjoyed it, you’d be worried about the opposite the whole time?’

“Yeah, that more or less hits the nail on the head.”  Winters paused to examine some tracks Io had found, a few oddly disturbed patches of dirt and undergrowth.  Taking a new heading to the northwest, he continued.  “I know I might be needlessly torturing myself here, but if I push this I know I’ll regret it later.”  Io acknowledged him sadly.

‘You realize that, while your reasoning is sound, she may be feeling the same?  She’s a virgin, sir.  For her to take the initiative in that, even though she’s demonstrated moments of boldness in the past, is quite an ask.’

“I can wait,” Winters replied seriously, removing an arrow from his clip and nocking it, leaving the bow at rest.  Io sighed at him.

‘Very well sir.  I can’t believe I’m about to suggest this, but as your partner it is one of my jobs to look after your…wellbeing.  Why don’t you masturbate?’  She asked.  Winters took the suggestion in stride, chuckling a bit as he paused for a moment to scan his surroundings.  Io had detected a faint scent on the wind from the east.  He adjusted his path.

“Wouldn’t be fair to Veera,” he replied simply.

‘Well aren’t you the sexual martyr?  You’ll have to explain that one to the VI sir,’ Io told him, giving him a disbelieving look.  ‘What could be so bad about relieving that sense of discomfort?’

“I’m sure by now you’ve realized finding a bit of privacy on this planet is no big deal for me.  So yeah, sure, I could go ahead and relieve myself out here, maybe mark a bit of territory, piss off an ursae, that sort of thing.  But then what?  That night I’m not going to respond to Veera the same way, no question there.  Maybe she lets it go.  Even if she does, and things reach this point again, I’ll just take the easy way out…again.  I can’t think of a better way to kill a sexual relationship before it even starts.”

‘So you intend to suffer in silence in the hopes that your next orgasm shatters the cosmos?’  Io could barely contain her laughter at her partner’s mule-headed ideas.  Winters didn’t bother holding his own laughter in.

“While I certainly wouldn’t mind that Io, I’m pretty sure that between her lack of experience and us being two different species, it’ll be something between forgettable and an utter disaster.  But it would still be her.”  He managed a small smile as he thought about Veera.  Io seemed to understand.

‘Very well sir.  That girl has no idea how lucky she is.  That said I believe that’s enough pining for one hunt.  Time to wipe that forlorn look off of your face, by force!’  Io declared triumphantly, allowing her outfit to shift from the typical barbarian hunting garb to something Winters had only seen before at concerts on Earth.  She was the spitting image of a female metal vocalist, complete with corset, long flowing coat, lace choker, and knee high boots, all in black of course.  Winters uttered a silent prayer, thanking the gods that she’d not gone wild with the eyeliner.

“Trying to seduce me Io?”  He waggled his eyebrows at her.  She dismissed him outright with a wave of her hand.  He noticed she’d painted her nails black as well.

‘Of course not, you hormone laden monkey!  Though I will be sure to instruct Veera to visit certain clothing outlets if we ever reach Earth again.  No, today we’re having karaoke time!’  She insisted, conjuring a microphone out of thin air and selecting a [track from his drop playlist.] [s]  Winters just stared at her, his expression quickly morphing from one of smug superiority to utter disbelief.

“I’m sorry, we’re what?”  He spluttered, hearing the toll of bells and knowing that Io must have remembered his atrocious singing on past drops.  *Damn, just when did she start actually changing?!*

‘We’re going to have a bit of VI-human bonding time and I’ve chosen karaoke.  Don’t look at me like that; I know this is one of your favorites!’  She pouted at him.  Winters just looked at her, open mouthed, as Io began singing.  ‘In the heart of the holy see, in the home of Christianity, the seat of power is in daaaanger!’  She held the mic out to him as Winters continued to silently gape at her.  Io carried on without him.  ‘Gave their lives on the steps to heaven, Thy Will Be Done!’  She started banging her head back and forth as the chorus began, her hair flying in every direction.  Much as Winters was willing to believe he’d stepped into some sort of alternate universe, he couldn’t deny that Io’s unbridled enthusiasm was winning him over.  By the time the song reached its climax, Winters had joined in.

“Dying for salvation!”

‘With dedication!’

“No capitulation!”

‘Annihilation!”

“Papal commendation!”

‘Reincarnation!’

“Heaven is your destination!”  

“IN THE NAME OF GOOOOD!”  They screamed together.  The chesko never stood a chance.

\-----

Winters found himself again on the forest path connecting Veera’s farm to her village.  For his time and effort on the hunt he’d been rewarded with another large chesko kill, this one certainly a male, based on the horns protruding from its skull.  Remembering Veera’s advice from when she’d found him on his first hunt, he’d immediately cut an opening in the throat, allowing gravity to bleed the animal as he carried it home.  With a couple hours of daylight left and safety within reach, he and Io were riding high.

‘Your shot was perfect sir!  Oh hang on, let’s watch it again,’ Io suggested, bringing up the video from the kill that she’d recorded using his helmet’s visor.  ‘See, I suggested you aim here so that if the arrow struck the ribs it would still have a chance to deflect into the heart and…there it is!’  Io cried triumphantly as Winters’ arrow buried itself deep in the animal’s flank and it dropped to the forest floor.  ‘What a day!’

“I’m more amazed by your singing ability Io.  The hunting honestly feels like a cakewalk now,” Winters admitted.  “And don’t get me wrong, it was what I needed Io.  I’d been down in the dumps for no reason and forgotten just how bloody lucky I am to still be alive at all.  So…thanks, for real.”  Io blushed at his genuine smile.

‘I had a wonderful time today as well sir.  Will you take me on a date again sometime?’  Io requested, returning his smile.

“Shouldn’t be a problem, I very much look forward to our next session of lethal karaoke.”  They both laughed, settling down as the walls of Veera’s village became visible through the trees, easier to see now that the leaves had retreated for the winter.  “Let’s get this thing inside, yeah?”

‘What are you going to do with it sir?’

“We still have plenty of meat from the other chesko, even if we’ve had to salt or otherwise preserve it over the last couple of days.  I was planning on bartering for a cloak or two.”

‘As per your survival log entry, of course.  It would be more efficient for you to be able to walk about for extended periods without the Aegis, to be sure.’

“I’m more worried about Veera,” he confessed.  “If she somehow loses her blanket during the night I’ll wake up to find her shivering a bit.”

‘I know sir, but her dress is synthetic wool.  That’s nothing to sneeze at, so to speak.  All I’m asking is that you not ignore your own needs.’

“Got it Io, don’t worry.  Besides, I’ve always wanted a real cloak.  Seems like a useful thing to have.”

‘I believe someone is jealous of Antoth’s style choices,’ Io ribbed him.

“What?  His cloak is pretty excellent.  Can you blame a guy for wanting to be warm and stylish?”

‘Sure, we’ll call it stylish,’ Io commented drolly as they approached the gate, finding Xan on duty and speaking to a young maiden with black fur that Winters didn’t recognize.  He nodded politely to the young guard.

“Evening Xan, you’re well?”  The salute that Winters received looked much less pained that the one Xan had attempted last week.  The human smiled behind his helmet.

“Evening Winters, I am thank you.  Oh, this is Eris by the way.  Eris, this is the human, Winters.”  Xan promptly made introductions.  Winters bowed best he could given the chesko carcass he was burdened with.  Her pale blue eyes regarded him critically.

“It’s a pleasure to meet you,” she eventually said.

“Likewise.  Xan, quick question.  If I wanted to exchange this chesko for garments or materials or something, instead of keeping the meat for myself, would I still take it to the temple of Valta first?”  Xan nodded.

“Yeah, just let any of the hunters know you intend to trade it.  They will tend to it while you collect whomever it is you want to deal with.”

“Noted, thanks a lot.  I’ll not take any of your time.  See you around Xan.  Oh, and it was nice to meet you as well Eris.”

“Good day to you human,” she bade him farewell as he continued on into the village.  A few villagers called out to him as he leisurely strode down the main avenue, either in greeting or to joke about how he’d only brought home one trophy that day.  

‘So, what do you make of Eris?’  Io inquired.

“I don’t know, hard to say really.  She’s guarded, sure, but I can understand that.  I’m sure she’s much more open around people she knows.”  Winters attempted to shrug, quickly realizing his mistake and grabbing at the chesko.  “Ok, nobody saw that.”

‘Whatever you’d like to believe sir.’  Io giggled at him.  ‘To return to the subject at hand, I suppose I must agree with you.  Very little to work with, but she struck me as a very protective sort of woman.’

“Well, if we meet her again at least we’ll know what she looks like so we can be polite.  Speaking of which, you’re alright with the plans for this evening?”

‘Of course sir,’ Io reassured him as they ducked into the temple of Valta.  ‘You seem to be forgetting that I’ve spent the entirety of our stay here keeping myself concealed from the Cauthan, Veera excepted, of course.  I am happy to be on standby for a night so that you might have guests over.’  Winters acknowledged her with a wink as he called over one of the hunters, thanking the fates that they’d paid a visit when someone was available to help.  After a brief explanation, the hunter helped him lay the chesko on one of the gutting tables and encouraged him to go find his buyer.  A short time later he returned, accompanied by Zolta’s master.

“I daresay human, you’ll be putting these lads out of business before long!”  He laughed heartily, earning him a very put out look from the disciple of Valta.  “You said you wish to sell this to us.  What for?”

“I’ve seen a number of villagers around with hooded cloaks made of chesko.  I’d like two of them, one for myself and one for Veera.”

“Hrrrm, yes, I see.  Winter is no doubt practically upon us.  Well, I think the trade is more than fair.  Are you in need of anything else?  This is a fine animal you’ve brought in.  Excellent horns too,” he remarked, taking a closer look at the chesko as he made a circle around it, running a hand over the fur.

“Well you guys already gave me that stuff to fix up our walls the other day so-”  Winters was interrupted as the older Cauthan help up a paw.

“That was still part of our deal for the hyrven.  If you don’t need anything, I won’t force you human, but Tyrdus would surely look down upon me if I were to not at least offer you an equitable trade.”

“Well, if you insist, we are having Zolta and his mate for dinner this evening.  We could use a couple more utensils at a minimum.”

“Not a problem Winters, we can head to the storeroom once we finish up here,” the smith declared, pointing out to the hunter how he wanted the chesko skinned.  Deciding to take a moment for himself, Winters wandered the temple, finding strips of hyrven meat hanging from the walls to dry along with other cured cuts from chesko.  A thought struck him.

“Excuse me, if you don’t mind could I get a cut of this one fresh?  Off the hind leg?”  He asked the hunter who had just begun gathering his tools.  He grunted in reply.

“It’s your kill human, do what you please.”

“That’s fine with me Winters, wouldn’t want my apprentice dining on salted meat tonight!”  The smith laughed heartily at his own comment, seemingly unconcerned with the details.

“I’m guessing I still have a bit of credit left over?”

“A bit?  Do you have any idea how much the temple of the twin goddesses wanted for that pelt?  There were no puncture wounds, no blood, nothing to spoil it whatsoever.  Whomever ends up with the cloak they make from that is going to pay a small fortune, be it Vash or some trader from afar.  Your efforts are making commerce flow at a time when we’d usually be in a post-festival lull human; I’ll not begrudge you a fresh cut of meat for your guests,” he explained, giving Winters and Io a bit of information on the Cauthan economy and business.  Winters nodded.

“Thank you.”  He allowed the smith to return his attention to the chesko, resuming his walk around the temple and ending up at the back wall, noticing that the skull of the hyrven he’d killed was resting on a shelf below the hanging trophies, presumably in order to soon join them.

‘It would appear her respect for you is at least equal to her thorniness,’ Io remarked.  ‘Oh, speak of the devil, here she is in the flesh.’  Winters turned to find Ratha had entered the temple, dragging a chesko behind her on a triangular sled of branches that had been lashed together with leather.  She noticed him and his kill.

“Oh you have got to be kidding me.  Apparently the goddess sees fit to test me yet again,” she lamented, smirking at Winters all the same.  In her full hunting garb, a hyrven cloak over fur armor inlaid with bone, Winters thought she actually looked more intimidating than he did in the Aegis.  He laughed.

“Need a hand there Ratha?  I’ve got nothing on my plate at the moment.”  She pointed her knife at him with a casual flick of her wrist.

“Honestly?  I’d rather die,” she stated matter of factly.  The smith and hunter attending to Winters’ kill made a pointed effort to mind their own business while still keeping both ears trained on the twin fireballs inhabiting the space.  

“You know that could easily be arranged,” Winters replied, drawing his pistol and observing it in the torchlight.  “But I don’t know what I’d do without such a spiky individual to toy with in my life.  Antoth just isn’t any fun.”  Ratha threw her head back with laughter.

“Those are some bold words human!  But I’ll agree with you on the subject of our illustrious guard captain.”  She flourished his title such a way as to indicate her true feelings on the subject.  “You’d grow bored of him in a day, likely less.”

“Guess I should keep you around then, shouldn’t I?”

“That would be most beneficial to your health Winters.”

“Sure you don’t want any help?”  He asked, standing stock still as she flicked her knife at him, the flat of the blade bouncing harmlessly off his chestplate.  Io was incensed, but Winters found Ratha’s actions to be oddly refreshing, a reminder of some of the days he’d spent training to be a HEL Jumper after basic, where the only humor around was dark or antagonistic.  “I guess that answers that question,” he remarked idly, picking the knife up and spinning it around in his hands for a moment before walking over and placing it on the table Ratha had chosen for processing her kill.  “You dropped this.”

“Oh?  So I did.  I hope you didn’t get it dirty,” she said, taking it and replacing it in the sheath at her belt.  Winters was about to reply when Zolta’s master tapped him on the shoulder.

“I’m finished here if you’d like to review the items we have in storage.  If you don’t find something to your liking, the sooner we can agree to terms for a new piece, the better.”  Winters nodded.

“Don’t miss me too much Ratha,” he waved lazily in parting.  The huntress had already strung up her kill and was slicing into it with precision.

“I have a corpse to keep me company Winters, that’s a lot better than you,” she insisted, returning his wave nonetheless.  Retrieving his large slab of chesko steak, Winters followed the elder smith out of the lodge.

“You enjoy playing with fire, don’t you?”  He joked when he was sure they were out of Ratha’s earshot and back inside the friendly territory of the temple of Tyrdus.  Winters let out a bark of laughter.  

“Literally and figuratively, yes.”

“Be it on your head then Winters, shall we?”  He motioned to the back of the building and Winters followed, giving a nod of greeting to a couple of the guild members who met his gaze.  He didn’t see Zolta, but figured that meant he was either working on his piece or spending some time with Asha, both of which he considered good uses of time.  After they entered the warehouse, they moved to the near left corner of the room, which housed most of the finished goods that were generic enough to be produced en masse and stockpiled.  Zolta’s master pointed him to a small pile of cloaks made of chesko fur.  “Take your time Winters, I’ll be out front if you require anything else.”

“Yeah, no problem.  Don’t let me keep you,” the human replied, beginning to rifle through the garments, holding them up by the shoulders to get an idea for their length and width.  Thanks to Io’s scan of Veera, he had no problem selecting one for her, a basic piece with two clasps, one just below the neck, and another partway down the chest in case the wearer desired a more thorough protection from the elements.  He was pleased to find the fasteners were made from filed pieced of bone as opposed to wood, which would hold the cloak together by means of leather loops woven into the other side.  Upon closer inspection he realized that all of the cloaks shared a ‘two button’ design and was able to find one for himself as well.

‘Shall we give it a bit of a test?’  Io asked.  ‘Even if you’re wearing the Aegis, heat is heat sir.  It makes no sense to bleed it any faster than we need to.’

“Was thinking that myself Io.  Hold on just a moment,” Winters said, laying the leather-wrapped chesko gently on the floor before swinging the cloak over his shoulders.  “Huh, a tad short when I’m suited up but this will do very nicely I think,” he remarked, throwing the hood up over his helmet.  It was a tight fit, but nothing that would strain the material.  With his broad shoulder armor he found himself only able to fasten the top brooch, but that was sufficient to keep it in place.  Receiving a thumbs up from Io, he gathered and folded both cloaks as well as a couple of dinner plates to supplement the two that he and Veera had acquired for themselves after his first hunt.  Satisfied, he shifted that load to one hand before grabbing his other parcel and heading back to the main temple workshop.  After a quick check with Zolta’s master, Winters bid them farewell and headed for home.  He and Zolta had agreed that the young couple would join them after sundown, which by Io’s count gave him and Veera a bit less than an hour to prepare for their guests.  Looking forward to the look on his girlfriend’s face, he headed home, taking another back alley route that he was becoming steadily more familiar with.

\-----

“Oh dear, what should I do?  Should this go here…or maybe over there?  To think that I’d ever be fretting over there not being enough room in this house again!”  Veera ran a paw through her crest feathers and sighed, trying to arrange her two new chairs around the fire pit.  They’d only gotten them in the day before and Zolta and Asha would be arriving soon.  A soft chuckle, slightly distorted, reached her ears and she turned quickly to find her mate standing in the doorway.  “Oh thank the gods you’re here.  Russell, do you think I should have the chairs facing the door or away from it?  Or maybe one on each side?  Or maybe the other side here?”  She looked at him urgently as his helmet turned back and forth to survey their home.

“How long have you been here Veera?”

“I got back in the middle of the afternoon.  Now help me!”  She brushed off his question, beginning to pace worriedly back and forth.

‘I love her.  Can we keep her?’  Io asked Winters privately, finding Veera’s attention to detail to be ridiculously endearing.  Winters killed his audio projection.  

“Using the ‘L’ word now are we?”  He asked curiously.

‘Thought I’d try it out in a few places, see how I like it.  Unlike you I’m not blessed with electro-hormonal systems that will produce the condition naturally.  Therefore I must create the conditions.  Don’t tell me you don’t just want to bed her this instant,’ Io insisted.  Winters’ eyebrow climbed higher.

“No, not exactly the emotional reaction I was having.  That said, I do love her very much, and this moment is definitely going in the books as one of the reasons why.”

“Russell!  Don’t ignore me!”  Veera demanded his attention anew, her back still mostly turned to him as she nervously whipped her tail back and forth low over the ground.  Setting down the plates, meat, and cloaks, he strode up to her and encircled her with his arms from behind, crossing his arms over her chest and eliciting a long sigh from her.

“Easy girl, I’ve got you,” he commanded.  Veera stilled against him as her breath caught in her lungs.  His armor was hard and cool against her, a stark contrast to the warmth of his voice and the gentle hold of his arms.  She found herself mentally and physically unable to move.  *What in the name of the goddess?*  Veera could only wonder why her body was betraying her, why her concerns regarding home décor were immediately forgotten, why her core was beginning to feel particularly warm.  “There we go, a bit more calm now?  It’s just Zolta and Asha coming over, you know that right?”  Winters asked, unable to feel her body quaking lightly against his armor.

“Love…”  Veera managed, thankful as he turned her slowly to face him.  He loosened his hold so she could remove his helmet, immediately tossing it to her left and not bothering to look as it rolled and came to rest against the wall.

“Veera what’s-”  Winters’ question was cut off by his girlfriend’s lips on his.  She nipped lightly at his lower lip before snaking her tongue into his mouth to taste him, finding the lingering taste of mint, much to her delight.  His startled groan stirred her.

“I don’t know…” she whispered.  “You just set me on fire.  I don’t know what happened I just…”  Veera trailed off and closed her eyes, purring as the rough material of his gauntlet moved south to her hindquarters.  He exhaled heavily and brought their foreheads together.

“Sorry, I’m a selfish man.”

“Crass as you may be my human, you make me feel attractive.  I don’t know of any female in the village that has this much physical attention lavished on her.  I’ll forgive you if you help me solve my little problem before dinner?”  She mewled, arching her back as he groped her.  He chuckled.

“I’m rubbing off on you.  And I very much like it.”  He took a couple of deep breaths and brought his hands higher to encircle her waist.  “I promise to help you in just a moment, but I have something for you first.  Close your eyes?”  She gave him a wary look but did so promptly.  Stepping away from her for just a moment, he grabbed her cloak and returned, draping it over her shoulders while planting a soft kiss on her nose.  “Got you a little something,” he told her happily, fastening the top brooch for her as she opened her eyes excitedly and looked left and right at her shoulders before running a hand over the material and fingering the bone clasps.  With a playful laugh she twirled once in place for him.

“How do I look?!”  She asked eagerly.

“Like you’re ready for snow.  How does it fit?”

“It’s snug and warm,” she informed him, flipping the hood over her feathers to test the fit.  She gave him a fierce hug after determining her crest had enough space.  “Will you still help me if I forgive you right now?”

“Of course feather kitten.”

“Then you’re forgiven darling.  Did you get yourself one?”

“I did indeed!”  He donned his own cloak with a grand flourish, also presenting Veera with the fresh chesko for dinner.  “Now, as promised, I believe our guests should have the chairs this evening and that they should be placed together, facing the doorway.  That way they won’t be subject to any drafts that happen to blow in and they can enjoy their meal together.  Crisis averted?”

“Yes my love, thank you.  I think I was just going a bit insane.  It’s been a long time since guests have been hosted in this home…other than you of course.  I wanted to do honor to Meylith.  She’s given us much since the harvest festival.  Oh look, it even fits over your armor!  Though it is a bit tight…”  Veera pondered, taking the time to size up his own cloak, picking at the fur and minutely adjusting the shoulders so that they lay perfectly over his pauldrons.  She stepped back and gave him an approving nod.  “Quite dashing!”  The two lovers shared a quiet moment of laughter before Winters caught her gaze again.

“We have been blessed, haven’t we?”  He spoke seriously.  “Should we…offer a prayer?”  Veera said nothing in reply but her eyes conveyed the enormity of her emotional reaction to his words.  Taking his hand softly, she led him to her shrine, moving around his weapons and bidding him to kneel with her.  Io even joined in as a show of support to her biological companions, projecting herself in a comfortable kneeling position.

“So long as your entreaty is humble, the goddess will hear you.”  Veera whispered before closing her eyes and clasping her hands together in her lap.  *Meylith, please watch over this home of ours.  Grant us the patience to understand one another despite our differences, all three of us.  Though I may never be a mother, please grant me the ability to be a worthy mate to this human.  Help me equal his strength and bravery.  We will treat our guests this evening in keeping with your customs.  Selah.*

*Uh…Meylith right?  I won’t ask for much, just that you keep Veera safe.  I’ll do what I can to treat her the way she deserves, the way one of her species would,as best as I can.  Hope that’s enough.  Also if you could make it so I don’t burn the chesko tonight, that would be awesome.  Thanks.*

,confession,"I haven't cried since my ex and I spilt all the way back in October. And before that it hadn't been since my first cat died over 3 years prior. And yet, there have been many other times when I felt I should have cried and when I didn't I felt wrong, almost not human whilst I wondered 'Why am I not feeling sad?'. I can feel truly happy, truly angry and all the other emotions but I was starting to think I couldn't feel truly sad. It made me feel incomplete. So I put on the saddest playlist I could and read an ask Reddit about the last time men cried. At first I thought nothing was happening but I felt myself well up over some posts about pets dying and was then pushed over the edge by ones about parents dying. I then allowed tears to fall down my face and I felt almost happy? It was cathartic.

,survivinginfidelity,"These are the events of the worst day of my life.  My wife, my confidant, my best friend, the person that I thought would be there for me no matter what became my enemy that day.  My wife hated me and wasn't afraid to tell me that day.  Hours/days before She would't have dared to tell me that she hated me.  I was confused and I did not understand what was happening.  On that day I felt like a child whose parents were abusing them and all they wanted was to be loved.  To summarize things my wife called the police on me, left the home that we picked out and purchased together, left our children, and then she went to have sex with and spend the night with another man.  We had been married for 10 years and had 2 children together.  At the time I did not know that's what was transpiring.  As I sat broken in the home that we built together, I began putting the pieces together.  I knew what was happening.  In all honesty I had known for weeks but I had refused to admit it to myself.  The signs were all there, but I gave her the benefit of the doubt and I refused to see what was happening right in front of my face.  The only issue is at that point I didn't know with whom it was happening with.  I thought it was with her friend(male) from work but it turned out to be her boss.  She did an excellent job of hiding in plain site and throwing me off her trail.  Her lies mixed with the trust that I had in her made it hard for me to pinpoint what was going on.  All I knew was that my marriage was unraveling in front of me and I was scared.  I felt helpless.  Little did I know, I REALLY was helpless.  Not only did two of the worst things imaginable happen to me but I almost threw my life away that night as well.  I waited outside of her place of employment from midnight until 7am the next morning on the person that I thought she had spent the night with.  I was thinking with pure anger and pain.  I was so hurt by the one person that I thought would never hurt me that nothing in life mattered to me at that point.  I look back and I am so thankful for the way the events of the following morning transpired.  Had any choices been made different I could possibly be writing this from a 10x10 cell.  

     The day that turned out to be the worst day of my life had been building for many months.  By the time I realized what was happening it was already too late to stop the train that was already in motion.  My wife had already been with this other man sexually multiple times by this point.  She had already fallen for him.  She did not have a plan of how to move forward but she was certain that she didnt want me anymore.  In my heart and mind I searched for what I had done to deserve this.  Even though it has been months, I can still remember that day like it was yesterday.  We got into an argument over nothing.  She pushed every button I had until I grew frustrated and angry, she called the police, they arrived and then she left and went to another mans house.  I did not see her until the next morning.

     To add insult to injury, today I was searching for study music to download.  I have to download music in advance because a lot of time the connection inmy study room is too slow to stream.  Well as Im searching I came across her favorites playlist.  It's a reminder and a blueprint to what was going on with my wife and how she felt.  Looking at the songs, the timeline, the lyrics hurt like a motherfucker.  The first liked song of the affair era on her favorites list was ""Love Bites"" by Def Leppard.  From there, if you are looking at it form the perspective of a betrayed husband it only gets worst.   Martin Vide, Poison.    And then we get to ""Love is in the dark"".  Further up the list we get to the song by Pia Mia ""Lets do it again""  where shes talking about her one night stand and how she wants to do it again.  Then I see ""Just a kiss"".  I imagine this song was Favorited around the time that my wife had her first kiss with another man that wasn't me.  It's painful to see to be honest.  I can look back and realize that this had progressed and that was the moment when I should have started seeing things.  But I didn't.  (I honestly should have seen things long before this point)  From that point forward my wife was no longer mine.  Her thoughts, emotions, feelings, were all geared toward another man.  As the playlist gets to the song ""Tomorrow"" by Chris Young I don't know if that song was saved with me on her mind or with him on her mind. But the lyrics ""tonight im gonna love you like theres no tomorrow"" leads me to believe that she was thinking about him.   As the playlist continues I could tell that my wife's feelings and opinion of me were changing.  Initially she was awestruck with her new interest, so thats the focus of the songs.  The ""affair erra"" playlist started with lust and excitement, but as time went on it got sadder.  I could see in the music what my wife was feeling.  She was hating me.  She was thinking that I was different now.  She was over me and she was wanting things back to the way they used to be.  She was done with me.  The music tells the tale.  The thing is... I haden't changed.  No more so than people do in long relationships.  What was changing was her view of me.  And it was a warped view because of her affair.  She was convincing herself that I was a horrible person.  A horrible husband.  That I dindt love her.  This was the furthest from the truth, but its what she needed to tell herself to be able to keep up her affair.  My wife changed her hair style which she had not done in over a decade, my wife began wearing makeup which she had never done, she bought perfume.  The other change which I didn't notice was that she began paying less attention to me.  She started being angrier toward me.  I was losing, and eventually lost here.  She told me on the day that we got married that she would love me forever but it wasn't true.  On that day I realized she did not love me.  I don't doubt whether she once did because I believe that she once did, but on that day it was gone. She was daydreaming about another man.  She was fantasizing about him.  She wanted to be with him when she was with me.  When we were together she wanted to talk to him.  When she needed a shoulder to cry on or someone to talk to she ran to him and not to me.",t2_1l157f72,,,0,,The worst day of my life (kind of a long post),[],r/survivinginfidelity,False,6.0,,,,,False,,False,dark,,,public,,,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},,False,33,,,,self,False,,[],,,True,,,text,6.0,,,text,self.survivinginfidelity,,,,,,,False,False,True,False,False,,,False,,True,False,False,,,,,,,t5_2x8ez,,,,,8rkvb1,,,Dead_Inside_1900,,37,True,all_ads,False,,,,/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/8rkvb1/the_worst_day_of_my_life_kind_of_a_long_post/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/8rkvb1/the_worst_day_of_my_life_kind_of_a_long_post/,26573,1529170134.0,0,,False,,,,,,,,1529169905.0,1536385821.0,,,

,actuallesbians,"This might be long sorry, I'm not sure what I'm looking for really. Maybe just some virtual hugs from those that have been through similar situations.

So (of course), there's this girl. We met on Tinder 9 months ago, but around Christmas decided to just be friends, because there weren't sparks flying. Since then, we have fostered a truly wonderful friendship. I'm quite socially awkward, and often find myself getting over being around other people quite quickly. But with her, I want to be around her all the time. I could listen to her all day, she's incredibly funny and genuine. She also cares so deeply about issues I am also passionate about, but doesn't make me feel stupid when we discuss them (another frequent feeling for me).

I realised I was falling in love with her about 3-4 months ago, but kept it inside, as our friendship was too good to go throwing romantic feelings at, and I was sure they weren't reciprocated. She struggles with her sexuality a bit, and has never been with a woman. She's openly bi, but isn't sure if she is heteroromantic. 
Over the past few months, I have started feeling more of that ""spark"". I thought I was imagining it, and also that it just corresponded to the amazing friendship we had forged. But it kept building, and then she made me the playlist. One day, she just snapchatted me a screenshot of a playlist she had made me called ""hi jambon_fleur"", which was uncharacteristically brief and mysterious. It was about a hundred songs long, and has since grown. The original playlist mostly contained love songs, with a fair chunk about not ignoring things that were meant to be etc. I listened to it all day, scared and excited and confused. I ignored the strong urge to ask to meet with her immediately, and just kiss her or something. 

The next day I messaged her to ask her straight up if she was interested in me romantically, or if I was imagining things. Mistake number one perhaps. I'm leaving the country in 9 days though (this was about a week ago), and thought that being straight up would be best at the time. She saw the message, left it on read for 9 hours, then replied later that night. The gist was that I wasn't imagining things, but she was confused about how she feels about me. We sort of decided that it's best to just keep hanging out as per usual. After that though, things intensified significantly. The tension was almost unbearable, and I was smiling non-stop everyday. She called me incredibly beautiful, and drunkenly invited me around to her house late one evening. She pushed the couches together and we had some drinks and chatted, before climbing into the couch bed and watching Harry Potter. She started to feel sick though, so we went to sleep. Well, she did. I lay there beside her, not touching but just wishing our feet would fall onto one another or something, occasionally sneaking a peek at her sleeping face. I eventually fell asleep then dreamt about us together on the couch bed, being called away but sneaking back to be together. 

We hung out for a while in the morning, then I left for work. I was so happy!
We shared a few days of messaging each other constantly. I had proposed renting a fancy hotel room together with a bath, because we both really love baths and would be finishing up some really big academic achievements then. I was kind of joking, but also thought it would be really fun to hang out in a bath together all night chatting and drinking tequila. I don't think I really meant it to be overly romantic, but I guess I did think it would be a nice opportunity to explore the growing tension. I'm not really sure what I was thinking, but it was obviously a stupid idea!

She messaged me a few days later, saying she thinks we really should be just friends and that she wants to have feelings for me, but doesn't want to force it. She (understandably) felt pressured by me booking this getaway. She said she understands if I want some space for a while (which will be enforced when I go overseas anyway), but wants to remain friends. 

I'm left feeling incredibly crushed, heartbroken, and utterly stupid. I feel like I tried to rush things way too much. I feel like I never should have said anything, and just let things happen naturally if that was the way it was going to go. I couldn't handle not knowing, and now I wish that I didn't. I'm sorry for the long ramble, I just need to get it out (I'm really hoping she doesn't use reddit).
Since then, we have been messaging each other less and something has changed. Like a huge dial has been turned down or a fire has burned down to embers. Maybe some residual awkwardness or just the fact that we haven't hung out alone since. I've been a melodramatic mess. I tattooed her first initial on my fucking finger.

,Blackops4,"They're turtling up.

They'll just ignore our concerns until everyone gets tired of it and stops fighting.

This is what they do.

Activision are no dummies.  They know that they can just ignore this and we will drop it.

Activision is so much smarter than EA.

Ever notice that on release day, and up to a month later that there are no disappointment drops (supply drops)?

This is no accident.  This way they don't have to fight the controversy... there isn't one yet!

and quietly a month later they add them in when we start really wanting some more content.

By this time we're almost lining up for them to take our cryptokeys!

They also start out with small items that don't change the gameplay... but that isn't their gameplay!

From day one they plan on having weapons in the disappointment drops... but they're patient enough, unlike EA.

They usually give us 1100 cryptokeys, even though nothing is available for that last 100.  That is to try to get us to buy more the ""free"" keys.  Which is surprisingly effective.

While the debate on loot boxes being gambling is debated a lot.  I submit that it doesn't matter.  The use of our dopamine reward system like that maybe is, or maybe isn't...but it definitively causes your brain to react in the same manner.

and yes they abuse our love of treyarch and it's games with no concern for the health of our communities... I say communities because between them and Sony they cause a huge divide along three paths... with smaller divides all the way up.

They rarely if ever lower the price of old CoD games... and never for map packs or the seasons pass.

They still charge us here in Canada $15-$20 for a Black Ops 3 map pack.  That's right, for some reason the pack with the remade Standoff is $5 more.

I guess that is because it's regarded by a lot of people to be one of THE BEST maps in CoD history.

Let me correct one thing, though... they justify the price of old CoDs by adding a map pack to the base game.

That's right... you cannot buy just the base game of any CoD before black ops 3.. you have to buy the ""gold edition""... with a map pack that will almost never come up.  This is not hyperbole... the map pack I bought for Blops3 has come up FOUR TIMES in the last year.

The map packs I got with Ghosts is even rarer in a playlist  I've played the Trolley level in Ghosts maybe a half dozen times.

This makes it hard to become competent with those map, as you can't learn the routes people take and how the map is played.

And while some CoDs have a playlist for the DLC maps, if you don't have the full seasons pass, good luck finding matches.  It's all or nothing.  And on top of that most people I know with the seasons pass uninstall theirs so they can get better lobbies.

The whole map pack thing is a scam... and once again, they don't care.

Did you know games like Unreal Tournament, Quake and Doom was FULL of maps people made?  And with mods that kept the game fresh.

If we were allowed to rent our own servers there could be ways to deal with this... run your own server with whatever maps you want... that way you could play the game the you wanted.  They even came with the tools you needed to make your own maps!  But this would dip into Acti. &amp; Co.'s cash grab so they got rid of both private servers and user created mods and maps.

Didn't have a map that came up on the list?  Those games would download and install it while you waited to join!

And the stuff they give you for a ""pre-order"" bonus is stuff that doesn't cost them a dime.

Skins, maps, and CoD points.  All so they could make a small fortune off the CoD communities money via interest.  You might think that this is a tiny amount, but when you're dealing with larger sums, interest can make you a nice chunk of change.

Then even though they know we are angry about them charging us THREE DIFFERENT WAYS for one game (buy the game, microtransactions, and dlc), and even more importanty dividing our community, they waltz in and announce that they will split it EVEN FURTHER.

I could go on and on, but I think you get the point.  Acti. &amp; Co. just want to abuse our community and take us for every penny we have.  All because they KNOW we love the game and will put up with more because of that.

And while I think Treyarch owns a good chunk of the responsibility, a lot of you disagree.  But think about it this way... regardless if Treyarch is culpable, Acti. &amp; Co. use them as a weapon against us.

Every time a Treyarch game comes out they ramp up the wallet raping to 11.

They use anything they can to try to pry out whatever they can, all because we love a franchise.

A lot of other companies would kill to have the loyalty that this fanbase has, but Acti. &amp; Co. just use it to scam us further.

I remember when MTX first came in they CHARGED for calling cards with countries flags on them.

One of the simplest ways to show your national pride, and 3arc + Acti just used it to push it in a little further.

***

I've had enough, though.  I won't be pre-ordering this, and if things don't change for the better I am not buying it at all.  Regardless I am not buying the seasons pass.

Once again they think they can throw us four less maps and expect us to be happy.  NO MORE!

My money for pre-purchasing is going to EA... which I understand has it's own problems, but they're not the ones who have been dryballing me for years so I can handle them this year... besides I want to support systems I believe in.",t2_3lvmt,,,0,,Activision is just going to do what it always does in these situations.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Discussion'}]",r/Blackops4,False,6.0,discussion,,,,False,,False,dark,,,public,,,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},Discussion,False,71,,,,self,1529162012.0,,[],,,True,,,richtext,6.0,,,text,self.Blackops4,,,,top,,,False,False,True,False,False,,,False,,True,False,False,,,,,,,t5_2untl,,,,,8ri0k5,,,sodappop,,10,True,all_ads,False,,,,/r/Blackops4/comments/8ri0k5/activision_is_just_going_to_do_what_it_always/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blackops4/comments/8ri0k5/activision_is_just_going_to_do_what_it_always/,45348,1529136281.0,0,,False,,,,,,,,1251492686.0,1536383580.0,,,

This post is an experiment: It's an end-of-the-week summary of the highest-level feedback we've gotten from all of you in the PUBG community **along with responses addressing that feedback.** It's NOT intended to be a comprehensive final answer for every single question or complaint posted in our communities—that wouldn't be possible. For many issues, the answer simply has to be ""we’ve got no updates to share."" However, we are going to be giving a lot of updates on issues the community is concerned about and sharing whatever we can. 

This is just an experiment for now, but if it goes well, we'll strongly consider doing it every Friday. Let's jump in.

#COMMUNITY ISSUES AND THE LATEST RESPONSES

###On Using Store-Bought Assets In PUBG

**Context:** 

For some time, there’s been a rumor that all of PUBG’s maps are either outsourced or entirely built using store-bought assets. Players generally would like to know more about how our art team thinks about the value of external art and how we actually do use it in our game.

**The Latest Response:** 

Earlier this week, I had a long conversation with one of our lead artists, Dave, about this subject. He shared a lot of really interesting information about the development of each of our maps and how our usage of external assets has changed over time. For those of you who are interested, [the full post is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/8qu07m/brendan_greene_wants_to_kill_me/e0ma17n/?context=3).

###On Map Selection Changes

**Context:** 

In [this week’s dev letter](https://steamcommunity.com/games/578080/announcements/detail/3077529424436480685), we announced that in order to keep matchmaking for our existing queues healthy, we’ll have to change the way map selection works in PUBG. Read the full post for details, but the TL;DR is that we’re limiting it by sorting maps with different playstyles into “playlists.” Since the announcement, many players have expressed dismay and confusion about why we can’t support full map selection for more than two maps.

**The Latest Response:** 

Some of you have proposed suggestions for alternate ways of handling map selection, so below I want to address those and explain more about why we’re going with the announced solution. 

The key problem to understand before jumping into the details is that with just two maps, **the game currently supports 12 separate queues for each region.** The math breaks down like this: (2 maps X 2 perspectives X 3 squad sizes). If we were to both launch another map and keep our current map selection design, we’d have 18 separate queues when Sanhok launches:

1) SOLO - TPP - ERANGEL

2) DUO - TPP - ERANGEL

3) SQUAD - TPP - ERANGEL

4) SOLO - FPP - ERANGEL

5) DUO - FPP - ERANGEL

6) SQUAD - FPP - ERANGEL

7) SOLO - TPP - MIRAMAR

8) DUO - TPP - MIRAMAR

9) SQUAD - TPP - MIRAMAR

10) SOLO - FPP - MIRAMAR

11) DUO - FPP - MIRAMAR

12) SQUAD - FPP - MIRAMAR

13) SOLO - TPP - SANHOK

14) DUO - TPP - SANHOK

15) SQUAD - TPP - SANHOK

16) SOLO - FPP - SANHOK

17) DUO - FPP - SANHOK

18) SQUAD - FPP - SANHOK

You can see how this gets complicated fast. Sure, some people would be queued up for more than one of those 18 possible queues at a time, but we’d still have big problems on our hands. Even in heavily populated regions, some of these queues would almost certainly fall over. 

That said, many of you have rightfully pointed out that there are some downsides to consider with our current solution for the problem, so let’s take some time to talk about the pros and cons.

**OUR CURRENT SOLUTION**

**Maintain 12 separate queues by combining Erangel + Miramar into one queue (called a playlist) and separate Sanhok out into a separate queue.**

**Pros:** Maintains the current health of our queues for all regions, doesn’t destroy matchmaking times, groups the 8km x 8km maps together and clearly marks Sanhok out as a separate experience (called “Mini Royale”), sets a solid precedent for the way we’ll organize maps after we launch more maps, and allows players to guarantee they’ll be able to play Sanhok whenever they want (very important especially just after we launch it). 

**Cons:** Players who want to only play on Miramar or only on Erangel no longer have that choice. Increased likelihood of hot-dropping or queue-dodging for those players. 

Okay, now just for the sake of argument, let’s talk about the pros and cons of two of the alternate solutions that the community has proposed.

**COMMUNITY PROPOSED SOLUTION 1**

**Allow players to choose one map they *don’t* want to play on, and exclude that from matchmaking. Players would then be required to queue up for two other maps of their choice.**

**Pros:** Allows you to always avoid playing on one of the three maps if you just really hate one of the three, isn’t as damaging to queue times as full map selection, slightly reduces likelihood of queue dodging

**Cons:** More damaging to queues times than our current solution because it splits up map-based matchmaking into more than two groups (even after accounting for overlap effects), creates more problems when we add more maps in the future (would you still only exclude one map?), players can’t guarantee they’ll be able to play on Sanhok when they queue up (very important especially just after we launch it).


**COMMUNITY PROPOSED SOLUTION 2**

**Allow full map selection but dynamically turn off low-population queues to push players into fewer queues.**

**Pros:** Most of the time you’d (probably?) get to play the exact map and mode you wanted depending on your region and the time of day, greatly reduces likelihood of queue dodging

**Cons:** Potentially kills off queues that would otherwise work fine albeit with low populations (a big concern for smaller regions), limits your choice on perspective and ability to play with friends (could kill FPP entirely in many regions), creates the false expectation that we’d always be able to support full map selection even after adding more maps, very complicated and unpredictable effects on matchmaking times

The point of all this is to show that while there are other possible solutions than the one we’re currently going with, we’ve thought seriously about them and their trade-offs. That said, please continue the conversation in the comments—it’s possible there are other possible solutions out there with pros and cons not listed here. Although Sanhok will launch with the announced solution in place, we’re eager to develop a solution that works well for everyone even as we continue to add maps.

###On Much-Needed Matchmaking UI Improvements

**Context:**

Many of you have pointed out that we should include more information in the UI when players are matchmaking. Suggestions include expected queue times, information about how full your match is, etc. 

**The Latest Response:**

The devs agree that there’s some improvements we can make. Although there’s no specific timeline or details on this stuff yet, we hope to share more in the near future about matchmaking UI improvements.

###On No MMR Matchmaking In Sanhok

**Context:**

We announced in [this week’s dev letter](https://steamcommunity.com/games/578080/announcements/detail/3077529424436480685) than we’re turning off MMR matchmaking specifically for Sanhok. The reasoning is included in that letter, although the basic idea is that we think it’ll make the map more fun and casual, as befits its smaller, faster-paced playstyle. Some players have expressed concerns that this will negatively affect their experience on the map.

**The Latest Response:**

There’s no real update on this from our side yet. It’s expected that some players will overestimate the impact that this change will have. We’re mostly waiting to see how things pan out once we launch the map. 
__________________

###On OCE’s FPP Matchmaking Issues

**Context:**

For quite some time now, certain FPP queues in OCE have suffered from extremely long or even infinite matchmaking times. Solo FPP in particular seems to be the biggest problem, but players have reported issues in FPP Duos and FPP Squads as well. 

**The Latest Response:**

Unfortunately this turns out to be a pretty complicated problem—but it comes down to low population and too many queues. OCE is one of our tiniest regions, its players favor TPP over FPP, and there’s often just not enough people in the matchmaking pool for the FPP modes. Although we still haven’t fully confirmed this plan, the devs believe that turning off FPP Duos at the same time that we launch Sanhok should solve the problem. 

Turning off more (or other) queues is an option as well, but there’s no question that trade-offs will have to be made, and some players are likely going to be unhappy with our solution. The important context to understand here is that we’ve already turned off FPP Duos in other small regions, and that has had the expected positive effect on matchmaking there. We hope to have a more detailed update about this problem and our intended solution within a week. Either way, we’re going to do whatever it takes to fix the problem.

###On Ping-Based Matchmaking

**Context:** 

Ping-based matchmaking is a system we added to the game in February of this year. Essentially, this system tries to divide the matching pool by grouping players with low ping together with other low-ping players, and high-ping players with other players with high ping. 

In effect, it’s a form of very soft region-based matchmaking which makes it less likely you’ll be grouped with players from other countries (or players who simply have much worse or better internet than you). It doesn’t fully prevent matchmaking between players with wildly varying ping, but it makes it less likely. 

Recently, some players have become convinced that ping-based matchmaking has been turned off. As evidence, some have shown that they can reliably get into matches with players from far away places. 

**The Latest Response:** 

I spoke with the devs about this issue, and they confirmed that no changes have been made to ping-based matchmaking. It’s important to understand that ping-based matchmaking doesn’t prevent people with bad ping from playing on any given server. Instead, it prioritizes players who have good ping, and deprioritizes those who don’t. 

Especially if there’s a low population in any given queue (say, for instance, it’s FPP Duos on Erangel only at an off-hours time like 3am) then ping-based matchmaking isn’t going to make as much of a difference as it would when given a bigger matching pool. This might explain why the system isn’t as always as effective as you might expect. 


#OTHER POPULAR TOPICS
These are things that we don’t have updates for today. We’ll be chatting more with the devs to see what, if anything, we can share about these topics in the future. Please note **it may end up that many of things can't yet be publicly addressed for one reason or another.** If that's the case, we'll tell you. But we’re listing them here to acknowledge you're asking about it. 

* Optimization
* Network Performance
* Anti-Cheat
* Bullet penetration
* Limb penetration (arms blocking too much damage, etc.)
* Region locking
* Practice range
* Ongoing changes to circle dynamics
* What do you want to hear more about?

,NoFap,"I was browsing youtube and looked at my private playlist that included sexual videos over the years. I noticed that a lot of the videos had disappeared and thought that a video I fapped to years ago had been deleted. I was disappointed and tried finding it for a few minutes and then I did. it was a video of pics from myspace of girls in their underwear from 2008. I masturbated to it about 7 years ago by humping two slices of melon pushed together and it felt good- I actually require a week or so of abstinence from masturbation in order to ejaculate this way because I usually masturbate every day and I'm desensitised. After asking about this on here it turns out that my neurological pathways in my brain has addictive tendancies to old   PMO habits because subconscioulsy the memory is still there that it felt good to masturbate to this video.

I've never considered nofap as completely relevant to me. The majority of the time I masturbate to my imagination and maybe once  or a few times a week (or perhaps only a few times a month) turn to porn. But the reality is that I still have  a pornhub account with private playlists with over 350 videos. The thought of it all being deleted worries me in case I couldn't find a video again  I liked .

I should also add that when I do masturbate by 'humping' into stuff like melons or my lubed hand, when Ive had enough days of abstinence from masturbation,  I look through those 350 odd videos to use that replicate the motion of standing and humping. On relapses I'd typically use those type of videos because I think to myself that I can't masturbate this way normally anyway but can on a long streak.

The reality is that I think I need help. Would you guys agree? Perhaps I'm not in a position as bad as some guys on here but I still might need some help. I've gone three days without masturbating but watched porn 6 hours ago- So here's to a full 90 days reboot starting 6 hours ago.

Seems like a sound idea, and having tried this on the range it actually gives quite good results. Im having issues with fat shots, mainly because i get too fast with the hands and dont allow (dont have time because of fast hands) for a proper weight-shift. With this swing i got solid contact and rarely hit it fat. 

Still having some issues with woods though...

The on thing i noticed was the difficulty of hitting a fade with this technique. It seems this is only for draw shots.

The other thing i noticed i never slice with this swing, if i mess it up, its a push shot rather than a push slice i normally get.

,LetsPlayVideos,"The long-anticipated DLC expansion for Splatoon 2 is finally here! I was going to wait until next Tuesday after my next ranked battle video, but I just couldn't wait! I've decided to push that video back to this week's Random Saturday slot so I can get started on the Octo Expansion right now!

The Octo Expansion stars an amnesiac octoling who lost his/her memory, but remembers the Squid Sisters' Calamari Inkantation from the final boss fight of Splatoon 1 and wants to head to the surface to the ""promised land"". Because the octoling is a fan of the song, the Squid Sisters' grandfather Captain Cuttlefish decides to help him/her escape the deep underground. However, in order to escape, the octoling needs to find four ""thangs"" scattered around the Deep Sea Metro subway tunnels. And the only way to get around the tunnels is to complete different tests, with each one also rewarding a ""Mem Cake"", which is basically one of the octoling's memories.

In the first part, Cuttlefish shows us the ropes, and Off The Hook decides to join in as well.

,loseit,"Background: I (F28) always had ""Fat family mindset"" growing up. Moved out of house. Learned how to cook and started to go to gym, Lost a lot \- in terms of dress sizes i went from EU 52 to 38, meanwhile lot of things in personal life, finally moved to another country with great SO (M, 30 prior always lean build). After move I was still running for a while, than with new job and everything else ^((add excuses)) I just gave up on myself and completely blobbed to almost same size as before to pants size 46 (UK18)... completely hating myself. Worst thing I feel like I dragged my BF to the bottom with me.  My renewed unhealthy lifestyle (eating maybe 1 maximum 2 high\-high calorie food a day while keeping myself full with 4\-5 coffees with milk\- preferably full fat &amp; always 2 spoons of sugar, toped with beer snack and leafs almost every night while sitting home and playing games  \- Im sick just writing in down, it makes me so sad  \- this is how we spend 2 years.

Currently: Almost 2 months back to healthy eating at least 5 to 6 foods a day. Payed for customaed menu done by female trainer, I knew had prior good results with my coworker. It is not as bad, lot of food, lot of protein, kind of what we hope for, except much more potatoes than i expected (2 times a week once once for lunch, one diner). We started going to gym seriously about month ago. **I** feel great. I love it I made the music playlist that makes me go over the edge to beast mode. I love that I can push myself again and I can feel old me awaking under the lazy cheese monster that somehow got hold of me.

My SO was also feeling it, but than one week he got really bad stomach flu (really couldn't leave bathroom) and week after that one of his root canal got infected and he needed a emergency dental work, and ended up on antibiotics for a week. So he fell of the wagon for 15 days. We wen to gym two days ago, again together and he was hurting *really* bad but he is pushing *for us*.

Now part of the current problem is the trainer didn't really helped and as he got back after two weeks of doing nothing, and trying to push himself she commented, as we were doing some of the cable biceps pulls that:  


**""You lift just like your woman""**  


And I got a bit offended, he got offended and for the moment it got real awkward. Luckily my SO is great diplomat and with huge smile on his face just told her, that it is a compliment for my woman. And she just killed it with ""but not for you"". And I saw he was trying to recover but it was just rude and wrong thing to say.

We finished the training with her and got home almost without a word. Now two days later his albows hurt so bad he cant work properly. We are suppose to go to swim today and I dont think he will go. I can feel he is already angry about it when I mentioned it, and he lashed out on me on msngr that saying he is sorry, he doesnt have biceps and brain like a gorilla. The thing is it was never our goal. We dont want to be fitness buffs (we joke that if we will be like Kratos and Xena it will be enough) but honestly I just want to feel healthier and sexy in dresses for him again, so we can enjoy long high quality life together. That is/was our real goal.

I can sense he needs proper motivation but I dont how. I need to get to him that result will show up he just needs to stick with it. I dont think he understood **how much work** it is going to be and now he is backing off and I know that if he is not going to stick with it I wont in long run either.

First few times in gym it was awesome, and while I kept going and he was sick now Im afraid he wont continue with it. What can I tell to my  skiny\-fat boyfriend to keep him motivated? He is complaining lately about being constatntly hungry, Im trying to incorporate more and more protein to his foods and make it as easy as possible for him. I dont hold him accountable for many of little cheats (salted peanuts, occasional small beer etc) just so it wont be so hard on him.

I need him to hold on, so we can grow beter. I dont know how. *Help please?*

Sorry for rant/ it end up longer than expected I will appreciate any male perspective too, I really dont know how to get to him

,FortniteCompetitive,"Right, prepare yourself.  This is going to be a long, rambling show of my attempt at contribution.  Feel free to point out my many inconsistencies and mistakes which I’m sure will follow.  This was also written to an inspirational playlist on spotify so I might randomly lose the ability to write decent English while I’m inspired.  

**QUICK TIPS**:
To begin with, work on your landing.  Arguably the most important of a game is not dying right at the start.  Mainly because if it carries on happening you get mad and [this happens](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=broken+xbox+one+controller&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=iu&amp;ictx=1&amp;fir=hsOCfuHsqrNO4M%253A%252CJRBnGcDi8jZx3M%252C_&amp;usg=__1tppoW6hNp2vNau61qAQkHUaNhI%3D&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjggeyT29LbAhXKB8AKHUFEDlYQ9QEIPDAC#imgrc=hsOCfuHsqrNO4M:).  So, the biggest thing is, if someone lands on a roof before you DO NOT LAND THERE.  You will almost certainly die, unfortunately we’re not in the good times where you could pickaxe someone with a gun anymore.  If someone lands on top of a house, drop to the bottom or glide away peacefully.  Your main aim should be to get a shotgun, so dropping alone is key.  Sometimes dropping to the bottom of a house and working up to the chest is actually better, because of the chance of getting a shotgun

**If you’re playing for wins** – Drop somewhere on the cliffs of the map.  Gradually move in with the circle if you aren’t confident at shooting or go to the middle of each circle and build a big base.  Only problem with this is that you will probably get pushed, so be prepared for that.  This will probably be boring, even if you get to the end there’s still a high chance you’ll come up against bob the builder who will build himself a 4 story castle in -1 seconds.  

**If you want to get better** – Drop tilted, or somewhere else popular, for example salty springs.  I’d recommend Salty, you’ll run into people and develop key gun skills, but won’t get shot in the back every few seconds.  Carry on dropping here and gradually you’ll build up skills in building and fighting.  [This video showcases it well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cer5lQjFlD4), look at the difference between Luke at the beginning and at the end.

**GET MATERIALS** – Arguably materials are the best thing to have in this game.  Building is key to becoming a solid (or even average) player, so make sure you have enough materials.  Material collecting is even more important after the recent material drop nerf(no comment).  It lets you spam build to protect yourself if you get shot, which is essential.  As Sypher says, if you get shot 3 times without building, you deserve to die.  That’s how important it is.


**GENERAL ADVICE**:
For newer players(who want to learn to build): For a few games start to land wailing / moisty to gather wood and practice building - both defensive (1by1s) and aggressive (double staircases with walls in front of each stair case). Take a few games to really help your muscle memory down. This game isn’t worth playing if you don’t have BASIC building skills. You don’t need to win build fights. You do need to be able to defend yourself.  As said earlier, if you’re shot, just start building, you can med up and peek/run when you’ve got cover.

**For everyone**: Go watch streamers to learn how to edit. It’s tough to learn yourself during fights if you’ve never done it. While the streamers will help you, you also need to just practice it yourself, to get that muscle memory.  This is a helpful visualisation created by u/moshimaster18 (thanks for that!) - https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/84pqns/3x3_editing_will_put_the_pyramid_piece_to_good/

**To defend against grenade launchers** - For defence against grenade launchers(the harder of the two): push. Continue building staircases in front of you while you push, because the closer you get to your opponent who’s shooting them the more ineffective they become(this tip also works when pushing someone with an AR).  Spamming walls won’t work because they’ll eventually take an odd bounce and kill / damage you, additionally, it blocks you from being able to push forwards.  Make sure, when you’re pushing though, that you’re blocked from Ars or sniper shots, so they can’t just laser you.  

**For defence against rocket launchers**: spamming walls tactic. Make sure you’re building walls to your right / left, the splash damage is usually what gets you. RPGs are easily blockable from a distance, its when you get close that they’re an issue.  My advice is to either stick in a tower and try and get some damage, or push hard(next paragraph).  If you’re staying in a tower, remember, they have to peek out to shoot rockets.  You can use this small window to try hit a snipe or some AR shots, which will make them a lot more cautious when peeking again.  


**For defence against rocket launchers**: pushing tactic.  If you choose to push, BUILD,  Splash damage will get you if you are not constantly protecting yourself.  This often means blocking yourself in and editing up.  This is definitely a higher skill move and not one I would advise to newer and less confident players.  Remember, when you are on the floor they will always hit something, the ground, buildings or you.  You want to try and get above them.  Here it is a lot harder for them to hit you, unless they get a direct shot.  At this point, with the high ground, you have the advantage.


**For endgame**: if you down a player in duos / squads, you need to push. If yo aren’t confident, think logically the best option will likely be to push anyway.  Generally, a player will be devoted to reviving, so you’ll be in a 4v2 situation (in squads).  Use this to your advantage, even if you are on low health you will not die instantly, so anyone who goes DBNO can be revived after the fight.  

**How to improve build fight technique** - go watch the replay and see if there was ever a time that you could have snuck in a few AR or shotgun shots. I can guarantee there were a few that you ended up building instead (even though your opponent probably still had their map out). Stop building just to build and be more aggressive. Don’t be afraid to drop down and blow it all out either.  If you are playing a bob the builder/john wick combo, this is probably one of your best options.  

**If you want to get kills/high kill games** – Learn rotations.  Actually, drop tilted.  Then learn rotations.  Seriously, tilted will have the most kills early game in nearly every game.  However, the key to high kill games is rotations.  Look at the storm and work out where people have to run the furthest from, head there are you’ll almost certainly run into people trying to get in from the storm.  Furthering this point, look at the map for yourself, you don’t want to be trapped in the storm.  If this happens, you’re taking damage and also struggling to see anyone watching you.  

My hands hurt from typing this, I’m meant to be revising but good luck to all of you.  I’ll check back in here a bit later with any other tips I can think of.

[Finally, if you want to check out the stream feel free to come by](https://www.twitch.tv/jamieoliver51)! I’m a console player, who knows the theory but doesn’t put it into practice.  However, I have very few people who watch, so anyone who does come in wanting help or advice will have my full attention!  Not going to be streaming today but tomorrow my exams end and I’ll be livestreaming a lot, so will hopefully be able to play with people or help them get better.  Good luck, just tell me if I missed anything!

,Overwatch,"**Disclaimer: I want be very clear that the purpose of this posting is to demonstrate that Blizzard is inconsistent in it's dealings with console consumers. It is not about me personally but the only avenue which I have to demonstrate these inconsistencies is through my own experience. In other words I am not here to debate about whether the silences I have received are justified or not. I am here to expose the fact that Blizzard and it's relationship to Sony (and I assume Microsoft has a similar relationship) exists in a gray area where Overwatch is the exception to every other game on these platforms, and console consumers are pushed aside because we are not the main platform. I am going to illustrate chronologically my dealings with Blizzard as a Playstation platform gamer. My hope is that other console players who feel marginalized by Blizzard, will come and share their experiences so that we can expose our mistreatment and have the Blizzard take notice and do better for us. My viewpoint is that because Blizzard does not own our Playstation Network accounts, they should not put a system in place which is completely automated the way the Overwatch Report system is, and then leave us with sketchy feedback when problems occur on our accounts.**   
**According to Sony, I am a completely clean player with no history of complaints or abuses from other players since the days of the Playstation 3, while according to Blizzard I am a vile, toxic, nasty person deserving of a total forum ban and a 90\+day silencing. I once read that Microsoft has it's own global reputation system, and that after reporting was introduced on that platform Microsoft was forced to rework it to go around Overwatch because reports from Overwatch were so damaging to a lot of players overall reputations. If an Xbox player could verify that I would really appreciate it. My dealings are with Sony, and they have no such system.**   
**Additionally, and a bit of a sidenote,  I purchased the Charity Mercy Skin, and it was only given to my account, though my wife and I share the same machine. In every other Playstation Store purchase the items bought have been attributed to both accounts, so again this is a place where Blizzard is an anomaly.**  
**Now here is what has gone on with me:**  


I am hoping to get some clarity on a situation I’ve experienced with the Playstation 4 version of Overwatch. These are the events that have unfolded, as best as I can recall them.   
 I don’t remember what season it was that the console version of Overwatch received the report system, but I know that I had no problems with the game prior to that happening, and I have never had a history of abuse or toxicity toward other players in the history of my Playstation Network Account, which dates back to the Playstation 3. This was confirmed by Sony on a recent phone call, and I relay this information to you as background of the type of player I am; one who is NOT an abuser. 

However, after the report system was introduced to Overwatch I began experiencing difficulty. The first silence ban I got, I dismissed as a fluke and did not file any kind of appeal, or action as it was very short and not worth the effort. The second one, I did file an appeal and was denied. At this point I became fearful of a three strike policy, so I turned Group Chat, Team Chat, and Match Chat all to off in an effort to avoid a 3rd silencing.   
 Nonetheless a 3rd silencing came anyway, so I wrote to Blizzard explaining that I had set all of the chat functions to off. I also took to the official Blizzard forum with this problem, because this was still early in the console reporting feature’s life and I felt it was being misused or broken. My initial reaction was that I was being targeted as a Gold Border in a low Elo, and I felt that way because younger gamers would see the gold border and have the following reactions:  
1) As a gold border I should be able to carry the games. This resulted in them playing down, and then sometimes filing group reports against me for failing to carry the team.  
2) They thought I was smurfing and would report me for that.   
I know for certain that these scenarios were occuring because these players would state it in the public chat.  That is to say I would have teams of 5 kids agreeing to report “the gold border” all at once.   
 The forum post gained a lot of traction and at one point Scott Mercer appeared. He said that my account had received a number of varied reports; Abusive chat, Throwing games, Poor Team Work, Griefing, etc. If it was in the game I had been reported for it.   
 My take on this was that players were simply selecting “the gold border” and assigning reports at random. Mr. Mercer would later reappear and say that players could recieve abusive chat reports for spamming voicelines. Which seamed contradictory to before when he insisted I was in chat when my abusive chat reports were filed.   
 On the console version of the game players do not have access to keyboard input. It’s common to spam voice lines and healing because we can’t type, not everyone is always in chat, and because in the case of the healing voiceline, it puts an icon over your player so that your healer can locate you more easily. I had taken to setting up my voice lines on some heros to convey messages other than needing healing, for example using Junkrat’s “Brrrng!” line to signify to me team when I’d secured a kill in order to make tracking kills easier. I had some other set ups, but that is one example of how I was using voicelines to communicate. I didn’t spam them but I did make gratuitous use of them to compensate for lack of keyboard options.  
 As that post carried on, people who had not read it’s entirety just started to assume that I was a scumbag player who was abusing my teammates and generally ruining the experience for everyone. This upset me a great deal, and yes, toward the end of it my frustrations with the situation got the better of me and I became less than polite with some of the community members, as well as more bitter and critical of the design team. Eventually resulting in a bann from the official forum boards.   
 This whole thread is still archived on the Blizzard Official forums at this address: [https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759289550?page=7](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759289550?page=7) So you can review it for yourselves there and pass judgment as you please.  
 For those of you playing along at home this was 3 silences deep.  
 After the 3rd silence occurred and following the forum ban. I decided to take a look at myself and assess how I was treating other gamers. My conclusion was that while I was certainly not a toxic or abusive player, I was also not particularly friendly or pleasant. My communication was seldom, short, and consisting of simple callouts. I didn’t exchange small talk or pleasantries with my teammates, as I am mission oriented and quite competitive.   
 I decided to change that, and be overly kind. Nonetheless I received a 4th silencing. This time I knew there was absolutely no way I had mistreated anyone, but I had no proof. So I waited out this fourth silencing which was quite lengthy, and decided that when it ended I would record every game and send that footage to Blizzard should yet another silencing occur.   
 Here is a screen shot of that first filing: [https://ibb.co/fMFofJ](https://ibb.co/fMFofJ)   
 Here is their response: [https://ibb.co/k6kDfJ](https://ibb.co/k6kDfJ)  
[ ](https://ibb.co/k6kDfJ)I apologize for some of the language there, but please understand I was quite frustrated with the situation. They said in this response that they reviewed the case, but when I checked my youtube playlist videos they had either 1 view (myself) or 0 views, so I knew that Blizzard had not actually looked at what I had provided.   
 I reopened the case and begged them to please look at the footage I had submitted. They gave me this response in which they state “after a thorough review of the evidence, we have removed the silence and restored full chat functionality to the account”: [https://ibb.co/hQc9LJ](https://ibb.co/hQc9LJ)  
[ ](https://ibb.co/hQc9LJ)I was, as you could imagine, very very happy, because this meant that I had finally cleared things up, and might be able to prove there was a mistake from the get go, but when I turned on my Playstation 4, the silence ban still persisted, so I too, persisted: [https://ibb.co/m9BGZd](https://ibb.co/m9BGZd)  
[ ](https://ibb.co/m9BGZd)This is where it gets weird. First Blizzard claims they do not have record of my account, and that they do not support the console.  
 Email: [https://ibb.co/gSZ3Ed](https://ibb.co/gSZ3Ed)

Ticket: [https://ibb.co/hiXOEd](https://ibb.co/hiXOEd)  
[ ](https://ibb.co/hiXOEd)Then they say that they did an additional review (of the account they can’t locate, and don’t support?)  and are upholding the silence:  
 Email: [https://ibb.co/n4squd](https://ibb.co/n4squd)  
[ ](https://ibb.co/n4squd)Ticket: [https://ibb.co/bRfAud](https://ibb.co/bRfAud)  
[ ](https://ibb.co/bRfAud)At this point, I decide to just take the loss. The situation looks shady to me, but I’m exhausted with fighting it, and it just doesn’t look like I’m ever going to come out clean, so I accepted defeat at this point and took down all the footage from youtube, which is why I can’t provide it to you unfortunately.   
 However, I was talking to some people on the reddit Overwatch discord last night and they informed me that while they had not had good results with filing support tickets, there was a way to do a live chat. I decided to give it one last go before packing it up. Here is where I get upset. I spent a good bit of my morning rehashing all of this in a live chat with a gamemaster. He is kinda hasty, but says that he will review my case. Few minutes after the voice chat sessions ends I recieve the following email, in which Blizzard Claims the whole interaction in which they said they would originally lift the silence, never occured: [https://ibb.co/c2S9LJ](https://ibb.co/c2S9LJ)  
[ ](https://ibb.co/c2S9LJ)Here is the Ticket History of the Live call: [https://ibb.co/iG077y](https://ibb.co/iG077y)   
 Yet, I have it in great detail through ticket and email, which I have provided throughout the course of this document.  That those interactions definitely did occur. Here is the support ticket history overview: [https://ibb.co/nwmm0J](https://ibb.co/nwmm0J)  
[ ](https://ibb.co/nwmm0J)At this point, I’m just trying to make sense of it all. I maintain that I am not a toxic player, and if you are on the PS4 I can talk to you once we are in a group so you can experience me first hand. I also think there is a serious communication between Blizzard and Sony, and a serious review of the report system as it functions on the PS4 platform is desperately needed. Thank you for your time and help I truly appreciate anyone who took the time to shift through all this.

,LSD,"I'm 18 and I just graduated high school. I can try to describe this experience I had but it's pretty ineffable. So basically during my last trip of ~250mics with my friend Kaden, on this trip we had a sober trip sitter which was helpful for keeping me grounded in reality but he really took care of everything for us I don't know if we would have made it through without being caught without him because my dad called me and I got really paranoid but he calmed me down and talked me out of it. We were sitting there talking and at one point we were realized some of the things we thought we were saying were just thoughts in our own head. somehow the other was able to interpret exactly what you were thinking. It was basically like we were having a conversation just looking at each other. We didn't even notice until our trip sitter said something.

 After that trip I delved deeper into research about psychedelics and ego death and I think it helped me understand it better as it was happening. So during this trip I took 250 and my same friend took 310. He had this movie cued up called Annihilation and it is was super trippy and we think that after watching it was a portrayal of ego death sort of. If you want check it out it was very trippy and I loved it. So watching this movie the visuals are going absolutely insane and we are like wow whoever made this movie definitely knew what it's like to trip. After that we went into his other room with these big comfy chairs with blue neon lights that come out underneath and put on my trippy playlist. This is when shit got crazy and we started to trip very hard. The hardest I ever have. 

The lights on the ceiling and walls were melting into an infinitely moving fractal and the proportions of the room were changing. Like the walls seemed further away. We decided to hit the dab pen because my friend wanted to but I was afraid of what might happen next. But I didn't want to be left on a different ""wavelength"" than my friend after he hit it so I joined. And only a few hits later we started to really go deep. We were talking very loud. It was a lot of nonsense. We were in the room right next to his little brother and Kadens dad came up there and came by and never said a word. And this time my dad didn't call me which is strange because he had every time in the past. We thought it might be a coincidence. And we were like ""who is looking out for me right now man... cause I'm definitely not looking out for myself, but somehow we are fine"" really it's amazing to me that we weren't caught. We started watching some very trippy videos. There was this one that was a ""live ego death narration"" and this is what pushed us over the edge combined with stuff from past trips / research. We started having some telepathy again. We were definitely peaking, I could see the veins in his face pulsating behind his face. And we kinda understood that what I was looking at was just his physical body. But my awareness and his were in the same plane of existence separate from our bodies. We were dumbfounded by this and pondered how it could be possible. And we realized that we were able to understand each other's  thoughts because we originated from the same collective consciousness, we were the same. Because we are all the same. And we originated from the same place. We understood that this world is only temporary and when your physical body dies, your  Ego, your consciousness, that voice inside your head reading this that separates the atoms that make up inanimate objects from the ones that make up you is not limited to this physical plane of existence and you will return to the collective consciousness again.  


And we wondered if you come back as another person, like reincarnation. But we had the realization that since we are all part of the same consciousness that we had already been reincarnated. We began to feel a oneness with not only all of the other humans on earth but everything in the entire universe. We were every person who had ever lived or was going to live simultaneously. Then we watched a video called a ""live ego death narration"" by Psyched Substance and this is when we really hit ego death.

 In the video he urged us to just ""let go""... And I was afraid of what would happen. But I listened because this narration was very well done and I recommend watching it next time you trip. We let go. In this moment we no longer were our physical selves but just our consciousness. This is when we had the true realization that everything really is one and there is more to life than we really know. We immediately felt something like a higher power, something spiritual, something almost god like. And we realized that was within us all along. In the video he said ""when you let go you can truly realize that you are the one steering the sails of the ship"" and basically we understood that we controlled our destiny (or something like that). That we were all collectively god. That when ""whoever made this movie totally knew"" it was because we made that movie. We realized this whole time the one who ""looking out"" for our physical bodies was ourselves. We saw the reflection of our humanity in everything and everyone. Past present and future. 

It was a really indescribable revelation that I'm not doing the best description of. It was such an oddly familiar feeling, like I already knew all of this but I was just being reminded of it. We realized there was a part of ourselves in everything and everyone even the people and things we didn't like. It was like being able to understand things from the viewpoint of every individual on the planet. And that we are all the same just trying to make our way on this journey that is life. I feel like I will treat other people very differently after this because I see myself in them.

 We talked about the golden rule ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"" and how it made much more sense. Because the other person is you. And we knew that every person would eventually come to realize this by dying or by taking psychedelic drugs. They would be revealed the secret that we are all one.

But we aren't sure if you come back as spirits in nature (many people report seeing faces in nature especially on shrooms) or just exist infinitely in the collective consciousness or maybe both. We kept asking each other how we were going to be able to return to our lives with this burden of knowledge. Then we realized that we had it done before. In every ego death that has ever happened, in every death that has ever happened, because we are all one. So we didn't worry about it because we got a glimpse into the inner workings of the universe and we knew that the beings in the collective consciousness would help guide us when we stopped tripping because those beings were us just in another form.

 The universe around you is a reflection of yourself and I think that is the biggest thing I took away from this experience. The way you choose to live will effect the way the world around you is and not vice versa. It was an absolute mindfuck. We were listening to Comfortably Numb by Pink Floyd when they sang the line 

""When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone"" 

and I thought about an interview I heard with Roger Waters the man who wrote the lyrics talking about his 1st LSD trip. He said ""I've heard people say oh I dropped acid and went to a party or a club, and I thought oh not the acid I took you didn't "" I realized those lyrics were an attempt at representing the ego death he experienced on his trip and I thought how could I know this and then was again struck with the realization that it was because we are all the same. Everyone will know that feeling or already does. It was absolutely insane and I probably left some stuff out but this is the best i can describe what happened to me. I will also include some images that's try to convey ego death that I recalled seeing before experiencing it. 


Who knows maybe I'm just some crazy guy on drugs and so is my friend.

,RocketLeague,"So decided to play some ranked today. Standard, Doubles and Solo Duel all Diamond. I left Solo Standard unranked because I thought it wasn't worth my time. Played my placements for Solo Standard, gone through them quick. Surprisingly, there were no toxic players and teams were pretty good in the Platinum/Diamond range. Somehow won all my placements and placed at Diamond 3 Division 3. This is my highest rank ever, so decided to push for Champion because why not. I played and every SINGLE person in the lobby was so mechanically and positionally good. No hesitation from any of them and they were just insanely quick. I thought I was good enough to get to Champion in standard and doubles etc, but as soon as I played that game, I realized I have a whole lot of steps ahead of me. Thankfully, my team were amazing and supportive, and we were able to make some good plays with me being the Torment like player (third man). We win the game, and somehow I jump 3 divisions and reach Champion 1 Div 2, my goal for so long. Lessons to be learned here, never think you're good enough for a rank because you can always improve, no matter how much you improve, it always helps.

,nosleep,"When I woke, I had the urge to go to the sea.  It was like a thirst.  Over the day my mind wandered, obsessed with the thought.  Visions intruded my mind.  I saw the water glittering like brilliant diamonds, the waves lapping against the shore.  I was mesmerised.  The image was so crystal clear, the clarity so much more intense than a normal dream.  I couldn't shift it. I wondered if it was related to the sushi I ate the day before.

It reminded me of childhood vacations; a sense of joy, a sense of belonging.  I wanted to be there.  However, I'd not even entertained the thought of going to the beach in my whole adult life.  I hadn't so much as seen the ocean in the last ten years.  But now, it's all I wanted to do. 

I sat down at the breakfast table and ate cereal.  I found myself staring at the cheerios that floated in the milk.  I dunked them down with my spoon, transfixed on the miniature ripples that appeared.  I was in a daze.  I forced myself to finish, but the cereal was now soggy and fell apart.

I messaged my best friend, Alex.  I told him about the weird *dream* I had.  As you'd expect when you re-tell a dream to someone, he was distracted and feigned interest. 

The apprehension first presented as mild anxiety, a knot that twisted my intestines, as brief as a tap on the shoulder.  I tried my best to ignore it.  I went into the garage and got onto my exercise bike, it always made me feel better when I was stressed.  I cycled hard, though the strange feelings didn't relent.

I put on my headphones and selected a hard rock playlist from Spotify.  I felt the sweat begin to seep out of my pores and my heart rate increased.  Then the familiar feeling of *the zone* enveloped me.  Instantly I felt calmer.  The music began to sooth.  The calm sounds of water lapping.  It was so relaxing.  It wasn't the sounds that made me twig, it was my heart rate on the display, 65 BPM.  I was peddling vigorously, though my heart showed I was relaxed.

I ripped out my earbuds.  The friction of the electromagnet wheezed and my legs relented.  I watched as my heart rate increased alarmingly fast.  I leaped off the bike when it hit 205 BPM.  I held my hand to my chest, it felt like I was about to have a heart attack.

I caught my breath, though the anxiety from earlier grew into panic.  I got in the shower.  My hands shook as I turned the knob.  The ice cold water made me jump, though I was soon soothed by the sound of water hissing out of the shower head and the tricking as the liquid dripped off my body and down the plughole.  The panic receeded.

It was early evening, I was on edge again, so I sat down in front of the TV to watch a film.  I tried to ignore the restlessness that had plagued me all day.  I noticed my attention had wandered and I was staring at my phone, confused to be watching a video of a calm lapping ocean, the sounds of the sea gently pacifying that disquiet in my stomach.  I continued to watch, feeling the urge relent.  Endorphins swam around my skull and I felt high.

I pressed back and saw I had searched for *""tranquil ocean""*.  I was concerned, I had no recollection of doing this.  I peered up at the TV to see the movie had ended, the Netflix screen offered me options to watch next.  I got up to get a drink.  I was startled to see it was already dark outside.  I checked my phone again, it was 9:30pm.  My battery was almost flat.  I began to panic.  I must have been watching that video for hours.

I checked my YouTube history to see that I'd viewed over thirty different ocean related clips, some barely for seconds before I'd apparently settled on the last one.

My panic was interrupted by a instant message from Alex.

*Sure, I'll go with you to the beach.  9:30 is a little late, but okay.  It will be nice.  I'll see you then.*

Before I could check the rest of his messages, the doorbell rang.   I knew who it was.  At first I was reluctant to answer, in the hope he would think it was a ruse, some joke I had played on him.  I stood in silence, that knot in my stomach now twisting so hard I felt compelled to open the door.  The bell rang out again, and I answered it.

""Hey, I didn't think you were in!""

""I'm in,"" I said.

""Are you ready to go?"" Alex asked.

""Sure,"" I replied, ""let me get dressed.""

***

""You've been quiet,"" Alex said as he peered over at me from the driver's seat.

I opened my eyes and was shocked to see we were on the freeway.

""How long have we been driving?""  I asked.

""Are you sure you're okay, man?  You've been weird all day.""

I rapidly scanned the environment, trying to work out where we were.

""Where are we going?""

""Dude, you drunk?""

""No, seriously!""

""Where you wanted to go.  You sent me the link.  It's not the nearest beach, but I hear you, it's the nicest.""

I took out my phone to see the battery was dead.  I sighed.

""How long left?""

""We're just about there,"" he said, taking the off ramp.

The dark ocean, to our right, glistened in the moonlight and I was in awe.

""I never knew you liked the sea so much, you should have said.  We could have gone surfing together.""

I didn't respond.  I stared at the flecks of light that fluttered on the oily black water.

We pulled up and got out.  It was silent except for the reassuring sound of the water breaking against the sand.  Without thinking, I took off my clothes.

""Man, I don't want to see that!""  Alex pleaded.

I stripped to my underwear, to see I was wearing speedos.  The ones I wore when I was a kid.  They were so tight, they didn't leave much to the imagination.  And I ran.

""Are you sure you haven't been drinking?  You're not supposed to swim if you have,"" Alex said concerned.

I didn't listen.  I made a beeline for the ocean.  My legs moved like the wind as I felt the soft sand mingle with my feet.  I was entranced.  The water splashed when I met the sea.  I hurried forward, that thirst being quenched.  I was where I belonged.  I didn't know why, and I didn't question it.  The water level rose and I pushed forward as far as I could until I needed to swim; and I swam.

The water was cold, though it felt right.  I reached forward with my hands, each stroke as intense as the last, thrashing my feet as fast as they would go.  It was as if I was about to climax, urged on by a primeval need, a lust to be at my destination.  I stopped and treaded water.  I turned to see I was a few hundred yards out.  My breathing heavy, my arms and legs burning from adrenaline.

I searched around, wondering what I was supposed to do next.  Alex shouted for me from the shore.  Though I couldn't hear a word he said over the sounds of me thrashing in the water.

Something caressed my leg, as if looking for permission.  I didn't jerk away.  It took the invitation, a tendril wrapped around my ankle.  I felt it tug.  I didn't fight back, I went with it.  Another clasped my other foot, and slowly I submerged.  The dim moonlight faded as I was dragged deeper into the depths of the water.  My lungs relaxed and my last breath escaped.  I felt high.  I wasn't scared to die.  It was where I belonged.

***

""Dude!"" I heard from a voice I recognised.

I opened my eyes.

""You scared the shit out of me!""

Alex's face glared back, though I was distracted by the bright stars that filled the night sky.

""I thought you drowned for sure.  The ambulance is on it's way.""

I became aware that I was lying on my back on the sand.  Water lapped against my head, and I tried to stand.

""Don't get up!  You've been unconscious for ten minutes.""

""I'm fine,"" I said, pushing myself to my feet.

And I was fine.  More than fine.  I felt great.

I staggered up the beach, with each step feeling more and more alive than I'd ever felt before.

""Dude!"" Alex shouted from behind me.

""Look, there's nothing wrong with me,"" I said, twirling around as if I was showing off a new suit.

""Fuck you!"" he said, and he stormed past me, towards the car.

I reached the edge of the beach and picked up my clothes.  Not bothered I was covered in sand, I dressed.

""Can we go now?""  I asked.

""Give me a minute,"" he said, taking out his phone.

Irritatedly he spoke to an emergency dispatcher, telling them to cancel the ambulance.  He made his apologies, got in the car and slammed the door.  I took my seat and sat in silence.

""If they charge me for the dispatch, you're paying for it,"" he said, as the tires screeched.

We didn't say much on the drive back.  We stopped outside my house.

""Thank you,"" I said and got out.

I was almost back to the house when he opened his window.

""Hey!""

I turned.

""I don't know what's going on with you.  But please tell me if there is anything to worry about.""

""I promise,"" I replied and unlocked the front door.

I laid in bed.  For the first time since I was a child I wasn't worried about anything.  I was one with the world.     Briefly I coughed and sat up.  I continued coughing until a salty taste filled my mouth, and a small quantity of sea water spilled down my chest.

I caught my breath, and made my way to the ensuite to clean up.  I towelled off the water and took a drink from the tap.  The water tasted disgusting, something was missing.  Odd.

I returned to bed and closed my eyes.  My mind was blank.  Though something called to me, in a language I didn't recognise, but I understood.  I heard it from all around.  Different voices, all in the same dialect.  I was falling asleep.  Though the voices called out.

I responded.

*Hello* I said, in the language I didn't recognise, but knew innately.  For a moment there was a silence.  Then hundreds of voices responded in kind.  I smiled, feeling like I belonged.  Then I craved something.

Salt water.

,anime,"**Anime:** Aikatsu!

**Links:** [MAL](https://myanimelist.net/anime/15061/Aikatsu?q=aikatsu) | [Anilist](https://anilist.co/anime/15061/Aikatsu/) | [Anime-Planet](https://www.anime-planet.com/anime/aikatsu) | [Kitsu](https://kitsu.io/anime/aikatsu)

**Type:** TV (178 episodes)

**Genres:** Music, School, Shoujo, Slice of Life

**Legal Sites:** Sadly none, but it has some of the best fansub quality I have seen thanks to Mezashite.


**Introduction**

Aikatsu is a series that I started due to a friend spamming screenshots of it that had me like “hey, this looks pretty good, but damn, 178 episodes? So lazy...” and that's what I kept saying until the day I finally gave it the chance, and boy I sure didn't expect it to become of my favorite anime ever! I hope this WT thread can convince you to give it a chance as well!


**What is Aikatsu?**

Just in case [hearing Ichigo's giggle at the start of each episode](https://streamable.com/hkb5v) is not convincing enough to start it right now, let's talk about what Aikatsu is! [(Other than everything).](https://i.imgur.com/XwO6xTD.png)

Aikatsu is a series set in a school that has as objective training idols to make them reach stardom. This includes seeing the characters practice for concerts, facing problems and how they improve thanks to them, and seeing them participate in idol-related activities like TV programs, firming autographs (and all the awesome moments that come from seeing fans interacting with them) or being actresses in movies/TV dramas among others things. This gives a very solid variety to the series and together with the nice comedy coming from the cast makes each episode so enjoyable to watch.

It's worth saying that this anime has zero fanservice and has quite a lighthearted tone compared to others from the idol genre. Outside of some unique (and greatly executed) moments, the drama is never particularly big, being “rivals” is another way to say great friends to improve with, and damn if it's wholesome, it's hard to not smile all the time watching this! That doesn't mean that Aikatsu doesn't have emotional moments though, instead it actually delivers the hardest when it comes to payoff when seeing the characters succeeding and taking a step towards their dreams.


**Becoming a star and inspiring future idols**

A big theme of the series is finding the inspiration for a dream thanks to another person, with the own protagonist at the start of the series, Ichigo, being clueless about what she wanted to be until she was invited to the concert of the most popular idol of the moment [and was so impressed](https://i.imgur.com/EIl0l1g.png) with her performance that she wanted to become one as well.

This is something that will happen many times in the future as we  see the characters grow and how they end up inspiring the next students that join the school as the years pass with their actions (yes,  years pass as the series progresses, leading to more focus on new characters progressively). That is such a satisfying feeling because we don't see the characters just in the “getting good” phase, but further than that.


**Dances and CGI**

As it's to be expected of a long length series that has a dance scene (or more) in the majority of the episodes, Aikatsu uses CGI animation for them and, being honest, they don't look too good at first, *but* [that changes fast with the pass of the episodes](https://i.imgur.com/UGI9kQj.jpg) to the point they look fantastic, for some examples, here are (visual spoilers for the characters who dance) [Episode 71](https://youtu.be/P7Rz2uZUnQk?t=1m) and [Episode 110](https://youtu.be/oimrIRFZnrg?t=50s), and they only keep getting better!



**Characters**

- [Ichigo Hoshimiya](https://i.imgur.com/6NLqNr9.gif), a cheerful girl with a heart of gold, absurdly likeable and [a big eater](https://i.imgur.com/LAbPv5T.gif), and damn if she can be badass too, nothing stops her!

- [Aoi Kiriya](https://i.imgur.com/LVIQYAO.gif), a total expert when it comes to idols, she's more of the cool type and combinates so well with Ichigo, who is her childhood friend.

- [Ran Shibuki](https://i.imgur.com/HEdDek1.gif) closes the main trio with a more mature personality, she has been working as a model since she was younger and is praised for her style.

This is really just an introduction to the main trio, between the other idols who get the spotlight (who are a lot), the designers of the brands each idol uses, Ichigo's family, and all the other characters who have chances to shine, the cast becomes really big, but it's done in a well paced way and each character has a nice personality and actions that makes them stay memorable. And I haven't even talked of best teacher [Johnny Bepp](https://i.imgur.com/sa1rOCA.gif) yet, [yeah!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0IxMo0wiM&amp;ab_channel=stardustStudio.)



**Looks interesting, but I really can't handle the length, is there any other option?**

Well, you're lucky because **[Aikatsu Friends](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37204/Aikatsu_Friends)** started this season and is giving me the same great vibes as the original! Definitely worth a try to see if Aikatsu appeals to you.

Each entry of the Aikatsu franchise is separated from the others so you can start from any point, this includes **[Aikatsu Stars](https://myanimelist.net/anime/32717/Aikatsu_Stars?q=aikatsu)** (100 episodes) which sadly I can't say anything about since, well, I will be starting it tonight! Look forward for a WT! of that one in the future if I end up loving it as much as the original.


**In conclusion**

Do you like following lovable characters and seeing them grow over time in their journey to fulfill their dreams, inspiring future generations to do the same? Do you like great dance scenes with music that you will most likely add to your playlist to listen to again? Do you want to feel awful when you realize that you're halfway through the series and you don't want to see it end of how much fun you're having watching it? Well, Aikatsu is just what you're looking for! 

I hope this post gives you the push needed to watch this anime in the future, as Aoi would say, it's really something special!

,Askme4astory,"Just saw this got deleted somehow, not sure what happened there, I'll repost it. 

More and more people were arriving in Central Park all the time, must have hundreds of people now. I wanted to ask Mick how many were there but he was way over by the entrance on his horse. Celebrities were arriving as well, more all the time. Justin Timberlake was there, Chance the Rapper had arrived, Aaron Judge and a bunch of Yankees guys, which, fuck those guys, Im never going to cheer for anything Yankees, ever but still, it was good support. Jimmy Fallon was there with his house band the Roots, Dave Chapelle was there, even JayZ had arrived. It was starting to become a star-studded affair. Bon Iver was the only one I wanted to talk to because they were the first ones that collaborated with On December 31st I Die and they were the one that put Ryan on the map. I wanted to ask how they knew it would become big and who wrote that song and what the collaboration was like but I knew they had signed a non-disclosure. Plus it would be disresptectful to Ryan. That was the only thing I wanted to see here, respect for Ryan until song two could be given our full attention. But song two wasn’t coming. And all we could do was wait.

The thing about waiting is that no one knows how to do it anymore. You don’t wait to find out what happens in a sitcom, you just binge three seasons on Netflix. You don’t wait for someone to call you back, you just keep texting them until they let you know. Waiting is a lost art. We want everything now, especially information when we have all the answers on our ubiquitous phones. There used to be a time when we would just have to wait until we got an answer. If you were wondering who won the World Series in 1980 you couldn’t immediately find out sometimes. I knew it was the Phillies of course but that was because my dad used to play that with me when he was driving the tractor and I was riding right next to him. Up and down that field we would go back and forth, late on a Saturday, finishing the fields before the sun went down. Watching the crimson red Kansas sun through the windshield on a tractor, there was no place I wanted to be in the world than right there with my dad. 

79 he would say. Pirates, Willie Stargell, We are Family! 88 my dad would say. It was an easy one, we watched every Series game that year together, one of the earliest in my memory and the to this day still my favorite (besides the Royals wins of course). My dad and I bonded over baseball like nothing else. Sometimes it was the only way to get him to talk. Tell me about the double switch I would ask him. I knew exactly what the double switch entailed of course, more than any sixth grade girl in the whole state I would wager. I just wanted to get him to talk. He loved me of course but he was always inside of some shell it seemed like. I think the war does that to you. When he was young he loaded bombs onto planes in the Philippines and it was only when he got back and saw on TV the devastation that he realized what the bombs were used for. Whole villages and moms and babies, the bombs he put on planes had been used to kill civilians, and the world had watched it unfurl. You were just a young man, you had no idea I heard my mom tell him but it didn’t matter, he still carried the shame and he still hid out in his shell. But baseball would bring him out of that shell. 88 he said, just because he liked to hear me say it. Sax is on deck, I would say in my best Vin Scully voice, but the game right now is at the plate. 3-2. High fly ball to right field SHE….IS……GONE. I would be standing up in the cab of the tractor by then, pumping my left arm only and pretending to limp on my bad knees fake running around 1st like Kirk Gibson. 


My dad would laugh along and I would yell out 1951! Ah the Shot Heard Round the World! he would say. My dad also loved hearing the old announcers call the games. We were both connoisseurs of great baseball calls. Hold the wheel he would say and he would stand up in the tractor and pretend to be excited talking into the microphone. Bobby Thompson takes a strike call on the inside corner, my dad said in an old-timey voice that made me laugh. But then he got serious, he leaned into his fake microphone as I held the tractor straight but it was barely moving now, we were too focused on one upping each other with our play by play call from memory. Bobby hitting at .292 my dad continued. Branca throws. Theres a long fly ITS GONNA BE I BELIEVE….THE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT THE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT THE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT! My dad was jumping up and down then, mimicking the players and coaches going crazy and throwing their hats and jumping around. It was a great call, one that I used to do out back in the fields by myself, just throw my softball glove up in the air, THE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT, THE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT!  It wasn’t my favorite but it was number three behind Gibsons and Ozzie Smiths Home Run in 1985. My dad would do that one too and yell GO CRAZY FOLKS GO CRAZY! Out of his shell indeed! I missed my dad so much, I would do anything now, absolutely anything to go back and just spend one more day on the farm with him. I wouldn’t even have to talk, we wouldn’t even need to talk baseball or designated hitters ( he hated them) or life or anything, just one more day with my dad in the cab of the tractor, his arm around me, our tractor facing West, watching the sun go down together one last time.

Apparently everyone was okay with waiting for Ryan’s song except for one group, Vampire Weekend. They started moving around on stage to everyone’s surprise and started plugging in their amps and guitars like they were going to start playing. Oh they fuckin better not do what I think they are doing! Becca said, way too loud. We were on stage too but they seem to continue nonplussed. We are going to play a little while we wait, said the lead singer. We have another gig tonight so we wanted to show support before we have to take off. Just the way he said gig made something snap inside me, as if I could hate this band anymore. Oh fuck this shit said Becca, fuck it right to hell! Shhh I said, Jesus, he can hear you, he’s like 15 feet away. This doesn’t bother you at all? After everything they did to you? Becca asked me. Eh, let’s see how this plays out. For some reason it didn’t seem like an affront to me. It just seemed like I was watching this from the back seat of a cab. I didn’t really have too much control, so I was okay with watching it all unfold in front of me. I was pretty sure I heard a few boos when he said another gig but maybe that was just my internal projections. But I definitely heard boos from what came next. Our album is finally done! Said the lead singer. Last year we told you we were 80% done. In June this year we told you we were 94% done, I know it has been a long time since then but there were bumps in the road and now we are 100%. He said it so upbeat, like he actually believed these people there were here to see him. That’s the thing about narcissism I guess, its all about yourself, yourself, and yourself, oh and don’t forget yourself! I couldn’t control myself anymore. He was up there promoting his new album to a group of people worried to death someone might have died. BOOOOOO I screamed out. BOOOOOO! Becca started laughing and she joined along with me and Ezra stopped and looked right at us. He seemed confused as to what was happening. Suddenly thousands of people started booing as well. God damn it that felt good. I wasn’t just booing for their corporate push, I was booing for all corporations jamming their product down our throats. I was booing for my disillusionment, for a life that had passed me by, for me not being the beautiful person I used to be, for mean people at my office that had snitched that it was my voice, I was booing at Thomas and his terrible family and I was booing at everything that had gone wrong in my life. And it felt cathartic as fuck.

I had always hated corporations pushing things off on me. Diamond rings and frappuccino machines and vacation packages and new albums. I can only think of one marketing push I ever remember liking, and even that turned out bad. Iowa you make me smile. That was the slogan for Iowa when I was finishing up high school and it was everywhere, plastered on billboards and on the Royals games and in brochures, we couldn’t get away from it. Pretty soon we just embraced it. Something about little Iowa wanting to get our attention. I wanted nothing to do with Iowa of course. I wanted to go to LA or New York and do acting and modeling but until I had a plan I decided to go to school at a tiny college called Northeast Missouri State University, at least for one year. The school was very close to the Iowa border. 
Whenever someone was from Iowa we would say, oh Iowa, you make me smile! Then one Saturday we all said, you know what, we should go to Iowa, and see if all those billboards are true. So six of us piled into Johnnys beat up Chevy Cavalier and drove the hour stretch from Kirksville to Iowa. When we got there, it was barren icy cold and desolate. Exactly. Like a desert plain only missing the tumbleweeds, except freezing and cloudier and more wind, and a sideways kind of freezing rain snow, just bleak and barren as shit.
There was one small sign that said Welcome to Iowa. On the sign someone had spray painted out Iowa and wrote ""Nothing."" Welcome to Nothing. We just parked the car right there on the road, there were no cars for miles and miles. Then we jumped out of the car and screamed at the top of our lungs.
Come on Iowa, make me smile!
You said you would make me smile Iowa, DO IT! FUCKIN DO IT!
It didn't work. We collapsed exhausted back into the Cavalier and turned back and drove the hour back in silence. We were not mad at a state so much but our lives in general, how we were told over and over what would make us happy. A phone. A trip. A University degree. Salaries. Engagement rings. We knew it was all bullshit. All as empty and void as Iowa itself.

Never had a marketing push came out worse than this one though. One band on stage talking about their new album while 3 quarters of a million people mourn another band’s possible death. We kept booing as loud as we could and eventually they just put down their guitars and walked away. Good, fuck that shit I said to Becca. She started chanting FUCK THAT SHIT, FUCK THAT SHIT, FUCK THAT SHIT and the whole crowd chanted along. We chanted for Ryan who wasn’t a corporate sell-out, who made music for the right reasons. And that is when song 2 game out, people stopped chanting and started talking to each other, then holding their phones up above their heads and shouting. We all looked at our Spotify playlists. Every single song that had ever been released by On December 31st I Die was just a number- 45 down to 3. But todays, today was different. Today it said 2 (Revised). Why would there be words there, and in parenthesis no less. It looked so strange. After a million times in 44 days of seeing numbers only, there was a word there. I ran up to the podium and decided to get one more dig in, seemed apropos for what we had just witnessed. Ladies and Gentleman, Vampire Weekend! I yelled mockingly. They were gone of course, having already scurried off with their tail between their legs and gone on to their next “gig” I guess. Fuck that band anyway. Everyone booed one last time and it felt just as cathartic as the first time we booed. Okay listen people, listen, I said and got them all to stop booing. I just received word that Ryan has released a new song! A deafening ovation shook the crowd. He was still alive at least, that’s all we could know for now but it felt good. And he was still releasing music. What do you think, I said, should we give it a listen? It struck me as odd that I was the one leading this whole bizarre scene. Maybe this was my chance to be Vin Scully, announcing batters stepping up to the plate. I wish I had that buttery voice. I wish my dad could see me on the microphone, leading these hundreds of thousands of people with just my voice. Everyone went crazy at the suggestion of course, his music was the reason we were here. Well lets hear some music, I yelled, taken aback by my own newfound stage presence and bravado, and loving every minute of it!

,DestinyTheGame,"Now that our first Faction Rally of Season 3 is coming to a close, I think we can all agree that there are some issues. Many of these could be made more engaging with a few simple tweaks. 

Let’s talk about three issues. The grind. The activities. And faction pledging.


The Grind

Issue: Faction Rally is a sprint that lasts for one week, with no long term investment. 

Goal: Faction Rally should be an exciting event, incentivizing players to play more during the event. But factions should still provide an engaging experience day in and day out of Destiny.

Solution: Allow players to earn faction consumables at any time, from most activities. Faction consumables are earned towards the faction you pledged to during the last Rally. Make rewards (I.e. catalysts) take double the rank to obtain. Rank 100 is your new goal.

During Faction Rally renown should be active in patrol. And to really drive home the point of the event, ALL sources of tokens are doubled. Meaning if you were able to hit rank 50 in this Rally, you’d also have hit the rank 100 goal. If you’re not able to grind much this week, you can still make progress through the other weeks.


The Activities

Issue: Patrol is very effective, but gets boring. Other activities aren’t rewarding enough. 

Goal: Match time investment and risk/reward. Incentivize players to play different game modes and still be rewarded.

Solution: Add a streak mechanic that increases the number of tokens rewarded based on how many activities you’ve completed there. Vanguard streaks were fun on strike playlists for Destiny 1. You could also reward win streaks in crucible with more tokens. And give out faction tokens for daily challenges that you’ve completed in all modes. 


Faction Pledging

Issue: Guardians feel “forced” into choosing a faction they don’t like for all their characters, or miss out on good catalysts. 

Goal: Pledging to a faction should be a meaningful choice. Provide unique rewards for each faction. Allow guardians to choose which faction they pledge loyalty to. 

Solution: When you hit your “goal” rank (100 in this example), provide a choice for the catalyst you want. You could buy either Sunshot, Graviton Lance, or Sweet Business. This incentivizes the grind, but doesn’t force people into a faction they dislike. The “brand name” faction weapons, armor, and shaders are enough reward to push people to one faction or another. If the goal is to make your faction pledge matter, a reward that pushes people to all 3 factions each season is counter to that choice being meaningful, you’ll be visiting all 3 anyway. 


TLDR; Factions should be a meaningful part of everyday destiny. The Faction Rally event should be a more rewarding time, but not the only time they matter. They should reward you more for game modes other than patrol. And faction rewards should be incentivizing, but not limit exotic weapon catalysts to just one faction, instead giving us a choice of which catalyst to buy from any faction.

,shrooms,"Just a little background; two weeks prior to this experience my cousin and I embarked on a 2.5g journey and although it was enlightening in some ways, it was a little underwhelming and left us craving for more intensity and depth.

My cousin came over at 6pm on Saturday and we meticulously prepared our playlist for the evening. At 8pm I prepared the tea and while it was cooling down, we decided that we needed to do some soothing yoga to ease our minds: seeing that the 2.5g had produced a much stronger effect than the previous batch of shrooms, we were somewhat anxious about taking 3.5g. 

Once the yoga was done, our minds were at ease and so it began. We divided the tea into two cups and proceeded to drink it all in one go. I have heard many people suggest to drink it slowly over the course of 30\-45min as to not have the tea hit you like a ton of bricks; however from our experience that is rather difficult to do as nausea sets in rather fast and so it becomes unbearable to keep drinking.

Having drank the tea, we decided we would roll a couple of joints to pass the time since normally you only start feeling pronounced effects after 30min or so. After having only rolled the first joint, we quickly realised that we were in for something very intense. Only 10 min had passed and yet our fingers had turned into uncoordinated jelly. I looked around and saw that everything was beginning to breath. I remember a part of me repeating the words “fuck me, what have you guys done?” while simultaneously feeling the thrill of adventure one feels when gladly embarking on a perilous journey. At this point my cousin, who normally has the stronger stomach, begins to feel intense nausea. So I suggested that we go for a walk in my garden to distract ourselves while we waited for the nausea to pass. It didn’t help at all!!! We just kept getting higher and higher while feeling sicker and sicker. This tea hit us with the intensity of a fully loaded freight train. Nothing was going to stop this onslaught. 

Once we had won the battle with nausea and knew we would no longer vomit we went to lay down in my bedroom with the lights on. At this point my cousin just closed his eyes and became unresponsive. He would later tell me that he had very had blasted off into a world of CEV’S and completely disconnected from his body. Meanwhile I laid in bed for the next hour alone. I remember feeling intense heat and energy. It was making my body feel uncomfortable and I could not stop focusing on that as I looked around the room. Things were beginning to really move at this point. The room took on a somewhat orange glow and lights and shadows began the eternal dance of mingling and mind fucking. The offensive the shrooms began on my senses was leaving me feeling overwhelmed and somewhat confused. I did not know what to focus on, the immensely beautiful visuals or the extreme discomfort I was feeling. I always said I absolutely hate the come up as its just a terrible feeling going from sober to breaking into the psychedelic space. But then again I gladly accept it as all the great things in life do not come easy, and so the come up as I see it, is the price of admission to enter this very niche and exclusive CLUB.

After battling the come up for about an hour I realised that all physical discomfort had disappeared and we had made it into the psychedelic space! Euphoria and intense energy were building up in my mind and body! I was feeling amazing! My cousin had finally awoken and he too was feeling the same. For the next 10 minutes or so we were laughing so hard and jumped around like fully grown kids with ADHD. It was amazing! But as the saying goes, it is all fun and games until someone dies. And the laughter quickly turned into shock and awe….well more like shell shock really! I distinctly remember when that happened; it was when I opened the door of my room to the hallway about 75min after drinking the tea. That is when I realised that the dose we took was way past recreational and this was serious territory. Everything was ablaze with the energy of the fungus, moving, breathing, morphing, expanding, multiplying into infinity. Never up to that point, in any of the 30 trips, had I ever felt overwhelmed, but this day was different. It was like I had gotten into a fight with Mike “the mushroom” Tyson. The fungus had hit me with an uppercut that left me feeling extremely off\-balance and absolutely overwhelmed. My mind was a CPU that had just fried, I had become the dreaded Windows blue screen of death. I was no longer me, I was water, I was everything and yet nothing. I quickly realised that I was unable to form thoughts, unable to keep up, unable to adjust….UNABLE TO ANYTHING!!!!! And so I retreated back into the room only to find that Lolo was rolling around in the bed because he too was overwhelmed. 

Here we were…..like the Robinson’s, lost in space….. the space of our minds. At some point I remember my girlfriend had come back home and I saw her opening the door. Her face was shifting colours, she had turned into a cosmic cartoon character. One that brought me immense relief. I asked her to hug me. Her touch was so profoundly reassuring, it felt like a lifeline thrown to you after you having fallen overboard in icy waters. I kept repeating 2.5, 2.5……..2.5 what she says? We should have done 2.5…….3.5 is just so much…. I can’t. I don’t know anymore. Not wanting to worry her I said we would be ok and told her to go. I then managed to crawl next to my cousin who by then was on the carpet behind the bed and laid down next to him. It was at this point that I realised that unlike acid, there is no fighting mushrooms, there is no guiding them. They drag you along for the ride. And so I decided to close my eyes and stop trying to make sense of anything. If you have seen the movie get out, that part when she hypnotises him and locks him into his own mind is such a perfect example of how it felt. The second I closed my eyes I began to fall backwards into the depth of my own mind…. I was falling into a tunnel that was never ending, a tunnel of light, colour, creatures, shapes, form, death, life….. I was no longer myself. I was no longer human. I was everything and nothing at the same time. But after an unknown amount of time, I realised that through all this, not once had I felt fear. On the contrary, I was feeling profound love from the fungus….. All this was not to scare me, this was not malicious….. this was just its way of getting me onboard with the program. And so I decided that I would just spend the evening as an observer who would be guided by this infinitely old mushroom spirit.

That is when I opened my eyes. We were no longer overwhelmed even though it was just as visually intense as ever. We were back in control of our bodies and feeling so at peace. We went downstairs to light the joint. I remember walking down the two flights of stairs and at the time they looked like they were infinitely long. It was as if my room was on top of a skyscraper and the living room was the basement parking lot. It felt like it took forever to get there. But once we did we puffed and puffed away! This began to intensify everything again, but this time having relinquished all thoughts of control, and having decided to just be observers, it was no longer scary. It was absolutely beautiful and as we laid on the floor we listened and watched the house. It had become alive with a spirit of its own, it danced and jived, it was a little rascal with a twisted humour.

From there we decided it was time to listen to music. And so we went back into the room, turned off the light, hit play on the speaker system and laid down on the carpet. That is when one of the most beautiful and profound moments of my life began. 

As the music played, I realised that the sounds were becoming a part of me. I wasn’t a human listening to songs, I was each song. I couldn’t differentiate were sounds were coming from anymore. As I laid there on the floor I couldn’t tell whether my eyes were open or closed. Music was flowing everywhere and I ceased to exist, there was no longer a me, there was no past, no future, there was only the absolute immediate presence. I was just a consciousness who could experience life on a second to second basis. I travelled in and out of my mind for an eternity as time literally stood still. I was a screen saver for the mushroom overlords and happily so.

After an unknown amount of time I came back and was back in control of myself. I was me again. But not just any me, I was me in a deep trance…. I felt raw…Tribal, aboriginal. And as the music kept on playing I began to move uncontrollably in the most deeply erotic and primal ways. It was art, it was humanity, it was soul…. it was how music is meant to be listened and responded to — on the deepest level. I saw that my cousin was still laying on the floor and so I laid on top of him to just tell him that I love him. As I told him I loved him I closed my eyes and my soul was beginning to merge with his. I no longer felt like myself, I was feeling like US, we were both part of the very same consciousness. And that is when the thought dawned on me that as humans, we always assume that it is I, ME, THE INDIVIDUAL…. but it really is not. It is US…you may be yourself, but you belong to others, you belong to the collective, you belong to the world and this universe. And so you have no right to feel alone, because you are not, being alone is a choice… somewhere out there exists your future friends and family, and it is up to you to find them if you haven’t already. Humans are to be respected, but first and foremost respect yourself, it is your only life, how you feel is your choice. Why get angry and mad, why feel shitty, WHY? When ultimately it is all up to you. That is insanity, and so there I found myself promising to forever remain positive and try my best to rid my soul of negativity and harmful thoughts and emotions.

At this point I dragged my cousin up and told him to join me in some deep yoga stretches. Let me emphasise that I never thought it could be humanly possible to feel so fucking alive. As I began to move into a pose, I would feel a rush of energy, followed by a profound feeling of purpose. And as soon as I pushed the limits I began to feel that particular pain of deeply stretching your muscles and joints. The kind you normally cannot bare to feel for long. And that is when it happened…the moment that it all dawned on me. This pain that i am feeling, why do I normally have such an aversion to it? Right now this pain does not feel like my foe, that sworn enemy I normally try to avoid at all costs, be it physically or emotionally. NO! Tonight, as the pain began to set in, it began to feel like my trusty old rival, one that I tremendously respect. Pain is not your enemy, pain is your teacher, pain is your guide. It was so crystal clear to me, as clear as a vision, that pain needs to be understood. To understand pain is to begin your tango with it. The tango that determines where your physical and mental limits to pain are. And the more you tango with pain, the more clearly you understand your rival, the more clearly you understand yourself. And only then can you begin to grow your limits, expand them, push them….only then can you begin to grow as human being. Only then can you begin to truly own yourself.

It became clear to me that physical flexibility is not so much a limitation of your body as much as it is a limitation of your mind. And with this newfound insight i proceeded to work with my pain to pull further and deeper than I ever have in my entire life. And to my absolute astonishment I was able to get into yoga poses that I never could even come close to. And that is when I realised that my body is perfect as is, and so I should be in sync with with it on all aspects. I quickly began to feel the small shoulder aches I carry with me daily begin to dissolve into nothingness. (To my amazement 4 days later and they still have not come back). Your body is a tool. How you treat your body determines how dull or sharp that tool becomes. Respecting your body is to show yourself respect.

Once you find the limits of your body in terms of pain and endurance you will see that you have the ability to deeply connect with your body. Once you are in harmony with your body you can begin to find balance in your mind. To find peace of mind you need to find a balance in your life between your responsibilities be they societal or financial and your own individual life in private. You cannot feel balanced for example if you are are jobless and aren’t able to support your kids. Just as you cannot be in harmony if you make millions but never spend any time with your family. After finding your balance in body and mind you can begin to balance your spirituality. You can do that by finding a connection with nature, with your fellow man, and with yourself. And when all three are in harmony you are at peace.

One last thing, for some reason I only wanted to lay down on the floor, not the couch or the bed. There was something about the floor that I found so reassuring and grounding. In conclusion I honestly feel that mushrooms are like your grandparents who love you and so show you some really tough love when needed.

,chuck,"So I’m new to the Chuck fandom. I started watching for two reasons. 1) I’m a huge Firefly fan and the actor who plays Jayne (Adam Baldwin) is in this. 2) I just got Amazon Prime and Chuck was listed on one of those lists of best TV shows to stream on Amazon Prime. I think this is gonna be my TV show of the summer. I love to discuss shows online so I did a search on this sub for discussions of the first season but they’re all over 4 years old. :\-( I’m going to post some of my thoughts about each episode. I’d love for people to discuss with me. :\-)

The One Where Chuck Watches a Whole Bunch of TV

**Random Thoughts**

\* Aww, his sis is trying to pimp him out. That’s sweet.

\* So…Bryce Larkin = D\-bag Extraordinaire?

\* Casey’s got a hardcore villain edit this episode.

\* Mmkay, I’m not super up in the spy world and all, but I’m kind of surprised that the CIA and NSA have such a beef with each other.

\* Forget that Chuck has a government computer in his head. The hard to believe part for me is that someone from the Nerd Herd aka Best Buy Geek Squad would do anything for free. Chuck’s helping people left and right. It would be more realistic if he ended each interaction with “That’ll be $150.”

\* Harry is INTENSE. He reminds me of all the terrible bosses I’ve had combined.

\* Morgan’s annoying but he seems to be a pretty good friend. He was the only one who was fighting (albeit badly) when that ninja/Sarah was robbing them. He’s a good wingman too. He totally pushed Chuck to go out with Sarah.

\* Jeff is…different.

\* Large Mart, Buy More, I love those names.

\* Maybe he’ll grow on me as I watch the series, but Captain Awesome is kind of annoying.

\* This episode kind of feels like a short movie.

\* Awww, their date was so cute! Too bad it’s not real.

\* They have some real close up face shots this episode.

\* Love the dance scene!

\* Zachary Levi was just perfect casting for the role of Chuck. He’s such a great combination of nerdy/adorable/funny.

\* It’s so funny that Sarah and Casey just accept that he’s got this computer in his brain. Like no questions asked.

\* I love how Morgan’s playing with action figures when he makes that phone call to Chuck.

\* And a porn star saves the day!

\* Sarah’s very normal and happy for a spy. While Casey’s all grumpy and growly.

\* Sarah and Bryce used to be a thing. No me gusta.

\* I know that Casey working in retail is going to be a rich comedic trove.

**Favorite Quotes**

\* “Uh, you know, sis, the thing is Morgan and I don't really feel like we're fitting in at my birthday party.”

\* “Pedal safe!”

\* “My parents are sadists and carnival freaks found him in a dumpster.” “But they raised me as one of their own.”

\* “Aces, Charles. You’re aces.”

\* “Actually, that's all over with now and her restraining orders are very specific.”

\* “Whoa. Computer emergency.”

\* “Chuck is the computer.”

,weezer,"TLDR: Hey, guys. I love Weezer. A lot. I also like to write and give my opinion on works of music. Because of these loves, I've decided to put every Weezer album on, give them a listen as if it were the first time hearing it. Today is the 2001 self-titled ""The Green Album."" I have weird feelings about this album. I like a lot of the songs individually, but collectively, they miss the mark is their most insincere album, though it makes sense in the context of their career.
 
I was inspired by u/clarke11235 in r/radiohead for a similar series he did. I loved the format and decided to try it out for Weezer. Here's my scale for grading each song:

1. Hate it. This song has little to no redeeming qualities and we'd be better off without it. (I like to call this, the Pitchfork score.)

2. Poor. There are some solid moments on this track and could be enjoyable if it wasn't buried in a jumbled mess.

3. Average. Pretty solid song, if not entirely memorable or missing that little ""oomph"" to push it to the next level.

4. Good. Damn fine.

5. Great. Better than good, not excellent.

6. Excellent. Better than great. Sooooo close to perfect.

7. Perfection

Here we go, ratings for Weezer's third release:

**1. Don't Let Go (4/7):** The booming drums to start the song is a sense of relief. As beautiful as Pinkerton is, it is nice to feel the lightheardedness and easy listening once again. I really like this song and its a simple-yet-sweet love song. The solo is good, but wait a minute, it seems to follow the chorus almost exactly. Gosh, I sure hope this isn't a recurring theme. All in all, a fantastic start aside from a forgettable solo and lackluster harmonies.

**2. Photograph (4/7):** Fun fact, this was the first video to feature Scott! I have mixed feelings about this one. When I think about it, it has a lot of pieces that I wouldn't normally like about a Weezer song, yet, it all works so well. It's brief and sounds like it was taken off of Beatles for Sale or Meet the Beatles. The vocal harmonies and ""oooOoohhs"" in the background are amazing, too. It sometimes gets lost in their arsenal of earworm singles, and its not totally unsurprising that it was but a modest hit, but its still good as fuck. A recurring theme through the first two tracks, meh solo, solid yet undemanding instruments and pretty basic but happy lyrics. A damn fine start to an album.

**3. Hash Pipe (5/7):** Oh here we go. Now we're talking. This song has swagger, hop in its step and character that the first two lack. The riff is so infectious despite being oh so simple and Pat's drums in the chorus fit so well. I'm not terribly fond of the lack of harmonies, but can we appreciate Rivers' falsetto? It's a damn fine song and deserves the pop success it has seen.Also, again, an uninspiring solo that really hurts the momentum the song had built.

**4. Island in the Sun (4/7):** Probably Weezer's third most recognizable song, and one of the most overrated. I used to hate this song, but it is a GREAT feel good track. A great song to throw on when you're stressed, anxious, or down and just relax. Again, the song is formulaic as fuck, similar to the rest of the album, but Mikey's bass is a hidden gem of this song and is easily my favorite part of it. The harmonies in the chorus is also exceptional. There have been better starts to Weezer albums, but there have been much worse. There's also faint oohs in the chorus that really add to the daydreaming atmosphere. Damn fine song, but it could be better.

**Crab (2/7):** Oh Lord do I hate this fucking song. The music might be the best the album has next to Hash Pipe, and maybe even the best solo on the whole damn album, but I cannot stand these lyrics. Crab - the lyrics specifically - is a great representation of everything *wrong* with Green. Pointless lyrics (I like to think its talking about the STD to make the song a bit more bearable) that bring down a damn fine melody (the guitar leading into the verse from the chorus is dope as fuck) with solid harmonies, but the lyrics are the worst offender of what's beginning to feel like a return to safe corporate rock. Again, I understand the direction after the massive failure Pinkerton was initially, but that doesn't make it any less obnoxiously insincere. This should be a three by my criteria (I think it could even get there soon), but I truly, truly despise these lyrics. The fact Crab beat out a slew of great B-sides and bonus songs from this era is despicable. We had a solid first four tracks, but to quote a famous film franchise, ""I have a bad feeling about this...""

**6. Knock-down Drag-out (4/7):**  It can't get worse than track five and, thankfully, it doesn't. I love the guitar intro. The song showcases Weezer dipping into the pop-punk genre that they helped inspire. Its fun, and though it can be argued that everything I dislike about Crab should be applied here, the song has some charm to it. The instrumentation in the chorus is also fan-fucking-tastic. A great bounce-back from Crab.

**7. Smile (5/7):** I love this song. The instrumentation fits so well with the lyrics. A staple song in my playlist in any of my relationships, Smile has this intimacy and love that we haven't really seen since Island in the Sun. ""Cause I don't wanna break/You're fine face I can't take/The way you wanna wrap me up inside your smile,"" with some cleverly written lines like, ""Water me girl, let me ease the drought."" One of the band members referred to this album as ""The Beatles with power chords"" and this is a prime example of that. My biggest issue, and it offends greatly with a song as otherwise great as this, is the momentum shattering solo and short run time at just 3:18. This song is so close to being perfect, but maybe that's apart of its charm.

**8. Simple Pages (3/7):** A great chorus and solid instrumentation. But this is, what, the fifth simple, sweet love song? It's pretty derivative, lacking the atmosphere of Island in the Sun, relative-intimacy of Smile, drum use in Don't Let Go or breath of fresh air in Knock-down Drag-out. Perhaps if Simple Pages was earlier in the album, it would held in higher regards, but at this point, its tiresome and annoying to have another short and sweet love song when four others do everything it does better. What it does well, though, is and one of the best bass parts on the record, good backings at the end. pretty cool lines like, ""Give me some love, give me some love, sugar
From the drop with the old school meet,"" and the rapid pace and enunciation Rivers has in the ""Kick it on back"" parts. Its solid, but maybe just in an unfortunate place on the record. The ending chorus is also done exceptionally well.

**9. Glorious Day (4/7):** I love the introductory melody even though its the same structure as the previous eight songs. The melody as a whole is wonderful and I love to hear a demo when it wasn't given the same structure as LITERALLY EVERY OTHER DAMN SONG ON THE RECORD. Its, again, hurt by a lame solo. All of these lower scoring songs had so much potential and were lost along the way.

**10. O Girlfriend (5/7):** Talk about underrated gems. The most Pinkerton sounding album track before Do You Wanna Get High, O Girlfriend is lost in the blur of mediocrity that is the second half of the album. Easily the most sincere lyrics on the entire record, Rivers speaks about his relationship and drug addiction that plagued his last relationship (touched on in SS2K's O Girl and White's DYWGH) with a welcome heartfeltness that Green suffers from oh so severely. The guitar harmonizing with Rivers in the verse is great. Although the lead guitar in the solo is lame due to the similarity with the chorus, the rhythm, bass and drums excel. This is one of my top 20 favorite Weezer songs and has that hint of how good Green *could have* been. Not only is the narrative somber, but so is the track in context with the album.

**SCORE: 4/7** Much better than what I would have rated it two weeks ago. Green is slowly beginning to click for me, but I can't get past some egregious issues. Every song follows the exact same structure: Intro solo that follows the chorus, verse-chorus-verse-chorus-solo that follows the chorus-capped off with a repeat of the chorus. Individually, these songs work so damn well, but as an album, they're only frustrating. Think of Green as a bowl of vanilla ice cream. It tastes fine, but its limiting when there are fantastic options out there. They chose to use Simple Pages. Crab and Knock-down Drag-out instead of Oh Lisa, Teenage Victory Song and The Christmas song, all of which would have thrown in a scoop of strawberry, lemon and maybe some Cherry Garcia. This is one of the few albums where I can say confidently that Weezer made the wrong decision relegating some tracks to bonus and b-sides or other releases isntead of on the album. In my opinion, The Christmas Song is better than every track on the album. When you talk about Weezer and missed opportunities, Green is the prime example. This could have been a very special record.

**Underrated track:** O Girlfriend, the outlier of the album because of how sincere it is. 

**Overrated tracks:** Island in the Sun, Crab. The former doesn't deserve to be more well known than the majority of the band's discog and the latter deserves way more hate than it gets.

Alright, tonight or tomorrow, I'll have the Maladroit review next. I'm looking forward to it. Thanks for reading!

,OWLCITY,"A little over 6 months ago I made [a post](https://redd.it/7ea7w6) to organize everything we knew about Cinematic at the time, and I continued to maintain the post as more information came out.

&gt; “The message I want to communicate with the release of Cinematic is simple: don’t stop believing in magic, even if everyone else does. Keep learning to see the beauty around you and embrace the ups and downs. I wrote this album because I believe those ups are worth celebrating.”

#Fiji Water

*New York City, New York*

Our very first stop in Adam's life story is New York City, to where Adam took the seminal trip that made him famous. It's a humbling, reflective tale that provides a lot of insight into what it's like to be an ordinary guy who's offered the opportunity of a lifetime.

&gt; ""Fiji Water is a song I wrote about the beginning of my career. I took a leap of faith and boarded a plane for the first time and arrived in New York City to sign with a major record company. When you listen to this song, I hope it leaves you with the feeling that life is full of things that happen for reasons you don’t always understand, but when you push yourself outside your comfort zone, sometimes it can change your life in positive ways that you could have never imagined.""

Notes:

* On the album cover, the water bottle says ""BURSKY"", which refers to Steve Bursky, his former manager from Foundations Music
* On the Reel 1 cover, the water bottle says ""2008"" instead
* The lyric ""A good time was had by all"" is a reference to his collaboration with Carly Rae Jepsen, ""Good Time""
* ""Ocean Eyes is the idea that **there is more to someone than meets the eye**"" ~Adam's description of [Ocean Eyes](https://www.owlcitymusic.com/music/ocean-eyes/) on the website
* [Video of Katie and Abbey talking about this song](https://youtu.be/nTFMglNVd2M)
* [This](https://i.imgur.com/l5roJhp.jpg)

&gt; ###I laughed when I got back home, and I thought,

&gt; ###""There's no such thing as luck!""

---

#The 5th of July

*Ottumwa, Iowa*

Our second stop is Iowa, where we're going all the way back to Adam Young's birth on July 5, 1986. Fit with the same fireworks as the Independence Day preceding it, Adam dedicates the album's first ballad to his family and the wonder of being alive at all.

&gt; ""The 5th of July is a song about the day I was born. I’m fascinated with the idea that we all begin life on a certain time and day, but since we don’t remember the events of that day, we have to rely on the descriptions of the people who were there. I hope that when you listen to this song, it leaves you feeling thankful for life and for the parents who brought you into this world.""

&gt; ""I wrote this song to honor my parents. I wanted to tell them, 'Thank you for bringing me into the world and for loving me unconditionally.'""

Notes:

* [Lyrics to acoustic version](https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/owlcity/the5thofjulyacousticversion.html)
* The lone female voice at the beginning is Adam's girlfriend, Abbey
* The time signature is in 6/8
* [Video of Katie and Abbey talking about the song](https://youtu.be/8CilZPUJbDQ) (includes All My Friends)

&gt; ###They loved me with all their hearts

&gt; ###Since the day I opened my eyes

&gt; ###On the 5th of July

---

#[All My Friends](https://i.imgur.com/1BgzddY.png)

*Owatonna, Minnesota*

Up next, we're in Adam Young's hometown of Owatonna, Minnesota, where he goes on a nostalgia trip to recall his treasured friends that helped shape who he is today. It's a sweet ode to friendship that even features some of his friends on the backing vocals.

&gt; ""All My Friends is a song about the relationships in life that are rare. To me, the song is about my small circle of friends in junior high and high school that left a positive impact on me. My teenage years were carefree because of the amazing people in my life who were there for me. I recorded this song as a way of honoring the friends in my life I’ll never forget.""

&gt; ""I hope, that, as you listen to it, it also reminds you of the friendships you know you'll never forget.""

Notes:

* This was the lead single of Cinematic and arguably the first song in the Cinematic era (barring Not All Heroes Wear Capes).
* Musically, it is noticeably different from the rest of his discography, mainly being pop rock with only a little bit of his original style
* The song is inspired by Adam's love of country music, and draws influence from ""artists like Jake Owen and Keith Urban""
* This was the song Adam had the most fun recording
* The gang vocals were recorded by Adam's friends
* The mumbled quote at the very end is ""Don't put Twinkies on your pizza"", a reference to the movie ""Heavyweights""
* At 3 minutes and 25 seconds, this is the shortest song on the album
* Comments from Adam about the music video:
 * ""While I never stood on a corner and played guitar for passersby, I performed with friends in local bands at county fairs. I remember a time when making music professionally felt beyond my reach and thus, I have a deeper appreciation for what I do.
 * ""It’s an extraordinary feeling to meet the gaze of someone you’ve never seen &amp; feel a connection. The idea of introducing myself to a stranger was contrary to my personality, but I couldn't ignore the impulse. I followed my heart, &amp; my life changed.
 * ""When I was in college, I worked for Coca-Cola in a shipping warehouse. I was grateful for the job, but as an aspiring artist, I knew it wasn’t the right fit for me. The best day of my life was when I was able to quit and work on music full time.""
* [Video of Katie and Abbey talking about the song](https://youtu.be/8CilZPUJbDQ) (includes The 5th of July at the beginning)
* [This](https://i.redd.it/s6g4gxp22wvz.png)

&gt; ###We'll always be young at heart

&gt; ###And nothing's ever gonna tear us apart

---

#House Wren

*Iowa*

It's summertime and the wrens are singing! For our next stop, we're visiting Adam's grandparents' house in Iowa, where the wrens live in the hollowed-out vegetable gourds that are hung out on the back porch. Like wrens searching for a home, we've all got to find our place in the world.

&gt; ""House Wren is a song about the summers I would spend at my grandparent’s house in Iowa when I was a kid. My grandfather used to hang hollowed-out vegetable gourds on the back porch and the wrens would live in them. I found myself wondering what it would be like for a house wren looking for the perfect home.""

Notes:

* House Wren was one of the most anticipated songs from the album (see the pre-release polls later in the post). It was the most anticipated song that wasn't on any of the reels.
* [This](https://i.imgur.com/C9BYPCS.jpg)
 * [and this](https://a.tumblr.com/tumblr_p9pttvoaLh1r3x1rbo1.mp3)

&gt; ###'Cause as far as I know

&gt; ###I am halfway home!

---

#[Not All Heroes Wear Capes](https://i.imgur.com/9r48RWg.png)

*Owatonna, Minnesota*

Up next, it's Father's Day, a time Adam celebrates passionately as evidenced by this thoughtful ode to his dad, Randy Young.

&gt; “Not All Heroes Wear Capes is a song about my dad. He loves cars, he can fix anything, he’s a man of few words and he’s my hero. I wrote the song because I can express myself better with music than with words, so I thought “I’m gonna write a song for my dad simply just to tell him I love him.” When you listen [to] it, I hope it inspires you to tell your dad: “Hey, to everyone else you probably seem like a normal guy, but to me, you’re a hero.”

Notes:

* This was the earliest song released from Cinematic, released 5 months before the album was announced
* ""Not All Heroes Wear Capes"" and ""New York City"" are the first Owl City songs to have a title that starts with the letter ""N"" (this doesn't count songs from side projects)

&gt; ###My dad's a hero to me

---

#Montana

*Glacier National Park, Montana*

For our next stop, we're going on an adventure to the Big Sky Country, also known as Montana! Adam isn't writing about himself this time, but of Bill Olmsted, a treasured family member who took a trip to the state and found the place he wanted to stay forever.

&gt; ""Montana is a song about an 82-year-old man in my family named Bill. When Bill was 15-years-old, he boarded a train in St. Paul, Minnesota and wound up in a small town near Glacier National Park where he fell in love with the Montana wilderness. I wrote the song because of the look of wonder I see in Bill’s eyes whenever he talks about Montana. I wanted to honor the story of a man who went on an adventure 70-years-ago and found his special place in the world.""

&gt; ""When you listen to Montana, I hope you feel the way I felt when I was writing it. I hope you feel inspired to live spontaneously, to go out there and face the great unknown, and if you haven't done it yet, to embark on your own adventure of a lifetime.""

Notes:

* [Lyrics to acoustic version](https://pastebin.com/N3WV8QzD) (transcribed by me)
* Scrapped lyrics from the website: [""And now you can run free, For all of eternity""](https://www.owlcitymusic.com/song/montana/)
* The chorus' chant ""Get Lost in Montana"" is a common phrase found in bumper stickers, water bottles, and other assorted items around Montana, often with a link to getlostmt.com, Montana's official tourism website
* This is the first song on the album about Abbey's family (Bill Olmsted)
* There are three versions of this song: The original, the acoustic, and the alternate version.
* Geographical references to Montana:
 * Glacier National Park: While not explicitly mentioned, areas surrounding it or leading into it are referenced throughout the song
 * North Fork Road: A scenic, uncrowded section of Glacier National Park
 * West Glacier: An unincorporated community serving as the west entrance of Glacier National Park
 * Polebridge: A small community close to the northwest entrance of Glacier National Park
 * Rockies: The Rocky Mountains, part of which can be found in Montana
 * Big Sky country / Treasure state: Two common nicknames of Montana. The former is a reference to its seemingly open and unobstructed skylines. The latter is a reference to its ""rich mineral reserves""
* The song's length (in most services) is 4:06. The area code of Montana is 406
* [A snippet of the song with violin, drums, and background vocals and vocal effects only](https://youtu.be/LkPp0jULIR4)

&gt; ###Let your heart lead the way

#[Lucid Dream](https://i.imgur.com/L3YBHNl.png)

*???, ???*

Our next stop isn't in the conscious realm... or is it? Inspired by the best flying dream Adam's ever had, his esteemed flying dream is turned into a real life musical fever dream of trance beats and towering, fantasy-infused lyricism that just takes your breath away.

&gt; ""Lucid Dream is about the best flying dream I’ve ever had. During the writing of Cinematic, I kept a dream journal next to my bed, and one morning, I woke from one that was incredibly vivid. I wrote down exactly what happened, and that writing later became the lyrics to the song. Never stop dreaming.""

&gt; ""When you listen to Lucid Dream, I hope it makes you wanna close your eyes after a long day, drift off, and let your imagination carry you away.""

Notes:

* The song's genre is Trance, a little explored genre in Adam's other work. Adam has been worked with trance producers, including Chicane and Armin van Buuren
* The ""Black Rabbit of Death"" is a reference to *Watership Down*, one of Adam's favorite books
* The freight train is a reference to The Polar Express
* The intro to this song samples The Hillary Step from his scores (1:09-1:38)
* In an album full of more literal, direct lyrics about his life, Adam has said this song was intended to round out the album with a more abstract song
* [A snippet of the song with synths, background vocals, and vocal effects only](https://youtu.be/AA6PU1dV8CI)

&gt; ###Life is a lucid dream

&gt; ###And that's how you study the stars!

---

#Always

*Owatonna, Minnesota*

In the darkest of times, Adam turns to God in times of trouble. Our next song is a soulful ballad about the power of prayer and staying strong because God is always with you.

&gt; ""Always is a song I wrote about my father’s struggle with chronic health problems. It’s about how God tells His followers: “Fear not, for I am with you.” I hope it reminds you that there is incredible power in the even simplest of prayers.""

&gt; ""Being raised in a family of faith, this is something I wanted to tell my dad ⎯⎯ to just hang on. There is a light at the end of the tunnel.""

Notes:

* [Emotionally, this was the hardest song for Adam to write](https://twitter.com/owlcity/status/1002402306544021509)

&gt; ###Please remember when I say

&gt; ###I'm with you always

---

#Cloud Nine

*Cloud Nine, ???*

Going up? Our next stop is the lush, proverbial paradise of Cloud Nine, another place Adam turns to in times of trouble. While the song is generally about keeping your head up in the face of distress, the song is also about meeting the love of your life.

&gt; ""'Cloud Nine' is a song about learning to keep your head up, even when you feel like the entire world is doing everything it can to bring you down. I included three key changes in this song that give you a sense that you’re ascending at all times. After listening to this song, remember that nothing can bring you down.""

&gt; ""When you listen to Cloud Nine, my hope is that you feel like there's nothing on this Earth that can possibly bring you down.""

Notes:

* The first line, ""Pull the moon down with a lasso"", is a reference to the movie ""It's A Wonderful Life""
* The sound used as the synth lead is a manipulated recording of Abbey
* This song features three key changes. The keys in each section are as follows:
 * Verse 1 - A-flat major
 * Chorus 1 to Verse 2 - B-flat major
 * Chorus 2 to Ending - C major (thank you /u/-reggie- for the correction)

&gt; ###For the rest of my life

&gt; ###I'll be floating on cloud nine!

---

#Winners Never Quit

*Owatonna, Minnesota*

It's time for a footrace, but this isn't just any old fable! Life is full of obstacles, but being patient and taking your time will ensure that you'll make it to the finish line.

&gt; ""Winners Never Quit is about dealing with the struggles life throws your way. It’s about learning to be patient, knowing you WILL finish the race if you don’t give up. I hope this song inspires you to work hard and to enjoy the journey of life.""

Notes:

* The turtle on the artwork is a reference to the classic Aesop fable ""The Tortoise and the Hare""^^^duh

&gt; ###I'll give it all I got, I don't have a lot

&gt; ###But I know a little goes a long way

---

#Madeline Island

*Madeline Island, Wisconsin*

Our next stop is Madeline Island, Wisconsin! Life may be an ongoing battle, but we all have to take a break sometimes. In this song, Adam and his family take a brief respite to go on the vacation of a lifetime and make a memory that will last forever.

&gt; ""Madeline Island is a song about the best vacation I ever had. My parents, our dog Max, and I went camping on Madeline Island in Lake Superior in the spring of 2013. I wrote the song to make sure I never forget what an amazing time I had with my family. I hope it inspires you to take a break from the chaos of life and take a brief respite with the people you love.""

&gt; ""The four of us went there, and it was pretty uneventful. That was the point... It was so good to reconnect with my parents and to realize that I have an amazing relationship with them. Not everyone can say that. It made me feel so blessed and grateful when I was looking back. I wanted to honor my parents by telling this simple story of us going camping and enjoying nature.""

Notes:

* The melody from 0:30-0:44 reuses a part of The Deep South from his scores (0:44-0:56)
* The ambient section from 3:58 to the end reuses parts of The Descent from his scores and Mr. Heartache, a SEKAI NO OWARI song produced by Adam Young (both are present from the beginning)

&gt; ###We made a memory

&gt; ###That will always last

#Be Brave

*Owatonna, Minnesota*

*Cinematic* is all about cinema, so why don't we stop for a movie? *Cinematic*'s longest song is a heartfelt, epic power ballad about the night Adam met his girlfriend, Abbey, through a life-changing decision to check out a midnight showing of a movie.

&gt; ""'Be Brave' is about a midnight showing of a movie where I met my girlfriend. I turned around, and there she was. I wrote this song because the events of that night completely changed my life and I didn’t want to look back one day and not be able to remember every little detail. When you listen to this song, I hope it leaves you with the realization that you never know what could happen, even from ordinary nights at the theater.""

Notes:

* [Lyrics to acoustic version](https://pastebin.com/mHUtnyKv) (transcribed by me)
 * The only lyrical difference between this acoustic and the original is that the ""Ok, I'll be brave"" before the third verse doesn't show up.
* The acoustic version was uploaded first on April 19, 2018 and taken down soon afterward. It was later re-uploaded on May 3, 2018.
* At 5 minutes and 15 seconds, this is the longest song on the album by far. It's the only song longer than 5 minutes.
* The ""paper bird"" is Abbey's business card, which she gave to Adam after he talked to her in the parking lot. The card had an illustration of an owl.
* Abbey sings during the bridge
* Adam reuses a section from ""Return to Earth"", a song from his Apollo 11 score, in this song (The oh's from 3:05-3:28 in ""Be Brave"", the riff from 0:25-0:45 in ""Return to Earth"")
* [This](https://i.redd.it/2dexu4v9kmq01.png)

&gt; ###And written on it were the words:

#[New York City](https://i.imgur.com/2DtdQ5N.png)

*New York City, New York*

The journey's almost over, but we still have time to revisit the famous New York City! We're traveling back to the time Adam graduated high school and packed his bags for the outside world. Adam describes his first journey outside Owatonna as not just a glamorous road trip, but as an inspiring coming of age story.

&gt; ""New York City is about the first time I ever really left my hometown and saw some of the world. It’s a coming of age story, and I tried my best to memorize all the little details as they happened. I hope this song inspires you to take a similar trip, maybe even get a little lost. I think you’ll be surprised at what you discover.""

&gt; ""When you listen to New York City, I hope you feel inspired to pack your stuff, jump in the car, take a trip, see the world, maybe get lost from time to time, 'cause I think if you do that, you'll be glad you did.""

Notes:

* In the music video, the main character ends up performing on a stage. This is the same stage where Adam films and records the acoustic videos.
* In the final verse, there is a field recording of cars passing by. Adam got these recordings by crawling through the bushes near I-35
* This was the first song (barring NAHWC) to be shown in a snippet, found in this [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/BapDcA-jTlW/) as an instrumental preview a few days before the announcement even came out
* An instrumental version of the song was featured in the background of the album announcement
* The artwork for this song is the only one that consists solely of inanimate objects
* This song plays in the background of the ""Life is Cinematic"" website
* ""Not All Heroes Wear Capes"" and ""New York City"" are the first Owl City songs to have a title that starts with the letter ""N"" (this doesn't count songs from side projects)

&gt; ###Travel light and see the world right

&gt; ###You'll never know if you never go

#Firebird

*Polebridge, Montana* [^^source](https://i.imgur.com/QVd8IJg.png)

Our penultimate stop in this journey is where it all began. In this song, we're taking the focus off of Adam to look at Abbey's family and the strong relationship between her and her brother, Billy. Together, they journeyed through life on a scarlet red Firebird.

&gt; ""Firebird is about a close relationship between siblings. It’s about how life changes quickly and how I don’t want to take anything for granted. I hope it reminds you that each and every moment is priceless.""

Notes:

* This is the second song on the album about Abbey's family (The first is Montana)

&gt; ###I wouldn't change a thing

&gt; ###'Cause everything changes

---

#Cinematic

*A galaxy far, far away*

What a spectacular journey! I'd love to collapse on the bed, but it's just not a cinematic experience without a grand ending. Adam has spent nearly a whole year developing *Cinematic* as a gift to the fans. In the album's proper conclusion, he gives us inspiration and hope in the rest of our endeavors, so that one day we may do or make something as meaningful to us as *Cinematic* is to Adam Young.

&gt; ""Cinematic is about the concept of a person’s life being viewed by an audience from another galaxy. It describes how life is full of magic if one strives to see it, and how we should all embrace our time to the fullest as if we are all making our own movies that will live on for eternity. I hope it encourages you to reach for the stars.""

&gt; ""I wanted a song at the very end of the album to sum up the tracks that had come before and that said to the listener, 'You just witnessed a few scenes from my life that I love, just a few stories I never want to forget. So, what does that mean to you? What are your movie-magic moments from your life?'""

Notes:

* Adam cited this as the song that inspired the idea around Cinematic. It was the first song he wrote for Cinematic and one of the last.
* Scrapped lyrics from the website: [""Your raw talent is blowing our minds, The kids quote all your signature lines""](https://www.owlcitymusic.com/song/cinematic/)
* Cinematic is the first instance of a title track in an Owl City album
* This is the only song on the album to be entirely in second person
* Obviously, this song references Star Wars twice (""a galaxy far, far away"" and ""May the force be with you"")

&gt; ###Follow your dreams

&gt; ###'Cause life is cinematic!

---

#Alt Versions

15 songs just wasn't enough. The stories of All My Friends, Montana, and Firebird each get cast in the spotlight again in alternate versions. This time, the songs are stripped down and feature (even more) vocal contributions from various people in Adam's life.

###All My Friends (Alt Version)

*Owatonna, Minnesota*

Notes:

* Breanne Duren has a vocal feature on this track

###Montana (Alt Version)

*Glacier National Park, Montana*

Notes:

* Abbey has a vocal feature on this track (She sings ""Heaven calls you home"") [***unconfirmed***]
* Bill Olmsted has several speaking parts throughout the song [***unconfirmed***]

###Firebird (Alt Version)

*Polebridge, Montana*

Notes:

* Abbey and Billy both have vocal features and speaking parts on this track [***unconfirmed***]

* [What each part of the cover corresponds to](https://i.imgur.com/EROuJD8.png)

* [This](https://i.imgur.com/aP4nxEL.png) is the first version of the album cover, which had Matt &amp; Adam by the plane. The current version doesn't have them anymore, instead having the kids from the All My Friends cover in their place. The exact reasons why are unknown.

* The cover art was illustrated by Jerry Vanderstelt

* [The font used on the album cover is called ""Alien Encounters""](https://www.dafont.com/fr/alien-encounters.font?text=Cinematic)

###The Reels/The Music Videos

* Each reel has an overarching theme (*speculation*)
 * Reel 1: Beginnings
 * Reel 2: Following your dreams
 * Reel 3: Love and adventure

* Reel 1, Reel 2, and Reel 3 are the first Owl City albums to not feature the words ""Owl City"" on the album cover (Not counting singles)

* The only differences between the music videos and the Director's Cut is the presence of the title cards (Part 2/Part 3/The End) and the addition of an extra scene between All My Friends and Lucid Dream

###Misc.

* This is NOT Owl City's last album. Thanks to the AMA/Q&amp;A sessions, you can expect more from Owl City, Sky Sailing, Port Blue, Goodbye Dubai, and the Adam Young Scores series!

Many of the trivia, notes, and etc. would not have been found without the help of you guys

&gt; I hope this album leaves you with the idea that your life is like a movie and you are the star. You're going to run into critics, but you have an audience cheering you on. The stage is yours, so get out there, do your best, and remember to have fun.

&gt; Cinematic, in short, means this: Your life is yours to live, so live it well.

,The_Crew,"It's a Spotify\* playlist, with a few guidelines I had in mind: keep it light. I did not want to go to deep into classics so don't expect Genesis or Pink Floyd show up, neither I wanted to stray too far into all kinds of electro genres. Keep it generic, easy to swallow, but daring to explore other genres. 

The goal was to have a somewhat underground feeling playlist echoing the feeling of ""party racing"" from the (gone to shit) Fast and Furious franchise, but with a heavy push towards relaxing, sightseeing experience where you just drive around in a 2 hour long all around the borders race for a long time, as I'm really hoping these races will return. Carefully avoiding any song that could bring you down or could dive you into some thoughts you don't want to go to if you often feel down, as much as I was tempted to include Nik Ammar's Diggin' my own grave, this playlist is all about high spirits and driving!

So you'll find a good mix of 2000s and late 90s pop / rock / country / rap songs with some recent radio hits here and there that I tried to streamline together and cut out some rougher edges, and those that would remind you too much of other racing games. I wanted to sneak in some of my favourites from Carbon, Most Wanted, Flatout 2, Crashday, but decided to cut some as they were a bit too much identified with those games because I definitely did not want to make another one of those lists that are 90&amp;#37; NFSMW and 2 other sings. If you ever searched for a racing playlist, you know those all too well.

Working a bit on the song order to keep it balanced and blending from one genre to another with a nicer curve but don't have too long sessions of one genre and keep it changing just in time you'd get too used to one, but here it is!

,ifyoulikeblank,"Okay, I'm sorry if this triggers some of you, and this is a really niche thing that not a lot of you might know, but I absolutely love looking up unknown mainstream songs. As in, artists that were signed to a major label or sublabels that had a music video and were targeted towards teens and young adults but didn't get the push to get really famous. 

Now, surprisingly, Discogs has a good catalog of mainstream songs going up to like 2006. I like to look up songs from the 90s and 00s, and even 80s sometimes. Starting somewhere in 2006-2011 in Discogs catalog, they start to prefer reeeally indie experimental shit, EVEN if you punch in the category 'Pop'. Its like impossible to find mainstream songs I don't know on Discogs 2017 catalog! Its always some weird bands! With no music videos! 

So knowing this,  I started looking for alternatives. At I used Spotify, like I punched in a mainstream song and put on their radio or put it in a playlist and looked at the similar results. But guess what! Spotify removed those features! Well, for the phone anyway. 

The other one I use is Google play music,  they have a good similar song list with like 5 pages! But even then, you can't search by year or genre or anything like Discogs has!

I honestly doubt there's a site out there to get all the specific info I'm asking. Pandora is shit, don't even suggest that. They play the same popular songs over and over. I'm looking for literally all the artists who got major record deals. But EVEN some mainstream songs are from indie labels, which makes things even more complicated. Or sublabels. Honestly, I just wish there was a Discogs JUST for the mainstream stuff. Its not just pop music either, anything mainstream like hip-hop, rock, alternative. Rock and alternative can be made by major labels too. Maybe mainstreams the wrong word. You know what I mean.

,DestinyTheGame,"Hi!  I'd like to talk about time-to-kill (TTK), in terms of responses to Jon &amp; Josh's (hereby J&amp;J) chat on Crucible Radio.  I really enjoyed the candor of the interview, but there were some things that were said that I feel are worth providing considered feedback on.  Disclaimer, I won't be making any suggestions on how to fix things, this is simply to further the discussion based and provide dev feedback.  

I will discuss reproducibles on how to replicate a particular player experience to analyze, and I will talk about possible design goals, not solutions.  The devs at Bungie are smart individuals, and there are a whole host of reasons internally and externally as to why D2 plays the way it does; they are completely capable of making Destiny whatever it needs to be.  This will probably be a long one, so let's get into it.

&amp;nbsp;

The topics of discussion:

*  J&amp;J - TTK, space, and skill.
*  Kevin - Destiny 2 is a team game, and we leant into that.  
*  Spikes in player power vs spikes in player execution.  
*  Teamplay builds on top of individual skill.  
*  Well that's a lot of words about problems (player headspace discussion).
*  What happens when we change it.

*I will be paraphrasing the devs here, please listen to the latest CR podcast if you'd like to hear it.*  

TLDR:

*  D2 needs to finely differentiate between primary gun skill of individual players, and reward 1v1 fights.
*  The focus on teamwork actually decreases the skillcap of individual play and*teamwork.  
*  D2's flow of player skill progression does not match a typical shooter, and it pushes players away.  
*  Player mental model suggestions (new and average players want to play for themselves, higher skill want teammates).
*  The community are a vocal bunch, and I don't envy bungie at all - design for depth.  

&amp;nbsp;

**J&amp;J.**
&gt;*TTK is about space; longer ttk means more opportunities for a higher skilled player to make skilled plays. For instance, halo - you can shoot a great player in the back, they'll turn around, throw a grenade at their feet, and hs you with a pistol, then teabag you.*

Teabagging and Halo, name a more iconic duo.  Actually I can - halo &amp; precision shooter mechanics.  

The biggest difficulty in comparing ttk in D2 and Halo is that for that great player Jon discussed in Halo - optimal ttk and average ttk tend to be close, even against great opponents who have the spartan dodge to get out of trouble.  H5 even has a term and medal for it - 'Perfect'.  Weapons are perfectly accurate ads'd or hipfired, perfect in-air accuracy, grenades are plentiful, melees are 2 hit.  That 1.2s ttk on the magnum starts feeling pretty powerful up against an Onyx player, because they will land nearly every shot, there is no flinch to force them to miss, just descope, which you can skill around.  

When I play halo, I'll get 3+ perfect kills in a match, plus some grenade priming + hs, plus some 2 shot + melee kills.  All of these kills are 1.2s or less.  They *feel good*.  Each of these types of kills are a 'competitive razor' where the better player differentiates themselves from a worse one.  In Halo,the optimal ttk tends to fall reasonably closely to the average ttk.  If I isolate a player in H5 and I'm a better player, I can win that fight before they can rotate away or their teammates collapse; if I'm worse, they'll nuke me 7 different ways with 11 herbs and spices.    

In D2, I find it much harder to get those 'perfect' kills.  Grenades are weaker, and much less numerous.  Flinch means I can easily miss a bullet or 2 in a gunfight.  Damage dropoff due to range is much more severe.  Weapons have strong zooms, which makes tracking harder.  My movement option is on an 18-12 second cooldown.  Radar takes ages to return in quickplay, so I can't be as aggressive in engagements.  In D2, I cannot press into 1v1 engagements, because I rarely feel confident I can kill someone before their teammates rotate on me.  

Flinch and aerial accuracy to force certain engagement approaches were more ok in Destiny 1, because they were there to balance out the quick ttk, constant special ammo, and powerful abilities.  But they are punishing in the context of how Destiny 2 plays, and they are blunting that razor's edge of skill that we use to allow players to differentiate their skill levels.  I play against friends who could just blow me off the server in D1, and in D2 I can keep up with them, because their options to outplay me have been reduced.  

&amp;nbsp;

**The matter of being an individual.**

Problem:  Primary-based fights between high skill opponents playing to win are unsatisfying, and frequently result in a stalemate.  Primary gunplay breaks down, and does not differentiate between player skill effectively.  

To Reproduce:  Load a 1v1 in private match.  Equip 150rpm pistol and 540 rof pulse.  Notice that grenades are easily avoided, have low uptime, and do low damage.  Notice that generally the most effective play is to rotate away when losing the gunfight.  Notice that it's hard to capitalize on mistakes, and if both players are playing smart, it's hard to get caught out of position.  

Step 2:  Load into a 2v2 private match with same weapons.  Notice that the skill requirement of communication increases player engagement, notice the better players can be more assertive, and leverage their better aim and positioning whilst tagging out to trade aggro and damage. 

Conclusion:  Destiny 2 lacks the capacity to meaningfully differentiate player skill on an individual level.  Teamplay is the major factor in victory.  *Why is this a problem?*
We'll get to that - but here's a hint, it's forcing teamwork onto players who have their hands full with the basics.  Which ties nicely into Kevin's point.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Kevin - D2 is a team game, and we lean into that.**

&gt;*The ttk in D1 meant that a player could end up in situations where their death was inenvitable, callouts were for location, because you knew you were going to die.  In D2, my team has a bit more time to react to that, and make a play.*

A - Agreed.  As an observer, if I was to look at the design of D2, I would guess that that the overarching philosphy came from a pure place - watching high level sweats, and wondering how to provide the thrills and joy of that experience to the general playerbase.  Every part of the crucible design definitely focuses towards this end goal.  But we don't want the general playerbase playing that way - *it's akin to driving a hardcore track car, it's really fun for 30 minutes, but for most people, they'll want to go back to their airconditioned sedan at some point.*  

This teamwork concept is great, but it breaks the typical player growth arc that shooters tend to have; and takes away from some of the core joy of a shooter.  Shooters tend to emphasise individual brilliance, and scale that up to teamplay.  Imagine a spectrum of player skill, from bronze elo to top 500.  Let's put this in the context of D1, and how its skillgap tended to play out.  

Up to Gold/Diamond, the first 60%ish of players have their hands full mastering individual mechanics.  Individual skill is king, if you're better than others, you can easily carry to victory.  At this skill level, people playing in stacks tend to be friends hanging out, their ability to communicate does not really have a meaningful impact upon the result.  Players in this bracket are having fun for themselves.  

But as you start to hit higher skill brackets, people start playing together, and at some point if they want to keep improving, that individual player will start to learn how to play as a teammate, and translate that individual skill into teamwork.  The higher and higher the skillbrackets go, the better individual and teamplay get - to the point where the gameplay is unrecognizable from what is happening in the gold bracket.  Because the game is built on a core of individual skill, average players can watch a tourney and get excited about their favorite player just going off -&gt; but the hardcore players watch for the teamwork, and the nuance that separates how the teams play.  

The game is about that push and pull between individual skill and teamplay.  CSGO is a terrific example of how this plays - even at the highest level, a player like S1mple can carry on skill alone, and there's tension - tension in watching a superior team work out how to deal with an individually superior player.  In most successful sports or games, that individual/team tension is what makes them a joy to watch.  Take that away, and they lose something.  

Note - this isn't spikes in player power.  It's spikes in player execution. In CSGO, s1mple or niko are using the same weapons as everyone else - *their brilliance is the difference*.  

&amp;nbsp;

**And the horse you rode on.**

And so we come to D2.  Because of this laser focus on teamplay (especially around vanilla), teamwork becomes the overwhelmingly dominant path to victory - and it breaks that 'typical' shooter growth.  Now those gold players can't just load into quickplay, because even there, they can't influence games with individual skill.  Every game and everyone feels the same.  There's less point in practicing their mechanical skill, and this presents a problem, because those players typically want to just log in and 'get good'.  They want to watch True Vanguard play, and try out things he does; but they can't - the game no longer allows it.  

They're forced into teamplay, when they're not really ready for it; and the outcome is where we are now.  ""Matchmake solos against solos."" - Once you do that, you've now broken that perfect arc of skill growth - and you end up with 2 streams of playlists, the 'solo queue' and the 'team queue' - when teamplay should be the eptimote of the game.  It's a sympton of a larger problem. 

And here's the real tragedy - by focusing to much on teamplay, D2 reduces the ability to distinguish between skilled teams in terms of leveraging the players they have and what makes them unique.  Because the ttk is so long, you don't have to be as exacting in your teamwork, you don't have to make your rotations as fast.  You can just roll around as a ball, rather than the rapid rotations that characterized high level D1 play.  

It makes everyone feel the same to play against.  At the higher levels, the game breaks down.  Players are constantly rotating, but lack the lethality to make aggressive plays, the game rewards passive play too heavily.  Right now, power ammo exacerbates this.  At the top level, D1 plays at a million miles an hour.  D2 plays quickly, but less happens because the condition for a kill is much harder to achieve.  

&amp;nbsp;

**That's a lot of words about problems.**

So, let's talk about the mental model in D2, and possible design goals; for a variety of players.  Notice that I haven't directly talked about TTK that much.  I don't mind how Bungie achieves it - but I want, I need - to have finely-grained meaningful differentiation on an individual level between players, over the gamut of player skill.  

I want to get smacked around and want to improve, and I want to see myself improve and do some smacking of my own.  Bungie can speed up ttk, or make it so all my shots hit, or make it about whoever eats more doritos the fastest - what matters to me is that I can take 1v1s, and come out of that engagement satisfied; with a meaningful outcome, and knowing who the better player was in that fight.  

&amp;nbsp;

**As a Bronze - Mid Diamond Player.**

I want to be able to log into 6v6 crucible or rumble, and play for hours; with my focus being on myself.  I want to come out of it thinking about the plays I made with a shotgun, the cool kills I had, and that feeling that ok - next I'll work on where I throw grenades, or my sniping, or my positioning so I can mida 4 tap.  

If I play trials, I want to queue up with 2/3 friends, and we run into people like us; we have one friend who is great, we're just there for fun, we win a few games; I feel like I did something cool here and there.  If we go a few games in, we start going up against teams that are obviously better than us, mechnically they're awesome, and they work together in ways we never see in traditional matchmaking.  Maybe one day.  

&amp;nbsp;

**As a Masters+ Player.**

I want to log into 3v3 crucible solo, and sweat.  I'm playing against stacks and great solo players, and honing my individual skill to be able to juggle multiple communicating players.  The game has a skillgap that rewards this investment.  I want to have 2 friends join me, and then that individual focus takes a back seat, and I'm constantly making callouts, rotations, and letting the individual things I've practiced happen naturally.  

I want to take players who've never been to the lighthouse and play trials with them.  I want to hear them ask about the things we're doing, and be shocked at how fast the game is played, and realize how much they have to learn, and how cool it is that this game is so deep.  

&amp;nbsp;

**What happens when we change it.**

The devs aren't dumb.  D2 was a response to a lot of things about D1 - and they're all going to come spiralling back when they make changes.  As the skillgap increases, it becomes less fun to get pummelled.  Everyone feels like they have a chance in D2, because teamwork tends to be the most important factor.  You never feel like you're the reason your team lost.  Decrease the ttk or up the ability to hit shots + prime people, and suddenly you'll need more aggressive SBMM matchmaking, because people will start complaining because they're getting crunched.  Up the SBMM, and then suddenly the good players are complaining because every game is sweaty, they can't just chill.  

Now what?  Now you have to introduce game modes that are more fun based, and less focused on skill (super fiesta from halo for instance I guess).  You've got all this right?  Now weapons are pretty hard to keep in balance, because ttk is down to 3 bullets; the meta tends to be more exaggerated, so higher skilled players are getting that 'competitive' experience constantly using the meta, but lower skilled players hate they they're forced to run the meta to keep up.  This is too much for a Friday, let's add vodka to our coffee.  

Destiny is a cyclical community, and I don't blame bungie for trying something to fix it.  My point would be this - you're better off having a game that people love and hate, and have room to grow/improve at - that's deep and compelling; than one that is bland and everyone just finds ok.  D1 was infuriating, hard, difficult; but had a rewarding pvp that truly rewarded skill - there was differentiation from Lumi down to the bronzest of bronze players.  D2 is just ok.  Good players don't feel rewarded for their skill in pvp, and newer players don't feel like they can do much to improve.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Thanks.**

If you've gotten this far, I thank you.  D1 pvp was my gateway into more serious pvp games, and I miss the just gamut of gameplay opportunities it had.  I miss playing sweats, or 1v1 privates against better players, talking into the night about how to improve.  I miss chilling with 6 friends in IB, complaining about rift or laughing at the worst player in our group falling off the edge *again*.  The skill differences are what provide these opportunities for friendship and communication - when we're all the same, it's boring.  

I hope we can continue our discussions with Bungie, and arrive at a more satisfying place in the future &lt;3.

,AmazonEchoDev,"Hi, early this morning I used my Amazon Echo and as usual I would ask Alexa to play NPR for about half an hour.  Later I would ask her to just “play music” and she would play music based on the criteria she learned from my history. Most times than not I would also ask Alexa to play Pop, Rock, or Jazz and she would provide a playlist of that genre. 

This morning while I was trying to figure out how to set up the “drop-in” feature I reset the device. I was able to configure “drop-in” but I noticed that Alexa has forgotten all my music history. Also now when I ask her to “play music” she just plays NPR, (which is the first thing I asked her to play earlier after the reset, mind you it isn’t music) before I would get actual music. I don’t mind if she forgot my music preference and history, but now every time I command her to play Rock, Pop or Jazz she would responds “I couldn’t find any (genre) songs” I know this isn’t true because earlier this morning it was working. Could the reset I did earlier enabled a new update on free music requests? I don’t pay for Amazon Music, could this be a way for Amazon to push me to subscribe to their music service? Are they limiting the number of songs and music commands available to free accounts? I did also try to request to play Madonna and she provided me with a Madonna playlist so this tells me there are still options available.

Any help or trouble shooting solutions will be appreciated.

,lawofattraction,"So in the past I’ve explained in some of my posts about my synchronicity with the time 9:11, long story short, I’ve seen that exact time at least once a day since probably around 8th grade is when I started noticing it, I’m 20 now. Anyways, I’ve not necessarily had a hard life in a physical sense, and opportunity was always there the more I look back but I do know I dug myself into a hole with drugs and drinking and not caring about anything throughout my highschool and into my part college years. Moved in with “best friend” just last August actually. Him and are no longer best friends.

We keep in touch but I mean he’s kind of on his own shit now working at dominos, living in a house with 4 dudes. And I ended up moving away from him because I realized how much time I was wasting, doing drugs, drinking, spending way more than I should’ve, not working out and smoking cigarettes. Tough spot. But after one weekend of a Xanax, addy, alcohol, weed, kratom binge I finally snapped out of it. Like what the fuck am I doing? And again the time 9:11 started showing up more and more I was giving more attention to it you know? Like I was still seeing it all this time but I wasn’t giving it any thought. 

Anyways I decided to change my life, moved away from him, got a job that isn’t the end game for sure but I’m making way more money right now then I ever have in the past and I get paid weekly which is nice. I’ve quit every drug I can think of, including caffeine, and very seldom do I drink alcohol unless I’m with my parents or family just having a good time. I started motivating myself telling myself all of these good affirmations and looking in the mirror every morning and night telling myself how much I love myself and that I’m a masterpiece. But I also affirm how much I love and care for others and my acts towards success will benefit them. And let me tell you something. 

It has changed, dramatically my mood, my overall well being, outlook, and my control over my emotions ( I’ve also been meditating for about 30 mins a day, exercising, and taking cold showers at 4:30 every morning and then at night after my exercising). It isn’t easy guys, but it’s so worth it, start dreaming, start believing, start changing, inch by inch and don’t kill yourself if you mess up a day or two, and routines are still tough at the beginning, it all starts to form, just believe, it took me about 4 months. Just believe. 

So now to this with a synchronicity that I had. I was driving home one night, and let me tell ya, I don’t know how the fuck this even happened and it has set me shooting for the stars with my dreams. It was around 9 ish and I noticed it was getting closer to 9:11 and I told myself like okay well if I see 9:11 now it is most likely forced and whatever but if there’s any sign that this means something about my life and who I am and where I need to be going and what I should be doing, give me a sign. So the time 9:11 eventually got there and I was listening to the music only to be listening to, without any choosing or certain playlist ( I have a very broad appreciation for lots of different music) the song Over by Drake was playing and at the time 9:11 these lyrics were said “What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh, yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me
I'm doin me
I'm livin' life right now, mayne
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over
'Til it's over
But it's far from over”

Have a great day everyone. This is a true experience and know that the universe will keep giving you pushes but it’s your choice and free will to stand up and use that push to your advantage.

# My Druggie Confessionals

......................................................................................

When trying to think of what to share next I couldn't get past mentally recalling my latest encounter with psychosis.

I'm no stranger to pushing limits, I love it. Finding what could possibly break myself is the best part of getting high on absolutely anything.

I had been up 2 days before this night changed my life, binging on free Adderall.

A long time friend of mine, was always obsessed with a weapon of mine. My first gun. The plinker. The forever missed, now. My 25 round, .22LR semi auto AR style rifle. The baby brother to my 25 round, .223 S&amp;W AR\-15.

The cheapest and most fun thing I've bought that actually lasted longer than the next day. Anyways, I had to sell it or risk not getting high. I hate myself for this.

The time had come. It was in my possession from the time before I was married, became to call a car my home and then back to moving into my families house again. I honestly miss it. Selling it taught me a lesson.

I notified my friend that I was going to let it go and he was to get ""first dibs"" if he'd like to buy it. He immediately wrote back showing interest.

Within 2 hours I met him at a local hotel where he was essentially ""trapping"" meth out of, like usual. The agreement was $200 and when I arrived I was handed $100 and an 8ball of the devils dandruff.

I didn't want it honestly. I needed money. I wanted Suboxone, cigarettes and gas. Enough to get me out of this cycle for at least a week or two and still have money to spend time with my girlfriend. I told him this and he understood, but other than the ole Franklin... He was tapped out due to needing a re\-up.

Upon arriving at the hotel, I had another friend blowing up my phone almost as soon as he handed the cash and bag to me for inspection. She wanted meth. It was really odd and somewhat out of character. I hadn't told anyone I was even around it. That sealed my fate itself. It was sold.

I got home and immediately split up the bag into smaller, $20s.

""2 for sale, 1 to rail"" I muttered to myself until the bag was divided.

Meeting up with my other friend I sold a bit over a gram and then proceeded to use her counter and money to shove my nose full of psychosis. I did nearly a gram line. I had made my over $200 already.

Fuck it. It's fun time. I've never did that much at once before. I probably will again though if I'm being honest. It was a life lesson in a nostril.

Within 10 minutes I was dripping wet. Tears had ran out of my eye, damn near leaving a spot so large on my shirt that it looked like I split water on the collar. My words became jumbled. I was geeked.

# Ding

A text from my loved one. Fuck. How could I fucking do this before I saw her tonight? I'm such an idiot. She'd fucking kill me and her brother for this. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

I don't lie to my girlfriend. She doesn't lie to me. Well, I definitely do lie about methamphetamine. That's it though, truly. I don't want to lose her because I do shit like this from time to time. I love her.

I put on my game face, completely unaware of what was in store, told my friend I'd see her later and thank you for the business and then proceeded to my girlfriends home.

10 miles away from where she was nearly took an hour for me to drive to. I was fucking flying, but I was getting nowhere. Every block I drove caused me to pull into a gas station, a business or a driveway. The police.

Every fucking time I overdo ole Tina, the first indication that I know I'm gonna turn into a monster is extreme paranoia ahout the police.

To top it off, it was later in the evening, my eyesight is fairly shitty, I'm higher than an aliens nipples, I have no license, the car isn't in my name, no insurance, no license plates, as usual I had a warrant and now I have to act like I'm not a 100&amp;#37; less AIDsy heterosexual Charlie Sheen. But, at this moment, I am.

Never once actually seeing a police officer, I pull into my girlfriends house. I have 3 polar pops in my car. One in one hand, two in the cup holder. I kept buying them on my way over to ""look normal"".

# I'm not.

I'm not going to bore you to death with the lovey dovey shit from her house, especially seeing as we ended the night and seeing each other with a fight. I somehow pulled it off though, blaming my heartbeat that could double as drumline on my actual heart issue. I was relieved, but you couldn't tell how relaxed that made me. I was also relieved we were arguing now, always over something stupid, and that I could bury my lie in anger.

On my way home, I stopped at my best friend's house and then decided to *do more speeeeeeeeeeddddddd*

I'm a fairly intelligent idiot. Did I mention that?

# By the order of the Jarl, stop right there! You have committed crimes against Skyrim and her people. What say you in defense?

Laughter that is common when we are all together became sinister. Something was wrong.

""Could it be the the copious amounts\-o\-shard?"" Nay.

It's never the drugs fault. These people who I've known for over a decade aren't friends. They have been using this time to plan my demise. They poisoned my water. (They didn't)

I run to the bathroom, throwing up stomach acid and possibly arsenic water tainted water. My friend asks if I'm okay from the other side of the door. I am silent.

""Think. Did any of them get near the water?"" I search the corners of my mind. ""Fuck! I gotta get out of here""

I bolt out of the house. I needed to be sure they did something before I retaliated and I wasn't sure. I was willing to die rather than kill my friend and I'm so fucking grateful for this because the thought truly crossed my mind. He would've never seen it coming and honestly no one in that house would have a chance. As I said, I'm a monster on binges like this. This is why I only buy $20\-$50 at a time.

My phone rings. It's them. Tears steam my face because I'm not sure what's real. I've never experienced this and definitely never expected to. They are family to me. He's my unrelated brother. The others in the house I can also say the same for, besides one woman who is an unrelated sister to me. In my eyes and to their admittance.

(This is also the fastest I've ever experienced a bout with psychosis. It starts on late day 4 and is full blown late day 5 for me and I try to never make it there surrounded by anyone but myself)

I don't give a shit about the police lurking, stalking me on the long ride home. I need to know what I'm dealing with. I need sanity. Headlights behind me that remind me of his truck appear on a dark road a mile from my house. My phone rings again.

""Bring it to the fuck on! We were family you cocksucking piece of shit"" I yell into my phone as I pull into my driveway. The truck creeps by, but I couldn't see it well enough.

I walked inside.

There is no sanity to be found. Only my AR\-15 and a quick bump of stalactite.

Loading up, as I know my friend is also a gun lover and could possibly come to finish the job since I thwarted his poison plan, I pulled a lawn chair to my front porch and sat in the freezing cold with enough rounds to start a war and end everyone on my side of town.

The truck rumbles by again. I can still remember that exhaust. It's identical to my friends and I still hear it today. In the same house.

I point my rifle at the truck as it FLYS by after seeing me.

""That's what the fuck I thought"" echo's behind it. I notice myself saying this when giving people ultimatums or overall being a shitty person at times, luckily rarely.

Rising out of the chair at every sound. Ready to die and take em with me. If war is war then war it is. That goddamn truck drove by again. I had enough.

I jumped into my car, so irresponsibly that it's gross, with a small .380 pistol, 24 rounds total and made my way to the back roads, hunting a ghost.

I am so fucking lucky at this point and honestly I'm not sure why God himself didn't strike me from this planet when I got into my car, but I pulled into gas station and lost my gun. Someone stole it out of my car as I walked in to get my final pack of cigarettes on this Earth.

I broke down. Life was over and I've done nothing but disappoint everyone I've ever loved and that's not a long list of people. I've squandered my life away and the only friend's I can truly call friend's are trying to kill me. My girlfriend is asleep and I can't say goodbye. I'm all alone with a bag of dope and nothing else but a phone thats being texted.

""Dude wtf? You ok? What happened""

*""You know what fucking happened. Just finish this.""*

""Dog idk WTF ur talking about, where are you?""

Fuck this. I wish I had my gun. I'd kill myself. Someone needs to come back and finish the job. I don't even want to kill whose after me. I just wanted to scare them away and out of my life.

I began praying to a God that I hope is out there. The same prayer I've prayed ever since I was a child honestly.

""Please, just end this. Let me go. I don't want to be here anymore. I'm not built for this place. I've been a lowly piece of shit for what you made me to be. Please do everyone a favor and take me away. I hate this fucking rock and everything on it.""

A song plays from my playlist on my Bluetooth radio in the car.

MGK \- Home.

**""Home**

**A place where I can go**

**To take this off my shoulders**

**Someone take me home**

**Home**

**A place where I can go**

**To take this off my shoulders**

**Someone take me home**

**Someone take me""**

It's funny that sometimes little shit like that happens when you're in a bad, bad place. I can recall a few other moments that a sign was given throughout my life. Whether it be imaginary, real or coincidence. It doesn't matter. It was enough.

# I was going home, to go home.

As I pulled into my driveway I called the police to tell them my gun was stolen, denying requests to come in to give the serial number and fill out the paperwork, and I locked my door behind me as I kneeled on my floor in front of it and continued my prayer.

A good amount of time I did this before I raided my bathroom cabinets and took an entire bottle of 20\+ Tyenol PMs as I returned to my spot in front of the door.

My heart didn't know what to do that this point. I faded in and out of consciousness. Each time I can remember little flashes of my view of my kitchen cabinets and my heart stopping completely and then pumping once more before I returned to darkness.

I woke nearly 2 days later. Stiff. Sore. Hurt physically and emotionally. So many texts of confusion. My girlfriend thought I was in jail and spent one day calling around to see where I was, thinking the worst of my well being. My friend hurt that I thought he tried to kill me, I had texted him to tell him to finish the job before I did and stopped responding. He actually showed up at my house to see if I was okay, but couldn't get in and didn't want to have me arrested which was inevitable had he called police. I later found my pistol. I was too high to remember where I put it at the time.

This is my second worst decision of my life. Falling in love with a crystal mistress. She made me reckless, wicked, dangerous and cold. She taught me a lesson I'll never forget.

Don't push limits with substances so strong. I did irreversible shit during that time. I have spasms in my arms, hands and neck still to this day from that night a couple months ago. Writing these honestly takes a bit of time because my thumb will jerk and cause errors. I barely speak to anyone in that house out of embarrassment. I further disappointed myself and my loved ones and I could've really hurt someone over nothing.

Everyone likes to joke on here about how great meth is, I'm here to show you the truth. It's fun. It's exciting. It's everything everyone says, but it's also misery and evil when you push your limits.

I tell people to stay safe in a lot of my messages and posts on here because of experiences like this. I never was and it could've lead to a serious negative outcome.

Sorry if this wasn't what you expected. It may be poorly written, it may shed a light on me that I'm a bad guy. I'm not. I'm just here to tell you don't do what you know can hurt someone. Think long and hard before you make your choice because you might be lucky or, even a higher possibility, you may be unlucky.

TL;DR: Car drive good, and do other things good too, including rain, mountains, city, town, cool weather, hot weather, and all things in between!

### TESLA REVIEW PART II: THE ELECTRIC BOOGALOO

## PART I: THE BASICS

Now we're on to the ACTUAL REVIEW! What's it like to drive a Tesla, for the average joe? I'm not a man who drives a BMW 3 series, or a Mercedes, or an Audi. Or a Lexus. Or an Acura. I don't have the latest Mazda 6 series. I have a FIFTEEN YEAR OLD Honda Accord. I imagine a large number of Tesla drivers will be coming from a similar experience \- so I want to share what it's like moving from a car to an electric\-powered rocket with wheels, airbags, and the most advanced cupholders I've ever seen.  


First, you gotta get INTO the thing. You walk up to it with cellphone in pocket, push in on a block bit which pops the handle out, pull the handle, and climb in. So far, I've noticed that this works 95&amp;#37; of the time. 5&amp;#37; of the time, it wants a key card. So you have to pull that out, and tap it on a spot just underneath a camera on the side of the car, then it \[probably\] lets you in.  


Getting out is a bit MORE odd. In the intuitive space where you would typically grab the door handle to release the door, a door handle to release the door has been placed. DO NOT USE THIS DOOR HANDLE. Your car will become ANGRY and use it's magic to warn you that you have used the door handle, and it will RUIN YOUR CAR WINDOWS AND DOOR. This is an emergency release lever. The actually door release is a small glowing button that, from the looks of it, appears to do who knows the fuck what.  


So every time you are leaving the car you have to stop the person and yell at them 'DONT PULL THE HANDLE. PUSH THIS PUTTON \- THE BUTTON RIGHT HERE THAT OPENS THE DOOR. THE DOOR BUTTON. THEN PUSH THE DOOR OPEN.""  


They still don't push the button, ever.  
Now, I'd put together one HELL of a playlist for my first drive, all kinds of cool audio to listen to. I was so ready to try it all \- I couldn't WAIT to pull out of the dealership and head out. However, I'd sort of needed a lift down (seeing as how my old Honda Accord died) and I ended up listening to some odd selections from big 80's hair bands, which was not what I had in mind for starship, really.  


  
BUT \- the sound quality was AMAZING! The audio was crystal clear, and the radio selection is unbelievable. You just say the name of a song \- ANY song \- and it will play it.  It's unbelievable. It comes with FREE LIFETIME LTE, so you'll always have access to your music and Google Maps.

  
The unfortunate side effect of this is the following:  
Every time you tell someone about this amazing feature, and ask them to choose **ANY** song, they choose 'Rock Lobster.' I don't know why. I don't WANT to know why. Maybe it's because the strange, foreign world of the Tesla feels as alien as the sea\-Klingon otherwise known as a lobster. I don't know.  If someone tells you about this feature, pick a song that isn't 'Rock Lobster.' Yes. It has it.  


Last is charging at home. When I brought the car home, I had NO 14\-50 charger. That's the big honker. I only had the standard, wall outlet plug available in my garage. What the folks at Tesla refer to as a 'Trickle Charger.' It was sufficient enough to get me up and running the following day, but I wouldn't write home about it.  


Thankfully, a good friend with a lot of electrical experience helped me install a 14\-50 outlet near the back end of my car. This IMMEDIATELY jumped my car up to about 30 miles per hour. This amazed me. I want to reiterate this isn't the Tesla Wall Charger. This is just a cable that comes with the car.  


This. Is. Amazing. Firstly, the unit itself is AWESOME! It lights up with a GREEN glowing Tesla logo when you plug it in!  To charger, you simply take the handle/charge end, point it at the charge port door, and push a button. The charge port pops open... and in goes your charger!!!! A little Tesla 'T' lights up, from blue to green, and the TESLA logo on the cable pulses.  


This feels less like putting gas in your car and more like putting 1.21 gigawatts into your Delorean Time Machine. It's neat and FUN!  


So \- a few things:  
1.) The port we installed is upside down, so the cable does a weird loop. Maybe look into that.  
2.) At one point it told me my car wasn't charging, and it wouldn't go anywhere. This was worrisome. I rebooted the car (you hold down both scroll buttons on the steering wheel) and it went away. Still \- creepy!  
3.) If you want to feel like you're parking a shuttle in the bay of the *Enterprise*, buy a Tesla.  


## PART II: THE DRIVE

Anyhow, the first drive is a little odd. It takes a few minutes to get the hang of driving with only ONE PEDAL. When you take your foot off the gas, the regenerative brakes kick in, and the car slows significantly.  This is, of course, easy to change with the software, but I'd suggest leaving it on. It's odd at first, but it's actually a better driving experience as you move on \- and it keeps your brakes from wearing out! It feels, again, a little like a skate board, where you push the car along, and then it slows down when you aren't actively pushing it.  
Next is the speed \- and the quiet. I'm used to knowing how fast I'm going by how exasperated my engine sounds. It sounded like a slightly overweight kid trying to run up a hill while pushing a slightly MORE overweight kid up the hill. This car has little, if any, sound. All you hear is music. The engine doesn't run. The wheel doesn't vibrate when you stop. The car is perfectly still. And quiet.  
My daily commute is a perfect test. I drive about 7 miles in town, 7 miles on a freeway, and a further 7 miles in the country and on dirt roads and into an animal sanctuary.  
Let me find some adequate words here: In the city, the car is like reclaiming your life. You can listen to music and sit in perfect harmony; in peace! It turns the entire drive into a peaceful, pleasant drive.  
UNLESS.  
You press down on the ~~gas~~ go pedal. Consider the folowing:  


The traffic lights through town are timed \- such that you press on the pedal, race up to 55 miles per hour (the speed limit is 45) and, upon reaching top speed, see a yellow light JUST out of reach. You can gun it, at which point you will most certainly run a red light, or you can slam on the breaks, such that your packed lunch, tic\-tacs, and make up pouch/fanny pack of sunblock/cupcakes for work fly into the windshield in an infuriating fashion.  


It is impossible to make one light if you catch the preceding light. You are stuck.  


Unless you have 100&amp;#37; torque, all the time. Then you can rocket through the first light and get to the second one before it turns yellow.  For the first time EVER, I shaved 3 minutes off my commute. I pushed down on the pedal and the car smoothly, effortlessly glided up to 55, and through the right just AS it was turning yellow, not before.  


No joke, it brought a tear to my eye. Zipping past both the 32 year old soccer mom in a RAV 5 adjusting her hair bun and yoga pants whilst answering text messages from her friend Tara, who's boyfriend Todd went out last night and didn't call her until almost 11:00 while going 40 AND the 75 year old geriatric grandma who's going to the store to pick up her medication and those little square cheese crackers her husband used to love so much whilst driving a 450 horsepower lexus from 2008 and driving 12 miles per. fucking. hour. is an amazing feeling.  


Weaving in and out of traffic no longer feels like a NASCAR race where you're struggling to get around other cars. It feels like an effortless jaunt. It's peaceful. If you want to get around someone, you can. It feels like snow skiing. You learn a bit to the left, the car goes left, around, and back.  


There is also a great setting called, ""Chill Mode."" Let's discuss.  


You will be tempted to floor it. Then, you will probably floor it. When you do this, the people in the car with you will want to puke. The car will suck you into the chair and your eyes will roll into the back of your skull, and then it will end because you shouldn't go 150 through a small town, or really ever. The experience is like shoving a rocket into the ass of a guy going down the luge in the Olympics, ridiculous speed, peanut\-buttery smoothness.  


Enter 'Chill Mode.' This decreases acceleration. To my little ear\-bone balancing bits, it feels like it also evens acceleration out to a more linear curve. It turns the car a bit more into a Honda Accord. I imagine it saves on fuel by limiting the power used and by discouraging you from lighting a firework under your ass every time you start the car from a streetlight up until you hit 55 miles per hour.  


If standard driving is Pod Racing, then Chill Mode is a remote piloted shuttle docking with the *Enterprise*. You are a leaf on the wind. Watch as your soar.

  
So in town, it's a huge bonus. Sitting at lights is quite and pleasant. You can listen to any radio station, streaming station, or song you can imagine. You can check the traffic. You can just chill.  
Second is the freeway. Leaping onto the freeway is amazing. It's a quick slide. The acceleration puts you at 70 before you're half way onto the ramp. The side effect of this quiet speed is that you'll probably need to use cruise control more, because you'll exceed the speed limit so effortlessly. The good news about THAT is you simply flick a scroll wheel and you're INSTANTLY going 1\-5 miles faster. No problem.

  
Now, I don't have autopilot (though I hope to add it at some point in the future) but even without it, freeway drive is a quiet pleasure. I have no problem zipping along, silently weaving in and around every 70 year old, heavily medicated Florida resident. Trucks in my way are a thing of the past. The car never feels like it's bending, rolling, or like the suspension is trying to keep up with the bumps and turns. It just... is.  


A lot of that road\-feel is adjustable. You can turn the steering from COMFORT to STANDARD to SPORT. This adjusts the tightness of the wheel. When in sport, the car goes exactly where you point it. You point a little left, the car points a little left. It feels more an airplane than a car in this way \- instant response.  STANDARD is a bit slower. The turns are a bit 'looser.' By this, I mean that the 'dead zone' where turning does nothing actually exists (where it did not in SPORT) and there's about a .5 second delay as you turn. It feels a bit more on par. Make a change, as you feel the change, respond as necessary. COMFORT feels like you're driving a Chrysler 300. It mostly works, and takes the car off in in a lilting, lackadaisical fashion. It does feel oddly comforting! It feels like you can 'do no wrong.' Sport feels like you could accidentally make the car fly off a bridge with a ill\-chosen tilt of the wheel, and comfort feels like you could spin the damn thing like the wheel of a cruise ship and it would slowly veer off to the right. I suspect for most folks coming from a non\-fancy luxury type car, the standard mode will be ideal.  


The last leg of the journey is through some rough country roads, and then a series of dirt roads.  This is the weak spot of the Model 3, I feel. Where the road is quiet on nice streets, the sound of bumps seems amplified. The peacefulness erodes, if only slightly. The car handles the bumps, but it handles them like a sports car. More than the Honda Accord, you can FEEL the bumps. This, I suspect, is by design. You feel connected to the road, as if you're brushing your fingers across its surface while you drive. Because the car is so quiet, the sound of those bumps seems amplified. Rough road seems coarse.  


On the dirt roads, the car isn't particularly awesome. It's a bit to firm for regular pot holes. I will say, however, that the weight of the car, and the fact that the batteries and balance of the car are all beneath you, makes the car feel well planted. I haven't tried to race the car, rally\-style around the dirt roads, but I imagine it would handle extremely well. It might be a bit uncomfortable, but I bet it would be very pleasant, if not as exciting as driving a car that has almost, but not quite, slid into the alligator filled canal sixteen inches to the right of your car.  


It makes me pine for a 'Top Gear' or 'Grand Tour' special in which they each take a different electric car on a multi\-part road race.  


So on that note, if you drive a large tractor more often than a car or truck, perhaps this isn't the car for you. If you live in a town that has twice as many dirt roads and NO Starbucks, and in which the tallest structure is a poll for a Barbecue Restaurant and/or a water tower, maybe consider a Ford F\-150.  


Lastly, the car handles great in the rain. I haven't tried it in heavy puddles, but the weight and traction on very, very wet roads is excellent. There appeared to be no serious hydroplaning \- and there are two added bonuses \- firstly, you can actually see all the rain through the glass windows. Secondly, the polarized, tinted glasses reflects into the water beading up on the car in the most beautiful way imaginable.  


Now, all of that said, this really only addresses 95&amp;#37; of driving. What if you want to take a road trip?  


Let's talk about the road trip.  


## PART III: ROAD TRIP

I decided I really wanted to put this car through its paces \- I have a sister deep in the mountains of North Carolina \- far from superchargers and the flat, straight roads of Florida's coast. I decided I had to make the Trek! This would be my Kessel Run, my Briar Patch, my Antares Maelstrom. I wanted to see how difficult it would be.  


I started my trip late on a Thursday night, with the intention of heading to Jacksonville. OF COURSE I ended up heading out late! This meant it was going to be dark. That's important. We'll get to that later And, since I'd needed to do about 50 miles of driving, I was probably going to need a supercharge.  


I decided to take my first ever supercharger stop in Daytona/Port Orange at around 9:00 PM. It was raining. The car hand done fantastically \- I felt less fatigue than in my usual car, and the ability to listen to radio stations, podcasts, music, or even to select the soothing sounds of bird calls all appealed to me. I was sort of excited to try the magic juice box!  


I hopped out of the car into the rain. This is the moment I discovered the first two big flaws in the general Tesla design: The chargers aren't covered. In Los Angeles or Nevada, this is no big deal. In Florida, this sucks.  


The second was more unexpected. The glowing lights of the supercharger made me feel better about the rain. They were beautiful, electrified beacons of clean energy, progress, and FREEDOM. But the also attracted spiders. Big ones. Every supercharger had it's own spider.  


I mean that. Of the many superchargers, ONE didn't have a big ass spider living on it. Further inspection revealed it was guarding an egg sac, which is soon to be a giant ass\-load of other giant spiders.  


I decided I wanted to be away from all the giant spiders. I needed to leave this place, immediately. At 9:00 PM in Florida, most things were closed, and it was very wet and nasty. There was one thing very close, and opened though: Chuck E. Cheese.  


Now, I love video games and pizza as much as the next man. Hell, I'd say they're two of my very favorite things \- however, I was presented by a dilemma: I am a man, in my mid 30s, wearing a soaked t\-shirt, traveling alone.  


I was about to walk into a children's eatery, alone. The interaction would, undoubtedly, go as follows:  


ME (sopping wet guy in oversized, comfy t\-shirt): Hello!  
HOSTESS: Hello sir! Are you meeting someone here or...  
ME: Oh! No, no. Just, uh... killing time. I thought I'd come hang out.  
HOSTESS: OH! Do you have any children with you?  
ME: Oh, no! I'm traveling along you see \- I'm on a trip up north... I just thought I'd come in here, since it's open.  
HOSTESS: OOoaaoo OooKAaaaaaAAy...?  
ME: No really, it's fine. Is there a soda and somewhere I can sit and just...  
HOSTESS: We're about to close... soooo.  


This is awkward. TESLA: Please put chargers close to things that won't make grown men seem like pedophiles.  


I climbed back in the car and just waited it out.  


So \- in the rain, I was arriving at Jacksonville. I was just about to head into the city when I saw a car on the right side of the road, flashers blinking. I immediately changed lanes to give the car more space. Out of nowhere, a man starts darting across the FREEWAY towards the car. I SLAMMED on the breaks.  I had a new update installed that supposedly changed the breaking distance, but it wasn't enough. I swerved into a different lane.  


It was close. It was very, very close. I can't stress that enough. The man DOVE out of the way of my car. If he had not done so, I would have hit him going about 35 miles per hour. I was within inches of this guy. I swerved into the right side lane. The person behind me was INCHES... literal inches... from my bumper. This forced me onto the ramp for a different road. I attempted to stop and turn around, but I couldn't find a place to pull over and the other cars were all trying to get around me, because I must have appeared to be a crazy driver (despite the guy diving onto the road).  I don't know what became of him, and surely I hope he's OK. I hope no one else hit him. I hope he turned out alright. I don't know how he could have misjudged my travel speeds so completely. I ended up taking a different route, but I'm a little disappointed the car didn't have some sort of warning system or auto breaking or some such. I missed that guy by a half second and maybe 18 inches, total.  


I arrived at my destination around 10:30\-ish and immediately fell asleep.  


The next day, I headed on to the next supercharger: Kingsland, Florida. I woke up early and ended up there around 8:00 AM.

This was a beautiful spot. Behind the chargers is a small pond with a fountain, and a number of yellow dandelions. The only food that was really in walking distance was a Cracker Barrel. Since I had about 200 miles worth of charging to do, I went over and had a little breakfast. This was actually a very pleasant experience \- the food was good, but their hot tea is crap.  


I was seated a a small table with only one chair \- it was a damn, damn lonely spot. I sat their, reading the news and drinking tea, hair shooting straight up. I must have looked like a crazy hobo. I'm surprised they never showed any concern as to wether I could pay.  


After a filling breakfast of oatmeal, sausage, fruit, and toast, I left for my next supercharger stop.  


The weather was much, much better \- and the further away from Florida's oppressive humidity you get, the better. I felt refreshed, and the sunlight pouring through the tinted roof was just right \- not to bright, not to dark. It made the car feel alive, despite the black interior. I've always been more a fan of beige, but the sunlight really seemed to 'wake up' the interior some what.  


My next stop was in Savannah \- at an airport. Of the superchargers I visited, this one is probably my favorite. Firstly, it's in a parking garage, which is covered, so the car stayed cooler and I couldn't have been rained on. Secondly, you have a whole CONCOURSE about 5 minutes away! The parking is pretty far from their, but the walk is worth it. The airport is lovely.  There's a Starbucks inside, a small place to grab a snack, and free WiFi. I was able to hang out and relax.  


It is about 5 minutes from the freeway, but it's totally worth it. It's a great charging location. BONUS: There didn't appear to be any spiders!  


My next stop was in Columbia, South Carolina.  The drive there was fantastic \- the weather was great, and, despite the crappy two lane highways of South Carolina, it was a pleasant drive among the trees.  


The downside was I needed to charge! Again. I have a friend with a Model S \- the same guy I talked into a Tesla, who in turn, talked me into one. I was very much excited to get his opinion on the car, as he's an engineer and an avid fan.

So thus began my first Tesla meetup. We drove the car. We drove to a neighbor's house, who also drove the car.  Here are his thoughts:  


* The steering is better, and tighter.
* The audio system is clearer than that of the Model S's standard audio.
* The car is smaller and easier to park.
* The U.I. was good \- not great, but good. The hardware is MUCH snappier and more responsive.
* The car had more than adequate power.

In short, he found the car to be better than his Model S.  He currently has another Tesla on order, but, a day after driving the car, he added a Model 3. To replace his Ferarri, which seems plagued with constant, expensive repairs. The Tesla, as he's stated in the past, 'just works.'

  
I should also add that the *other* car he has on order is a Roadster 2.0 (a car I'm very much anxious to borrow!) This endorsement, to me, is the most valuable I've had so far, and the most important indicator I've had this this is more than just a new car \- it's a the start of some form of planetary change.

  
Anyhow, I plugged into the wall charger at his place, and discovered that I could pull down about 42 miles per hour \- that's a LOT! A few hours of charging (while he went to Charlotte and back) was enough for me to drive around town the remainder of the day!

  
That said, the next morning, I still needed a bit of extra energy, and in a hurry! I hopped back into the car and ran to the Columbia, SC Supercharger. It's a bit inconvenient, as there are 3 freeways that all meet nearby, and I had to sort of head in the wrong direction to get to it.

  
That said, the charger was quite nice \- it's part of a Hilton \- and they had a great breakfast for something like $6.50, give or take! It was a nice way to start the morning.

  
Then it was off to our next stop, way up at a Sheetz gas station in North Carolina. The drive from Columbia through Charlotte is pretty boring. This is another decent location \- located in Hickory, NC.  

  
While we're speaking of cars, by a strange twist of fate, I discovered my favorite car of all time there (or a very close approximation of it, anyway!) The ECTO\-1! No matter how cool my car seemed, this is probably the coolest car of all time.  If I recall, the car itself, and ambulance/hearse, is haunted. Parking tickets placed on the windshield spontaneously burst into flames.  If anyone out there wants to sell a 59 Miller Meteor Futura Cadillac, please let me know!!!! Also, if you'd like to visit a really cool animal sanctuary and raise money one Halloween, also let me know!!!  
The next part of the drive was phenomenal \- I was in the mountains. Not hills, but real, honest to god MOUNTAINS.  
The best cars weave through traffic and hills, sputtering along with beautiful sound as they dance across the pavement, paying homage to themselves as they race through loud, open tunnels in the mountains.

  
The Model 3 doesn't bother with any of that. It eats corners \- taking a hairpin 180 degree turn still feels like a 180 degree turn, but somehow, you can stick to your lane, and you feel confident as you whirl through the mountains.  
The downside, though, is that there are no superchargers \- and only two wall chargers in the area. This meant I had to give up my car for about 5 hours.

  
During my time, I did have the opportunity to take a An Acura TSX into the Blue Ridge Parkway. It held it's own as I downshifted and tossed the car through the mountains \- though you do tend to feel awful sick after an hour or so of sloshing about.

  
Once I retrieved the Tesla, however \- it was like a slalom \- skating around the turns was effortless and fun. The sharp edges and terrifying drop offs, which before had been a real concern, were now fun, tight rounds \- the regenerative breaking made downhill great, and after a solid hour of downhill driving, I'd only used about 5 miles of battery, as the regenerative brakes had returned quite a lot of energy to the car!

  
It was, perhaps, one of the most enjoyable experiences of my ENTIRE LIFE, marred by the lack of charging ports and the worry that the uphill trek might overly deplete my battery.  


Another small side effect, according to my sisters, was the oddity of the car itself in this small town. A number of folks stopped to gawk at the tiny white spaceship \- not for any reason other than it's uniqueness. The mountains seemed to contain a huge number of Porsches \- lots of beautiful Audi's and a number of nice Corvettes \- but few, if any Tesla's. Many a college student stopped to see the strange white marble parked in the small town. I certainly didn't mind, but didn't think it was that unusual of a car \- it does, after all, look like a car. It is possible that the car was more familiar to this crew, given the college (and town) focus heavily on sustainability and green technology.  


The only issue was going downhill \- I wish there was a 'mountain mode' that would further utilize the regenerative breaking when on a decline over X percent.  There were a lot of twisty, downhill bits that could have used a bit of help!  


So, I headed home. I did stop at a new supercharger in St. Augustine, Florida. For some reason, the meter told me that all the spaces were occupied \- I arrived to find that NONE of them were occupied.  A few minutes later, my charging was 'interrupted.' I peaked around the corner, and nothing seemed amiss. I unplugged the cable and plugged it back in \- and everything seemed fine.  


I will add that the car was about 55 degrees when it arrived. When I stepped out, the 70 degree mountains and the 55 degree car met all my senses with 95 degree heat and extreme humidity. My whole body was covered with condensation. It felt like sweat, but it wasn't. It was terrible.  


That charge cost about $1.00 \- the most I spent on a charge was about $7.50. In total, I spent no more than $30 for the whole trip.  


On the last leg of the journey, I did hit some MAJOR thunderstorms. Again, the car handled them ably. The headlights came on automatically. The wipers adjusted automatically to the rain speed. The car did great through puddles, pouring rain, and Florida drivers once gain.  


I arrived home thrilled. It was a trip to remember in a car that still doesn't feel like mine. It feels like a rental, or a friend's car I'm borrowing. I'm still a bit cautious with it \- but it's fabulous.  


So what can I say about the car, in closing? Tesla has made a fantastic car \- one superior to any driving experience I've ever had. It's fun. it's fast. It's comfortable beyond measure. It's so customizable it can be anything you want to be \- a little star fighter or a great, lilting luxury car. It will satisfy you to no end.  


Unfortunately, I wasn't able to test the autopilot \- if anyone would like a review of that, you can either pay to have it added (I'd be HAPPY to take it! Really. I do not fear the robot overlords) and I'll take a trip and tell you ALL about it, OR I can borrow someone's car, at some point, who does have it, and I'll tell you about that!  


Thanks for reading!  


Below is my list of improvements and recommendations I'd love to see for the Model 3 moving forward!  


1. The button to open the door \- make it more obvious some way. ANY way.
2. We have free LTE \- I would love a weather map/weather updates/weather overlay for the drive!
3. Perhaps better warnings for people darting in front of your car? Please. Add this to the whole fleet. It could save lives.
4. Superchargers need covers!
5. Anti\-Spider super chargers. Maybe a different kind of glowing light that doesn't attract bugs?
6. The button to switch audio sources is in an odd spot. Bring it closer!
7. A few more awesome easter eggs would be great! I tried saying 'Prepare to make the jump to hyperspace.' and ""Warp 9. Engage!"" The car did nothing. I am dissapoint.
8. A 'mountain mode' that more aggressively breaks on a decline would be much appreciated!
9. Why can't I adjust the fan speed without a sub menu?
10. Why can't I change from 'Standard' to 'Chill' or from 'Comfort' to 'Sport' with the touch of a button, or by saying 'Go, Go Gadget Space Car?' I found myself changing depending on the system!
11. A bit more customization! What if I could use Standard drive and Sport on the Freeway, but the car automatically pulled me back into 'Chill mode' through town? I'd love a sub menu to customize my day\-to\-day!
12. Apparently, my charge port is lifted up a bit. Apparently, it's not supposed to be \- even though the folks at Tesla told me it's supposed to look like that. I'm not sure who to believe Is the charge port supposed to be completely flush?

That's all I've got.  The car is awesome. You save money on gas. Your drive is a pleasure! You get to reclaim your travel time as fun and/or relaxing. Your life will change a little bit!",t2_8oyp5,,,0,,The Everyman's Review of a Tesla Model 3 Part II: Electric Boogaloo,[],r/teslamotors,False,6.0,M3,,,,False,,False,dark,,#ffffff,public,,,{},,058bde12-fcac-11e2-9b06-12313b0cf20e,False,,,False,False,,{},Model 3,False,63,,,,self,False,1 f,[],,,True,,,text,6.0,,,text,self.teslamotors,,,,,,,False,False,True,False,False,,,False,12922b0c-8034-11e6-b5e8-0e7740f6c075,True,False,False,Model 3 Owner,,,,,,t5_2s3j5,,,,#ffadad,8p2m6k,,,JediChris1138,,13,True,all_ads,False,,,dark,/r/teslamotors/comments/8p2m6k/the_everymans_review_of_a_tesla_model_3_part_ii/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/8p2m6k/the_everymans_review_of_a_tesla_model_3_part_ii/,316946,1528306434.0,0,,False,,,,,,,,1345154154.0,1536342475.0,,,

## TL;DR: What's it's like to get a Model 3 for the average guy, more or less!

## PART I: THE MYSTERY BOX

I have been driving a 2003 Honda Accord, a white one, for about ten years now. Have you ever been to a local mini\-sized fair, where all the rides are really for five to ten year old children? But you decide you're obligated to go anyway, so you hop on the teacups. The teacups are stained with the vomit of hundreds of kids across a dozen years. The paint is has chipped off, so the smiling Mad Hatter now looks like the Joker, if someone told the Joker that purple striped suits were \*OUT\* and he cried so hard his makeup ran down to his chin. 

So you're on this old ride, toned down to make it more comfortable for the young and the elderly. Age has taken some speed from an already less than trilling ride. You give it a few spins, but you're resigned to the fact that, at best, this ride will make you mildly nauseous. You stop spinning it and wait for it to end and watch other people walking around the park as you slowly rotate towards them, then away. The ride stops, you get out, you have a beer, a hotdog that gives you inadequacy issues, and an elephant ear, then you ride it again, because outside of smelling the poo of animals mixed with deep fried Cheerios on a stick and counting how many lightbulbs of each color are out, there isn't anything else to do.

\*THATS\* my Honda Accord. Old. Reliable. About as exciting as a PBS Special on how envelopes are made. Perhaps once, in the age of analog TV and rotary dial phones, it was a little bit interesting, but no more.

The car runs like a champ, but the tint on the windows is peeling off. My view is surprisingly obstructed. There are a few marks in the car, and while it doesn't smell bad, it doesn't smell particularly good. It has enough power to to not be a small economy box car, but none of the charm \- putting the pedal to the floor makes the car look up at you and ask, ""Are we doing this now? Ok, fine I guess..."" And with a groan and a sigh, it moves along, one more face in the caravan of life.

Let's switch gears for a minute. A while back, I started reading about a new car. The Tesla Model S. I thought it was really neat, but it was way out of my price range.  It was incredibly fast. It was incredibly safe. It had a MASSIVE digital display instead of a bunch of gauges. It didn't need gasoline. At all \- just electricity! Most importantly, it was FUN to drive!  

Since it was beyond my reach, I instead sent bunches and bunches of articles to a friend who might be interested. Lo and behold, he got one! On my next visit, I asked to drive the car, which he happily obliged! The car was... phenomenal! The roof was all glass! It felt big, and roomy, and OPEN! It was QUIET! The drive to ANYWHERE was peaceful! And most interesting of all, it had an amazing cruise control system called 'Autopilot.'  It would practically drive itself. That's some *Star Trek* level shit right there. After just 10 minutes, I have the following expectations about the 2020 model:

1.) The computer will explain to you that the power couplings on the negative access have been polarized, and then a 3D printer will make you a cup of Earl Gray Tea.

2.) There will be a lever I can pull that will cause the car to enter a swirling blue vortex that will open up at my destination.

3.) I will have a Wookie as a copilot

4.) Cupholders will be rendered unnecessary because a tube will drop from the roof and you'll be able to use the giant touch screen to select any beverage you can imagine, like those really awesome drink machines at newer chain restaurants. I'm hoping for Fiesty Cherry Diet Coke, but La Croix is also acceptable.

I love this thing. So Elon Musk, the space faring god\-child who owns Tesla, says he's going to make a mass market car that will be mostly affordable. It will have 240\+ miles of range, and it will cost only $35,000.

Elon, named, I assume, by the Head Rubaple Space Czarian of his home planet, says the car will be on order March 31st of 2016 \- and that evening, he will 'unveil' it.

There is almost no information on this car \- but having experienced the Model S, I decide it's time. I'm ready for the future. My current car existed before the iPhone hit, or the advent of the X\-Box 360, or the idea of .mp3's became ubiquitous. There is no auxiliary input. There is no digital display. There is no computer information of any kind. Bluetooth isn't a thing. This car predates all those advancements. If 'The Flinstones' was remade today, it would take place in 2003, and the Honda would have been the funny car they drove, except with out the convertible T\-Top.

So I get in line around 10:30 AM on March 31st, 2016 to put down money on a car I've never seen. There is already a huge line of insane people. Fanatical people. They are probably a bit overexcited for this car. Not unlike Jesus, people are clamoring for this thing sight unseen, however, unlike Jesus, they have a near\-lust for it. It's almost like Jesus came back as hundreds of attractive strippers, now available for hire, and with cup holders.

This looked like iPhone on steroids, which surprised me. Cars are an awful big investment compared to a cell phone.Anyway, I wait through the line, mega\-excited, place my order calmly, and step out.

That night, the car is unveiled. It's not bad looking! Like all of the Tesla's, it looks like a a decent car! I've always hated the design of current hybrids and electric cars:

AUTOMOTIVE EXECUTIVE: We need a new car with a new 'vibe.'

DESIGNER: Cool. What did you have in mind?

AUTOMOTIVE EXECUTIVE: Something bold. Something NEW! Imagine... a mailbox!

DESIGNER: Go on!!!!!

EXECUTIVE: Now, take ONE side of that, and make it SWOOP back. That'll create the illusion of SPEED.

DESIGNER: Swooping mailbox \- got it! I'll add some tires and have it to you by morning!

Anyway, the event goes on \- the cars look fun! They have a 0\-60 time of about 5.4 seconds and a 210 and 310 mile range! That's AMAZING! The car sounds like a very slightly modified, very slightly smaller version of the Model S, which is a good thing. While I'm disappointed the handles don't jump out to meet me like they would on the *Millennium Falcon*, I'm more than enthusiastic about this car!

Now to play the waiting game. According to Elon, they'll be available towards the second half of 2017. I have put money down to gamble on a car, and it's paid off. I'm towards the front of the line for what will be one of the coolest things ever created \- a fun, sporty electric car. I love the thing, and I'm excited for it \- it's only a year away!

**JANUARY 2018**

I've stopped putting money into my Accord, but the Tesla is no where to be found. More information is available about the car, and it's damn near the most amazing thing I've ever seen in the universe. A few people have actually GOTTEN them, and I am insanely jealous. This thing is a WONDER!

My login says my car will be available to configure sometime between January through March.

**MARCH 2018**

My login says my car will be available to configure sometime between March and May. I ordered the car March 31st. It has now been two years. Their is a $7,500 tax credit for owners who receive the car before it hits the 200,000 mark. I become a human calculator, checking spreadsheets, scouring the web to see if I should get the standard car, or hurry and get the extended battery, or really do WHATEVER I can to pick this beast up. My excitement has hit a fever pitch. I have a feeling not unlike an astronaut about to enter space. I've created a playlist of music for my first drive. For about four months, I'm convinced every tank of gas will be my last.

""HA!"" I think, after I pour more of the smelly, explosive liquid into the car's feed hole. ""THAT should do it.""A few days later, when the needle starts pointing towards the small birthmark on my right pinky toe, I roll my car back into the station, tail tucked between my legs, and repeat the cycle.

I decided to test drive a Model S \- which is a great car, HOWEVER, the salesman decides we need to see insane mode. I tell him no, I really DON'T need to see insane mode. He does insane mode. The sensation is a combination of a roller coaster starting, a skateboard going down a steep hill, and a dozen sand bags being slowly pressed into your body, then suddenly flung away. It's fast, but also vomit inducing. I couldn't eat dinner for about 3 hours whilst my stomach traveled back up my bowels and into it's usual resting cradle.

**APRIL 2018**

I have researched the car to death. I have seen every YouTube video imaginable on the thing. I am now convinced I can drive the car with my eyes shut. I know the console, display, dashboard, and stitching inside and out. I can almost smell the vegan leather. I know how to operate every system, including systems my car won't have. I've seen how the battery is installed, I know where the fire department will need to cut me out in the event of an emergency, I know how the car should be towed, and I'm familiar with the roughly 15\-30&amp;#37; panel gap misalignment issues that have plagued early cars. I have waited, I have watched. I have become excited!And finally, after what seemed like an absolute lifetime, and after saving as much spare cash as I can possibly muster, the day arrived. It was time to configure my Model 3 \- possibly the coolest piece of automotive technology in the entire universe.

## PART II: GRAVITY, ENTROPY, PROVIDENCE: RECEIVING THE GIFT OF MODEL 3

April 6th, 2018 \- I get an email. Now it's time to configure the Model 3. I have no interest in any bonus features, really, except for the extended battery \- however, because the car is one of the early versions, and you can't change much, it does come with a few other add ons \- an armrest at the center console, extra USB ports, a glass roof, and some type of seat improvement. Their are only a few things to choose.One is the color. The other is the wheel size and rim type.I choose the default tires and rims, as the rims add roughly 5&amp;#37; mileage by reducing drag on the car. For paint, I opt for Pearl White. After doing way, way too much research, I determined that pearl white (over standard white and silver) is the coolest car color, from a thermal perspective. Pearl white is highly reflective, and can reduce the ambient temperature inside the car by 20 degrees. In a battery operated car, this means less cooling, less damage to interior materials and technology, and less wear on the systems.

So I begin the waiting game.

**MAY 2018**

A VIN, or Vehicle Identification Number, is assigned to each car during the early manufacture process. In early May, I received mine! My car is being, or has just been, manufactured! It exists! The car I've thought about for probably two years, the environmentally friendly crack of lightning, intent on destroying every car in its class, now exists somewhere in the desserts of Nevada. Or Freemont, California. Or something. One of those.

I receive a tentative delivery date of the 25th \- this is the same date as the movie '*Solo*.' And as my current car has a license plate that says, 'My other car is the\* MILLENNIUM FALCON\*,' I decide this car must be the\* Millennium Falcon\*.

My date is changed to May 23rd. At this point, I'm restless. I'm doing my best to play it cool, but inside I'm a barrel ninja monkeys on cocaine and Red Bull. I've seen ONE Model 3 in real life. I'm about to receive a car I've never driven, I know little about, with a drive train I'm completely unfamiliar to me.I just have to make it a few more days...

Only I don't. On Monday, the 21st, I leave work for a much\-needed Doctor's appointment. I have a terrible cold and cough that I can't seem to shake. As I leave work, I notice my engine barely turns over. I pull into the office Maintenance area to see what's going on. The folks at work confirm my alternator is dead. It has expired. This, combined with old spark plugs and a few other weak spots, has transpired to keep my out of my car.

I hop on the freeway to take the car to the mechanic. This was not unlike asking a geriatric to pilot a rocket into space \- the heart was willing, but the car just wanted a long nap. My freeway speeds fluctuated wildly from about 75 miles per hour to about 50, on and off. As the engine died and gravity pulled my car down the freeway ramp, a mere tenth of a mile from my destination, I sighed. The car was now in a busy intersection. It was very hot. It was raining. I was coughing. And the police showed up. And I don't even have the juice to run the emergency flashers.

There are few places less fun to be around than in hot, pouring rain with a cough whilst battling the flu, except maybe filing your taxes.

Anyhow, the officer is extremely friendly and helpful and PUSHES my dead car to the mechanic, who pronounces it dead.The irony that, two days before I take delivery of an electric car, it is the electrical system of my current car that has killed it. A part of me is sad. The car was unendingly reliable and a good companion. I took the best care of it I could, and it outlasted even my wildest expectations. It was a real trooper.So now I need a lift to work \- until Wednesday the 25th.

The process of picking up your car is a really neat one. They bring you into a little room with a congratulatory certificate and you sign a few papers. This takes mere minutes. Then it's on to your car, which is waiting not far away.

And just like that, you're in front of the car. It felt like a miracle \- one that wouldn't have happened without a lot of saving, tons of research, and the invaluable help and support from a friend! Even having learned every detail and little oddity online, it's still an odd experience to climb into one for the first time. I'd thought for the longest time the car would be less intuitive than the gauges and buttons I'd been used to, but in fact, the opposite is true. It's like using your iPad \- it's simple. It's MORE intuitive!

I'll save the rest for a second blog post \- TESLA PART II: ELECTRIC BOOGALOO, in which I drive a Tesla for a week, then take it from Florida deep into the mountains of NORTH CAROLINA via the supercharger network!

,NintendoSwitch,"I've been following this game's development for a bit now, and it just released and has already exceeded my expectations. I haven't been seeing much buzz about it on this sub or in general (it's not even in the top 30 for digital only on the eShop) and I want to make sure it doesn't fly under the radar. This is sort of a pseudo-review but it's mostly just me recommending the game.

  


**Gameplay**

The core mechanics of JS&amp;B are very simple, but it's their execution combined with the amazing level design that really shines. You play as a little shape. All you have is movement and a dash, but the levels throw so many things at you that any more complexity could have been overwhelming. The entire game can also be played in up to 4 person multiplayer, either locally or online. The basic objective for each level is to avoid all of the pink things and make it to the end of the level alive. The game definitely won't make this easy for you though, sometimes more than half the screen is covered in things you must avoid. However, it manages to never feel unfair. While memorization can help you through a level, everything is clearly telegraphed enough that it is avoidable based purely on reactions. Outlines of obstacles will slowly come in, giving you some time to get out of the way before you take damage. Your dash also has some fairly generous invincibility frames, allowing you to get out of tight spots. Additionally, if you're playing with other people, they can rescue you from death by touching your shape before it drifts off the screen. This being said, JS&amp;B is still quite challenging. Some of the levels can take you many tries to get through. However, the game provides many options to enjoy it even for the less skilled or patient player. During the story mode, you can activate casual mode, which gives you double health and makes it much easier to make it through some of the tougher levels. There game also has party mode, where you can't die. This is great for playing with friends and for people who want to just listen to the awesome soundtrack and enjoy the ride. There is still incentive to not get hit, as whichever player takes the least damage gets a little crown for the next song. In addition to story and party mode, there is also challenge mode. This is where you can play online multiplayer, and is also one of my favorite modes. In challenge mode, you and three friends or internet strangers make your way through three songs. For the first two, you are given a selection of 3 tracks and the players get to choose which one they want. The last one is a random boss fight. All players are awarded beat points at the end, which both function as a score and can be used to unlock more songs. The last mode is playlist, where you can just choose what song/level you'd like and play through it. You are also ranked on your performance (except in party mode) and each song can be S ranked, providing a lot of replay value.

  


**Story**

The game doesn't have much of a story, but surprisingly, there is one. It's presented wordlessly and conveyed only through the visuals and music. It's not a lot, but it's still interesting enough and provides a bit of context between levels. The world map also has some fun background details and does a good job of connecting the levels.

  


**Presentation**

This game looks great. It is accurate to its name, with basically everything being some sort of shape that goes along with the beat. It's definitely not pushing the hardware, but it has a distinctive style and is very polished. Every level is unique, and as far as I can tell no animations are ever reused. Everything syncs if perfectly to the song. The menus are clean, simple, and aesthetically appealing. You can tell the developers really wanted the game to just feel fun. It all comes together into a cohesive while and makes the game feel like a big dance party. It's great.

  


**Soundtrack**

What would a rhythm game be without a great soundtrack? JS&amp;B has a great collection of songs done by many different artists ranging from EDM to chiptunes to anything in between. The entire game syncs to the music incredibly, every track complements every level and vice versa. There's not a bad song in the bunch. It's an excellent OST and it's the best I've heard since Celeste.

  


**Conclusion**

Just Shapes &amp; Beats is a great time. If you like rhythm games, bullet hells, great music, or just fun video games in general, I highly recommend it. It has a good amount of content for the price and lots of replay value, and it's accessible on many levels from coasting through and just enjoying the audio-visual spectacle to trying to S rank every song. It's only $20 and it's an awesome game, don't let this one pass you by.

,Metalcore,"[Four years ago I made this post that describes a lot of Japan's metalcore/post-hardcore scene at the time.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metalcore/comments/1psjz0/a_look_into_japans_metalposthardcore_scene/) Many bands on that list have broken up, changed their name, or are on hiatus. So I'd thought it be a great time to revisit that list, and make an up to date version of what Japan's metalcore scene is in for 2018.

A lot of the bands on that previous list aren't what I would consider metalcore that we listen to today. I don't want anyone who may live in Japan to take this in a negative way, but at the time of that previous post Japan's metalcore scene was behind where everyone else was. To a degree, it still is. 

What I'm meaning is that bands would create a new single, post it on YouTube (and it might not even be the full song), and then release a physical CD with that single on it and one or two more unreleased/unheard songs. That would be their release for the year; a physical CD only available in Japan with two or three songs.

Bands also were relying on a heavy use of high cleans in their material. That's not the case with everyone though. Even before Rio joined Crystal Lake and blew up, Kentaro was doing a very 
(old) Parkway Drive-esque metalcore sound with their ""Into The Great Beyond"" CD in 2010 (I'm ignoring their 2006 album Dimension as you could tell they hadn't really found their sound yet). A similar story can be said with Crossfaith in 2009 with ""The Artificial Theory For The Dramatic Beauty"" and Her Name In Blood in 2010 with ""Decadence"".

Since then, a lot has changed for the better. Bands have started pushing Bandcamp, Spotify, and iTunes for their release. Over half of the bands on this new list have their music up for digital purchase/listening while not even close to that was the case on the previous list. Along with this, bands have began to phase out high cleans and drop dat tuning.

I'm excited for this list as I believe it's much better than the one four years ago. You will see some bands on this list that's also on the previous one, but they're the ones you just can't ignore or have changed their sound dramatically since then. Also just because a band is not on this list but was on the previous list doesn't mean I think they're not worth listening to anymore (such as [coldrain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2teepAfDrXI), listen to them, they're great). This time around the list is going to be rely more on metalcore than post-hardcore as well. The previous was a bit of both as there just wasn't enough bands to make a full list last time on solely metalcore. That is not the story now. But please dont think both lists are the definitive encyclopedia of the Japanese scene. I'm only one person and can't possibly find every band out there that's worth listening to, which is subjective anyways.

But enough talk, let's get into it. Here are a lot of bands hailing from Japan that I think you should listen to:

[**Playlist here**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y)

* [A Barking Dog Never Bites](https://youtu.be/74zQEqiAcds?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) - these guys are all over the place, they've got two vocalists (one who does cleans and also raps at times, while the other screams with a decent range), their bassist is also amazing

* [A Ghost of Flare](https://youtu.be/1fQ-YcwF9tY?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) - changed some members around and have put in a lot more hardcore influence in their sound since then. [Here's another single from that same album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMEk9zWikP4)

* [abstracts](https://youtu.be/wJ9lvSM3EI8?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) - You like Northlane?

* [After The Fading](https://youtu.be/cFErkDUVwlg?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y)

* [Azami](https://youtu.be/Stby8tS-M3w?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) - probably the least metalcore in this list as they lead hardcore, though still belong here IMO

* [Before My Life Fails](https://youtu.be/p6vdQGd1Qdg?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) - have since previous post disbanded, but left us with their 2nd full length album that is by far their best material

* [Blackagly Force](https://youtu.be/JZerZ_tkWh4?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) - breakdown-core 

* [Breathe My Words](https://youtu.be/7Koqjf0M4uY?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) - vocalist has some good range

* [Crystal Lake](https://youtu.be/jX8RTjUUcLE?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) - at the time of my previous post Rio had just come in replacing Kentaro and they were about to release ""Cubes"", you know who these guys are, and if you don't you're about to as they are one of the forerunners of the Japanese scene by telling everyone else how to tune their guitars

* [Crossfaith](https://youtu.be/R4c2tGS83e4?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) - another one of the forerunners in Japan, you probably know who these guys are too, heavy electronica influences

* [December Everyday](https://youtu.be/ymxJLtBnSNs?
list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y)

* [Devil's Inlay](https://youtu.be/n4qk5NRlvZE?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) - more melodic death metal than the rest of the bands on this list

* [Dyslexia
](https://youtu.be/xye2FRKM9pc?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) - breakdown-core: The Sequel

* [Each of the Days](https://youtu.be/DHrabI7QAjs?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) - one of their drummers left the band since the previous post (yes, you read that right) and they have changed up their sound a bit

* [Earthists.](https://youtu.be/LXi7oGDnwik?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) - You like Invent, Animate?

* [F.P](https://youtu.be/4WaCzk6YCsU?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) - you know how hard it is to search for these guys with that name?

* [FOAD
](https://youtu.be/43oS5GiLWUk?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) - this band is even more genre-crushing than ABDNB, you like post-hardcore alt-rock symphonic djent?

* [From The Abyss](https://youtu.be/lAieaC98N1c?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) - the cleans will throw some people off this group, but they got breakdowns that will make you rock your head

* [Graupel](https://youtu.be/cZ0vSNXe6-M?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) - DO NOT sleep on these guys, they are all talented as hell and will be releasing their [debut album on July 4th](https://graupel.bandcamp.com/album/bereavement)

* [I Promised Once](https://youtu.be/pG-pABD_trc?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) - might be better to not watch the video due to second hand embarrassment and awkwardness, cleans are also very glam metal but screamer is top notch

* [Inception of Genocide](https://youtu.be/h4kaiRwzqG4?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) - can get pretty deathcore at times, lead singer reminds me of Mitch Lucker

* [LOST](https://youtu.be/67RhGjwp-CA?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) - if you like this song I'd strongly recommend listening to the full album, ""Back &amp; Forth""

* [Jester May Fail](https://youtu.be/Q7TIupRynvo?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) - You like BLEGH?!

* [Make My Day](https://youtu.be/G1HQCeuzT14?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) - formerly Ashley Scared The Sky

* [mildrage](https://youtu.be/PMxbN9om_tQ?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) - another band who utilizes two vocalists, one is female, and both do cleans and screams

* [Paledusk](https://youtu.be/Ct6B17jdDa4?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) - the group on this list probably using the deepest tuning

* [Prompts](https://youtu.be/ZlUcaVI_DEg?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) - vocalist has a fantastic hardcore scream

* [Sable Hills](https://youtu.be/-sPhGWrNJt4?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y)

* [SAINTZ](https://youtu.be/nFFj6kPzKwc?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) - I feel as if this video was recorded in the same room that Crystal Lake's ""Prometheus"" was

* [Shark Ethic](https://youtu.be/t2kjMAT1Ovw?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) - breakdown-core: HD Remaster

* [Shores](https://youtu.be/65kxSpZKIZs?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) - have broken up since my previous post, but got back together for a new single with hopefully more music to come this year

* [Skygraph](https://youtu.be/dOMH9OHWXHE?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) 

* [Soul Japan](https://youtu.be/e336xsKgd54?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) - a solo project led by the way too talented Gaku Taura, previously of A Ghost of Flare and current drummer of Crystal Lake

* [Wavelets](https://youtu.be/xNxDz7NCrUo?list=PLKEZ4EY3S5hlZ3rne6q3plA34Ej-FBa2Y) - another band that's just starting out

Here's a bonus for you guys as well. [It's a South Korean metalcore band called End of Days \(thanks to u/Dmac5797 as I originally thought they were Japanese\) featuring guest vocals from Crystal Lake's Ryo.]

,DDLC,"*Ossi’s POV*

“Ugh...there’s nothing out here but sand...sand...and more sand. Wait...wait...nope still more sand. How exactly did we get picked for this reconnaissance mission anyway? It’s not like there’s really anything here to recon. Can we just go back to base already?”

Sayori looks over at me and smiles.

“Now Ossi, there’s no need to whine. It’s nice and peaceful out here and we get to spend some quiet time with each other. I’d thought you’d be happy about that.”

She is right. Despite my gripes with the two of us being sent by the commander to assist Outpost Actone, I have enjoyed my time with Sayori. Normally, we’re either training or fighting so there’s very little time where it can be just the two of us. Hopefully when we get back to our home base, we can spend time together that doesn’t involve walking around the desert for hours on end.

“Hey Sayori, since we’re heading back tomorrow morning, what do you want to do when we get back?”

“Hm...I dunno. I am craving something sweet though. Maybe we could go to that place that sells those really good milkshakes.”

“You mean Boistothayard Shakes?”

“Yeah that one!” Sayori says excitedly.

Suddenly, a small screen containing Commander Booker, the commander of Outpost Actone, appears in our cockpit.

“Hello Commander.”

“Hello you two. You two can head back to base now. We gathered all the recon info we need for now.”

“Roger that. Cinnamon Valkyrie will return to base ASAP.” Sayori says with an over enthusiastic salute.

“Haha, alright you two. Just make it back soon. It’s getting dark. We don’t want you two out there at night. The Bullis in this area are a bit different than the ones back home. Booker out.”

And with that, his screen disappears. Thank the goddess Doki. Sayori and I fire up the vernier engines of Cinnamon Valkyrie and fly back to base.

------------

***The next day***

*Yawn*

I slowly open my eyes to see the sun peeking through the window. I turn to the alarm clock and notice that it’s almost 8am. I let out a deep sigh and grumble to myself. The one day I don’t need to get up early, I find myself waking up early. At least today Sayori and I get to head home.

“Os...si?”

I guess my grumbling was a bit too loud. Sayori sleepily looks over at me with the worst case of bedhead I think I’ve seen. She sleepily smiles at me before plunging face first into the pillows again.

“Sorry. I didn’t mean to wake you up.”

Through the pillow, I can hear her say “it’s ok”. I place my hand on her head and run my fingers through her hair. I hear a pleased sounding “hmmmm” as she removes her face from the pillow and turns to me.

“We get to go home today. I’m so excited to see the others. I miss them.”

“I do too bun.”

Sayori giggles as she places her hand on mine. My life has been far more interesting since she came into it. I remember the day the tryouts were held to see who would help co-pilot the Dokis. I remember seeing Sayori standing in front of Cinnamon Valkyrie and looking at her for the first time. There had to be at least one hundred other people that day all vying for the right to be her partner. I swear she must’ve seen me looking all goofy and awkward at her because even though she was far away, I saw her smile at me. I don’t know why but seeing her smile made me even more determined that day to win the right to be her co-pilot.

The fight to become a Doki co-pilot isn’t something that is easy to do. You have to beat out every other competitor and only the last one left standing, gets that title. I had to go through a LOT of people to earn that title but at the end of the day, I wound up winning the right to help Sayori pilot Cinnamon Valkyrie. My buddy Nem told me that by the look on my face alone, that he would’ve thought I had won the lottery. I’d have to say, I sorta feel like I did.

---------

Sayori and I refuel and resupply before flying back home. Thankfully, unlike the other Dokis, Cinnamon Valkyrie, is actually capable of self-flight, so no need to wait on a transport carrier for us. About an hour or so later, Sayori and I begin our flight back home.

While in route, we receive an incoming transmission from home base. Sayori flicks the little notification icon and the commander appears.

“Pilot Sayori. Pilot Ossi. Are you two enroute?”

“Yes sir. We’re about to pass the Western perimeter marker now.”

“That’s good. Commander Booker informed me that your recon mission was a success. Good job you two.”

“Hehehe, thank you Commander.” Sayori says playfully.

“We should be back at base within the next ten minutes sir.”

The commander nods.

“Yes, we can see you on the scanners now. Be safe you t….”

I watch as the commander’s expression changes.

“Pilot Ossi, were you escorting something back to base?”

“No sir. Why do you ask?”

A map of the area appears next to the screen containing the commander. On the screen we see two dots heading for base. One of them we recognize as us. The second one seems to be heading toward us. Sayori looks at the second blue blip on the screen.

“Uh sir, what is that? Is one of the other Dokis out?”

The commander shakes his head. 

“No. All the Dokis have been accounted for and the Anti-Bulli alarms aren’t detecting anything. Whatever that thing is, it is heading straight for you two. Hurry and get back to base.”

Sayori and I push Cinnamon Valkyrie to her max as we make for the base. No matter how fast we seem to go, the unidentified second dot keeps pace with us.

“What on earth is that thing? It’s keeping up with us!”

I feel a chill run down my spine. I turn to Sayori who, judging by the look on her face, felt the same thing. To our side, we see what looks like a dark storm cloud barreling across the horizon right toward us.

“Engaging combat systems. If this thing is looking for a fight, we’ll give it to ‘em.”

--------

*Battle POV*

Cinnamon Valkyrie spins to face the oncoming storm cloud chasing after them. The skies above change to an ominous dark color. Whatever this thing is, it’s presence alone is enough to change the weather of the surrounding area. Sayori and Ossi draw Cinnamon’s main weapon, a large double-edged spear and prepare for battle.

Sayori and Ossi can see the dark figure come into view. Without slowing down, the beast leaps over them, careening to a halt behind them. For the first time, the two of them finally get a good look at what was pursuing [them](https://imgur.com/gallery/FcQFJ).

There’s a noticeable fear and revulsion in Ossi’s voice as he speaks.

“W-w-what the hell is that thing?”

Before Ossi can have his question answered, the monster lunges at him and Sayori, it’s fist cocked back to strike. The two of them evade the strike as it craters the ground where they stood. The two of them swing their spear horizontally to counterattack. As the blade nears its mark, it’s suddenly stopped by the monster’s hand. The face on it’s knuckles giggles before throwing the two of them away like they were a ragdoll. Sayori and Ossi plunge the blade of their spear into the ground to slow themselves and using their momentum, spin themselves upright. A screen containing the commander appears to the right of Sayori.

“Commander, what on earth is this thing? It doesn’t look like any Bulli we’ve seen before.”

“It’s because it’s not a standard Bulli. We have no information on whatever that thing is, but it has the same energy signature as Badooga.”

“Wait, isn’t that the thing that was talked about in the last episode?”

“Yes. If that thing is anything like Badooga, you two need to exercise extreme caution. Treat it as if it’s a S Class level threat. Be careful you too.”

Sayori looks back at Ossi with a wide smile.

“Huh? What’s the smile for?

“Well I was thinking, how about we skip the fifteen minute power up sequence and just get down to business shall we?”

Ossi smiles back at Sayori.

“This is one reason you’re my favorite bun.”

“Hehehe~. Initiating HNG System!”

The eyes of Cinnamon Valkyrie take on a soft blue glow as the HNG System engages. Sayori and Ossi level their spear at the beast. The beast lets out a deafening roar that causes the clouds to open and the entire area to be enveloped in an intense lightning storm. Cinnamon Valkyrie dashes forward, attempting to impale the monster. The beast suddenly opens its maw and fires out a column of obsidian fire. Sayori and Ossi manage to narrowly dodge the attack as it scorches the air and ground near them. 

“It can breath fire too? Is this thing just an amalgamation of all the “nope” in the world?”

“Watch out!” Sayori cries.

Cinnamon raises it’s spear to block another thunderous punch from the beast. Sayori and Ossi dig their heels in, doing their best to try and block as much damage as they can.

“Dammit this thing is way stronger than it looks.”

As one of the beasts punches is being thrown, Sayori activates Cinnamon Valkyrie’s thrusters and spins around, attempting a counter blow. The beasts punch connects with nothing but air. The momentum from the swing is enough to not only allow them to evade the monster’s attack but also to connect the blade of their spear with the side of its head. The strike sends the beast reeling back, shrieking in pain. The inky black blood of the beast drips from the tip of the spear.

“Wow. Good job Sayori.”

“Hehe yeah. Had no idea if that would work or not.”

Their celebration is cut short by the enraged roar of the monster in front of them. The eyes dotting its body begin to all turn red and glow as if they were on fire.

“...I’ve seen enough anime to know when the bad thing’s eyes change color, that is never a good sign.” Ossi states matter of factly.

Sayori and Ossi barely have enough time to raise their spear as the beast charges at them with frightening levels of speed. It pulls back its arm attempting to pummel them into the ground. As the punch connects, Sayori and Ossi hear the chilling sound of their spear shattering. Before they have a chance to react, another punch levels Cinnamon Valkyrie allowing the monster to mount them. 

A sadistic expression can be seen on the monster. What can only be described as laughter can be heard, as the monster wraps its hands around Cinnamon Valkyrie’s neck. Both Ossi and Sayori feel themselves struggling to breath. They attempt to punch the monster off them but that only causes the monster to clamp down even harder. 

Ossi looks at Sayori. The expression of fear on her face terrifies him. The look in her eyes, as if she’s reliving a painful memory from her past, is all over her face. His vision begins to darken and blur as he reaches for her. 

They were supposed to go get milkshakes when they got back home. They were supposed to protect each other. He was supposed to protect her. This isn’t how they die is it? Crushed to death by some eldritch abomination?

….

….

….

A quiet voice can be heard from the cockpit of Cinnamon Valkyrie as their vision goes completely black.

“No.”

Suddenly the entire battlefield is blanketed in a blinding light. The pained shrieks of the monster accompany the cracks of thunder and lightning. 

“I won’t let you take my sunshine away!”

In the cockpit, Sayori gasps for air. She turns her eyes to see an enraged Ossi. His eyes changing to an intense fiery blue color. Ossi turns his gaze toward Sayori, a warm smile replacing the death stare that was just there. He extends his hand to her. Sayori takes Ossi’s hand. As their hands meet, Sayori feels an intense energy course through her body. When she opens her eyes, her eyes have the same fiery blue flames as Ossi’s. Cinnamon Valkyrie slowly makes it to its feet. Sayori looks over to Ossi with a fevered intensity in her eyes.

“Let’s kill this thing and go home.”

A small screen appears next to Ossi. 

“Before we do that though...now where is it…?”

Ossi scrolls through the screen till he comes to what he was looking for. He presses the button and suddenly the cockpit is filled with [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2NFG4XWbWk).

“Ah. “Music to Murder Bullis To”. Thank you for making this playlist for me bun.”

Sayori lets out a slight giggle.

Now with the proper soundtrack, Ossi and Sayori both prepare to take on the monster.

“I am Ossi: The Eldritch Hunter. Firstborn of the House Doki. King of the House Cinnamon. The Bunlover. Knight of the Queen of Wholesome. The Lightning Commentor.”

“I am Sayori: The Queen of House Cinnamon. The Sunlight of Hope. Dispeller of the Storm. The Golden Heart. But you wanna know what my favorite title is? The one that we share monster?”

A large golden brown glyph appears at the feet of Cinnamon Valkyrie as it slowly rises in the air. From behind them, dozens of more glyphs appear. Cinnamon Valkyrie holds it hand out to it’s side as a giant, golden lance of deus ex machina appears. Cinnamon points it’s lance at the beast, and as it does, Sayori and Ossi speak in unison.

“***The Bulli Butchers***.”

“*Unaware of loss*”

“*Nor aware of gain*”

“*Withstood the storm to create hope, waiting for its arrival*”

“*Our light will never fade*”

“*Cinnamon Valkyrie, Special Technique: [Unlimited Doki Works](https://imgur.com/a/WUhoD6G)*”

From the glyphs, spears of light emerge, converging into one singular beam of light directed at the monster. The enraged monster, not content with simply rolling over and dying, unleashes a wave of black fire. The two attacks converge, creating a power struggle between the two of them. Light and darkness intertwine as the struggle shakes the surrounding area. 

The beast buries its heels into the ground as it attempts to overwhelm Cinnamon Valkyrie with its hellfire attack. Sayori and Ossi scream in defiant opposition to the monster as they push Cinnamon Valkyrie to its absolute limit. The convergence point for the struggle finally grows too unstable and explodes. Right as the flash begins to dissipate, the monster sees Cinnamon Valkyrie barreling at it. Before it can defend itself, Sayori and Ossi plunge their lance into the chest of the monster, skewering it as they drag its body along the ground. A trail of blackened blood extends about a tenth of a mile from the point of impact.

Sayori and Ossi place the boot of Cinnamon Valkyrie squarely on the monster’s wound. The monster howls out in pain as the two of them drive their foot into it. They raise their lance ready to deliver the finishing blow.

“Now do us both a favor and *die*” Sayori says with a tinge of madness in her voice.

Before the deathblow can be delivered, Cinnamon Valkyrie is sent skidding away. 

“What the hell was that?”

“Look Ossi!”

Standing where they once were was the last thing they were hoping to run into.

[Badooga](https://imgur.com/a/0KMbtYW)

Badooga looks at Sayori and Ossi and then to the wounded monster. Badooga places the monster on its back and runs away.

“Hey get back here you meanie! *That was my kill*!

Sayori tries to pursue Badooga but she feels her knees buckle. The onboard computer system flashes in front of her: [HNG System disengaging]. The two of them collapse, using each other to prop themselves up. The sound of labored, exhausted breathing gently reverberates within the walls of the cockpit.

“I guess...we...can count that...as a win right?”

“Y-yeah...let’s go with that…”

---------

*After Battle Analysis*

A rescue squad was dispatched to retrieve Cinnamon Valkyrie. Upon returning to the base, the scientists and researchers of the city, took the battle data of Cinnamon Valkyrie and analyzed the unknown Bulli Beast. Despite sharing a similar energy signature, the beast was not a Bulli Beast like Badooga, Hugn’t, or (what has since been known as) Thigh-chan. The beast actually shares closer genetic properties to the four Doki pilots, causing the researchers to reclassify it from “Bulli” to a new category called “Doki Beast”. Further study will be necessary to answer several lingering questions, such as where did it come from? Are there any more like it? Who the hell would come up with something like this?

--------

*A few days later*

*Ossi’s POV*

*Ossi’s room*

I sit in my room playing my favorite game, SuS, while I wait for Sayori to come over. She said she was coming over so we could finally go out and get those milkshakes we said we’d go get. While playing in a lobby against Leo, Stuart, and Jack, I hear a knocking on my door.  I make my way out of my room and gently open the door.

On the other side of the door is Sayori in a long, red raincoat. Weird, I don’t remember them calling for rain today.

“Uh, hi bun. You’re early.”

“Hehe hey Ossi. Sorry for being early.”

I close the door as she walks in. She pivots and turns to me. She seems happier than normal.

“So what have you been up to?”

“Oh nothing, just playing with Leo and the others. You want anything to drink?”

“Water would be nice.”

I walk over to the cabinet and pull out a glass. I reach into the refrigerator to get my water pitcher when I hear a faint noise coming from behind me. I pay the sound no mind as I pour Sayori her glass.

“Alright Sayori did you want ice or n----”

As I turn around, I drop the cup on the floor. I realize what that sound I heard a second ago was. It was the sound of Sayori’s raincoat hitting the floor. Why does that matter? 

Because that raincoat was apparently the only thing she was wearing. My entire body tenses up as she playfully sways back and forth, her hands behind her back. She slowly walks toward me.

“S-Sayori! W-w-what are you...I...I mean...I...uh….”

She walks up wrapping her wrists around the back of my neck. I find myself losing whatever semblance to a train of thought I once had. She speaks with a calm, flirty tone.

“You know, I was thinking. I don’t want milkshakes anymore.”

“Uh...ok...what do you want?”

“I still want something sweet. Just a different kind of sweet.”

Without saying anything else, she grabs me by the collar of my shirt and brings me to my bedroom. Just as I pass the door, she twirls around and kisses me. The subtle taste of sugar and what I’m fairly certain is apple juice is still on her lips. After a few moments, she pulls away and pushes me onto the bed.

“You wanna know what I wanted to be before I became a pilot?”

“Uh...a nurse? An astronaut? A professional nap taker?”

Sayori looks me in the eyes as she gets on top of me. She leans in close to my ear and whispers.

“A cowgirl hehehe~.”

,ElectricForest,"To help decide which sets I will be catching at Electric Forest \(2nd weekend\) this year, I listened to all 158 artists on the lineup and compiled my impressions of their sound, style, and overall vibe. Sometimes I had to rely on first impressions, other times I got much deeper into the catalog and even sourced some fun facts about the artists themselves.

I do this every festival season to help me make decisions on lineup conflicts or to find new acts to see that I hadn’t heard of before but this is the first time I am posting my impressions. I don’t always know the proper terms, especially in electronic, but I did my best to convey the experience I had listening to each artist.

## !!!

Feels like Fall Out Boy without the angst. [Dancing is the Best Revenge](https://open.spotify.com/track/2PAn8J9dbmSnR4fLjpgehC?si=cG2CMTXlTQO5hPuJknexJA) got my feet tapping for sure. Apparently it’s pronounced “check check check.”

## AbJo

Instrumental electronic, [For What It’s Worth](https://open.spotify.com/track/6KJHwy5B3d85fHrRrwuNan?si=mMDkfiAYRt6GVb2--bqWxg) definitely played up the summer vibes. Could find literally no bio information about him but looks like some of the track titles are in Portuguese \([Alma Do Sol](https://open.spotify.com/track/4m8tlz5ArYPrBfNCkJ3pzj?si=gaW_ss1rQMu1nWZpKPU3DA)\) and I definitely get a Brazilian sensibility in his music.

## Air Credits

Rap duo from Chicago, only 4 tracks on Spotify all w/ \&lt;2k listens. [This Could Be Bad](https://open.spotify.com/track/2NxK59MATUT9bjRZABuDxd?si=R6XjJeBdRI23T3kbT0GK5w) had decent flow.

## Anna Lunoe

Love me some badass lady DJs. She’s true dance music, not too heavy into bass and BPM is up there but not full rageface. [I Met You](https://open.spotify.com/track/4VPBrJfT6CAu9ktgoU28Bj?si=27brQy7MRuaTJIPe-t7pmQ) her most well known track, [Stomper](https://open.spotify.com/track/15kdGzJcLr8TgxQVMy3sP1?si=EWxfBuqETHOECb_kyVKC1g) and [Radioactive](https://open.spotify.com/track/1w3K9vULEEnS56XNiY9Qyj?si=9PQxZEbSQ1yA9mDxGcNxtw) brought some fun energy as well.

## Aqueous

For whatever reason, when I saw this name I thought it would be another basshead group. It very much is not...it’s almost like indie alternative ballad rock. [Don’t Do It](https://open.spotify.com/track/56XM9BGCwEzutNMbHWD70z?si=dWomqSqtTvmZCOTbORjX3w) was my first introduction: 9\+ minute song with a long guitar solo that almost brought in some metal influences.

## ATTLAS

Mellow summer vibey. [I Need You More](https://open.spotify.com/track/5nfl1oLAAHdlfNHFKWCVAC?si=xs-DnltpR3Caw0olTi_Gug) plays with vocals but more as a looping instrument than lyrics. [Shadow Play](https://open.spotify.com/track/14Y6AtQimcsVwXDUKlbB3W?si=TC-vNJl4TtmcE2VkCsdzjQ) more traditional song with lyrics, prob my fav actually.

## Bassnectar

One of my Forest companions made a big push for this dude and I’m glad he did, such good dance music that doesn’t just rely on big drops but takes you on a journey. [Was Will Be](https://open.spotify.com/track/1olERLnSeLfDNsMPFCi7TK?si=5G6iBsbkSKy2qdbCtHeofA) was my first intro and it does a good job drawing you in w/ high melodies and female vocals but always keeps an edge that makes it really engaging to listen to. [Speakerbox](https://open.spotify.com/track/1ti43ZT6bc4o1eGOSnBHkO?si=3vUHFiB4RKifrWA-MJY0uA) brought in some more hip hop style vocals but still kept things from getting too aggro by keeping the bass in check. Remix of Ellie Goulding’s [Lights](https://open.spotify.com/track/3nPpCn5nYTMg0ajmzv57Jq?si=6Qq2SqNIQfyuz1WLdFlWdg) was super cool too, for a festival set that is going to be all dance party it’s always good to get some songs in there that are more universally familiar to keep the crowd energy up.

## Beau Young Prince

Rapper out of DC, got a groovy flow to him. I can’t really place who he reminds me of...I got twinges of A$AP on [Two For One](https://open.spotify.com/track/5CSOrBtd9fiIMd2Bggsyzx?si=7XxG2Hn4QUSczxJVNHQnQQ) \(more the production than the vocals\) and Fetty Wap on [Power Trip](https://open.spotify.com/track/3KK3h5vqz9Xsz0tsqhu3qy?si=ZC9tcga3ShqS4nNNQpxA9Q). Could be fun to check out for a change of pace, not a lot of rap on the lineup. [She The Type](https://open.spotify.com/track/5XSUVQWE90IrBCI5nxTneX?si=vQZeC95pRYWSMF8b4VbYbg) popped up a few days later after doing my initial dive and prob my favorite track.

## Big Something

Would want to listen to some more to make sure this is an accurate assessment but [Club Step](https://open.spotify.com/track/4xPvYvyJ2ZObQOdYRKzC7a?si=ng0D7Z7oRa2vriBh2mFVRg) was grungy guitar riff central. Almost makes me feel like they were able to capture the sound of lasers to go along w/ the drums and guitar. I dig. [Song for Us](https://open.spotify.com/track/57lOagpbrS9oL3pHcXQONR?si=wxr2wJoHRd6CcN81V6Hzkw) still captured that laser sound that was so memorable in Club Step but this was more of a jam band feel. Extended electric guitar solos should play real well in the Forest. I would flag this as an early frontrunner for surprise hit of a set.

## Bishop Briggs

[River](https://open.spotify.com/track/0TGTE9TEh9qzuFwmtRNICn?si=gmXQheShTN6B0wzlSHlz6A) has definitely popped up on a bunch of playlists for me...it’s one of those songs where she starts soulful and builds up this yearning for strong vocals that don’t come in until about a minute in. [Never Tear Us Apart](https://open.spotify.com/track/0zdzgfhY18Au7dD1hOrTrX?si=7wXD1cPBRdOABNoU14XEUw) is on the Fifty Shades Freed album \(it was the Spotify album art, don’t judge me\) and it’s actually delivers exactly the vibe the movie is going for.

## Blackgummy

Heavy bass, [The Machine](https://open.spotify.com/track/4FefDGQlG3flM3I10aG1UL?si=KIm5p81ZSZWqnBBCErT20g) had a bit of a gurgly sound to it. [Plucking Technology](https://open.spotify.com/track/5Hbetns0qdbHpbK4sAuYYt?si=m_iuYjy9TBGp_0wFByTIIg) hit me with a more erratic deadmau5. [SuperHuman](https://open.spotify.com/track/3pGQ3dwcxARDft3mspWHKn?si=c_1X07F9S2ed98s-vV0sPg) by far my favorite track and probably least like the others.

## Bonobo (Live)

He’s deservedly really popular but he’s one of those guys that just kinda missed me...I never found myself drawn in enough to commit. It’s super chill, a lot like Tycho. [Migration](https://open.spotify.com/track/61g7oQKm8DFEL7r2g9LS8x?si=N5-PIerkTfWKy2Je6MIIfw) is very mellow, [Kerala](https://open.spotify.com/track/5DAjrJqXqYtgr67pVhmUeR?si=qvHkH1fqTcaMtiRKbTduJw) brings it up a bit but still very chill.

## Boogie T

Super bass’y, too rich for my blood. [Bad Motha](https://open.spotify.com/track/100YMZ73Ij3TKNRB08wHdT?si=xNWlX3JVToKBF3J-XFkpsg) was honestly pretty hard to listen to. Looks like he’ll be B2B Squnto on Friday and playing w/ live band on Sunday \(will be interesting to see how this translates to live band\).

## Boombox Cartel

Here’s what I wrote when I vetted these dudes for EDC last year:

*A lot like Slushii, very synth heavy on* [*Jefe*](https://open.spotify.com/track/7ielYE7gGD2NLZOS0xuKto?si=vJLh1o2cQmq2HEq55fy36g) *not quite my jam.* [*Dancing with Fire*](https://open.spotify.com/track/4UciArpih1UoflaDFRGtlZ)*, on the other hand, is pretty dope \(I’m always a sucker for good female vocals on an electronic track\). Overall probably a pass for me but depending on conflicts I wouldn’t mind checking them out.*

## Bubble Gutter

Nothing on Spotify and the top YouTube result was [bizarre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXouPsrC1pY). Not sure I’m super inclined to try and chase this down...

## BUKU

[Front to Back](https://open.spotify.com/track/2zZRCaghsCm5aOEolYapnG?si=DvAm-hv-SYOAsD0Ew_Z7jg) is right along that line for me of dubstep I enjoy and dubstep that turns me off. I’ve always loved anything Spinnin Records puts out though, so that’s gotta count for something. Probably not going to be enough here for me to go out of my way to catch this set but if I found myself wandering through I wouldn’t be upset.

## Calyx &amp; Teebee

[Where We Go](https://open.spotify.com/track/7lChRNCZeQlZBrHW1HdRUN?si=8Re6MXcJSW2H0CeGNyb6Tg) is house meets reggaeton \(I think maybe consider this moombahton?\) and together take a trip down techstep lane.

## Cassian

Upbeat electronic, instrumental only on [Know U Well](https://open.spotify.com/track/20nDYyRNL4u5Kukzy1pL6z?si=q6f7Jv7ATTKJxJnQTm6gUw), vibey lyrics on [Running](https://open.spotify.com/track/7HGH1CkqLwUkXgNAVf31q7?si=Em5P0mdYRdGggTRlqDx2Lw). [One More remix](https://open.spotify.com/track/0BfxprYfu6ZKVBJL2pFU1q?si=OyqtxmxASsibnbOg7BYgPw) brings in more dance influences.

## Chalk Dinosaur

[I See The Sun](https://open.spotify.com/track/59MzhFrvcrmYPAHIrq9fT1?si=SOLUQ5BjS7qTt69dNlcJhw) brings out a little Beach Boys with a little George Thorogood guitar attitude. This would be a fun show to catch in the middle of the day but I don’t see myself investing any significant time here.

## CharlesTheFirst

Mellow electronic instrumental, [Mercy Falls](https://open.spotify.com/track/6oSxm8jKgVbrlKo4Ktd1qr?si=iOfVlm5nQAihCmCAT-ejIQ) would be good for settling into workflow focus but not sure this is what I personally look for in a festival environment.

## Cherub

Listening to [XOXO](https://open.spotify.com/track/1YzIe5I0UNPgPRPxYpe92f?si=1nnewXXOSk2E_H8EFQe0TA), I got a very distinct Prince vibe from top to bottom...the vocals, rhythms, use of synth sounds. This strikes me as a good vibes dancing kinda crowd.

## Chris Lake

Reminds me a bit of Jamie Jones but with more of a 90s house DJ vibe. [Piano Hand](https://open.spotify.com/track/2kv5Z38j5V5p3sAiU6iI3h?si=IybcHw1nTN-XTb33DmLs2Q) feels like something I would hear in an arcade/pizza shop in the mid 90s.

## Chromeo

These guys are gonna be cool, got a synth sound that is really hard to get right but they nailed it. Dancing is always gonna start with hips here, almost got a 70s funk to it on tracks like [Tenderoni](https://open.spotify.com/track/0iHxnDGfUSMtrWHZIGF9uL?si=ztRNFa0lQzy6QA5KW29Ptw). They do a good job using volume to navigate rhythm changes \(almost like an intake of break before picking up your pace in a run\). I had flagged [Bonafide Lovin’](https://open.spotify.com/track/3mtxdHVUg0JFP6rdOfssXz?si=NhtN3pC8ScCik4H159tlpg) from [my monthly playlist in March 2013](https://open.spotify.com/user/brettasnyder/playlist/2y3rtD9XCpqHRPPKjPgVHE?si=MmIqJ8TcQveVeoXVGBdK6g), which I think is a pretty fair assessment of their overall vibe. If LMFAO wouldn’t apologize for party rockin’, Chromeo is serving up that bonafide lovin’.

## Claptone

Feelin' a little ODESZA on [No Eyes](https://open.spotify.com/track/6zutgObWlxx1A95cjAYGwB?si=CZpJtHldQ9-eutoVjdetPA) \(20M plays on Spotify\). [Heartbeat](https://open.spotify.com/track/2uGWFmJYpJMUNhzG1Zg6LN?si=87AjV8-rQd-MrdUaIvzvhQ) also cool, never gets too carried away. Looks like he rocks a mask like the doctors wore on Assassins Creed, which is pretty dope. [Puppet Theatre](https://open.spotify.com/track/46fAKTnbopehOmOoSYTion?si=nsou3kuaTiGGlzfH3344gQ) with Peter, Bjorn, and John is a v natural fit.

## CloZee

Trippy, got a pretty cool Japanese vibe to it. [Koto](https://open.spotify.com/track/4TmwuMVty1K2qBJnYFpnNs?si=575oaRyeQHGiYEZpKNxG2A) sounds like it would belong on Kill Bill soundtrack \(during a non\-stabbing scene\). Lyricless so solid work/chill vibes. [Secret Place](https://open.spotify.com/track/7nYSThKhGZuaOQ8zeKSm1X?si=6EeFoBpyS1iWT4u-c8Fv0A) was also cool, a little more mellow than Koto. Even though this is primarily electronic, she is classically trained in guitar so there’s definitely a sophistication that I really appreciate and she seems to incorporate actual instruments into her music as often as possible. [Inner Peace](https://open.spotify.com/track/4nC3lnqFUrkwuImM8WTrap?si=dP7Ols1GSDyjQH2D0ylMNA) definitely goes a lot harder on the basslines.

## The Comet is Coming

Really cool upbeat instrumental w/ heavy emphasis on jazz horn on [Final Eclipse](https://open.spotify.com/track/7mCL2LKHdraRa3yqXtymkK?si=3tEIIqnLT0aTqnmIlkymcg) \(love that track name too\). [Ascension](https://open.spotify.com/track/1pwqM6HL17oUmxWpSSze61?si=isKD7KUhS7CFl9zshUckyg) also cool track, very jazzy.

## Corrupt

[My Type](https://open.spotify.com/track/5MDyVbZhsFNbNzU5nWqgJB?si=qIHPH0ooQyqMIuKWZ3751g) throws me back to 90s techno dance. Not a ton of Spotify play and nothing particularly interesting here, fairly generic retro dance music.

## Corey Henry &amp; The Funk Apostles

Smooth jazz on [Seven](https://open.spotify.com/track/1ZZeTJA78VzNIIEmQP2RoU?si=rjW7Yq4HTke3nTBUUwBquA) that was enjoyable.

## Crankdat

Reminds me of Party Favor actually, you’ll have tracks that try and go total rageface \([Stoopid Rich](https://open.spotify.com/track/3cURfOu0w2obSRR3v6zAKz?si=NNyWl0iaS9uk6U_EB-PK3Q), [Dollars](https://open.spotify.com/track/78DXxHA3S8Y7yXbBx1pgAU?si=PTGemCFAR4eQWwUoXPfQzw)\) and others that are standard pop dance music \([w/ T Pain](https://open.spotify.com/track/3CeHJhDLOmTlqdZfrRtx3u?si=tEaTbw9YT3qxxNPQbrMGYg) no less\).

## Cut Copy

[Where I'm Going](https://open.spotify.com/track/4ueuplDNBS2fBbsqV0w5nc?si=Kz3-sF9cTsuKURWSD8kTNQ) felt like a song you would hear opening for Cheaptrick. I had flagged [Need You Now](https://open.spotify.com/track/1abUzN0mxXuoiGsMvj1FxS?si=-qWa6SNSQtOaQbfJiGL52A) on my monthly playlist back in [April 2013](https://open.spotify.com/user/brettasnyder/playlist/7tirCUKbuWpT2wHz8LQMYW?si=CRvDZ10QQ9a62QrVyXIjXA) as a cool track \(recognized the dope album cover\). Was a little surprised to see them up there as a subheadliner but I gotta trust that Forest knows what they’re doing here.

## Cut Snake

[Noisy](https://open.spotify.com/track/4vjs3Q1ygCDlVhfG6kC7lD?si=uLCdNYxLT2qopWlBjFbIKA) was pretty generic electronic, threw in some interesting crescendos but nothing that grabbed me. Pass.

## Dena Amy

Very soft sound on [Your Eyes](https://open.spotify.com/track/66h9qtMTxn092DLN5Y86L5?si=Hf8_Jar9TAOnWfISkWXRUw), almost timid. Same with [Wait For You](https://open.spotify.com/track/0kcA6Jb4OUYR0olR0o7E34?si=ysO9g0pKTY2Km0stLo8pOQ) \(Cut Snake did a [remix](https://open.spotify.com/track/2rlKV7AKmXXs98Q7HLzJrW?si=d2PLahs4QdevU_xcvfCYyw) of this track as well\). When she does use bass it kinda feels out of place.

## Desert Dwellers

[View from Lanaikea](https://open.spotify.com/track/4xo9SkUEaX2NxOcqqAMsYr?si=cH0ny6ajSwi_qe3HhN-rsg) was actually pretty dope. I’m not sure how to describe it, I want to say trippy but it feels a little more outer space. Let’s go w/ “astrotrippy.”

## Desert Hearts Crew &amp; Friends

All I could find was [this playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/datatransmission/playlist/07NZ7LAh2t88KqSDiJONIv?si=nqfjK6YTTs23KnUkdYvwwA) from a stage takeover, not anything from this artist in particular. My assumption is that this is going to be one of “off Broadway” acts at a small stage tucked away somewhere. Looks like this might actually be a Marbs project.

## The Dip

I wish the lead vocals were stronger on [Ain't Necessary](https://open.spotify.com/track/0zrlyaSLInQjYmft7BqTGu?si=LM9406skRJ-wDw3FpTp0yg). It's a cool big lounge vibe but the lead vocals aren't strong enough to carry the song as written.

## Dixon’s Violin

Name pretty much sums it up, mellow instrumental. I was happy to hear [Space Journey](https://open.spotify.com/track/5wcDtMQYswG4Hsnj42HB5q?si=5dsd2V0WQo-L2gyYCCyeRg) used a lot of plucking sounds \(not all traditional violin notes\).

## Doc Martin

Nothing that really grabbed me. [Emerald City](https://open.spotify.com/track/4kSuF1LBcTJURkoNnO9LBR?si=qzcCZtbOR6iQtDIB4DdUgw) was top played track on Spotify and it was pretty vanilla. Will be B2B Lee Reynolds.

## DROELOE

[Kitsungi](https://open.spotify.com/track/1MXPdYCJiVqTtMu32zFzvP?si=CVB6YpW0TkSdgS8bxMjUhA) almost has a Flume'y vibe, playful rhythms with rolling drop.

## Dub Trio

[En Passant](https://open.spotify.com/track/3kQeLtNyUiKS6BloVUqSaN?si=mfbyPSqXQlORi16u-XI0rQ) has that rock n roll feel that made me think ""man, they don’t make 'em like this anymore.""

## Edaa Birthing

Nothing on Spotify, nothing on YouTube...are you a ghost??

## Elderbrook

[Talking](https://open.spotify.com/track/6uQe7SVjdDlRqDRAi0qnKg?si=AImEJVpfQYatRQOJZTODPQ) was pretty slow, kept waiting for it to pick up but it never delivered. [Cola](https://open.spotify.com/track/7ir1tVqAtNjctvteJPw5MF?si=XNHl3brTS0yUjow8BdgN8A) has almost 80M Spotify plays and is definitely more traditional dance music. It seems like Elderbrook was the supporting cast on Cola though.

## Elohim

I knew I recognized this name but couldn’t find any track titles I recognized. [Hallucinating](https://open.spotify.com/track/39Qv03aCbWnguEMWzUDao2?si=oBenmbV_SzGnK3ecNNSHFQ) came on playlist and this is definitely the one that has surfaced for me before...it’s got almost a childlike feel to it, feels like it belongs in a less\-dark version of Alice and Wonderland. Does some cool stuff w/ violin that you don’t hear very often in music like this.

## Emancipator

Really chill dude, I got turned onto this by a guy I know that works in a digital agency as really good focus music, very elegant. [Greenland](https://open.spotify.com/track/2SPTGg9SC5MT1FwNX4IYfx?si=ALBynHWuQwe7_h3WjMVFbA) prob his biggest track, [Pancakes](https://open.spotify.com/track/3iNtgGeNegXb8ZMUCc77CB?si=_CmcT9HzQGWkPyjno-IMCw) came out last year and still the same great vibe.

## EOTO

[Time Saw](https://open.spotify.com/track/43szumPPvfg21oOqIJRyQd?si=hNaC8If_TKiUQYTq8dYg6w) feels like you’re sloshing around in the belly of a sea creature \(in a good way\). Almost like a deep gurgly sound, definitely heavy but not full of bass drops. Was very well balanced.

## Eprom

Got a bad taste with this, the word acid comes to mind \(and not the good kind\). [Prototype](https://open.spotify.com/track/6qh3wyeEIpzzk4qNnqULvR?si=FsiO1G2wTkKpI9AATkpu3w) was too abrasive for my personal tastes.

## Everyone Orchestra

10 people in the group, brings that big band sound for sure. [Funk Explosion](https://open.spotify.com/track/32NQBfkWUeJavQuP6T3JT1?si=8wICXVoLRCqDq1zqD6LD0A) cool track.

## Flamingosis

Brings soulful R&amp;B vocals over fairly basic electronic rhythms on [Ohhh Baby](https://open.spotify.com/track/2xCiGZZOLGodAsNJi3lHBc?si=3snezRh8RSyUZpHHo63tPg). It was cool but prob not something that's gonna keep my attention.

## Fruition

Folksy, reminiscent of a traveling band. [The Meaning](https://open.spotify.com/track/1A2TSsGcCiX4GhLi13hTrQ?si=9MG-nZLhRPe4rVWQS1JxkQ) I can’t really place what it reminds me of but it is very soothing. I do always like a track that can communicate a story without vocals and the jam section to wrap up was like another vocal\-less verse.

## G Jones

Doing some cool stuff here, seeing lots of collabs w/ Bassnectar on [Mind Tricks](https://open.spotify.com/track/11Cz8Naeb1fIOqtkkPVNzg?si=YWw2emj5TfmK9wEq0Fh4PA), [Underground](https://open.spotify.com/track/6q7bYKH84sRAloYodj4Jfz?si=jyPCc5aESYKqvb0Vnq42jw), and [The Mystery Spot](https://open.spotify.com/track/6Nwx9hniDms0YH9hZSP1Ye?si=NQEMOrwsSKiuM03lpwAKtA). Even the stuff w/ Bassnectar was a little too aggro for me and then his solo stuff kinda doubles down on that. He’s a lot like Eprom, not surprising to see he’ll be B2B Eprom on Friday and solo set on Sat.

## Get Real

[Mind Yo Bizness](https://open.spotify.com/track/0QCl9rZxNa6wJDAcLawmy9?si=fYDE2AQeQ1iUhCXQXePj5A) was monotonous. [Snuffaluffagus](https://open.spotify.com/track/0xrFl8umf6tMbEVLRZGM6j?si=JQQHafwfSwyEPM99sssdbQ), while a hilariously awesome track title, also pretty uninteresting and overuses the gorilla vocal effect. These are the only 2 original tracks on Spotify.

## The Glitch Mob

[Animus Vox](https://open.spotify.com/track/4c9FIjxXYYEyD9iH02fvbu?si=ceAYQTuJR2qlF7KCyqPEwg) was the first song I pulled up, very matrix’y and almost futuristic. Feels like it belongs in deep space. The fact that it was a 7\+ minute track really let them take you on a journey through their music and deliver a deeper listening experience.

## The Glitter Sparkle Unicorn Spectacular

Nothing on Spotify or other searches, all I could find was [another Redditor trying to hunt down the same info](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricForest/comments/8jovme/the_glitter_sparkle_unicorn_spectacular/).

## Golf Clap

Melodic but pretty uninteresting. [Make Me Feel](https://open.spotify.com/track/4qOdFvP52SrsiqTIzs1idY?si=RwECVaAxRf2vve-uc81BWA) I got bored after about a minute and hit skip.

## Great Good Fine OK

[Take it or Leave It](https://open.spotify.com/track/1HH9T6jsitwm9Cvs9jUeTf?si=NDVCHN2DT5C0--c5C610BQ) has made the playlist rounds, they’ve got the “big burst of sunshine” builds and vocals that spend a lot of time in falsetto. They did collab on one of my favorite Chainsmokers tracks [Let You Go](https://open.spotify.com/track/2Mh0jU5IyRTQfpyMnvki5Z?si=TQYW_avBSVKD4DzqApby3Q). I would be interested in trying to catch this set assuming no major conflicts.

## GRiZ (live band)

I have listened to GRiZ a bunch and I wish I was more into this but it's just not exactly my vibe. I love the funky aspects of it but the deep bass and heavy crash is a little too jarring for my tastes. I find myself really digging a track like [Funk Party](https://open.spotify.com/track/5lOtRTRSUg0OJFd5ircx5R?si=L7I1HzStRrevhmXMuwz0cA) until it gets to the drop and I almost cringe a little, at the same time doesn’t overdo it with the warped buzzsaw effect but keeps that heavy horn/jazz influence at the forefront. Still excited to check them out especially with the live band. Really, as long as there’s not a big crashing drop I’m good. [Can’t Hold Me Down](https://open.spotify.com/track/0n9Le5SnqdeJ2senJ4SwJa?si=vl8TukbeTKelMvrcHgSqUQ) was a bit more forgiving and I dig it a lot. [My Friends and I](https://open.spotify.com/track/5r0pFcKYtfb4RgIiOwB0Cx?si=dWusZgpPTWiil88XQRoH-A) was awesome but the drop kinda throws me. Just never really liked the metal\-on\-metal sound, one of the hardest things for me to get past in slushii as well.

## Gryffin

This guy has always had really good music w/ A\-list tracks like [Feel Good](https://open.spotify.com/track/0Ev562zA4pmUsBqjxsxxdx?si=6EcpWqarTUGri9xvVedGZg) and [Whole Heart](https://open.spotify.com/track/4Z1t1aMRif8ES212kTN8H2?si=trRQsSa-RRK66kFkXPbOPA) but also being able to mellow it out on [Heading Home](https://open.spotify.com/track/4iZ3YEN89TU8Uwan4NwkB8?si=rDDk0koJQ-y8sKljd7bUDw). I remember being underwhelmed w/ his live performance when I first saw him but he was trying to bring in different elements, even busted out a few tracks on guitar. I remember thinking he hadn’t quite found his identity as a performer yet but as long as he keeps producing his music he’ll get there. Had the same feeling seeing Illenium too actually. One of my Forest companions also uncovered this week that Gryffin is 1 of the 2 guys from [The White Panda](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1mOUOvOOaoTF2b3kDjrety?si=dLgQWEgaSFWQL3CoroHLnA) mashup masters.

## Hannah Muse

Not even seeing her on Spotify but she’s listed on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Gotta assume this is a small, off the map stage, maybe a competition winner?

## Harrison Brome

[Fill Your Brains](https://open.spotify.com/track/2nH7DxQqCYHRo4uYozjmKq?si=gPBv1uJBQpaMTX8t0Bvh3Q) conjures associations of folk but with a much heavier weight to it, a longing/yearning to the vocals that gives it an emotional weight. I’m not that well educated in music theory but there feels like a like of minor chords that define the sound. Not sure this is the vibe I'll want at Forest, I typically relate more to melodies and upbeat rhythms. Vocal range is pretty impressive, [Body High](https://open.spotify.com/track/6d3qn99YVl3IrTQH68lE5t?si=u9hBGjEiRWWp9KfL3sDOaA) leans more on falsetto than Fill Your Brains. still not quite enough going on to really keep my interest but I have an appreciation for the artistry.

## Hayden James

This dude is more than his [Something About You](https://open.spotify.com/track/5n9DJWUiwuKuPE9sCVbQ0n?si=wEQGllgdRXejyaeO0Pilhw) collab w/ ODESZA, definitely has a very similar vibe though. [NUMB](https://open.spotify.com/track/4bJzIbze97tZwCxxMw4hx9?si=pxe3G9GoTQyd8SluNB3yUg) is a cool track, same type of playful, rolling melodies. Full set Thursday and DJ set Friday.

## Heroburst

I’ve read a lot about how strong the basshead scene is in the Forest, and my first intro to this dude was [Party McFly](https://open.spotify.com/track/390Q0QFBIRNts4vBykK9jF?si=BE0z95nYTVS6tiLpT67LvQ) and it certainly delivers. Deep bass not really my thing so prob a pass from me but definitely had a good beat if that’s your thing. Good to see some recognition in ATL for more than just hip hop.

## Hiss Golden Messenger

New age Bob Dylan, trying to revive American folk. [Heart Like a Levee](https://open.spotify.com/track/3fJCTime9pAkyQ5oyj0tIE?si=SbGK5q6xRHSKlnM5dK8p2g) not doing it for me.

## Insightful

A lot like Emancipator, maybe a little more edge. [Black Dress](https://open.spotify.com/track/2jZ9fCH4Cp7sZ1N0IUS5QM?si=frBptkqTSqmf-5jcYJPNAg) and [Moth Mother](https://open.spotify.com/track/5SbUBMRPHwq7eVPgmdn8Ds?si=eoQvs1EMRnm0C5Sf_otXng) show you what he’s about. [Csyani](https://open.spotify.com/track/63o6UeGqTc6sJAgB9OWKiM?si=miUdLvTFRgqWR8whFc1dSQ) leans on that edge a lot more.

## Jauz

I’m looking forward to Jauz, I think it’ll be a fun show. He’s done a lot of remixes with people like Marshmello \([Magic](https://open.spotify.com/track/0FjkcycxVB1Jd7mcdEDDWp) prob his best known song for sure\) but also with Diplo on [Final Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/0gahmokctHhYjyR3ZUGr7L) \(originally a MØ track\). [Rock the Party](https://open.spotify.com/track/1eawzcSXO0NFalHKRoKrMC) an original track released on Spinnin is pretty dope, I bet the crowd will get live for this.

## Jeremy Olander

Hitting me with that soft ethereal trance vibe on [Crossed](https://open.spotify.com/track/6bJliOsJqznrtk90KrF5Mb?si=Hwlrua8pSfqfP57nHdsrZQ). [Last Dance](https://open.spotify.com/track/1v14bpOcknr4bLbgwKRijs?si=KOCr8tvGSdyDWZQk15YX-g) more syncopated.

## Jody Litvack

Sounds like a hype man. From [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/jodylitvack):

*Veteran Toronto entertainer Jody Litvack is one of the most sought after names in the live event industry today. As a top Emcee, DJ &amp; multimedia expert, Jody has spent the last 23 years honing his creative talents and immersing himself in the hottest new trends in music, fashion, lifestyle and entertainment.*

## Justin Jay’s Fantastic Voyage

[Hit It](https://open.spotify.com/track/6jjxWcs8iSx8ueDJv3GVvo?si=PseXqibVRJmAjACXo2qpiQ) takes a little while to ramp up, starts with some basic beats and layering on different instrument and vocal sounds. It is interesting how the basslines are pretty deep and extended and then you drop in other levels that are still heavily based on layering rhythm. I would have liked it to continue building but kinda levels out halfway through, a bit hard to keep my attention. Apparently we just get Justin Jay on Friday, the Fantastic Voyage doesn’t arrive until Saturday \(2 sets\).

## Karl Denson’s Tiny Universe

Dude can shred on the sax. Funk instrumental that does a good job having a lot going on that doesn’t conflict with itself. [Seven Nation Army](https://open.spotify.com/track/5T8Nc3nQ9EoEEgeiVfovnO?si=1R5TGiJ8Qvq2Gty_4BBFHw) gets covered constantly but his version might be my fave I've heard. Looks like he does a lot of covers \([Hang Me Out to Dry](https://open.spotify.com/track/58YIzooPiDTYSbDmARmwEA?si=yaSmoIFMR4eHkpKDXwS3fw) cover of Cold War Kids also pretty dope\). He’s got a tagline on his 2014 album that just says ""soul explosion"" which I think is fitting.

## Kasbo

This seems like someone that would need live vocals to bring the heart of these songs out. Tracks are pretty great \([Find](https://open.spotify.com/track/3a1DVjwshmHW9DR7pJMTaR?si=8BuBVrQQT-eMc1U_XOXRWg) is super chill\) but not sure how much I could get into this if it’s just a DJ set. The fact that he works w/ ODEZSA and released newest album on Foreign Family Collective and that he has opened for Glass Animals is some pretty legit street cred in my book. The production of [Found You](https://open.spotify.com/track/7HSNDCmILAqYrMZh4tZgp4?si=aYTyf8d6QXC3yWooHoMqNw) reminds me of Said the Sky a little bit, very heady and creamy melodies. Collab w/ Big Gigantic on [The Little Things](https://open.spotify.com/track/4KRkanYEoxAEBY5HDtYGU6?si=0A5BwdEBTP6CqtxuZpqYig) I wish brought a little more consistent energy.

## Kawehi

Going by the name alone, I was expecting [Robot vs. Girl](https://open.spotify.com/track/2CmEofve4LcDxG0Pzy1wEh?si=S6KHRoDRR7GPswfiS1_k5g) to be similar to [Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots](https://open.spotify.com/track/0ccCwNzXvr1Yoz91vKz31Z?si=j-uABWFiQ8Cx2SrNZcmbvA). Sultry female vocals, seems like her overall vibe is playing with that line between human and machine\-produced music. Definitely very vocally\-driven, will be a nice mental break in between more high energy sets.

## Kidswaste

[Free](https://open.spotify.com/track/5413LFXLYAJS85VKs6H6ag?si=WL9qL1jRSrOwdd5fTcPaPg) was very mellow, almost remind me of Death Cab for Cutie but I can’t really place why. [tbh ily remix](https://open.spotify.com/track/52Jf8rOBta15wNrkOg0tg0?si=q5VZSdEcRBetnRnhomV8jw) of Chet Porter off [Study Crab](https://open.spotify.com/user/abbykatz/playlist/0NKNTwQOBWVYbBBbbNUGrg?si=qHw1ylaRQM6QsWIpN_7d1Q) is dope.

## Knox Fortune

Pretty simple rhythms on [Lil Thing](https://open.spotify.com/track/3q6ygCZID0OKj6MUxInB48?si=gkIZSsx1Ta-41CuVBi9Czg) that keep this from standing out, the vocals are pretty neat. I would classify as general indie, not a ton that grabs me tbh.

## KRANE

Sometimes you just need some good old fashioned dance music. [Nobody But You](https://open.spotify.com/track/6rfHN9Hmz7WD3nb7HtMxNM?si=SCsL3jIlTaSmV93AnaK_2g) had some cool Illenium\-mosque builds to it. Would recommend.

## Kronika

Hitting us with 80s rock and roll power chords and then surprising with Sumblime\-esque vocals on [Tinnitus Forte](https://open.spotify.com/track/6aGSCU0SLviqrnqQll9AO5?si=_UR-dtydR3myKHGK195TAg). Not 100&amp;#37; certain I have the right Kronika though, this seems pretty out there and almost no play on Spotify...

## Lane 8

Saw this dude in DC earlier this year, he did a really cool thing where he had the bouncers tape the camera on everyone phone so that you allow yourself to just enjoy the experience in the moment rather than trying to capture it \(and allow others to do the same without staring at your cell phone\). Very chill, along the same lines as Emancipator and Shallou. [Fingerprint](https://open.spotify.com/track/7ixuc4KOSHm0BsrwsRLM3i?si=mpShM7eASn-Y5LrrA8ozwQ) and [No Captain](https://open.spotify.com/track/7KKzbd8nN8M51mOzoNlH3k?si=1N5bnSTmQcWwNFssFJRacA) some of his bigger tracks.

## Lawrence

This is a brother and sister that we saw play the campsite stage at Firefly last year and they blew it away. I first discovered them when [Columbus Avenue](https://open.spotify.com/track/5wzdaXVadPAGwkgtcR1dLB) came on in morning as the sun was starting to creep through the windows and that perfectly summed up the vibe of the song: very chill, pretty standard type of sound for early\-day festival. When we saw them they brought so much more energy than I expected and really got the crowd into it. They’ve got a great stage presence and have found a way to bridge that soulful, wholesome sound into a pop dance beat.

## Lee Reynolds

[Moon Matrix](https://open.spotify.com/track/7EVXgDHtysC4vOagHfjq0c?si=vKyltWVZSYKe8IScu3UuQg) had a couple of playful melodies but overall didn't do a lot for me. Simple syncopated beats and echo tones. Only playing B2B Doc Martin.

## Locos Por Juana

[Pal' Caribe](https://open.spotify.com/track/2txbBxoT8vq3J02Ex4sf0q?si=1xEP9gRQRcu0kqDLmhcpGQ) got me in the mindset of a Latin Sublime.

## Lophiile

Belongs on the setlist for a summer block party. [Nayhoo](https://open.spotify.com/track/4WCgIZ1n7I6yRaAQ9GjS07?si=GS8Xol25RSqxEJZ9ZJojYQ) with Chon was mellow but kept enough energy to keep you hooked. He’s got a bunch of remixes, including several from Zedd \([Stay](https://open.spotify.com/track/5CYAoFTUYmujB0vn9yzxOW?si=eYZD0NrCQc-geSTunI0QTg), [I Want You to Know](https://open.spotify.com/track/3qHK2JdWAG4jlPnZqyxGoZ?si=VUeIPjJIQWOQc6JrWfkW6Q)\). Seems like he’s trying to make a name for himself.

## LOUDPVCK

When I saw [Click Clack](https://open.spotify.com/track/4hcCUmWAxXT36YHZyyUNyX?si=bdRFUFF1RTOGaF6kFvjXhA) collab w/ NGHTMRE, I couldn’t have picked a closer comparison for his sound. I listed to [Tony](https://open.spotify.com/track/4mfIwjsMW79kDyA8UKLms5?si=sAPbvtQXTDGjAN2dH5pC-g) as well to make sure it wasn’t NGHTMRE dominating and it was the same hard hitting electronic that I can appreciate from a musical standpoint but have never personally been able to really get into. They did do a pretty dope cover of Chainsmokers’ [Paris](https://open.spotify.com/track/5ZQM4NzvXB4Hc0BG0ZHufF?si=RBqRqr0dQJ2UiEHB4wTR3Q).

## Louis the Child

When you evaluate a festival lineup, what really sets one apart IMO is being able to bring in subheadliners that can really deliver. Louis the Child would be a highlight show on my calendar if they came through DC this summer but it’s easy to overlook them when seeing the strength of this schedule. They dropped a couple new tracks this year already \([Better Not](https://open.spotify.com/track/447yWcDPg1ddgcHBLGpJC0?si=Ff7pjfxsTTKa7qXrStcPmQ), [Shake Something](https://open.spotify.com/track/6mUwMth1MQT8NVSMI7lKjx?si=t1a_Cb39QqeT3PmO4Fq4Iw)\) that are solid and [Fire](https://open.spotify.com/track/3gEd9lG47fxPbqE3pEVZEF?si=Hr77ENiJQNifQ381IFiDXg) will always be 🔥. Would love for someone to tell me if it’s pronounced Looey or Lewis \(yes, I am too lazy to Google it myself\).

## LUTHI

[Every Body](https://open.spotify.com/track/7ypcwonAuWX3Aa2ighixoT?si=s1CSlTlhR2-8HBTYaVRAug) is by far the most listened to Spotify track and I definitely see why. They’ve got that big sound that comes from having a band w/ 9 people. It’s also cool to see the influences of a huge music city like Nashville come through in a non\-country band. Their website described their style as a “Boogie Circus”, which weirdly fits. It’s 1 part Misterwives, 1 part Earth Wind and Fire, 1 part something completely new. Had never heard of these guys before Forest, definitely going to try and check them out though. [Milk and Honey](https://open.spotify.com/track/5cKSzaikxKsabI5KscouIL?si=dTZ-a0WVSeWzo20_MJI-bQ) another fun track off their [Stranger](https://open.spotify.com/album/14zJYz8kVDNFs3gl8tlIXM?si=GA8kZ7DxT52Qtxua-RyHtw) album that just dropped May 11, will be cool to see how they do at this point in their tour of the new album. [Back to You](https://open.spotify.com/track/0TlmgB7XD5YSK1oT9HqKXs?si=KItuwQjpQb-_1iRUKRaKbQ) came up on a later playlist and that really got me too.

## LUZCID

Did some cool bass'y things with [Make It](https://open.spotify.com/track/70ORmzps86niRQYBTreYGX?si=MJ4ujyDyT2KAZRF8LY6P6A) that were measured in a way I like. For whatever reason I associate artists who use all caps in their name to be big booming sound \(your name is yelling at me already\) it at least Make It i think did a really good job of keeping the bass in check.

,fo76,"1. Full MMO style. I really want the game to based all around online, I feel like this would be the best direction for the game. Maybe we could incorporate some cool skins that people could grind for. Or even have a loot box system similar to Black ops three which is one of the best systems where you grind for keys to open a supply drop. Also I think that the whole world should be PvP and when you die you lose everything and have to start over. Also fortnite building mechanics where you quickly build bases to counter enemies and kill them.

2. No skills and less perks. I feel like FO4 was too complicated and could have had less RPG elements to make it easier to understand.

3. Less gore and more family friendly. How the frick am I supposed to play these games around my children with blood and gore. There should be a paintball mode similar to advanced warfare so me and my children could play through it together. Maybe also have censored swearing or just no swearing at all. Like swearing just hurts people anyway. 

4. Battle royal, battle royal, battle royal. FO battle royal would be perfect. You jump out of a vertibird with 100 other players while a nuclear storm pushes everyone in closer together. No bandages or meds but stimpax and jet. With of course build mode which I think they would incorporate.  Also add loot boxes for cool skins and guns.

5. Less story and reading. I think that there were too many terminals in fallout 4. Think of the fricking blind people. 

6. Last is music choice. Honestly the music in fallout is garbage and probably the worst part about it. I think they need a modern playlist with maybe artist like Drake, Kendrick Lamar, Lil Pump, Ed Sheran, maybe some Lil Dicky

|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|**AngryCentaurGaming** \- [Jeremy Penter](https://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter)|Buy \~ [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lidwgHSddIQ)|*This is absolutely a 'Buy', it is well worth it at full price on the consoles and for the 45 it is available on Steam for. The game does betray its ""double-A"" budget at times, but to me, Vampyr is a great example of a title doing something different that I'm not sure a AAA company company would do. A lot of the safeguards that we see, even in some other AA games, when it comes to society's impacts and the social decisions you can make are gone here. Those consequences hard-felt and they are instant, and the inevitable character death of somebody that you actually like is gonna hit you even more. Combat's fun and not perfect, but it works to keep you engaged as well. At 25 hours without doing everything with so many different ways and situations this can play out, I would assume two playthroughs at minimum is what I'll do with this title, and it really does show that a game can be far more than the sum of its parts, and certainly not reflect just the budget.*|PS4, XB1, PC|
|**Player2.net.au** **-** [Matt Hewson](https://opencritic.com/critic/3904/matt-hewson)|Unscored \~ [Unscored](https://www.player2.net.au/2018/06/vampyr-review/)|*A beautifully told gothic tale with interesting skill systems and some fun combat is only let down by window dressing and a location that feels like a stage and not an actual city. Vampyr might not be the game of the year, but it is certainly going to be one of the most interesting titles we see in 2018 and, sales permitting, a title that will only get better in future sequels.*|PS4, XB1, PC|
|**Eurogamer** \- [Aoife Wilson](https://opencritic.com/critic/761/aoife-wilson)|Unscored \~ [Not Recommended](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-06-04-vampyr-review)|*Dontnod takes a thrillingly Gothic perspective on early 19th century London, but squanders it in a dreary and indecisive adventure.*|PS4|
|**VG247** \- [Marshall Lemon](https://opencritic.com/critic/628/marshall-lemon)|Unscored \~ [Unscored](https://www.vg247.com/2018/06/04/vampyr-review/)|*Vampyr is an ambitious masterpiece with forgivable flaws*||
|**Rock, Paper, Shotgun** \- [Alec Meer](https://opencritic.com/critic/1590/alec-meer)|Unscored \~ [Unscored](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/06/04/vampyr-review-pc/)|*I'm left frustrated that Vampyr falls short of truly combining a smart choose-your-own-adventure game with a meaty action one.*|PC|
|**Polygon** \- [Charlie Hall](https://opencritic.com/critic/1506/charlie-hall)|Review-in-Progress \~ [Review-In-Progress](https://www.polygon.com/2018/6/4/17425760/vampyr-review-pc-ps4-xbox-one)|*The easy way out for Dontnod would have been to take the most time-worn tropes from dime store horror novels, season to taste with period melodrama and serve it all up for players to enjoy. Vampyr reaches for more, and I'm very interested to see if the finale does it all justice*||
|**Nerd Much?** \- [Rhys Pugatschew](https://opencritic.com/outlet/512/nerd-much-)|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://www.nerdmuch.com/games/157714/vampyr-review/)|*Victorian vampires have never been so intriguing and exciting as they are in Vampyr.*|PS4|
|**GameSkinny** \- [Autumn Fish](https://opencritic.com/critic/2875/autumn-fish)|90 \~ [9 / 10 stars](http://www.gameskinny.com/nnx9h/vampyr-review-sink-your-teeth-into-an-intoxicating-vampire-rpg)|*Vampyr is a brilliant single-player RPG with deep social mechanics that make playing as a vampire a truly unique and satisfying experience.*|PC|
|**COGconnected** \- [Garrett Drake](https://opencritic.com/critic/4281/garrett-drake)|88 \~ [88 / 100](http://cogconnected.com/review/vampyr-review/)|*Witnessing a studio succeed beyond what their audience expects of them is always a pleasure, and DONTNOD Entertainment has done just that with Vampyr. Whether you're intrigued by the idea of stalking London as a bloodthirsty vampire or expressly fancy a rock-solid ARPG, consider sinking your teeth into this gem.*|PS4|
|**Hobby Consolas** \- [Álvaro Alonso](https://opencritic.com/critic/3755/-lvaro-alonso) \- *Spanish*|88 \~ [88 / 100](https://www.hobbyconsolas.com/reviews/analisis-vampyr-ps4-xbox-one-pc-258255)|*Even with it's noticeable flaws, Vampyr has the potential to be the new cult gem among vampire lovers. If you can see beyond technical limitations, the story and characters will trap you within their arms and suck until the very last drop of... your time.*|PS4|
|**Cerealkillerz** \- [Gabriel Bogdan](https://opencritic.com/critic/3388/gabriel-bogdan) \- *German*|87 \~ [8.7 / 10](https://cerealkillerz.org/vampyr-ps4-review-ein-liebesbrief-an-bloodborne/)|*Vampyr exceeds all expectations and delivers a thrilling vampire adventure with great storytelling and a gameplay that borrows the right elements from games like Bloodborne. If you can live with some longer loading screens and a missing fast travel option you'll get a well made Action-RPG with lots of enjoyable content.*|PS4|
|**DualShockers** \- [Tanner Pierce](https://opencritic.com/critic/3982/tanner-pierce)|85 \~ [8.5 / 10](https://www.dualshockers.com/vampyr-review-ps4/)|*While a couple of technical issues stop it from being a masterpiece, Vampyr is still a fantastic title that will keep you entertained for hours.*|PS4|
|**GameSpace** \- [Brandedwolf](https://opencritic.com/outlet/464/gamespace)|85 \~ [8.5 / 10](https://www.gamespace.com/reviews/vampyr-pc/)|*If you enjoy your story a bit on the darker side and making choices that matter, then give Vampyr a try.*|PC|

Every decision has implications that spider out in unseen directions, often far into the future. While there are some wobbles in terms of combat and load times, the engaging storyline and premise carry this title far.*|PC|
|**PlayStation Universe** \- [Neil Bolt](https://opencritic.com/critic/838/neil-bolt)|80 \~ [8 / 10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/vampyr-review/)|*There's no denying that Vampyr has some mighty rough edges to it and combat that is decent, but unspectacular. Yet there's a delicious sense of place to it that makes it undeniably interesting to get stuck into. Many of the game's flaws melt away as you get lost in the moody grime of this alternate version of wartime London. The most important job Vampyr had to do was to present a compelling game about the tragic romanticism of being a vampire, and the fight for retaining humanity or embracing the unnatural power it brings. Vampyr does drop the ball on many small things, but it does that important job superbly.*|PS4|
|**Twinfinite** \- [Alex Gibson](https://opencritic.com/critic/1863/alex-gibson)|80 \~ [4 / 5](https://twinfinite.net/2018/06/vampyr-review/)|*Ultimately, the sum of Vampyr's emphasis on story, combat, and progression combine to produce a video gaming experience that will appeal to those outside the RPG and adventure genres that it seeks to combine. My hope is that it finds its audience so that we might yet again see Dr. Reid on an even grander scale in the future.*|PS4|

|**SelectButton** \- [Kevin Mitchell](https://opencritic.com/critic/2802/kevin-mitchell)|80 \~ [8 / 10](http://www.selectbutton.com/reviews/vampyr-review/)|*Although Vampyr's combat system is thoroughly satisfying, it's the dark atmosphere and narrative that genuinely makes the game a must-have. Your choices define the experience, altering a world full of discovery and intrigue all around you. Do you give in to your blight and feast upon the weak and unworthy inhabitants of London or do you become their salvation? It should take you anywhere from 20-30 hours to complete the narrative, but if you want to see all of the possible endings, you'll have to play through multiple times, altering your choices and decisions regarding the lives of the citizens.*|PC|

|**EGM** \- [Emma Schaefer](https://opencritic.com/critic/162/emma-schaefer)|80 \~ [8 / 10](http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/vampyr-review/)|*Vampyr walks a fine line between narrative storytelling and action-oriented combat, trying to appeal to fans of both genres and mostly succeeding. Though the game lacks polish in many areas, it stars a clever morality system that entices players towards both good and evil deeds, a well-rounded web of background NPCs, and an intriguing overall narrative of an undead doctor investigating the spread of the Spanish Influenza, making Vampyr a treat for any vampire fan.*|PC|
|**Wccftech** \- [Rosh Kelly](https://opencritic.com/critic/1301/rosh-kelly)|80 \~ [8 / 10](https://wccftech.com/review/vampyr-vampire-puns/)|*Dontnod worked hard to create an immersive, dark world to explore and it succeeds in doing so. Despite some boring conversations, most of the world of Vampyr is an exciting, dangerous place and if nothing else, being a vampire in here is also very fun.*|PS4|
|**TrustedReviews** \- [Andi Hamilton](https://opencritic.com/critic/737/andi-hamilton)|80 \~ [4 / 5 stars](http://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/vampyr)|*Vampyr might not be what many wanted after Life Is Strange, but it’s still an enjoyable – well, as enjoyable as its grim nature allows – game nonetheless. It follows the modern action RPG template almost to a fault, but the agency the player has in shaping the districts by disease control and straight up murder is a lot more interesting than some of the moments in other games within the genre, where they present you a binary choice that pushes the plot forward. It’s a decent idea holding up an otherwise solid game, but overall Vampyr is worth a look if you’re looking for something to plug the gap in your life in this post- Witcher 3 world.*|PS4|

But I was constantly compelled forward to find out what next grim choice it would give me, anxious to spend yet another night in one of its safehouses to see if my efforts to keep London's souls alive another day had worked.*|PS4|

Gaines](https://opencritic.com/critic/901/grant-e-gaines)|73 \~ [7.3 / 10](http://www.justpushstart.com/2018/06/vampyr-review/)|*Vampyr is a hard game to review, because there is enough to warrant a low score, yet the experience is satisfying enough to make up for this. For better or worse, giving answers and explaining things make it easier to invest in the story, with the conclusion certainly being worth the time. The ability to interact with NPCs, heal them, figure out more about the world and extract new information also adds a lot. It’s just, when it comes to gameplay, Vampyr falls short. With loading screens being common when players move too fast, combat often being more about managing stamina, difficulty stemming from how willing are you to kill innocent people and a needlessly frustrating waypoint system, it’s easy to get frustrated. With this in mind, anyone looking for a vampire romance story or just want to experience a world filled with answers should consider picking Vampyr up, where as action-RPG or open world fans can probably skip it.*|PS4|

Hitting a game-breaking bug certainly soured my experience, but the wonderfully written characters kept me going until the credits rolled. This may not be a perfect RPG, but Vampyr is still a fun time for those wanting something a bit darker in their games.*|PC|

When it gets going you can see the potential of the way it offers you more power if you consume its interesting citizens. But Vampyr never commits to this idea to the point where I felt I needed to make that sacrifice to succeed in its relatively simple combat, which leaves it feeling toothless and vulnerable to having a lot of its fun sucked away by technical issues, despite its genuinely engaging story.*|PS4|

So, if If you were expecting another Dontnod masterpiece, you'll be disappointed. If you're interested in setting, then it's probably worth a try, but only at a discount price.*|PC|

It also manages to effectively make you feel like a creature of the night at times. Unfortunately, the frequent technical issues sapped just about every ounce of joy from the experience, leaving this digital world a dry, lifeless husk.*|PS4|

In a time where the genre is evolving Vampyr holds on to past ideas for much of its tenure, and it doesn't have a story strong enough to overcome that fact. The world itself is ripe for lots of stories to be told within, with Dontnod having done a good job with world building, but while Vampyr isn't a bad game, nor is it as great as it could be.*|PS4|

Combat is stiff and quite mindless, but Jonathan's progression deeper into Vampiredom is handled well and the abilities at his disposal go a long way towards masking some of the more mundane aspects of the battle system. It's more whether or not Jonathan decides to prey on the people of London, and its consequences, that keep the experience fresh. There's a trade off between making Jonathan and keeping districts stable, each one offering their own benefits. There are technical issues, and the performance is lacking on every front, but Vampyr has enough going for it conceptually that it's worth sinking some time into, if only to be a vampire in 20th century London.*|PS4|

|**USgamer** \- [Hirun Cryer](https://opencritic.com/critic/3422/hirun-cryer)|60 \~ [3 / 5 stars](http://www.usgamer.net/articles/vampyr-review)|*Vampyr unfortunately flounders after building some solid foundations in the opening hours. London feels like a city on a knife edge, and the citizens prove to be an inviting cast of creative characters. But Vampyr then lures you into sacrificing these characters, cutting out a key part of the game, all to have a hope of standing up to the horrors that await you in the shadows of London.*|PS4|
|**TechRaptor** \- [Robert Grosso](https://opencritic.com/critic/1998/robert-grosso)|60 \~ [6 / 10](https://techraptor.net/content/vampyr-review)|*Vampyr has a lot of good ideas, but its execution is sorely lacking in most areas.

It wears its ambition on its sleeve, even if it looks at times to be wearing a tank top. The underlying game mechanics require a certain amount of suspension of disbelief, but those that can will find an entertaining penny dreadful.*|PS4|

,makinghiphop,"# Welcome, this is my top 3 list for beginner-friendly production tips.

Since this is my first try to create a list like this it won't be perfect, yet I'd like to adress some things that could prove useful for some of you, especially in the beginning to end\-of\-the\-first\-year\-stage of producing. It won't cover essentially everything, just some topics that stole a lot of my time and costed me way too much effort figuring out.

***Please be aware of the fact, that this list is indeed somewhat personal. I tried my best to make it fitting for beginners in a way, that I wish I would've gotten help. It's supposed to help those, that aren't satisfied in watching YouTube\-videos or just want to read something before going to sleep. If this isn't your cup o' tea, please feel free to skip this post.***

# Tip #1: Don't think too much, do it. (Learn step by step!)

""Wow KVMVSVBI"", you think, ""this is very counter\-productive!"" \- but first, hear me out.

In the early stages of getting comfy with the DAW \(Digital Audio Workstation\) you might find yourself in a stage, where you constantly want to improve what you do and how you do it. For example you find nice samples, you'd really love to put to use, but instead of creating a dank beat with it you just hang around trying to figure out, how it sounds the cleanest and how to mix it perfectly.  Or instead of throwing in some funny melodies via MIDI and working with them you first try to wrap your head around music theory for hours and hours. But the critical thing about your first \~100 hours is to get to know your DAW.

Yes, you should know how to mix, master and edit stuff properly. But I think it can be very frustrating and overwhelming. First you should try to get used to the many many details that are packed in your DAW and how to use them properly. Let's take FL Studio for example: One of the first steps you'll propably take is whether finding out, how to use the patterns or how to use samples in the playlist \- those two ways are correct, yet some like working with patterns a bit more, some doing it all in the playlist track. Then comes finding out, how to route stuff to the mixer and even that part could be overwhelming, because now you have yet another window open, where you can do even more stuff.

I'd highly suggest to take it slow and take some breaks. Make fun patterns, show it to friends or musicians you know and let them help you. Create wanky melodies, listen to them over and over and try to feel, what you could do better and what you've done right. Pat your own shoulder when you have your first cool loop and feel even more satisfied when you're ready to show the complete thing to your friends. When you've got a feel for everything and you know your way in your DAW, then there's now plenty of time to go to the library and grab some books about Mixing and Mastering. Before that there's not even a need for that, because by the time you've figured out how to use the program the right way you have to re\-read / re\-watch what you've learned about Mixing/Mastering anyway. \(I hope you get what I mean\)

# Tip #2: Don't be afraid. (Keep it real!)

Someday you'll question what you're doing and you'll ask yourself at least one of the following questions:

* Am I using the right DAW?
* Wouldn't I sound better with XXX Vst?
* Will people even like what I'm doing?
* Should I switch to Mac / PC?
* Should I just do what XXX is doing, because he's successful with it?

I'll answer them now. Right now.

Every so often there's the time, where everything feels old, unsatisfying and repetitive \- you want a fresh breath of air because you're feeling that with the software you're using you won't progress anymore. You're using your Selfmade/downloaded Presets day in, day out, running in circles, searching for something that makes making music attractive again.  Well \- you could have overworked yourself. I've pushed myself to my upper limits quite often. I've had weeks of recording and producing with only one or two days without it, so almost 24/7. It sounds fine in the beginning, but it doesn't leave much room for creativity and trying something new, especially when you've got a deadline someone's depending on.

Let me tell you this: You don't need new software \(most propably\). You need a challenge. Sometimes it feels like you're a line worker, because going out of the comfort zone in music is scary in the beginning, but you'll get the best results whenever you're challenging yourselves. For example: try making beats only with one sample, try a BPM you've never used or to remix a song you've never heard before. Find new ways to accomplish a sound, that you love and you'll quickly find yourself gaining knowledge and confidence.

Switching your DAW makes things even more complicated. I've been there. I've used FL for a fair time now, but I've already tried Ableton, Logic Pro X, Reason 5, Cubase and even Linux Music Maker. I have been trying almost everything because I've spent at least \~5000 hours in FL Studio and I've had to catch some fresh air quite often. You can try it to, but you'll soon realize, that there's \(often\) not too much to gain. As soon as you've settled down with the DAW of your liking switching to another one might be easier in theory, but harder in reality. It won't bring you further in a short period of time, maybe in the long run, especially, when you've not been using a program for that long, but you should go with a PRO and CON list for this sort of thing.

# Tip #3: CRITIQUE IS VALUABLE. (Get feedback &amp; keep practicing!)

Let me tell you a story. I've been using computers since I've been like 5 or so. When I turned 10 I've been learning Coding, as I turned 13 I started fiddling around with music, got my heart broken by a ex of mine, turned then to photography and video editing until almost three years ago, when I turned 18, I started to love music again.   It's f\*cking painful to hear, when your stuff gets trashed by other people \- but at the same time it's the most important thing. I've always been someone who tries stuff out just to see, what happens. I've not been much of a reader back then and I didn't know anything about music theory, but I knew I loved music \(I was 13, of course I didn't wanna sit down to read stuff about music theory\).

I showed stuff to my friends one day and they all said that it sounds pretty good. Until I showed it to someone I didn't do much with and he straight up told me, that what I'm doing is complete and utter trash and I should sit down, take my time and learn. And that's what I did. I've been asking him, what he thought is the problem with it and since he didn't know much about music, he just told me that the bass seems to ""push away the melodies"" and everything doesn't seem to fit. After a bit of reading, googling and try and error \(and around 2 weeks of intensive studying\) it turned out, that my bass wasn't EQed properly and the melody was pretty much offkey. I've been able to fix it somewhat and then scraped the whole thing because I wasn't satisfied with this piece anymore.  That's when I learned that in order to progress you have to fail sometimes.

Post your stuff online and ask for feedback. Try to find people that know their shit and let them show you some stuff. Don't be as naive as I was, just get to the library, read yourself some good books about music theory and production, watch YouTube videos and learn stuff and most importantly: love what you do. Then you will succeed.

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

So. That's all I've got for you today. I know, those aren't the most scientific tips, nor are they perfect. But maybe reading this stuff hits home a bit and can help you.

If you want me to do something again but with proper tips about topics you'd like to see \(e.g. EQing, Mastering, Vocal Processing, etc. etc.\) just comment or hit me up, I'd love to help someone.  Also sorry if the many commas and the strange grammar confuse you, I'm no native speaker, but I've tried.

Have a nice day,

KVMVSVBI!

,movies,"In other words, what is your favorite movie that has really good music, but also uses music to drive either the emotion of the plot of the film, acting almost as a character in itself? It’s quite common for movies to have good music, but often times the music is clearly driven by the action and is reacting to the events on screen. I’m looking for movies that seem to flip that relationship around. What movies do you think are truly driven by their music?

Here’s a few from the past years that I’m kind of thinking of:

La La Land

Baby Driver

Drive

Sing Street

Begin Again

The Secret Life of Walter Mitty

The Social Network

Lady Bird

Into the Wild

EDIT: A commenter pointed out that the term “music as a character” was pretty vaguely defined, so I wrote up a few points that explain how it differs from “ a good soundtrack.”

&gt;No, it’s a valid criticism. I guess I didn’t really define it all that well, and I admit some of my examples are quite different. I read a book a little while ago called “The Dolby Era,” all about the advancements in sound and theater technology that Dolby have helped push, as well as the ways that sound and music are kind of considered secondary elements of movies, often helping add emotion or drama to scenes but only ever taking their cues from what’s on screen. It’s a one-direction relationship, in other words, where the visual elements are the primary form of the film and the sound is secondary; reactive.

&gt;In my opinion, there are a few different ways that music can “become a character” in a movie, and they don’t all have to be done at once for it to be true, but at least one or two attributes should be there:

&gt;1. The music comes from the world of the film.

&gt;This doesn’t just mean “world” in the broad sense, like if a movie is set on earth then all earth music is available to be drawn from. It also does not mean that the music is entirely diegetic. It doesn’t have to come from a source in the scene, but the music should be draw from the musical influences of the setting, both in geography and time period.

&gt;In a movie like Lady Bird, the story is set in a Catholic high school in California in the early 2000s. The score is heavily influenced by high school bands and it is a constant reminder of the setting and the things that Christine is working through. The soundtrack also includes the kind of early ‘00s music that a high schooler in California might have listened to. The relationship between our protagonist and the music tells us a lot about her personality and her history, in much the way that her relationship with her best friend does.

&gt;La La Land revolves around Sebastian and Mia trying to break into the jazz and acting scenes respectively. Sebastian’s love of jazz is his primary motivation and drives much of the plot, acting similarly to a love interest, in that he has to choose between Jazz and Mia. It shapes his character, and the film cannot be separated from its music. Granted, musicals somewhat fall into this category by default.

&gt;Baby Driver is any easy one, because pretty much the whole soundtrack is taken directly from Baby’s personal playlist. The plot itself is not directly driven by the music, but the pacing and rhythm of the film is.

&gt;2. The music is pulled from the existing works of a single artist or group.

&gt;When a movie uses the past discography of an artist, they, and by proxy their music, tend to seem like a character in the story. They can influence the plot and the action, because often the story is written around the songs. This is especially the case for jukebox musicals.

&gt;Mamma Mia takes the music of ABBA and threads their songs together into a story.

&gt;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou kind of does this, only it takes a lot of David Bowie songs and has them sung by an in-story character with a totally different style.

&gt;3. The music is often the only audio source in a scene, for extended periods of time, or in place of dialogue.

&gt;This one is a little trickier to determine, because how long an “extended period of time” is can be very subjective. Basically when sound effects and dialogue are eschewed for music only, and large portions of the film are told as interconnected music videos, where the story is told without words.

&gt;*Drive*, *2001: A Space Odyssey*, and *Interstellar* largely fit into this category.

&gt;4. The music is diegetic and directly interacts with the characters.

&gt;Closely related to 1, but beyond just having a music that is stylistically influenced by the culture of the film, here the music is the result of character actions, be they as simple is the protagonist putting on a record and dancing to it, or music that is played by characters with instruments. Especially original music that was “written” by characters in the film.

&gt;Movies like this are often about characters that are musicians, such as August Rush, Sing Street, Begin Again, Whiplash, etc.

&gt;Anyway, that’s a whole lot of rambling and I hope it makes things a little more clear about what I meant by music as character. I think you’re right though about it being a somewhat vague concept often used to mindlessly praise the music of a film because the author doesn’t have anything else meaningful to say than “it sounds good.” Even in this thread there are a lot of responses praising movies that I wouldn’t agree use music as a character, but which do undoubtedly have great and even legendary music. I am pretty open to various interpretations to the idea, though I don’t really agree with people who says Star Wars or Lord of the Rings use music in that way. They both have phenomenal scores, but they’re largely disconnected from the criteria I mentioned above (though I did see a user give a great breakdown of how LOTR reinforces character and plot developments through music above). I hope this helps haha.",t2_579v4,,,0,,What is your favorite movie that uses music almost as another character?,[],r/movies,False,6.0,,,,,False,,False,dark,,,public,,,{},,,False,,,False,False,,{},,False,158,,,,self,1528122549.0,,[],,,True,,,text,6.0,,,text,self.movies,,,,,,,False,False,True,False,False,,,False,,True,False,False,,,,,,,t5_2qh3s,,,,,8o8v7w,,,phatboy5289,,231,True,all_ads,False,,,,/r/movies/comments/8o8v7w/what_is_your_favorite_movie_that_uses_music/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8o8v7w/what_is_your_favorite_movie_that_uses_music/,18322565,1528036222.0,0,,False,,,,,,,,1304745167.0,1536328591.0,,,
,halo,"With the first patch coming later this summer and additional features/content coming later this year I see no reason not to believe the big Halo game this year is the reworked MCC 2.0. It would be pointless for 343 to release all these fix's and content updates to the MCC if Halo 6 made it out this year, since the MCC updates would be buried do to Halo 6. What we know so far is the following

\- The first of many MCC patches is do sometime this summer. What this patch includes is a mystery at this time.

\- The public beta\(s\) will begin at the end of the summer \( could be pushed back a little depending on stability of the MCC\)

\- A custom game browser and other additional features are slanted towards the end of the year currently. This custom game browser will be more advanced then Halo 5's. 

My opinion on why the MCC is the big Halo game this year see below.

\- The fix's to the MCC is essentially a relaunch of the game\( New UI, game specific issues, cross game playlists, 4K, custom game browser potential additional content\)

\- What additional content could consist of \( ODST Firefight, Halo Custom Edition since this was actually confirmed as possibility with Sean actually loading a map of it on the MCC, SPV3, Reach, a PC Port\)

\- Franky pretty much confirmed that if there was a Halo 6 was in development that it indeed would be released on the PC as well since all Microsoft games will be on both platforms. As of right now PC only players can only play Halo CE if they can find a key for it, Halo 2, HWDE AND HW2. The latter two were released back in 2003 and 2007 so the PC community would greatly benefit from a MCC  and Halo 5 release to get caught up story wise before Halo 6 comes out.

Prediction time

\- November 2018 the MCC 2.0 launch is live on Xbox with all games playing like they did.

\- ODST Firefight

\- Custom Edition of Halo CE

\- Halo Xbox ONE S and X Bundles are released that include Halo MCC, 5 and Halo Wars 2 Ultimate Edition.

\- Halo MCC is added to Gamepass and is GWG for November.

Early 2019

\- The MCC is released on PC with cross play 

\- SPV3 comes to Halo MCC

\- Reach is added to the MCC

Spring 2019

   \- Halo 6 beta\(s\) begin that go on until summer 2019

E3 2019

 \- Halo 6 released date announced with full Mod support

Summer 2019

\-  Eldewrito in some way is released as part of the MCC

Fall 2019

\- Halo 6 is released.

,popheads,"#Picture this:

it's 2013 and you're in your sophomore year of high school. your best friend just introduced u to tumblr and u two DM each other ""save pop punk"" memes on instagram. your feed is meticulously organized monochrome images of white text lyrics over blurred photographs. you just discovered Vine and trap music. ""dumb ways to die"" is trending on YouTube. life is absolute shit.

this is the music you listened to back then.

#ok yikes wtf was that?

That was a shitty intro but I'm keeping it. This is the 2013 B+W ""indie rock"" rate! These bands might have very little in common with each other when taken into consideration now, but in 2013 they all felt firmly in the same universe. The 1975 and the Neighbourhood were new blog darlings who created hyper-polished rock, while Vampire Weekend and Arctic Monkeys were long-beloved indie bands that took new leaps in sound and direction that led to both commercial and critical success.

The album covers are all in black and white, which is kind of interesting because despite the darkness that pervades all of the artworks here they really do have some bright, poppy tracks that kind of negate that. 2013 was a year for self-proclaimed hipsters to embrace themselves, and these four albums feel like they came in a time before the cynicism that pervades a lot of indie music nowadays. Two of these albums have achieved huge critical success; two of these albums were practically skewered by the musical press. Two of these albums come from across the pond; two of these albums embrace their American selves in all their glory. Two of these albums are wholly sensitive pop works; two of these albums sound like they came from a place of scum and muck (in a good way). It's a rate of a lot of opposing forces, but ultimately these albums all feel natural together. If you like one, you really are bound to like the others.

I ~~payolad~~ pushed for this rate to be chosen mostly because this year is the year of 2013 comebacks. All four of these artists are expected to, or have already released, albums this year. They've all undergone some crazy transformations in the past 5 years, and what better to celebrate their development by rating the groups at their arguable best or most iconic? I'm perched to see how dramatic this ends up!

#[The 1975 - *The 1975*](http://highlightmagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/the_1975_album_artwork.jpg)

Across the pond, somewhere in Manchester, the home of acts like the Smiths, New Order, and Oasis, some kids decided the best thing to rip off was U2.

And, surprisingly, they succeeded!

The 1975 formed in 2002 and went underneath several name-changes, including:

&gt;The Slowdown

&gt;Talkhouse

&gt;Drive Like I Do (?)

&gt;Me; and You Versus Them (??????)

Guitarist Adam Hann, bassist Ross McDonald, and drummer George Daniel are led by the talents of Matty Healy on vocals. They met in high school, and started out covering punk tracks as a group. In 2012, they released their first EP, *Facedown*, and followed this up with three subsequent EPs up to the release of their true debut record. BBC Radio allowed for singles like ""The City"", ""Sex"", and ""Chocolate"" to garner a huge following for the band, and by the time of the release of their self-titled they had already earned several charting UK hits.

Their self-titled is an amalgamation of their diverse musical influences, and serves as a taste of the group's ambition that they would further explore on their sophomoric record. On *The 1975*, they more subtly indulge in '80s revivalism, occasionally sneaking new wave guitar lines into Phil Collins-esque drum patterns on tracks like ""Chocolate"" and ""The City"". The band has an irresistible sheen of polish to their songs that may be courtesy of their producer, Mike Crossey, best known for working with the group Arctic Monkeys. The 1975 pay their debts to the indie rock greats of the 2000s as much as they pay their debts to pop punk acts and electronic synthpop across the 16 tracks of the record.

Matty Healy is a charismatic frontman and a remarkably snappy songwriter, detailing the romances and affairs his own personal life in vivid color. He's a pretty cinematic narrator, and music videos like the ones for ""Robbers"" and ""Chocolate"" feel like true-to-the-book depictions of the stories Healy tells. The image of the 1975 might feel a bit easy to pick apart now, but in 2013 they felt real and honest.

The 1975 garnered tons of fans through the countless visuals they released for the album, and they have a surprisingly disproportionate amount of album Spotify streams compared to the pretty massive amount of YouTube listens they have on their videos. It shows that there's a lot that can happen when you set up an aesthetic that hits all the right bases for artistically inclined teenagers. While the album was certainly not one for the critics, the band's continued popularity and commercial success achieved after this record proves that the group have a lot to prove.

#[Vampire Weekend - *Modern Vampires of the City*](https://78.media.tumblr.com/2789710cb66d5227477ad52563b25f9e/tumblr_mhq7d9CTUP1r3zexno3_1280.jpg)

Vampire Weekend are the punchline to every joke made about the state of indie music in the 21st century. A bunch of Ivy League guys decided to make *Graceland*-esque indie rock, and they got absolutely clowned for how white they were as much as they got praised for their eccentric songwriting and tightly catchy instrumental sections. Amongst other achievements made in their pre-debut blog buzz, their ""Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa"" made Rolling Stone's best songs of 2007. It was practically a replica of the same success that Arctic Monkeys had, minus the actual hits. *Vampire Weekend*, their 2008 debut, was full of perky chamber pop and Afrobeat that was guided by the oddly endearing lyrical prowess of frontman Ezra Koenig and the production of Rostam Batmanglij. *Contra* built upon the base of influences they had on *Vampire Weekend*, by adding more electronics and introducing a more ""art pop"" approach to their songwriting. The record debuted at #1 on the album charts, proving that the fanbase they had built had become passionate about their music no matter what. However, this didn't impress critics all too much, and many felt they didn't step outside the box they had given themselves. Even ""Holiday""'s success amongst Honda commercials couldn't make up for how many critics felt disappointed. 

With *Modern Vampires of the City*, everything changed. For the first time, they enlisted an outside producer, Ariel Rechtshaid 😍, for an album. Gone were the pretty twee electronics of *Contra* or the twangy guitars of their self-titled. Vampire Weekend threw away their synthesizers and replaced them with organs and string samples. The record aches with a certain melancholy that hasn't been as upfront on their previous records, and that shows right out the gate with the instant start of ""Obvious Bicycle"", an oceanic ballad of minimal percussion and piano. Koenig writes lyrics that are hugely cryptic, yet somehow the most personable of any of the songwriters in this rate. His musings on aging, religion, and maturity feel like those of someone wise beyond their years, and it's easy to relate to his emotionally sensitive songwriting. It's one of the most exemplary records of the ""studio album"": full of tape trickery and pitch shifting amongst other effects, it's hard to imagine it without the pop prowess of Vampire Weekend's talent.

*Modern Vampires of the City* was released to immense critical success. Critics found the album an excellent foray into new territory, and it was named the #1 album of 2013 by Rolling Stone, Pitchfork, Slant Magazine, PopMatters, and Under the Radar. It won them a Grammy for Best Alternative Music Album, with an iconic speech that unfortunately isn't on YouTube anymore, and grabbed them a #2 spot on the Pazz and Jop poll. This is all also with huge commercial success for the record itself; it debuted at #1 on the Billboard album charts. They have critical clout, but will this be enough to lift them to the #1 track spot? Hell, will it even be enough to lift them to the top 10? Or the #1 album average? Who knows.

#[Arctic Monkeys - *AM*](https://img.apmcdn.org/80ef67f5910de61be7dbb1a1adfdb4253e08dad4/uncropped/ed0c2d-20130929-arctic-monkeys-am-album-cover-art.jpg)

Even though I was a teenager long after Myspace's prime, it feels as if though the social network was absolutely key to my growth as a human being. In the mid-2000s, the budding artists on its platform were embraced by the site, with Arctic Monkeys being *the* band that spawned from it. They had grown a huge following without even being aware of their huge fanbase on Myspace, and by the release of the 2006 *Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not* British media and tabloid press were obsessed with the indie rockers from Sheffield. ""I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor"" was a #1 hit on the UK charts, and their success was only furthered by their first album, which eventually became the fastest selling debut in British history at the time. Arctic Monkeys maintained their critical and commercial momentum going into *Favorite Worst Nightmare*. Going into the dark, studio-produced *Humbug* era, they had a bit of a stumble singles-wise as ""Cornerstone"" missed the success of their previous singles by a huge margin. However, Alex Turner and co. still maintained their critical acclaim and both *Humbug* and *Suck It and See* debuted at #1 on the album charts. Hell, they performed at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony. Arctic Monkeys were doing fine. At least in Great Britain.

If you had asked the American general public about them, there would only be one question: who the fuck are Arctic Monkeys?

With *AM*, it seems as if Alex Turner wanted to answer that.

*AM* somehow manages to be both pristine and gritty, taking heavy influence from blues rock, psych rock, soul, and hip hop. The band propels themselves forward with tunes that sound ready for American alt radio, with very little time wasted for filler. While some of their original fans felt alienated by the squeaky clean shine of the record, Arctic Monkeys gained thousands of new teenage American fans obsessed with the leather jacketed Alex Turner. Contemporary R&amp;B production processes delineate the indie rock the group have built themselves on, and Turner's penchant for witty songwriting still remains. The album art is a quirky interpretation of the record's name, standing for ""amplitude modification"" as well as the obvious, and its simple yet aesthetically pleasing appearance might explain why it's one of the highest selling vinyl records of the decade.

*AM* was an absolute smash. ""Do I Wanna Know?"" is one of the highest streamed songs on Spotify ever, and that's without charting in the US top 40. For the first time in the States, the group managed to mirror the same success they had in the UK. Their singles smashed alt radio apart, and their renewed vitality certainly added several years onto Alex Turner's life. The record received several year-end accolades, and remains treasured by hip teenagers everywhere despite the relative falling out of the record amongst indie rock elitists for its poppier sound. It returned them to the eyes of the critics, and earned them their first Mercury Prize nomination since *Favorite Worst Nightmare*. Rock and roll was effectively saved by this album, for better or for worse.

#[The Neighbourhood - *I Love You.*](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ILxrYw3tL._SL1500_.jpg)

The Neighbourhood, truth be told, look a lot like a boy band for emo kids. Don't let their name fool you; despite the British spelling, they very much hail from California, and they're eager to prove it. Led by Jesse Rutherford, the group gained popularity nearly out of nowhere for their mysterious image and cryptic promotion. They released two EPs prior to their studio debut, and even got a spot on Coachella before the record's release.

On *I Love You.*, the group melds R&amp;B beats into their dark, moody indie songs. It's very trendy and very polished, but underneath the layers of pristinely orchestrated pop the Neighbourhood do have some genuinely anxious, personal lyrics that can often be quite poignant. The album was produced by Emile Haynie, who had previously worked with fun., Lana Del Rey, and Bruno Mars, and his talents shine through in the overcast, grandiose R&amp;B/rock/pop that very much echoes the once novel beat-driven pop of *Born to Die*.

The true star of the record is the hit song ""Sweater Weather"", which is probably the most popular and recognizable track out of all of these albums. The single's pseudo-rapping and boom bap beat were something that weren't really heard of in the mainstream at this point, so having something like it become a hit was absolutely welcome in a time where alternative radio hits could break into the mainstream easily. Songs like ""Afraid"" and ""How"" are full of densely layered electronic production that feel key to the record's atmosphere: one of angst, anxiety, and stress that was once so intriguing back in its release.

The record currently holds a 48 out of 100 on Metacritic.

#fucking RULES

#READ THIS SHIT

**SERIOUSLY GUYS**
 
* Listen to each song and **assign each a score between 1 and 10**. Decimals are fine, but **please refrain from giving decimal scores that have two decimal spots.** What is wrong with you? Don't give a 6.75, that's just ridiculous.
 
* **Yes, you have to listen to every song**.  I will not accept your ballot if you have a score missing. That's because it will crash the program. It's exhausting when I'm putting in all the scores in last minute and somebody decided not to rate ""Float"" because they were so bored with the album they forgot to put something in for the last track!

* Your scores should **NOT** be considered confidential. How have you not figured this out by now? It's a rate! They will be revealed!
 
* You may give **ONE** song a **0** and **ONE** song an **11**. By one, we mean that this is **one song total**, not one song per album. Please reserve these for your least favorite and most favorite tracks; **excessive sabotage ruins rate results**. It's *annoying*!
 
* You **can** change your scores at any time! Feel free to PM either me or /u/fourchip again afterwards. Actually, just PM me. /u/fourchip will probably not have access to the scores
 
* The program makes things a lot more efficient and reduces errors on our part, this does mean that scores need to be sent in a very specific way. The easiest way to make sure your scores follow the necessary format is to **use the pre-prepared link, found [right here](https://bit.ly/2LfgjoD). PLEASE USE THAT**. You can copy and paste it to a notepad file or something and fill in your scores there, but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE use that format to send in you scores.
 
* If you don't follow the format, we'll still accept your ballot, but I reserve the right to publicly shame you and your inability to follow basic instructions. And I will present your username in large, bold text making fun of you every single time a song is revealed. We'll also probably/definitely ask you to fix it on your own if the issue seems like it's going to take a long time to correct.

* If you want to attach a comment to a specific song (which is encouraged!) write it right after your score. Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space!

* If you want to attach a comment to an album, add a colon after the ALBUM name and put your comment there!
 
* If, after submitting your scores, you change your mind about a certain song, I WILL change it up until I stop accepting scores.

**This is the ONE AND ONLY correct format:**
 
&gt;Obvious Bicycle: 8 What the fuck is an obvious bicycle?
 
**These are INCORRECT, in fact, LITERALLY ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT IS ABOVE IS INCORRECT:**
 
&gt;Obvious Bicycle: 8: What the fuck is an obvious bicycle?
 
&gt;Obvious Bicycle: What the fuck is an obvious bicycle? 8
 
&gt;Obvious Bicycle: What the fuck is an 8bvious bicycle?
 
&gt;Obvious Bicycle: 8-What the fuck is an obvious bicycle?
 
&gt;Obvious Bicycle: 8 (What the fuck is an obvious bicycle?)

**You can also comment on albums by adding a colon after the album title!**

&gt;Album: AM: Who the fuck are Arctic Monkeys?

**NOT LIKE THIS**

&gt;Album: AM Who the fuck are Arctic Monkeys?

im too lazy to come up with more examples but u get the gist

* **Bonus tracks CAN NOT GET 11s OR 0s.** You can also optionally rate only a few bonus tracks, but why would you do that? Just rate all of them if you want to do it, but **you don't have to rate the bonus tracks**.

Adam, firstly, thank you so much for doing this AMA. I love your music, and I've been a fan for a while now. My question is about writer's block. Have you ever felt like you had writer's block? If  so, do you have any advice for aspiring artists about overcoming it?|I am the Michael Jordan of getting writers block. Don't let it discourage you! Tell it to sit down and shut up because you are going to write the best stinkin song the universe has ever heard. Or book or whatever you're writing.
Will this be your final album? :(|NOPE.
Hi Adam! You're my actual favourite! One of your lyrics that stands out to me the most is ""I stood under the waterfall with a kiwi pineapple parasol."" Can you explain what that means?|Oh man, I think I was up wayyyyyy past my bedtime the night I wrote that line. I still don't even know what that means.
1. What advice would you give someone about to release an album of their own?|1. DON'T listen to what haters tell you. Pure poison. You will be so much happier if you let what they say go in one ear and out the other.
2.What is something you wished you did better at the beginning of your career?|2. I wish I would've taken music lessons, piano lessons or voice lessons. That would've saved me so much time!
3. What is your number one piece of advice to musicians/artists in general?| 3. Be weird. Be unique. Don't chase fads. Don't even listen to the radio if you're not inspired by it. Learn to be inspired by YOU.
I don't have any questions - just wanted to say thanks for being such an inspiration! Your music is what got me into writing music years ago! Can't wait to see you in Detroit September 14th!|THANK YOU! See you in Detroit!

HEY ADAM!! ive been a fan for 8 years now and my question is how did you meet the actors of the cinematic music video? how was the choice for them to play both you and abbey? thank u for your time, i love you very very much.|Katy and James sent in auditions tapes along with a bunch of other talented peeps. Loved them, and they did an amazing job, and it was just serendipitous accident that they ended up looking like me and my girl.
adam, your mixes sound incredible. any tips on your compression/limiting methods?|Easy does it. It's SO HARD not to over-compress stuff but in 10 years, you'll be glad you didn't overdo it. Trust yourself!
That announcement paper you're holding looks like the The Dirty Bubble drawn on it haha|that's because my name is rick
Hi Adam! No real questions, but i just wanted to say you're music was the soundtrack to my middle-school years, which were a difficult time for me. I had a a lot of mental health issues and got picked on quite a bit, but your music always felt like a ray of sunshine in my life and made everything so much easier! Thank you for that, and please never stop making music, can't wait for the new album ❤️|I appreciate you!!!!

This would be a loaded question, I think anyway, but since ""Cinematic"" is so auto-biographical, do you think it could be your last album as Owl City?|Absolutely not! Owl City is alive and well!
so why the fascination with House Wrens in particular?|My grandparent's always put up wren houses and during the summers I visited them as a kid. They were always just part of my life. Their song is the sound of summer to me! Pure music to my ears.
What other ornithological field recordings are on the record? So far I've picked up house wrens and chickadees.|A fellow bird fan! I recorded blue jays, cardinals, starlings, crows, white-breasted nuthatches, pileated woodpeckers, all kinds of my bird friends.
hey Adam! you're my biggest musical inspiration and I'm already a massive fan of Cinematic. :) as I was listening I was hit with sooo much nostalgia, and it made me feel the way I feel when I listen to Ocean Eyes. (which never ceases to take me back in time whenever I listen to it) did you do this on purpose, and did you do anything in particular to capture that old-timey, 2000's nostalgic feeling?|Hey thanks! Didn't do anything different, just older and wiser. Maybe a little crazier too! Just making tunes and having fun. That's all I wanna do while I'm alive :)
How do you feel with the meme-ing of your song Fireflies? Artists have varied responses about this, but I'd love to hear yours!|I thought it was awesome! Totally unexpected, but I had a lot of fun seeing them.
I'm so happy for you man! I'm the skateboard kid from the Atlanta show a few years back. I hope you liked that music from forever ago. You actually inspired me to put an album on iTunes in 2016 and learn the in's and outs of music producing. Right now I'm in the navy and I'm currently deployed in Europe and Africa. Everywhere my ship goes I write and record about experiences and my emotions. Recording with logic and fl studio are my escape form the ship life. And everytime I plug up my bullet strat to my Scarlett, I think about you and how you inspired me to start making music. Your heart is so pure and I'm so happy you exist and expell joy to this world. I hope you stay on track, and keep skating that green skateboard!!|Thank you so much, Austin! keep up the creativity! You are seriously talented.

Hey Adam, I'm hearing a lot of orchestral elements in Cinematic and I love it! Just wondering if you'll be playing any tracks off Adam Young Scores when you go on tour?|Probably not this tour. Perhaps an Adam Young tour just for those?????
Hey Adam, thanks so much for doing this! My question is this: what was it like collaborating with Carly Rae Jepsen?|It was awesome! Carly is an awesome human being. I remember she and I did a rehearsal at a dance studio in LA one time, and I am the least danceable person ever to crawl the planet... and she was a natural. She put up with me!
Low key I have visited Owatona a few times solely because you are there and I ate at an apple bees and a cute lil breakfast diner. I was wondering, what are you favorite places to eat in town?|Well, where the heck was I???? You buyin????? Just kidding. Applebees is a fave. Old Town Bagels too.
Hey hey Adam, what's your favorite ice cream flavor?|DQ Blizzards
When you were first learning to be a music producer, what was the hardest thing for you to learn? And do you remember the first song where you really felt like a ""professional?""|Singing forever was and will be the hardest thing for me. Vocals are my least favorite part of the process because I never feel like I can make my voice sound the way I want it to. It's a lifelong sturggle for sure. The first song I felt like a pro was a song called Swimming in Miami. I was like... I MADE THIS &gt;:)
Hey Adam, I just wanted to know how it felt having 'Fireflies' turn into this big meme last year? Did you like what was being made or it did you hate it?|I thought it was awesome and funny and hilarious and I encouraged it.
Love the guitar tone on 'Not All Heroes Wear Capes' - what's the chain there? Specifically the left panned guitar. Your instrumental albums form last year are fantastic, by the way, love sticking them on whilst at work.|Hello and thanks! Appreciate the kind words. The chain was just a Les Paul through a Line 6 Helix. I think it was just a factory preset... haha. No shame.
Hi Adam! Started listening to Owl City last October and I'm a huge fan of your work. My first question is what was the inspiration behind the song Cinecatic? Also, I'm going to your Seattle show and I was wondering if Hello Seattle is going to be played (in a bet with a friend). Anyway can't wait to see you in October Ps. Cinematic was amazing.|Hey! I wanted to write a song to remind everyone that life is a movie and magic is there, sometimes you just have to open your eyes and realize it. Hope you enjoy the show- I guess you'll just have to see when you are there. :) P.S. Thanks so much!
Adam! My sisters and I have been huge fans for as longs as I can remember! Absolutely love the new album. Ludic Dream has such a great feeling to it, such a mix of emotions, as many of your tracks do. Can't wait to finally see you on tour again in FL this year. My question is regarding your scores. Do you think you'll ever continue the project? Some of the scores were the best music I've ever heard in my life- period. Base Camp, Nova Scotia, Interstellar Space, and so many more, invoke such strong emotions. Thanks for all the great music you've brought to us over the years!!|That's so cool to hear! Thank you! I hope to, yes- absolutely. shooting for some serious brainstorming in 2019! See you in Florida!!!

Are you gonna bring back sky sailing?|Ya betcha as they say where I'm from

Hi Adam! Long time fan from the Netherlands here! Loved your concerts here in the Netherlands. Hope to see you again sometime. I just wanted to say I love everything you do and I respect you so much as an artist. My question for you is: what do you do when you're out of inspiration? I experience this a lot (not music, but graphic design) and I have a hard time getting over it and going back in.. thank you so much!|Hello from USA! Can't wait to visit the Netherlands again. When I'm out of inspiration, I like to do things that still make me feel productive -- I like to clean out my computer, organize hard drives, BACK UP hard drives for that matter, haha. I just do stuff that makes me feel like I still got something done even when I'm feeling low on new ideas.
What was your favorite song to come up with and write on Cinematic? Also what's the song you're most happy with out of all the songs you've created (if you can even choose!?)|Each song honestly had its very own separate party in my world. Each one had its day in the sun with me, and the memories of writing each still brings back the best feels.
Hey Adam! I'm a huge fan. Your music has inspired me and saved me. I really love how you include your faith in to your music. I hope you can answer some of my quesitons for you! What were some of the craziest fan experiences you've had so far?? How did you react to those you didn't believe in you and said you couldn't do it? Do you have any tips for people who want to go into the music industry? The last question I have is Pans or your fans?!? Thank you for all that you do!! Cinematic is a masterpiece! I can't wait to see you on tour in Milwaukee!|I LIKE TO PAN IT PAN IT Craziest fan experience was when some random fan drew all over our tour bus with sharpie. Not good enough, Sonny Jim. My biggest tip is: be weird! Be yourself! Be your own person! Don't listen to anything else. Don't pay attention to the radio or what's popular.
Why is one of the songs on Cinematic called Be Brave? (By the way cinematic is great!!)|Be Brave is about a time in my life where I had to muster up the courage to ask what would end up being the love of my life out for coffee. Really glad I did. It's about doing something even when you didn't feel equipped, but happy you did it in the end, because it could change your whole world. It's about the magic moments.
How long have you been a birder?|Many moons.
You are honestly my top favorite artist. You're a Christian influence, and inspiration, as a fellow Christian, and I look up to you!

Hi, Adam, been a big fan of you since I ever heard Fireflies on the radio as a kid. The songs was my favorite for a while. My question to you is, do you follow the NBA? If so, Warriors or Cavs? Who do you want to win?|So cool to hear that! I say good luck to everyone and eat some butter.
What's your favorite bird?|ALL THE BIRDS
Good Mornight, Adam! - Are you considering on collaborating with any artists in the future? Any bands or musicians that you're listening to lately? What are your plans for your other side projects? Will there be a possibility of reviving any of them in the future? Thank you very much and stay **pantastic**, Adam!|PANTASTIC. I'm really into country music right now. Brad Paisley, Jake Owen, etc. I love how witty country songs can be. It's inspiring to me. I might bust out some Sky Sailing on eof these days. Gotta love those open acoustic tunings!

First off, I want to say thank you. Your music really helped me through some hard times. Thanks for doing what you do! Which song did you have the most fun making on Cinematic?|I appreciate hearing that! All of them, really! They each hold something unique and meaningful to me. It was fun to record sounds not knowing what songs they would end up in.
Hey Adam! I've loved you since 2009 and I'm a big fan. Your music changed my life. Gonna ask something different: any quick tips to someone trying to produce with Logic Pro X? You're clearly an expert (I've seen you use it on YouTube) and I'd love to hear some of your methods.|Hello and thank you! My biggest tip is: use it everyday, and customize your own Key Commands. Once you get a workflow down, you don't even have to think about anything, your hands just fly over the keyboard and you can manipulate audio/midi as if you were touching it physically. It's a great place to get to. Took me a few years but it's worth the discipline!
First off, I want to say thank you. Your music really helped me through some hard times. Thanks for doing what you do! Which song did you have the most fun making on Cinematic?|Thank you!

(2) What was the main inspiration for Cinematic? (which is awesome, by the way)|2. The main inspiration was to tell a few stories about my own life I've never told anyone before.
(3) What is your favourite song off the new album?|3. Might be a song called Madeline Island. There's a few seconds at the end where it's just waves and insects and I just drift offfffff
What's your favourite thing about releasing an album?|The excitement and support from fans truly touches me. it's incredible to complete something, and be so vulnerable as to allow it into other's personal worlds.

If you were any LOTR character who would you be?|Tators
Hey Adam, what's the story behind New York City from Reel 3/Cinematic? Originally being from the midwest then moving to the east coast \- for me the song hits home and I love it!|Amazing! It originated with the memory of taking a road trip with a buddy of mine several years ago- first road trip I'd ever taken. It then melted together with my memories of NYC through my Owl City years, as well as the memory and feelings of road tripping with my girlfriend for the first few times. It's an affectionate nod toward NYC itself, as well as the compilation feeling of the sort of magic one experiences on a road trip to ANYWHERE.
What was the worst substitute teacher you ever had?|Mrs. Pillmanner. The absolute worsttttt.
Can you pls make a pan sample and use it in your music|I'm on it!
Adam, I have really just wanted to reach out to you and let you know how important your music has been to me. A couple of your songs have stood out to me at very different times of my life. When you released Back Home, I was deployed nearing the end of my deployment. As I listened to it, I came to face the depth of the loneliness I felt and how homesick I felt. I've traveled most of my life but until that moment I never really felt home sick. I sat on my bed and cried for hours as I listened to it on repeat. God was doing a lot in my heart during that season of my life, and your song resonated deep within my spirit. I ended up using the song when I mad our ""Welcome Home"" video when we returned from our deployment. The second is ""If My Heart Was A House."" That song has been special to my wife and I since we started dating, I incorporated it into my proposal, and we danced to it for our first dance at our wedding. The challenge to risk everything, trusting each other to be there, and God to catch us both has been encouraging and inspiring to both of us. I also have multiple songs of yours on my worship playlist, and I have had numerous meaningful times seeking God while listening to your music. I hope that God continues to bless you and use you to impact lives as your music has impacted mine. I don't have a question, I just wanted to thank you for how you have used your gifts and talents, and share how much I appreciate your music. Don't ever doubt the talent and gift God has given you or the impact you can/have/ and do make for the Kingdom of God. Blessings to you!|WOW. This makes my day. Thank you so very much for telling me this. I can't tell you how cool it is to read this. God bless you my friend.
What's your spirit dog?|Chickadee
Hi Adam!! I'm a big fan from Brazil :) I have 2 kinda of simple questions :|Hello!
1. What is your favorite daw?|1. Logic. I like all the other DAWs I've tried but Logic makes the most sense to me.
2. When making a new track, what do you make first the lyrics or the instrumentation?|2. Instrumentation first, lyrics after. I don't know how to write lyrics first, it's something I wanna work on.
My daughter turns 2 tomorrow and her name is Brielle. Can you wish her happy birthday? She is of june!|Happy Birthday, Brielle!
What's your favorite color?|sky blue
Hey Adam, I love that you've been sharing your faith through your music! Any chance that we'll get to hear an acoustic version of Always? That opening piano line gives me chills!|Chills are awesome! I appreciate that. I hadn't thought about an acoustic version but now I'm inspired. Definitely putting that on my list :)
Can you please stop by Vancouver Canada after the Seattle show?|We are on a tight schedule, but you never know!
How did you and Matt Theissen meet and become friends/begin working together?|I sent Matt some of my music back in the day and he was insanely kind to me. We hung out and hit it off! He's such a dear friend to me :)
What's up Adam! I recently travelled to Eagan, MN for work and had the chance to visit Owatonna. It's something I've always wanted to do since I became a huge fan of your work. I got to see the three-pronged plane sculpture and everything! My question is, where is the best place to eat in Owatonna? Not counting Applebees of course|Hello! I hope you can visit Minnesota again soon! There's this little hole-in-the-wall Mexican place called, El Tequila's that I wanna live it.
Hello! Your production is super inspiring so I have a gear question for you. If you had to keep just 3 pieces of your gear (excluding computer) and start over from there, which 3 would they be and why?|Tough question! I'd wanna keep one synthesizer -- my Roland Super JD 900 rack synth. I'd keep my drunk kit (Catalina Club), and some way of recording them -- an external recorder of some kind, maybe a Sound Devices 744T. That would be my dream list for only 3 pieces of gear.
Hey Adam! Cinematic is musically IMPRESSIVE. What was the track you had the most fun composing?|Thanks my friend! Maybe the most fun I had was recording crowd gang vocals for the song All My Friends. We just had a bunch of friends in my studio and we were all just being goofy and singing up a storm.
Do you think you'll ever write more stuff for your blog? There was this one post that has a line that always stuck with me cause I think it's really cool and meaningful. ""You will always be who you are until life changes the locks on your heart and the roof leaks rain. Gotta fix that."" Thanks :)|Firstly, it's so cool that has stuck with you. I'm honored. Blog writing isn't a part of my life right now, but you never know when the urge will happen again!
Cats or dogs? I know you love brids but we gotta know.... cats or dogs ?|Honestly, BOTH, but chances are, I will be getting a cat first.
Hey, Adam! I've always loved the Deer in the Headlights video, can you tell me what it was like filming it and how you got ahold of a delorean?|It was a blast filming that video. They brought in one of the actual Deloreans from Back To The Future and I was dead inside. Such an iconic car!
Hi from France! Your music has been a huge inspiration for me as a music producer, been following you since the beginning, I really love all of your projects and I was wondering if we might ever see a Port Blue type song in the future? Would be awesome!|Possibly, quite possible!! I got ideas!
Yeah, but, WHERE SPECIFICALLY should I get lost in Montana?|I recommend Glacier National Park. You'll get good and lost!
How do you approach choosing tracklisting and how to flow from song to song? Especially for such a large album as Cinematic...|I'm pretty picky about tracklist. For me, it's less about the chronological order of things, but more about the vibe. So if track 1 is an upbeat song, usually I like to follow it with something more laid back. I just kind of feel it out.
Any of your blog tracks available for download?|Only what you can find in the abyss of the internet! Feel free.
Tell me about how growing up/your family life affected your early music and how that's evolved over the years please!|My Dad played a lot of 70's rock-and-roll in his truck when he'd drive me to school every morning. So I was into Led Zeppelin and Steppenwolf and Boston and stuff. I'm not sure if those influences found their way into Owl City haha. But those were some of my first musical loves.
Hi Adam! I was on twitter last night, I literally only got a reddit account to ask if you could name my Prius... (We can't decide lol) What do you think my car should be called? :D|Billy.
Hey Adam, I think that anyone who has listened to a previous Owl City album before Cinematic would be able to tell that this album is very unique. Was there anyhting that inspired you to make this album different from the rest and sing about your past throughout the tracks? (P.S. How big is your pan collection?)|PAN IS LIFE. You know, I'm not really sure what it was that got me excited about writing songs to tell my own stories that I've never told before, but once I started messing around with these ideas, I couldn't stop. That's usually how I roll: I let the songs decide what they wanna do and I just sit back and let them evolve. That's the best part about writing for me, jsut letting things happen organically. I don't like to force songwriting.
This album has a title track. You've never done that before. What came into existence first? The song or the album title? What was the writing process behind the song ""Cinematic""?|The song was a small seed when it came to me to create an album around it. I was working on the melody and the lyrics, when it inspired me to think, ""What scenes throughout my life thus far are worth writing about?"" Of course, there are many, but these few followed seamlessly ever since that day in my kitchen as I was trying to beat lines I'd already begun writing for a song titled, Cinematic.
Your older albums seem to be more abstract and dream-like. But were any of those songs secretly inspired by real life experience?|Cinematic is the first album that holds songs written from a personal perspective. Everything prior was pure imagination.
Hey Adam, long time no talk, throwback to the Tinychat days! It's tough to know what to ask you after ten years, but something I'd really like to know is: do you believe you'd ever transition to scoring films as a full-time role, perhaps becoming one of the greats like Williams, Zimmer or Elfman a couple decades down the line? You've mentioning your love for film scores many times, but has your experience with the business side of music made you reconsider that route? And if you were to score films, what genre do you feel you'd like to pursue the most?|Hello sir! Oh man, I'd be lying if I said I havene't dreamed about becoming a full-time composer. The ONE thing that's keeping me from chasing that dream hardcore, is the fact that I love doing my own thing. When you work on a movie, you kind of have to do any and everyting required to serve the picture and the story. For me, having the ability to dabble in movie scores on my own is really fulfilling because I get to kind of do whatever I want. That's really fun for me. If I could score any genre, my top choice would be a darker animated style of film. Don Bluth films from the 90's style, The Secret of NIMH, All Dogs Go to Heaven, etc.
What's the story behind your song firebird And oh who's Mary Lou?|Firebird is the story of my girlfriend's relationship with her older brother, all from her perspective. They have a very special bond and that has always been cool to me, being an only child and all. Mary Lou was a reference to a Ricky Nelson song I covered once called Garden Party.
Hey Adam, love the new album, once I ehard everything I bought the bundle with everything because it's amazing, but my question is Who is your biggest inspiration when it comes to writing music? And what do you listen to when you write music to inspire you to write? Thanks for the album it's incredible and keep doing you!!!🔥❤️|I appreciate you!!!!
Hey Adam! Do you have any plans of visiting South America one day? I know you've been to Argentina before but you also have lots of fans in Brazil to so give us some hope for the future haha btw, congratulations on releasing your new album, I'm so proud and happy for you! I love your work so much.|I'm dying to visit South America again. Some of the best shows I've ever played were in Argentina but I'm absolutely looking forward to my first trip to Brazil. I can't wait! Thanks for the kind words!
Hi Adam! Cinematic is brilliant, album of the summer for me. Much of your music has been inspired by video games such as Wave Race 64, what (if anyting) are you playing these days? Do you ever watch or consider streaming on Twitch.tv? Can't wait to see you on tour!|Wave Race STILL Proves to be an inspiration for me, and I still play it to this day!
Hi Adam! Huge fan, and love that you're a Christian, too. What's your favorite breed of owl? If you had one, what would you name it?|You can't beat the Great Horned Owl. Those little wisps for ears make me laugh. If I had one, I'd name it Tooth Paste.
Hey adam, i'll be seeing you in Minneapolis in October! do you know what songs you'll be playing? I would love to hear some older stuff|It's a secret, but worth the wait!
Hey adam, i’ll be seeing you in Minneapolis in October! do you know what songs you’ll be playing? I would love to hear some older stuff|Home show! See ya there! I'm planning a mix of old and new.
Hey Adam, I've had some burning questions for a while. Were you planning for Fireflies to become such a hit? How did you react when you realised it was a meme? Do you think any songs of your's were overshadowed by Fireflies?|Hey! I didn't, just poured my heart into it and hoped for the best! The meme revolution was awesome- wasn't expecting that. I don't think any overshadowing happened- it's just one people know and love and that's awesome!
If you could pick one thing you hope every listener will take away from this album, what would it be? Edit: this album is amazing. The songs Cinematic and House Wren had me dancing around my living room like a madman from 1230-2am last night. Thank you!|Amazing! I'm so glad to hear that! If this album can encourage all of you to take in life in a cinematic way, as it has been designed, and live each day like you're the star of your own life, my work here is done. Appreciate the Magic life has to offer, and I hope this album can serve as sort of a soundtrack for at least your summer scenes, and forever after that whenever you need it.
How long did it take you to translate the notes from your dream journal to writing actual lyrics for the song ""Lucid Dream""? What was the process like?|It was a pretty quick process. The dream I had was so strange and vivid and mesmerizing, it was all pretty much word-for-word. Usually I'm really picky about rhyming, but for Lucid Dream, I just tried to put in the literal things I saw in the dream. It took 30 minutes or so.
Hey Adam, I know you grew up playing drums and as a drummer myself was wondering 1. What is your favorite album to DRUM to?|1. The Swiss Army Romance by Dashboard Confessional. I've been playing drums to that album for 10 years :)
2. How do you approach drums vs. percussion in your songs, seeing as you have such an interesting approach to percussion in general.|2. Usually I have a pretty good idea of what I want to achieve before I start recording. A lot of times, I'll sit down at the drums and just noodle around until something grabs me. Then I'll either record the kit, or program a rhythm in with samples.
3. Just wanted to say I grew up down the street from you and never realized Matt Theissen would come over and work with you and he was my biggest influence ever....not a question just wanted to let you know my angst.|3. Small world! That's awesome.
Hey Adam! What is your favourite movie of all time?|Jurassic Park. I was in 3rd grade when it came out and it blew my mind. It still does! John William's score is one of my favorite compositions ever.
Hi Adam! I just want to say I miss your songs and I thank you for them. Not really a question or anything but is it okay if I ask for a little prayer/luck from you? I’m taking the Nursing Licensure Examination this Sunday and it would mean so much to me. Thank you!|Good luck! I hope you ace it!
Hey Adam ! Big fan. Just wondering if a Christian album is on the horizon in the future? Have a great rest of the day! :)|Hey thanks! I'm inspired to make a full on CCM album, just trying to figure out the timing. I'd love to make a full collection of original worship songs. Good question!
The line in lucid dream that’s how you study the stars that’s how you study the stars and that’s how you know em by heart what are you trying to explain?|The main idea is that you have to look outside of yourself. Broaden your horizons, push yourself out of your comfort zone and don't listen to what anybody says. Discover everything for yourself and sometimes, that's how you begin to understand things. Life, love, pain, happiness, bacon, etc.
Hey Adam, great to see you’re still making new hits. You’re my favorite artist! Can you tell us how you came up with the more “dreamy” imagery in songs like Saltwater Room and Yacht Club (among many others)?|Hey thanks! In the past, I used to just write down the first thing that came into my head, so a lot of the lyrics were pretty abstract and quirky. I'm always writing down weird ideas and concepts that pop into my mind. The Saltwater Room and The Yacht Club were based around daydreams I would having in high school. I sat at the back of the room and just looked out the window.",t2_fxooj,,,0,,"I’m Owl City. I like birdwatching and collecting vintage cast iron skillets. I also make music.

,destiny2,"There have been an absolute TON of people talking about how much harder the Heroic strikes in Destiny 2 are and how they aren't fun and how people only do them just for the weekly milestone. I gave it a bit of thought and I think I understand why, and honestly, it's not a problem with the playlist, it's a problem with the strikes themselves.

After playing through each strike on both D1 and D2 a few times, I recorded some data. (For reference, this data was pulled from normal strikes)

**Length:**
On average, Destiny 1 strikes took around 8 minutes to complete with the shortest being Fallen SABER at 6:44 and the longest being The Shield Brothers at 9:52.

Destiny 2 strikes on the other hand take an average of about 15 minutes with the shortest being Lake of Shadows (PS4 Exclusive) at 13:37 and the longest being Savathun's Song at 17:22.

**Boss Fights:**
The final room in which you fight the bosses is actually very different between D1 and D2.

In D1, Nearly every strike had a large boss room/area in which to fight with a decent about of cover. This allows players to move around more safely which, of coarse, means players are able to stay alive longer and shoo the boss more. Additionally, these spaces tended to be so large or have so much cover that nearly every single one contained some sort of ""cheese"" spot or at least some place players can go where the boss cannot hurt them while they heal or wait for players to respawn.

D2, on the other hand, has much smaller fight spaces and are much more open with little to no cover. 

*Inverted Spire*: First phase has a few pillars and walls to take cover behind. Second phase has fewer pillars and a boss mechanic designed to knock you out of cover. Third phase has nearly no cover at all.

*Exodus Crash*: The middle platform has 1 pillar in the middle with a few small Fallen cashes, but neither provide much cover since you are generally being attacked from all directions. The outer platforms have more cover, but you are generally punished for standing on them by the shock shanks that make it difficult to move or jump when on those platforms.

*The Pyramidion*: Has some cover when capturing the plates to push the boss out of the first phase, but once in the final phase (where the boss is actually open to damage), ALL of the cover disappears making you open to attack from the boss and all the additional enemies.

**Heroic Strike Modifiers:**
The lack of cover in these areas make these strikes incredibly difficult and frustrating because the make it difficult to survive, often leading to a wipe. These weaknesses are even further established with some of the heroic strike modifiers, especially Glass, Blackout, and Grounded.

Destiny 1's heroic modifiers where also pretty brutal, but usually more on the burn side. Basically everyone knew that Omnigul would be a bitch where there was an Arc burn or Shield Brothers would suck if there was Solar burn, but even with those burn modifiers, there would still be times when your fireteam had enough fire power to completely melt the boss using the burn to your favor. In Destiny 2, it seems this is only possible with the Heavyweight modifier, but even then, so many D2 bosses are heath gated that it's still very difficult.

**TLDR:**
Destiny 2 strikes themselves (not the heroic playlist) are too long and specifically designed to be harder even without modifiers. And with modifiers, heroic strikes can become even more punishing to the point where the time it takes does not feel worth the effort. You could run nearly 4 D1 strikes in the same time it takes to run 2 on D2. That is why people do not want to run heroic strikes for fun in D2.


**Disclaimer:**
I actually really like how difficult strikes can be in D2, I just think heroics push them a bit too far, and I really wish they could get done quicker.",t2_w1r2o,,,0,,Why I think Heroic Strikes feel so much more brutal/worse in D2,[],r/destiny2,False,6.0,discussion,,,,False,,False,dark,,,public,,,{},,7c50eeaa-7e0b-11e6-a909-0e79dd1330a5,False,,,False,False,,{},Discussion,False,23,,,,self,False,blue,[],,,True,,,text,6.0,,,text,self.destiny2,,,,,,,False,False,True,False,False,,,False,412791c4-6755-11e7-94bc-0e6aef238bc8,True,False,False,Hunter,,,,,,t5_2we4j,,,,,8nvxef,,,Bri_Bri_The_Guy,,39,True,all_ads,False,,,dark,/r/destiny2/comments/8nvxef/why_i_think_heroic_strikes_feel_so_much_more/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/8nvxef/why_i_think_heroic_strikes_feel_so_much_more/,159721,1527890924.0,0,,False,,,,,,,,1456947185.0,1536322554.0,,,

,CruciblePlaybook,"**Introduction**

This post will discuss more of the communication teamwork aspect of the PVP playlist in Destiny 2. You will hear every top tier player/team emphasize the importance of “communication” and “teamwork” but what does that necessarily mean? Well I believe the best way I help you understand this concept is to just give you examples to apply in your PVP matches in order to stay competitive. If you are a Lone Wolf some concepts might not directly apply to you but you can use this information when you do have the opportunity to run with a team.

**Tip #1 Call Out Where You Spawn**

A lot of people I help or play with in PVP don’t understand the benefits of what this callout does for your team. When you or your teammate\(s\) die, call out the location of where you spawn up. This callout helps your team in generally two ways.

1. Your team got wiped out and got split spawned. Calling out where you spawn gives your team a general idea of where they should attempt to group up to set up a counterattack instead of getting spawn trapped.
2. Your team wiped out the enemy team but one of your teammates died. If we use a simple example of A,B, &amp; C spawns, your teammate then calls out he spawned at C. That immediately tells you and your team that the enemy will spawn near B or A. This helps with the team’s process of elimination in order for your team to successfully pull of team wipes instead of getting reverse swept.

*Note: 2 is utilized for top tier players but not as much as 1 as 2 coexists in the concept of knowing how to manipulate spawns \(There are more instances where you would just hear these elite players saying go to A after a teamwipe because they already know their teammate is going to respawn at C.\)*

**Tip #2 Call Out Information On HUD \- Power Ammo &amp; Super**

**Power Ammo**

Another important tip. Seems trivial but there are countless times where we will see on the screen that the enemy picked up Power Ammo but yet my teammate will say, “What? When did they have Power Ammo?!”

You have to get this mindset drilled into your head when playing with a team:

***Don’t assume your teammates see what you see***

If everyone on your team sees what you see, there is no point for communication right?

Reasons why teammates don’t see enemies pick up Power can include:

1. Being ADS
2. Was dead and waiting to respawn
3. Was in a gunfight to notice that Power was being picked up.

Chances are one of your teammates will be in those above scenarios so make sure to call out this information even though it’s on the screen.

Also make sure to call out what type of Power Ammo they picked up. You can tell what kind of Power Ammo the enemy picked up with an icon next to it.

For example, if your teammate calls out the enemy grabbed Sniper ammo, this lets you and your team know not to challenge long sightlines and peek at head level.

Another example is if you call out to your teammates the enemy has a Shotgun, this lets you and your team to not be in close quarter engagements.

Another point to build off this is let your teammates know much Power the enemy has left.

For example, a legendary shotgun generally has 5 shots vs Legend of Acrius has 4 shots. If the enemy has Legend of Acrius and you hear 4 shots go off, call out to your teammates that they have no more Power Ammo. If the enemy has a legendary shotgun and you hear the enemy fire 4 shots, let your teammates know the enemy only has 1 shot left.

**Super**

Again be better safe than sorry. Even though it shows on the top of your screen sometimes people aren’t aware.

More importantly though, it is more vital to call this out when the enemy gets their super mid round. This lets your team know if they need to make an adjustment.

For example, if you see an enemy get their Arcstrider as you rotate towards the inside of the map, tell your teammates to back up because the Arcstrider will wipe all of you out OR by letting your teammates know they will be ready for that Arcstrider activation ready to teamshot, super, or power down the enemy.

**Tip #3 Call Out End Of Power Ammo / Super**

Building off Tip #2 let your teammates know when the enemy runs out of Power Ammo or Super. This lets your teammates know that it is safer to attempt a coordinated push on the enemy team.

**Tip #4 Call Out Kill Clip**

Antiope\-D is still a thing. As Antiope\-D is the main offender of Kill Clip, keep in mind there are other weapons out there with this perk: Old Fashioned, 18 Kelvins, the Rattler etc.

If you die to an enemy with a Kill Clip gun, inform your teammates they have Kill Clip. This helps your teammate decide if pushing is safe or not. Even if the enemy is a little bit weak, such as 70&amp;#37; health, your teammate would usually push that with health being 100&amp;#37; vs 70&amp;#37; but with the enemy having Kill Clip active, that health difference is not enough and the enemy wins out.

**Tip #5 Managing Aggro**

So there is 3 steps with this in a sense. To make it simple, there is a callout list you should try to prioritize.

1. Number of Enemies
2. Location of Enemies
3. Super / Power Information \(If Possible\)
4. Call Out If It Safe To Push \(Numbers Advantage, Enemy has no Health\)

This needs to happen when you are BOTH dead or alive.

For example:

I die to two enemies at B.

There are **TWO** enemies at **B FLAG.**     *Told team the location so they can make a play off it.*

**BOTH** of them are **HALF SHIELDS**.      *Lets them know if it’s safe for them to engage.*

You have a **3v2**!                                      *Confirms that your team should definitely engage.*

OR

I see two enemies at B.

There are **TWO** enemies at **B FLAG.**  *Told team the location so they can make a play off it.*

One of them has Shotty!                      *Let’s team know that the enemy has Power and don't run in blind*

BOTH are one shot!                             *Let’s team know that they can be more aggressive.*

This is important because using the above example, I was calling out the two enemies at B. What about the other two? Remember that Destiny’s PVP is 4v4.

Informing your team vital information as fast as possible and your teammates processing and playing off that intel is crucial in winning your matches. The quicker your team can make these adjustments, the better you will be in the long run.

**Tip #6 Your Team Must Know Map Callouts**

“He’s over THERE!”

Don’t lie. Everyone has said this at some point.

Knowing key locations on the map and being able to make the callout, such as simple ones as A Flag, B Flag, &amp; C Flag, make a MONUMENTAL difference in separating the best teams from everybody else.

Make sure that everyone understands what each location is and that they have the same callout for it.

For example in Distant Shore there is a room by C Flag that is commonly referred to as either:

*Donut or Circle or Shrine.*

Now some people can easily understand that when someone calls out Donut it means Circle or Shrine but just to be safe have the map location be uniform.

This tip can easily be mastered by loading your team into a private match of the map and discussing what locations you want to name. Alleviates the pressure on your team when you attempt to call out where the enemy is because generally, a bad call out is worse than no call out at all.

**Tip #7 Designate Your Power Ammo User**

Due to only being one Power Ammo box I see lower skilled teammates being selfish and trying to pick up Power Ammo.

To quickly recap the general importance of Power Ammo.

Initially only one person can pick up Power Ammo in what that person can:

1. Dictate the pace of the game
2. Secure easier teamwipes
3. Deny enemy team pushes
4. Potential to deny enemy super

Only one person can pick up the Power Ammo. So don’t have more than one person trying to grab the Power Ammo or have multiple teammates standing by it \(The exception would be you or your teammate setting up a Barricade so someone can pick it up.\)

So designating a player on your team to pick up the Power Ammo makes this process easy as it lets the other teammates fulfill other roles such as securing power position of the map, manipulating the spawns, and initiate spawn trapping.

I suggest that you have the person with the best slaying capabilities be the person with the Power Ammo. If you want to win, you have to maximize the Power Ammo by giving it to your player that’s best with it.

So for an in game example, let’s say that I have a sniper rifle equipped and my team secures the team wipe, with me being the lone survivor. Power Ammo spawns up in 5 seconds. My teammate who has Legend of Acrius, and is good with the gun, spawns up next to me and the Power Ammo. Instead of us fighting over the Power Ammo, we should do one of two options:

A\) I tell my teammate to push up and deny the enemy team from getting a lane onto Power so I grab Power Ammo.

B\) I push up to deny enemy team from getting a lane onto Power Ammo so my teammates grab Power Ammo.

If our team decided that my teammate was going to be our main Power user because Legend of Acrius gets us easier round wins, I would already know to be initiating Option B along with my other two teammates. My two teammates and I would already be rotating towards the enemy, spawn trapping them, while my last teammate can help clean up and secure the teamwipe. Then rinse and repeat.

**Tip #8 Make Coordinated Pushes With The Super**

It is important to make a coordinated team push when using your super. To give a simple example:

You see 4 enemies sitting on B flag. You are a Nightstalker and fire your tether on B tethering all four enemies. You died in the process because you did get shot by four enemies but you come to the realization that your three teammates are nowhere to be found, being on the other side of the map. The enemy then teamshoots the tether and this scenario results in you wasting your super and giving your enemy a free kill.

So there are two major points you and your team need to master. One is making the callout. Two is knowing if your team can play off the callout.

So using the above scenario again, even if I yell, “Four enemies on B! I’m going to tether them!”, it doesn’t do much good because remember, your teammates are on the other side of the map. Your teammates can hear you and try to play off it, but in reality it’s impossible. The outcome would still be the same as the previous scenario \(You dying and wasting a super.\)

Remember that communication is a two way street. If my teammate was the one with the super ready and wants to make a push, I would let my teammate know that he is by himself and that there is no one with him yet. This lets your teammate know to wait for everyone else to get in better position. Just waiting one second makes a huge difference in winning the round vs losing the round.

To provide more pros to why coordinated pushes are important.

1. Enemies are generally focused on the Super this means the three teammates should get free kills as the enemy is generally shooting the Super or running away from the Super
2. Manages the enemy aggro. The enemy will sometimes decide to shoot you instead of the Super, so it divides the enemy attention allowing the Super to survive and secure a team wipe. Make sure to call out to your teammate that the enemy is focused on you \(Tip #5\)
3. Prevent the enemy team from getting free kills. Again I just want to emphasize the point of not giving the enemy a free kill because you decided to push alone, even if you have Power Ammo. Make sure that if you do push alone, whether it be through a flank or initial rotation, that your team is on the same page and ready to play off it.

**Tip #9 Make Coordinated Pushes With Power Ammo**

Everything about Tip #9 is the same as Tip #8. Just replace the word Super with Power Ammo.

What I want to add onto this though is that Power Ammo in a sense holds more weight in determining you winning matches as Power Ammo spawns up multiple times per round and more importantly, anybody can pick up Power Ammo upon death.

If you push up by yourself with Power Ammo and die, you basically handed the round away. Not only did you give the enemy team a free kill, but you gave them Power Ammo as well, resulting in a reverse sweep. So again, make sure to form coordinated pushes so that in case you do die with Power, your teammates can either pick up the Power Ammo or kill the enemy before they can pick it up.

**Tip #10 Focus On The Above 9 Tips** **\(A.K.A Don't Be A Rager Like Me\)**

This tip is specifically meant for me as I’m struggling mightily with this but it can possibly apply to you as well. Getting frustrated in this game is quite common due to an infinite amount of crap that happens to this game, \(Lag, cheaters, teabaggers, whiffed melees, getting shot through walls, teammates acting like J.R. Smith in Game 1 of the NBA Finals\) there are plenty of reasons to get frustrated while playing this game.

Using myself as the example, I will get upset and completely ignore the other 9 tips, where I would be venting how bullshit it was that I got shot through a wall when instead I should be telling my teammates where the enemy is.

It is important again to avoid being on tilt as those seconds wasting my energy raging should be used on helping the team. Also it doesn’t help your teammates focus if all you hear is yelling in the background \(I know, I do this a lot, I’m working on it.\)

**Conclusion**

Overall, these tips have helped me long term \(Even though I’m still working with #10\). Hopefully you and your team recognizes which weaknesses your team needs to work on so you can improve both as an individual player and as a team.

,relationships,"I am 27F, if it matters. At one point, my sister Jenelle and I were very close. That is until she started drinking heavily and abusing drugs. If you can think of it, she's snorted, smoked, popped, or injected it. She claims she has been clean from ""hard"" drugs for over a year. 

I lean towards believing that. She dumped her druggie boyfriend and moved back in with our parents late last year. On the outside, it looks like she's trying to get her life together. She has been getting treatment for her bipolar disorder and PTSD, got her license back and bought a car. She has even been talking about going back to school. I was really proud of her.

I had been talking recently with Jenelle about letting her move in with me. She doesn't feel right staying with our parents at her age. I totally understand that and while I was a bit hesitant at first, I agreed to let her live with me. I talked it over with my boyfriend first, of course. He is a big fan of my sister. Granted, he thinks she's a bit eccentric, but they have always gotten along well. 

After what happened over the weekend, I don't know if I would be comfortable with Jenelle living with us anymore. This is her story:

She was driving in her car and briefly glanced at her phone to change the song on her Spotify playlist right as she drove past a cop, who was laying in wait on the side of the road. She gets pulled over. The cop approaches her car and according to her, the driver side window is stuck in the up position, so she opened her door which she says freaked the cop out and he became aggressive.

She says at this point, he ordered her out of the car at gun point. She claims to have been 100% compliant. Well, lo and behold, he got a whiff of pot. Jenelle swears she had not smoked that day, but it was possible that he smelled her hoodie that she wears often and rarely washes. 

Now, at this point, I can more or less buy her narrative, by the way.

Anyway, so the cop searches her and her car. According to Jenelle, she was not at all worried because she knew she had nothing on her. Despite that, the officer found a single pill pushed up under the fabric lining in her center console.

It was a Xanax bar.  

Jenelle vehemently swears that it was the former owner's pill because she just bought it on Wednesday of last week, I believe. She said the car hat been cleaned and she had no reason to think there was anything of the sort in the car.

Surprise, she gets arrested anyway.

She gets taken to the hospital for a drug test, for some reason. Jenelle swears all they found in her system was pot and Adderall and that she hadn't done those drugs in over a day. Regardless, on top of the possession, they charged her with a DUI, as well.

She sat in jail for the weekend until my parents bailed her out on Monday. I looked at the charges online and indeed she was forthright with her charges: DUI and possession of a schedule 4 drug w/o prescription, or something like that. I looked it up and Xanax is a schedule 4 drug, so I buy the majority of her story, I just cannot believe the pill was not hers with her history. 

That's a mighty fine coincidence, in my opinion. Maybe it's wrong of me to hold her past against her, I just honestly don't know anymore. Jenelle is usually a very honest person, but I know addiction can make anyone a liar.

My parents believe her 100% though. They were always in denial about her substance abuse, enabled her even. My mom gave her money all of the time, without Jenelle even asking, when she knew full well that she had a drug problem.

I guess I'll just end this post here since it's getting lengthy, I really just needed to run this by an outside perspective. Should I trust my sister? My boyfriend is on the fence. Jenelle is trying hard to sway him, claiming if she DID have drugs she would have put them in her bra, or, uh, her lady pocket and who has one Xanax anyway? She would have taken it and she pissed clean for Xanax. She almost has him convinced.

TLDR Addict sister gets pulled over and cop finds a single pill of Xanax stashed in her car, that to be fair, she did just very recently buy used off Craigslist. Swears the pill was not hers and that she was not even intoxicated, but pot and Adderall were found in her system, so she got a DUI, too. I was going to let her move in with me, but now I'm not sure. It seems like nearly everyone but me believes her and I'M starting to feel like the crazy person.

,loseit,"Hey, so this is about to be a wall of text. Stick with me, or go to the TLDR at the end :)

So 2 years ago, I adopted the cutest little dog in the world. Shortly after we got her, she went into heat (2 days before I had scheduled to have her fixed....) and all of a sudden, I had this little ball of energy that I couldn't take to the park. I thought, maybe I'll try doing some running with her. It was painfully slow at first. I didn't have good sneakers, I felt ungainly and thought constantly that people were watching me and judging me. I used the r/C25K program and slowly built up little by little by little. It had been a few months by this time, and I started to feel a little better about running in general. Then, a funny thing happened. I started to like it. There was something about getting up in the morning and knowing that I had that time to myself. I didn't feel I had to go far, or that I needed to be fast, just knowing that I got out there an accomplished something before 9am started to be a big motivator. 

In February 2017, my husband convinced me to do a 5k with him, and I agreed, knowing that I might have to walk bits of it. BUT I didn't. I powered through and ran the whole thing. It took me 32 minutes, and I was exhausted at the end, but so happy. I started to change my mindset. Instead of thinking ""I can't run this"" I started to think ""I will run this"". I started doing longer and longer distances and, on a whim, signed up to run a half marathon (21km) in September of that year. I got closer and closer to the distance and started to think It was actually going to happen. Morning of, I woke up at 6am and it was already 28C degrees. I ran the damn thing, but it wrecked me. It was SO HOT. I did it though. I felt amazing. 

In June, I decided to start using MFP. I had tried a few years back and had seen a slight dip in the scales to the tune of 10lb. I then stopped using it and quickly went right back up to where I had been most of my adult life. By the time June rolled around, I had already seen a ton of progress, but nothing drastic, more of an overall toning from the running. I set myself at a 1lb per week deficit, and kept doing what I was doing exercise-wise. Again, things went slowly, but little by little the weight started to melt away. I also started to get faster.

I started to enjoy physical activities. I remember in the past going for hikes and, while I liked the scenery and company, I would be thinking to myself the whole time ""when is this going to end? Can't we go for a movie, or hang out at a cafe?"" In January, I went rock climbing with my brother and I loved it. Biking with my husband, loved it. Swimming on the weekends for fun, paddle boarding, slacklining, hiking, yoga. All of a sudden, all these things I had never wanted to do before seemed like so much fun. 

I continued to run, and did a 30km race (Around the Bay) in March. I have started climbing several times a week, and now do 5.10's with ease. All this isn't to say there haven't been struggles, but I am spending so much more time outside, time with my husband and dog, that I never would have before. 

**If I could go back in time, these are some things I would tell past me:**

1. Don't rush the speed when running. Go at your own pace until you can go faster. This is NOT A FAILURE. You are amazing, keep going.

2. Try not to eat back all your exercise calories, maybe aim for half. This being said, there are days when you will be hungry, and this is ok. Take a cheat day now and again if you need to. Remember, while the goal is to be fit, happiness is better.

3. Buy good sneakers. Really. It will just make your life so much better and prevent hip issues, bruised toes and blisters.

4. Find a meal you like for lunch, and learn how to make a whole weeks worth. This takes away the temptation of over eating at lunch and leaves a bit more room for dinner.

5. Burrito bowls are the best. 600cal and so tasty.

6. Drink lots of water. Tea is good too, but the water is important, especially when running long distances.

7. It's ok to have setbacks and plateaus. Sometimes loosing weight isn't just about the numbers on the scale, and muscle might be a factor too.

8. Don't get discouraged. You can do it.

**Fav lunch recipe**

I affectionately call this one bean slop. It tastes sort of like the innards of a burrito, and you can garnish it with a variety of toppings making it slightly less boring to eat every day.

1/2 cup rice

1 can refried beans

1 cup tomato sauce

3 cans of flaked tuna in water

1/2 a red onion diced

1 cup cherry tomatoes diced

1 tbs garlic powder

Directions:
Cook the rice first, then add all ingredients and let it simmer on low heat for about 30 mins. Portion out into 5 containers.
Calories: roughly 350 per serving
It is very filling and satisfying. I often add other ingredients such as cheese, avocado, tomatoes, sour creme, aioli dressing ect.

**TLDR:** 

Ok. So here's why in the end it doesn't really matter.  I hit my goal weight. I thought I would be more proud about it, but the thing I'm most proud of is how far I have come with my fitness level. a few years ago, I could barely run 1km, and now I could run 20 no problem. I get up every morning and look forward to my run with the dog. That feeling of accomplishment before 9am even rolls around is incredible. The scale is a number and, while it's important, it isn't everything. The progress I have seen in fitness has been, ultimately, so much more important to me than dropping the weight. Now, I know there are others out there who have lost amazing amounts, and I just want you to know, you inspire me beyond words. The support and friendliness of this sub is amazing and I love you all.

I thought I would be more proud about it, but the thing I&amp;#39;m most proud of is how far I have come with my fitness level. a few years ago, I could barely run 1km, and now I could run 20 no problem. I get up every morning and look forward to my run with the dog. That feeling of accomplishment before 9am even rolls around is incredible. The scale is a number and, while it&amp;#39;s important, it isn&amp;#39;t everything. The progress I have seen in fitness has been, ultimately, so much more important to me than dropping the weight. Now, I know there are others out there who have lost amazing amounts, and I just want you to know, you inspire me beyond words. The support and friendliness of this sub is amazing and I love you all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, it&amp;#39;s about one thing: Find what makes you happy, and keep doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

,DestinyTheGame,"Okay Bungie, it's time to sack up and admit what we all know. The competitive playlist in particular is a nightmare. Just to throw out some buzzwords, time to kill and teamshotting are still rampant, (Bungie has addressed these multiple times so we won't talk any more on them.) 4 stacks are almost always at an advantage against solos, no matter the skill level of the solo. The ""ranked"" system in general is little more than a indicator of how much time you've spent in quick play, or how much you run streaking with 4 stacks. Finally, with the recent heavy ammo changes, people on the same teams are quite literally fighting over heavy.

_________________


Ooph. These are the main problems that I'm seeing in the pvp realm. All of these are very fixable problems. So let's break down all of these problems 1 by 1, offer solutions, and try and see where the disconnect is with Bungie and the community.

_________________


So, let's talk 4 stacks. 

Honestly, at this point it needs to be said. Split solos off from 4 stacks. There's no reason a 4 stack should go against solos. Period, the end, done. Bungie has stated that they don't want to split the game's already fragile population. I'm willing to bet however, that with the addition of a solo que only option for both quick play, and competitive, more people would be willing to pvp! The thought of knowing that no matter what, you won't be going against a 4 stack is immediately a weight off the shoulders. Not to mention, whenever I am in a 4 stack and go against solos, my first thought is ""well these guys are going to get rolled."" It's not fun as a solo, it's not fun as a 4 stack. There is no challenge in it, and if there's no challenge, there's no fun. 


Bungie's disconnect: We wanted solos to never get matched against 4 stacks. We wanted that to never happen, like ever. Instead we have hidden values that tell us, hey there's a ""lower chance"" you'll see 4 stacks as a solo. Which, from the posts I've been seeing isn't happening. People are still constantly matching against the rolling teams that have better communication, and team play then they will ever have with 3 rando's, it's just not fun or fair.

I should note, I'm NOT a solo player by any means. I just understand and empathise with their plight. It's not fair to them to face off against a 4 stack. I feel you solo's I feel you, this one is easily the most important thing on this list and if Bungie takes anything from this, WE DONT WANT SOLOS GOING AGAINST 4 STACKS.


Solutions

1. Split the playlist. Plain and simple.

2. Tie matchmaking to actual rank (more below.)




Alright alright alright, time to talk about rank since the above topic kind of ties into it. 

So what we wanted was a system similar to....well....any other ranked game. A system in which we could climb a ladder while being faced against others of our same rank. Normally, at the start of a season, in almost any competitive game you go through ""placements."" This is a series of matches to determine your ""skill"" and place you in a a ""Rank"" based on your skill. So how this SHOULD have worked, you do your placement matches, you are placed in the rank ""brave"" because you faced some really good people, followed by a solid comeback win, a couple more wins, a loss etc. The game has determined you should start here and climb or fall from here. You face people who are also the ""brave"" rank. Period. You might face 1 or two people in the ""heroic"" rank. Nothing above that. That is how competitive, matchmaking should work. There's hundreds of examples of these systems that work. It's honestly really simple. Instead, we got a system in which, players often face off against players FAR above their skill level despite the game thinking otherwise. This problem is exacerbated, by teams against solos. Immensely. It does not matter if I'm a god at the game, I cannot beat a 4 stack with 3 blueberries that don't know how to pvp in Destiny 2. This is purely an example, I'm only slightly above average at pvp, but you understand the point. Finally, if I'm a lower rank and I am matched against multiple higher rank players, then I should be rewarded for beating those higher ranked players. Should I lose to these higher ranked players, I shouldn't be punished as though I'm the same rank as them. The same works in vise versa, if I'm higher rank and I smash some lowbies, that's not fair and I shouldn't receive as many points. If I lose to those lowbies I should be punished harshly.


Bungie's disconnect: The issue here is that they heard we wanted ranked and brought in....half of a ranked system in my eyes. Like so many things in Destiny 2 it's ALMOST there. It's almost fun, it's almost acceptable. We have a system in place right now that is so close to a real ranked system. It just has a massive glaring flaw. We're not placed against players of our rank. We're placed against players with HIDDEN skill values that we can't see. The current Glory numbers mean absolutely nothing, which in turn defeats the entire purpose of RANKED. If a group of 4 people that were all really not good, went against other people who weren't good, and then promptly went on a 50 win streak to get 2000 glory, we have no idea whether the people they were going against were actually increasing in skill or not. Because we don't have a system in place that means anything. Instead we have, essentially a glorified (no pun intended) glory win streak counter. In fact now that I mention it, is there not an emblem that does indeed track the highest glory win streak you've been on? Yes, there is. 


Solutions

1. Make rank and skill the same thing. Base our matchmaking off of our rank. This is what everyone wanted and thought you meant  when you said you were doing ranked comp.

2. Give us placement matches so we can start in our proper rank and climb/fall.

3. Give appropriate points for wins an losses. I.E. if I'm a brave matched against 4 fabled players, I shouldn't lose many points at all, but if I beat those players I should be awarded more points. 


Heavy ammo time. 

So this is a weird topic. Bungie threw in more heavy ammo spawns and faster timers and all this stuff to (in my eyes,) artificially lower TTK. This is....not exactly what we asked for but it's what we got. This created several more issues instead of solving the ones we already had. Which were, people fighting over heavy, pushing team mates off, flaming in chat, Titans shoulder charging off heavy. Shit has to stop. It's awful, everything about Destiny 2 works to incentivize team play....until heavy spawns. Instead of having only singular bricks, there should probably be a system in which the whole team has the ability receive heavy ammo, similar to D1 in addition to the singular control point single bricks. This way teams don't have to fight over heavy with both their team mates and the enemy. As it stands having heavy ammo while no one else does, is essentially on the same level as having a super when no one else does. Except people have next to no idea that you have it. It's essentially a cheap kill that unless the person with said heavy is bad, is basically not out playable. People don't like being limited, they don't like not having the ability to outplay someone with their own hands.

Bungie's disconnect: The biggest disconnect here was bungie thinking that more heavy would make us satisfied with the artificially lowered TTK. This wasn't the change to heavy we wanted. We wanted to stop murdering our own team mates every time they took that sniper for the 5th time and a row and promptly died with it for the 5th time in a row without securing a single kill /  assist. The heavy ammo pick up was good but why should I have to get my team mates death scraps because he died with heavy 10 times in a row.  :(



Solutions

1. Communal heavy spawns, either in single bricks or different spawn points.

2. Add more weapons like fighting lion in the game. (I.E. power weapons in the kinetic/primary slots, this also ties into weapon slots but that's a chat for another day.)

I’ve been to see my counselor and am scheduled to be in with a psychiatrist soon as well as a new counselor closer to the family. I’m spending a lot of time with them lately. Don’t worry about me. Shit’s rough, but I’m alive and breathing and have a lot to be grateful for. I’m okay. I am writing because I want you to know why I cannot be the friend you need right now. I am writing because I want to help you if you’re hurting. 

The last time we spoke - or rather, argued - I was not mentally well. I’m not sure why or how the breaking point ended up being you again, but it was. There were a lot of factors involved, and although I am doing MUCH better I am currently extremely depressed and experiencing quite a bit of anxiety. I am not in a good place. This year was filled with blessings but was FAR from easy for me, and I lost sight of myself for a short while. I am still finding me again. Because of that, I can’t be talking to you. I can’t be the sympathetic ear you need. Although we cannot talk I want so badly for you to understand why. My soul screams for you to understand. For you to know it is not you. I need you to know that I did not flee because you did something wrong, but because I did. The reason why is me. My mental illness. My breaking point. This is not your fault. I have been advised to not read a single thing you send me for the sake of my own mental health and I am taking that advice. I have to. There is too much pain. There is too much guilt and resentment and shame and sadness and confusion. I’m not telling you this because I want you to feel bad about it, I just really really really want you to know that I’m not ignoring you because I don’t care. I do care. My problem has always been that I care too much to do what’s right for me, to the point that I break and my mind is clouded because I stopped putting my needs first. To the point that I say or do hurtful things while under some influence, whether emotional or intoxicant, because I have become so unwell that I have lost myself. Because I have lost God. Because I have lost a friend.

We cannot be friends right now because it is not good for me, and I am sure it is not good for you as well. We cannot be any more than friends because I am in love with someone else. I have been eaten alive by guilt lately as my head as been cleared and I’ve thought long and hard about the things I said to you during that time. I want you to know that I am sorry for the hell I put you through during our time together, near and far, in things that I have done and things that I had (or still have) left undone. I want you to know that when I am well and my head is clear, I don’t resent you. I want you to know that I love you like I love my sister, or my best friend, or my niece or my nephew. I want you to know that life is currently scarier and number than it has been for me in a long, long time - and it is for that reason I must leave every message you send me on “read” and I must put this on a subreddit instead of sending it to you.

I’m not sure what is going on in your life right now but it looks like you might be going through some hell. I wish I could send you words of encouragement, offer advice, or do something like make you a playlist of positive music. I wish I could help take care of you, because you are - in a parallel universe where fate so had it - my number one. We don’t occupy that universe right now and I can’t throw away the things and people I have just in case... ????? I don’t know. I can’t let myself think about it. I can’t do that. It will destroy me. I’m sorry. 

I’m not sure what it is going on in your life that makes my body ache with the desire to help, but I will tell you that whatever is going on, whether it is my fault or something outside of me, *you have the strength to see it through*. You have the smarts. You have the charm and the talent and the *incredible* will to being that is needed to suffer the storm. You can do this. You can *fucking do this*. You can blaze through every problem in your way and leave a trail of ashes in your wake fitting of a phoenix. You can conquer your trauma and not let it control you. You can face your demons and not let them define you. 

Look in the mirror. Look at what you see. You might not like it, but it’s what you got. Nobody else can tell you about you. Nobody else can tell you your flaws or praise your good traits. If you look in the mirror and you see an image that somebody else has forced upon you, smash that fucking mirror and build you a new one. Appreciate the small things. Love everything you like. The best advice I would give you if we ever got that conversation I wish we had, from the bottom of my heart, is to appreciate the small things. Go for a run - I know it used to be something you liked to do. Draw for you. Write for you. Swim and eat and breathe and shit and fuck *for you*. You might not wake up tomorrow, and indeed one day you won’t. You will die one day. I will too. Until then, though, you are living for some unfathomable reason. Some phenomenon we will never understand made it so that you are a single instance of the universe experiencing its own breathtaking wealth. Our existence, the miracle of the human consciousness, is something that nobody could ever understand lest it not be worth understanding. I choose to call all the miracles, the beauty, the infinitesimal chance of *you* God. Whatever adage you prescribe to this world that is here just for you, hold that close to you. It is comprised of your childhood, your dreams, your passions, your blessings, your friends (even if they are few), your family, your favorite food, your favorite TV show, your favorite book, and your favorite future. That is what God is to me. God is the faith that this planet is filled with awful shit, sometimes of our own fault, but it’s okay because this planet is also filled with all of the world’s favorite things. Choose to focus on the things of this life You like, choose to make your own meaning, choose to say *fuck you* to those that would make a monster of you because you know you better than anyone else. You are the only one who has a right to your body, your mind, and your own will to being. You can make the kind of change I did, find the kind of happiness I did, and reconcile the kind of trauma I did with the power of positive thinking and faith in good universe. 

I don’t mean to make this about me - I mean to say that my words are not based on emptiness. There is a ground I am standing on and it is my own life, which is not a perfect one but is a damn marked improvement from what came before. I really, really mean it when I say I believe in you. If you feel as if no one else does, then I want you to know that I am on this same rock hurtling through space as you and I believe in you. There are times I am angry with you, I am sad of you, and in which I wish I understood you to the same capacity as I used to. Nonetheless, at the end of the day when I have tuckered myself out from screaming and crying and cursing you or my God, I always fall asleep with the same notion: I believe in you. I want you to know that not a single moment, whether wracked with emotion or psychosis, has gone by that I have doubted your ability to conquer anything that comes your way. If I have made you believe the opposite, it is because my belief in myself has wavered and not my belief in you. You can do this. Anything. Whatever “this” is. If it’s me, if it’s school (or the lack thereof), if it’s family troubles, if its substance abuse, if it’s mental illness, if it’s loneliness, you can beat everything that stands in your way and carve a happiness for yourself. I know this. I believe in you. Let go of the romantics and hold on to the belief. I am freeing you. Do not hold on to the idea that we would have a romantic future together, please, because I am not. You are free. You are free to find a love a thousand times better than me. You are free to meet somebody that deserves you. You are free to have all the excitement and sexuality and happiness you deserve because you are free to let go of me. Please do that. Our romantic future is done. You are free.

Look in the mirror. Pat your face a little bit. Pinch your cheeks, throw water for the dive reflex, emerge from this ocean of pain and twisted fate and lost love. Look. *Look*, please for the love of fucking God *look*. You’re here. You’re alive. You are still standing even after all of the shit. You are going to be okay. If you don’t believe it, if anybody out there is trying to push you into not believing it, if my memory pushes you not to believe it, cast all of those things aside. I believe it. I believe in you. 

I don’t know if I will ever sit here and write a letter that you will never read again, or if I will ever get the chance to lift you up like I want to again, or if I will ever understand you again like I wish I could. I don’t know if either of us will ever move on enough so that we can be friends. I don’t know if I will ever gather the strength to finish reading your words. I don’t know if the next time we speak you are met with this self - this me, writing these words, having casted aside our twisted fates so that I could reach into your universe and claw at your being so that I might prevent you from drowning - but I know it doesn’t matter. I know you can make it. I know I do not have romantic feelings for you but I still care for you every bit as much as I ever have. We are separated by miles and oceans and families and unrequited love and hurtful words and painful pasts but I believe in you and your dreams even though I can no longer be here or there to tell you that. 

I could sit here and talk for hours, but I need rest. I need healing. I need movement on dreams standing under none. I don’t know if you’ll ever hear from me again, but I reckon this won’t be the last unsent letter I write. Until then? Know that I believe in you, even if I do not have romantic feelings for you. Know that I will not stop believing in you. Do me a favor? Do what I did when I started writing this and cast aside any conceptions of me or you or us or the past. Read these words. Read only these words that are unsent because this is the person that believes in you, this is the friend I hope you can hold close to your heart. This is the person that will always believe in you, even when they’ve doubted you.

Wherever you are, whatever you’re doing, look up. Breathe in the petrichor. This life is yours. Make it a happy one - I believe you can.

Hey guys, CANAS1AN here. I am going to keep the format of the post the same as the videos are similar, but the actual game play is different.

[Here is a sneak peek](https://twitter.com/CANAS1AN/status/1001855829157363713)

Last week Jayne was making a dedicated push to learn Zarya. You can see the video he made on his progress [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5Qp8ZT3C2I)

Essentially he correctly deduces that his main problems are reloading WAY too much and that he is not getting good usage out of his barriers.

Seeing Jayne dedicate a lot of time to improving the hero, I offered to help and with Jayne's permission, I did 5 Zarya Vod Reviews of his game play. This is the third one.

[Reviewing Jayne's Zarya.#3 of 5](https://youtu.be/TDVXUwRKn2A)

As usual, the main focuses of the vod review are:

* Positioning
* Target Selection
* Ability Usage
* Ultimate Usage
* Reload Discipline
* Beam/Grenade Discipline

Expect a new Jayne Analysis each day this week. 

Thanks for watching, hope it was helpful, and as always, have a good one.

[Here is a sneak peek](https://twitter.com/CANAS1AN/status/1001855829157363713)

Last week Jayne was making a dedicated push to learn Zarya. You can see the video he made on his progress [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5Qp8ZT3C2I)

Essentially he correctly deduces that his main problems are reloading WAY too much and that he is not getting good usage out of his barriers.

Seeing Jayne dedicate a lot of time to improving the hero, I offered to help and with Jayne's permission, I did 5 Zarya Vod Reviews of his game play. This is the third one.

[Reviewing Jayne's Zarya.#3 of 5](https://youtu.be/TDVXUwRKn2A)

As usual, the main focuses of the vod review are:

* Positioning
* Target Selection
* Ability Usage
* Ultimate Usage
* Reload Discipline
* Beam/Grenade Discipline

Expect a new Jayne Analysis each day this week. 

Thanks for watching, hope it was helpful, and as always, have a good one.

,omnifocus,"What sets OmniFocus out as a great task manager is right there in its name: **focus**.

Through a magic soup of metadata (status and times) and categorisation of tags, projects and actions (tasks), it is possible to build crystal clear viewports onto your tasks, tightly focused on only what’s relevant, hiding away fluff. It’s exceptional.

This review is primarily about the general concepts behind *OmniFocus 3*, but later gets into specifics of OmniFocus 3.0 for iOS, released today (30 May 2018). At the time of writing the macOS version is still in the proving drawer with a beta expected in summer 2018.

## Custom Perspectives

The in-built views, perspectives, of your actions provide simple ways to slice into your task lists to get your work done with what’s happening now.

However sometimes you may find you want more clarity or you find yourself preparing the same views over and over. For this case, you can create a *custom* perspective.

OmniFocus 3 takes the custom perspectives of the past and boosts them to new levels with rules. These rules are based on the same (and some new) criteria used in the old perspective builder. The power comes from *boolean logic* (AND, OR, NOT) rules. (Think smart playlists in iTunes.)

Say you often want to make a quick loaf for friends (some of whom have nut allergies or despise currants) as you work your way through all the enriched bread recipes you could find. You can build this custom perspective:

	All of the following:
		Availability: Available
		Is contained within project or folder: Enriched Breads
		Has an estimated duration less than: 30 minutes
		None of the following:
			Is tagged with any of: nuts, currants

This will show only the actions from your Enriched Breads folder which are available (incomplete, not deferred or held back), quick to prepare (less than 30 minutes) and aren’t tagged with nuts or currants.

*These recipes may require slight alterations to the laws of physics, but that’s another app.*

## Tags

Another way that OmniFocus 3 extends its power is by using tags. At first thought the idea of tags could seem overwhelming, but only if you think of them as you might in any other app, as categories. Instead, it’s more important to think of them as avenues that will provide ways to view your action lists. Some tags may be analogous to contexts in prior versions of OmniFocus like tools/equipment or places. You could also use tags for people, a time of day, energy level, priority or steps in a planning process (researching, planning, doing, delivering).

For what tags to use, my advice remains steadfast: think about how you work or want to work, try out tags and adjust as necessary. I’d recommend adding a repeating action to review your tags, especially whilst in flux, to think about how they’re working. I might also suggest using as few as you can get by with.

Tags combined with the power of custom perspectives can give you an always-ready set of lists of the baking that will: get you a licensure, make your friends happy, push you forward innovating at your fledgling patisserie. 

### Forecast Tag

In a few months of use, my tags are almost identical to my old contexts, but with one very important addition. The **Forecast tag**. 

Items tagged with this are granted a special status: they will appear in the Forecast perspective alongside due and deferred items. For anyone who always wanted to use Forecast as a working/‘Today’ perspective, this may be your answer. You can even reorder the actions as you wish.

In my previous OmniFocus systems I used flags to denote those things that were my current priorities (not just for today, but the next few). The Forecast tag has replaced this practice. 

I now have four priority levels without any extra faff:

1.	Overdue: drop everything
2.	Due soon: Do it! Don’t let it go red!
3.	Flagged: I really ought to do this today; I’ll be happier for it
4.	Forecast-tagged: I promise myself I’ll do this soon

I really appreciate that the flag can now hold more importance as its orange highlight really stands out now. One nice touch on iOS: swiping from left to right on a project or action gives a quick way to anoint it with the Forecast tag or flag it. 

## OmniFocus.ipa

For me this release is almost as much about making the *app* more powerful and useful. This is most noticeable on iPad where the 2016 pledge to bring more desktop power to iPad continues to bear fruit.

First off, OmniFocus for iOS features multiple selections and batch editing of actions. On iPad, there’s also a three-column layout allowing for a persistent inspector column. These three things have completely changed how I use OmniFocus when interacting with my database.

The info panel/inspector is now customisable, too. If you never use defer dates and estimated duration, for example, you can hide those fields. The option to ‘Mark complete… (Manually/With Last Action)’ for projects was previously only shown on Mac, but is now available on iOS. Following this pattern, I expect the ‘Completed’ time and date field will also make its way here eventually.

The outline view, which shows your projects and actions in context is also much improved. Between iPhone and iPad the views are the same and I find it easier to scan my lists. In custom perspectives there are also new grouping options and project information can be optionally shown. Additionally, a feature I *love* from the Mac has made its way to iOS: Clean Up. If an item changes so that it doesn’t fit in the current perspective, it is greyed-out but not immediately removed (cleaned up) in case you’ve made a mistake or want to make further edits before it disappears. On iPhone you can pull down to refresh and clean up at the same time, whilst on iPad there’s a dedicated button. (You can also customise the behaviour if you don’t like this.)

Lastly, whilst it may only seem superficial, custom perspectives can be much more personalised in OmniFocus 3. Each perspective can have its own colour, reflected in the iconography as well as on the home screen and any image can also serve as its icon. On iPad, you can just drag in an image from Photos or the web. (If you’re looking for custom icons, you needn’t look further than [these icons produced by Josh Hughes](http://omnifocusicons.josh-hughes.com/), which have been refreshed to match the app’s new visual style and colours. There are lots of new icons, too.)

## *n* actions remaining

It’s impossible for a piece of software to be perfect. Whether that’s because of bugs or because of outstanding features, every revision, major or minor, is another step toward an unreachable goal.

There are still features on the [OmniFocus roadmap for this year](https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/omni-roadmap-2018#omnifocus3) that aren’t present in 3.0: JavaScript automation, sharing/collaboration and ‘nagging’ notifications. We’ll likely be seeing 3.1 and 3.2 before the end of 2018 with these features.

Aside from those though, I reckon there’s still plenty to do. My short list for iOS:

-	*More* keyboard power: OmniOutliner has tremendous keyboard support so I expect this will be added in short order
-	A better date picker: the iOS standard wheel controls are not suited for picking dates more than a week or two away
-	Greater control of custom perspective output: for example, I would like a way to group by a single tag or to sort the action list
-	Even more custom perspective rules: it could be useful to be able to perform date calculations in custom perspective rules to, for example, prepare a list of actions deferred to next month

There are plenty of other features that many users want (natural language input springs to mind), but some features must be weighed against the ability of OmniFocus to be a general-purpose tool. I’d be appalled to see features added that are highly-specialised (like a grocery shopping manager, for example). Fortunately, it may be possible to build your own niche features using JavaScript once [Omni Automation](https://omni-automation.com) is integrated.

## Yes, there’s more

If that wasn’t enough to justify a point release to your mind, there are more things in there. I would be remiss to not mention these features, even if I don’t use them a lot:

-	More kinds of notifications: custom ‘fixed time’ notifications, last time to start (due time minus estimated duration) and defer date &amp; time notifications
-	Flexible repeating: repeats can now be based on days of the month and days of the week
-	Tag reordering: items listed in the Tags perspective can be reordered based on your preference
-	Calendar items appear amongst due items in Forecast
-	Updated custom perspective icons: there are now even more icons to choose from built-in to the app
-	New custom notification sounds

OmniFocus has been with us for ten years. Even longer if you take into account its roots [as a set OmniFocus scripts for OmniOutliner](http://www.43folders.com/2005/10/04/review-kinkless-gtd-for-automated-elegant-os-x-task-management).

In that time, huge changes have been made to the app. This version, with rule-based perspectives, tags and batch editing, has trebled my productivity. OmniFocus has even more focus.

&lt;p&gt;If that wasn’t enough to justify a point release to your mind, there are more things in there. I would be remiss to not mention these features, even if I don’t use them a lot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  More kinds of notifications: custom ‘fixed time’ notifications, last time to start (due time minus estimated duration) and defer date &amp;amp; time notifications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Flexible repeating: repeats can now be based on days of the month and days of the week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Tag reordering: items listed in the Tags perspective can be reordered based on your preference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Calendar items appear amongst due items in Forecast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Updated custom perspective icons: there are now even more icons to choose from built-in to the app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  New custom notification sounds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;✓&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OmniFocus has been with us for ten years. Even longer if you take into account its roots &lt;a href=""http://www.43folders.com/2005/10/04/review-kinkless-gtd-for-automated-elegant-os-x-task-management""&gt;as a set OmniFocus scripts for OmniOutliner&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that time, huge changes have been made to the app. This version, with rule-based perspectives, tags and batch editing, has trebled my productivity. OmniFocus has even more focus. &lt;/p&gt;

,FFRecordKeeper,"Hello everyone! Again our CM-Raids, a really great challenge in FFRK!

We had to tackle Odin (FF3) and Goddess (FF6), realms with overall great coverage!

#Odin
#[Video (Click)](https://youtu.be/PRfg_Qpxagk?list=PLA9QVxgKtrYB1FINBbnKIKh_UNLukJfoK)

With Odins omni-resist there are just few options to dealing damage effectively:

Have dived characters to push through the resistance for still effective damage

Stay non-elemental focused, but OK is the only support5 for entrusting to Arc for SSB spam

Radiant-Shield

For 75% of the fight, everything was going smooth, but then Odin enters a rampage state where he obliterates you......................... and himself. Ingus and Arc together can sustain the party while the rest of the FF3 cast watches the counterdamage doing it's job.

Very straightforward all in all!

---

#Goddess
#[Video (Click)](https://youtu.be/gMzOcLfFevM?list=PLA9QVxgKtrYB1FINBbnKIKh_UNLukJfoK)

We kinda expected her to be a bit difficult due to her resistances and the doomcounter constantly ticking down with her attacks, but there is an element she forgot to null: Fire. In FF6.

It became a crazy DPS-race once we saw that reviving AND dealing with confuse is really hardcore (RIP Celes/Mog halfway..), so Terra and Edgar had to rush her down before she kills us or doom takes us 1 by 1.

Pretty chaotic fight, but manageable thanks to the versatile and strong ff6-cast!

,WWII,"## Operation Breakout, Tips/Tricks &amp; 24.7 ( Please ) And Why..

**Operation Breakout \- My Thoughts / Tips / And why we deserve a 24.7 Playlist.**

Having Played since the BETA. Where breakout was a continuous choice and a Strong option for SHG to use to promote there game I ask you to please give us a 24.7 Playlist.

***I Know.. I'm not alone.***

***Thoughts \-***

This map is by far the most superior map when it comes to earning XP, Fun &amp; Greatness. Having bought all DLC this still stands.

Whether you are a new comer or avid player you will enjoy this map. The variety it brings to capture the house, build the bridge &amp; plant a bomb, escort the tank is the most thrilling from all war map options.. IMO &amp; with many others a close contender is griffin.

if you analyse data you will see if there is any option between say \- Breakout/Griffin/intercept/Neptune.. **Breakout Will Always Conquer. Please SHG Listen to the community.**

'***I Don't Mind Breakout but can I really earn that much XP? Is it really better than the others?'*** MY ANSWER IS YES! &amp; Here is why.. Follow my tips &amp; tricks.. Even if you love it .. you may not know some!

**ATTACKING \-**

* **House** Saboteur, Push left side past truck into centre of the map do not run up the left or you will die/ Saboteur into house x2 and push up right side slope.. Plant explosive and shoot explosive.. Stay in back room until 100&amp;#37; Capture.
* **Building The Bridge \-** Armoured w.Undercover &amp; Smokes is all I can say.. K/d is not effected as you are aware.. Smoke/Build/Rinse/Repeat &amp; always try to be building during 50&amp;#37; or 100&amp;#37; capture.
* **Planting The Bomb \-** Now you can choose to follow this if you wish.. if you dont dw its not important but can earn you a few extra seconds to get a quick plant.. Kill yourself once the tank begins to cross the bridge throw a grenade at your feet.. this WILL automatically spawn you a few steps infront of your team mates and really catch the AXIS by surprise \(Many of times I Have got the plant whilst the entire team are stood around me.. I should add to leave your current class as above at this time also.. If you get the plant.. STAY LAYING BEHIND THE BOMB.. let them defuse if you even like &amp; rinse &amp; repeat the planting! easy 500xp per plant..once detonated be sure to jump on the tank.. remember 75xp a kill

**DEFENDING \-**

* **HOUSE** &amp; Immediately build the turret if possible.. Mount turret &amp; Stay aiming at truck for as long as possible \( 75XP Per Kill \+Build XP \+ Defender XP \) KEEP the side wall open at all times &amp; use this to frag the small room at the back.
* **Bridge \-** Build Right turret if possible.. or left, stay as long as possible.. Use saboteur &amp; continuesly sticky grenade the bridge. Another good spot is under the bridge shooting from beneath through the wooden slats.
* **THEY PLANTED A BOMB ON OUR AMMO SUPPLY \-** Now this one is my personal favourite.. Immediately as the build is complete grenade yourself to spawn back at the builds.. build as many walls as you can and grenade over the walls to the little window you push through when you attack.. lay behind the bomb &amp; if your lucky someone will plant &amp; you can ninja defuse.. Run undercover with armoured &amp; continue to lay behind the bomb.. 500xp Per defuse.. If the bomb detonates.. immediately run back to the church &amp; build the turrets \( Trench, Right at the back\)

These are just a few tips.. I will keep updating this later on when I have more time as I am currently in work.. if you would like a few more tips from the defending side please comment and I will add more.. there is a FEW.. Such as once the timer runs out and you defend the tank.. RUN BACK to the church and build all the turrets..

MY SPM on war alone is 380\+ with a highest score attacking on breakout of 10,275 &amp; Defending 8,750.

Not to brag but its just great fun!

,Zarya,"[Reviewing Jayne's Zarya.#2 of 5](https://youtu.be/JfOQR7RN_dk)

Hey guys, CANAS1AN here. I am going to keep the format of the post the same as the videos are similar, but the actual game play is different.

[Here is a sneak peek](https://twitter.com/CANAS1AN/status/1001532556808933376)

Last week Jayne was making a dedicated push to learn Zarya. You can see the video he made on his progress [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5Qp8ZT3C2I)

Essentially he correctly deduces that his main problems are reloading WAY too much and that he is not getting good usage out of his barriers.

Seeing Jayne dedicate a lot of time to improving the hero, I offered to help and with Jayne's permission, I did 5 Zarya Vod Reviews of his game play. This is the second one.

[Reviewing Jayne's Zarya.#2 of 5](https://youtu.be/JfOQR7RN_dk)

As usual, the main focuses of the vod review are:

* Positioning
* Target Selection
* Ability Usage
* Ultimate Usage
* Reload Discipline
* Beam/Grenade Discipline

Expect a new Jayne Analysis each day this week. 

Thanks for watching, hope it was helpful, and as always, have a good one.

,Keratoconus,"Hey guys, so I'll try to make this as brief as I can! I've been lurking this thread here and there and it was super helpful when I was first diagnosed with Keratoconus 1.5 years ago (at 23, almost 24 years old. I'm 25 now). So in November 2016 I was diagnosed, was getting super hard to read the computers at work and knew something was up. Saw my optometrist here in Abbotsford, BC, Canada and she referred me to Dr. Dubord in Vancouver, after diagnosing me with keratoconus. Dr. Dubord confirmed and suggested I get CXL done pretty ASAP. 

&amp;nbsp;

He originally told me I should get a corneal transplant as my keratoconus was ""quite severe"", which it was, ~57 diopters when he first saw me. He said that CXL may help, but wasn't a guarantee due to how far gone I was, but with that said, he was astonished that I could see as well as I do, in fact I'm still legal to drive (I get tested fairly often) without corrective lenses. In fact, I only every wore glasses for a couple of years in high school. In my first year of university my eyesight improved to almost perfect, I presume now it was due to my cornea starting to misshape more aggressively and temporarily being beneficial (damn I wish I had gotten CXL done then lol). 

&amp;nbsp;

 Anyhow, we tried CXL first as a transplant is a little bit more risky and was potentially not needed. I had my right eye done in April of 2017 and my left in May of 2017. Here's my advice to prepare for surgery day:

&amp;nbsp;

-All blinds closed with blankets over top to let in NO light, seriously guys, you want it to be blacker than black.
&amp;nbsp;

-Get a chrome add-on that lets you put your browser into a ""night mode"", I used night mode pro
&amp;nbsp;

-Make sure all other sources of light are off or are very minimal.
&amp;nbsp;

-Have an audiobook or music playlist ready to go at the push of a space bar on your computer, you're going to be sitting in bed for a while doing nothing
&amp;nbsp;

-When you first get the surgery done, it will not hurt, it WILL hurt an hour afterwards, I took it less seriously than I should have the first time, seriously, it hurts a ton. So when the doctor prescribes you T3s or whatever you happen to get, take them ASAP, in fact I took two T3s when I got them right away and another one before I got home on my second surgery. My first surgery I didn't take them until it started hurting, big mistake
&amp;nbsp;

-Bring a towel and sunglasses with you for the drive, cover your head with both the glasses and towel. I get car sick so this was difficult for me, but even having the operated eye covered makes a difference, don't assume that because it's not hurting, that the sun and lights aren't putting strain on it that you won't feel later.
&amp;nbsp;

-I also had one surgery later in the day and another in the morning, late surgery was better as I was able to fall asleep sooner when I got home and it helped me get over the pain.

&amp;nbsp;

The next week post-surgery you'll slowly have less pain and will be able to see more and more, the second day I was watching movies while covering my operated eye, albeit with difficulty. On day 3 or 4 I was using the computer a little, by the end of the week I was mostly good. Still wore sunglasses inside though and was not driving yet, I drove after 1.5 weeks. Using the night mode add-on helped a lot, I still use it now here and there. Bandage contact ended up feeling worse than the darn surgery as it was very scratchy and whatnot, huge relief when that was pulled.
&amp;nbsp;
I then saw the doctor a few more times for some check-ups and he said things were healing well, did it again a month later and then had a appointment for a check-up in November of 2017. He took pictures of my corneas and had told me some shitty news, the disease had slowed, but hadn't stopped...I was devastated. I did remember him not taking pictures right before the surgery and only a few months before, so I had hoped that's what he was comparing to, but nonetheless was devastated. I started googling to figure out what I could, some suggested Vitamin D and calcium (top homeopathic suggestions), figured it was better than sitting on my ass not trying anything, the vitamins and calcium are good for you regardless. So now I take some a few times a week (3000 IU), albeit not consistently enough for it to have made any difference in my opinion though, but who knows, maybe it helped.

&amp;nbsp;

May 23 (6 days ago), I had another check-up. He wanted to give it 6ish more months to see if anything was going to change and if it was getting worse, potential corneal transplant. I saw him with worry and felt like all I keep hearing is bad news, I had a really bad couple days before that and I just didn't expect anything, but for the first time since I've been seeing him, I got some good news. My keratoconus HAD IMPROVED A LITTLE. Now, some people show improvement after CXL, some don't, it's not expected, that's not what excited me, what was excited me was the improvement from November to May. That was real improvement, I went from 59 diopters and an Astigmatism level of 5.5 to 57 diopters and 4.8, much more than a corneal fluctuation would allow for. 

&amp;nbsp;

This whole time I haven't worn any corrective lenses at all, glasses don't work, and I didn't want contacts just to have to refit them, funnily enough my daytime vision improved a little after my surgeries, but my nighttime vision got much worse (bigger halos, ghosting, double vision, etc.). A lot worse actually, it's since improved a tiny bit, but I don't drive at night unless absolutely necessary. It was an unfortunate side effect, but I knew not doing anything was worse. With that said, I called my optometrist here in Abbotsford about getting some hybrids to start, heard hard contacts are just so damn uncomfortable and I don't plan on wearing contacts every day, have been getting along just fine for the past 25 years without them. I was going to start with sclerals, but I figured it might be better to try the hybrids first, 6 months supply will cost me $350 CAD and if I don't like them I can always get sclerals later ($2500 CAD...). 

&amp;nbsp;

Nonetheless, the point I'm getting at here is that CXL is a such a great surgery and with it we can have great results. I've had ups and downs with the surgery and with my eyes for sure, but I'm just so happy that for the time in 15 years, I might finally be able to see like a normal person again. Best of luck to everyone in their journey and please message me if you have any specific questions!

&amp;nbsp;

*Also forgot to mention, light sensitivity was mostly gone by 6 months post-op.

I get car sick so this was difficult for me, but even having the operated eye covered makes a difference, don&amp;#39;t assume that because it&amp;#39;s not hurting, that the sun and lights aren&amp;#39;t putting strain on it that you won&amp;#39;t feel later.
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-I also had one surgery later in the day and another in the morning, late surgery was better as I was able to fall asleep sooner when I got home and it helped me get over the pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next week post-surgery you&amp;#39;ll slowly have less pain and will be able to see more and more, the second day I was watching movies while covering my operated eye, albeit with difficulty. On day 3 or 4 I was using the computer a little, by the end of the week I was mostly good. Still wore sunglasses inside though and was not driving yet, I drove after 1.5 weeks. Using the night mode add-on helped a lot, I still use it now here and there. Bandage contact ended up feeling worse than the darn surgery as it was very scratchy and whatnot, huge relief when that was pulled.
&amp;nbsp;
I then saw the doctor a few more times for some check-ups and he said things were healing well, did it again a month later and then had a appointment for a check-up in November of 2017. He took pictures of my corneas and had told me some shitty news, the disease had slowed, but hadn&amp;#39;t stopped...I was devastated. I did remember him not taking pictures right before the surgery and only a few months before, so I had hoped that&amp;#39;s what he was comparing to, but nonetheless was devastated. I started googling to figure out what I could, some suggested Vitamin D and calcium (top homeopathic suggestions), figured it was better than sitting on my ass not trying anything, the vitamins and calcium are good for you regardless. So now I take some a few times a week (3000 IU), albeit not consistently enough for it to have made any difference in my opinion though, but who knows, maybe it helped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 23 (6 days ago), I had another check-up. He wanted to give it 6ish more months to see if anything was going to change and if it was getting worse, potential corneal transplant. I saw him with worry and felt like all I keep hearing is bad news, I had a really bad couple days before that and I just didn&amp;#39;t expect anything, but for the first time since I&amp;#39;ve been seeing him, I got some good news. My keratoconus HAD IMPROVED A LITTLE. Now, some people show improvement after CXL, some don&amp;#39;t, it&amp;#39;s not expected, that&amp;#39;s not what excited me, what was excited me was the improvement from November to May. That was real improvement, I went from 59 diopters and an Astigmatism level of 5.5 to 57 diopters and 4.8, much more than a corneal fluctuation would allow for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This whole time I haven&amp;#39;t worn any corrective lenses at all, glasses don&amp;#39;t work, and I didn&amp;#39;t want contacts just to have to refit them, funnily enough my daytime vision improved a little after my surgeries, but my nighttime vision got much worse (bigger halos, ghosting, double vision, etc.). A lot worse actually, it&amp;#39;s since improved a tiny bit, but I don&amp;#39;t drive at night unless absolutely necessary. It was an unfortunate side effect, but I knew not doing anything was worse. With that said, I called my optometrist here in Abbotsford about getting some hybrids to start, heard hard contacts are just so damn uncomfortable and I don&amp;#39;t plan on wearing contacts every day, have been getting along just fine for the past 25 years without them. I was going to start with sclerals, but I figured it might be better to try the hybrids first, 6 months supply will cost me $350 CAD and if I don&amp;#39;t like them I can always get sclerals later ($2500 CAD...). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the point I&amp;#39;m getting at here is that CXL is a such a great surgery and with it we can have great results. I&amp;#39;ve had ups and downs with the surgery and with my eyes for sure, but I&amp;#39;m just so happy that for the time in 15 years, I might finally be able to see like a normal person again. Best of luck to everyone in their journey and please message me if you have any specific questions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Also forgot to mention, light sensitivity was mostly gone by 6 months post-op.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr Got CXL, eyes got worse, then better, now I can get contacts, great success.&lt;/p&gt;

,WWII,"## Operation Breakout, Tips/Tricks &amp; 24.7 ( Please ) And Why..

**Operation Breakout \- My Thoughts / Tips / And why we deserve a 24.7 Playlist.**

Having Played since the BETA. Where breakout was a continuous choice and a Strong option for SHG to use to promote there game I ask you to please give us a 24.7 Playlist.

***I Know.. I'm not alone.***

***Thoughts \-***

This map is by far the most superior map when it comes to earning XP, Fun &amp; Greatness. Having bought all DLC this still stands.

Whether you are a new comer or avid player you will enjoy this map. The variety it brings to capture the house, build the bridge &amp; plant a bomb, escort the tank is the most thrilling from all war map options.. IMO &amp; with many others a close contender is griffin.

if you analyse data you will see if there is any option between say \- Breakout/Griffin/intercept/Neptune.. **Breakout Will Always Conquer. Please SHG Listen to the community.**

'***I Don't Mind Breakout but can I really earn that much XP? Is it really better than the others?'*** MY ANSWER IS YES! &amp; Here is why.. Follow my tips &amp; tricks.. Even if you love it .. you may not know some!

**ATTACKING \-**

* **House** Saboteur, Push left side past truck into centre of the map do not run up the left or you will die/ Saboteur into house x2 and push up right side slope.. Plant explosive and shoot explosive.. Stay in back room until 100&amp;#37; Capture.
* **Building The Bridge \-** Armoured w.Undercover &amp; Smokes is all I can say.. K/d is not effected as you are aware.. Smoke/Build/Rinse/Repeat &amp; always try to be building during 50&amp;#37; or 100&amp;#37; capture.
* **Planting The Bomb \-** Now you can choose to follow this if you wish.. if you dont dw its not important but can earn you a few extra seconds to get a quick plant.. Kill yourself once the tank begins to cross the bridge throw a grenade at your feet.. this WILL automatically spawn you a few steps infront of your team mates and really catch the AXIS by surprise \(Many of times I Have got the plant whilst the entire team are stood around me.. I should add to leave your current class as above at this time also.. If you get the plant.. STAY LAYING BEHIND THE BOMB.. let them defuse if you even like &amp; rinse &amp; repeat the planting! easy 500xp per plant..

**DEFENDING \-**

* **HOUSE** &amp; Immediately build the turret if possible.. Mount turret &amp; Stay aiming at truck for as long as possible \( 75XP Per Kill \+Build XP \+ Defender XP \) KEEP the side wall open at all times &amp; use this to frag the small room at the back.
* **Bridge \-** Build Right turret if possible.. or left, stay as long as possible.. Use saboteur &amp; continuesly sticky grenade the bridge. Another good spot is under the bridge shooting from beneath through the wooden slats.

**THEY PLANTED A BOMB ON OUR AMMO SUPPLY \-** Now this one is my personal favourite..  Immediately as the build is complete grenade yourself to spawn back at the builds.. build as many walls as you can and grenade over the walls to the little window you push through when you attack.. lay behind the bomb &amp; if your lucky someone will plant &amp; you can ninja defuse.. Run undercover with armoured &amp; continue to lay behind the bomb.. 500xp Per defuse.. If the bomb detonates.. immediately run back to the church &amp; build the turrets \( Trench, Right at the back\)

These are just a few tips.. I will keep updating this later on when I have more time as I am currently in work.. if you would like a few more tips from the defending side please comment and I will add more.. there is a FEW.. Such as once the timer runs out and you defend the tank.. RUN BACK to the church and build all the turrets..

MY SPM on war alone is 380\+ with a highest score attacking on breakout of 10,275 &amp; Defending 8,750.

Not to brag but its just great fun!

,ZaryaMains,"[Reviewing Jayne's Zarya.#1 of 5](https://youtu.be/9R9V70T5Zb4)

Hey guys, CANAS1AN here.

Last week Jayne was making a dedicated push to learn Zarya. You can see the video he made on his progress [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5Qp8ZT3C2I).

Essentially he correctly deduces that his main problems are reloading WAY too much and that he is not getting good usage out of his barriers.

Seeing Jayne dedicate a lot of time to improving the hero, I offered to help and with Jayne's permission, I did 5 Zarya Vod Reviews of his game play. This is the first one.

[Reviewing Jayne's Zarya.#1 of 5](https://youtu.be/9R9V70T5Zb4)

As usual, the main focuses of the vod review are:

* Positioning
* Target Selection
* Ability Usage
* Ultimate Usage
* Reload Discipline
* Beam/Grenade Discipline

Expect a new Jayne Analysis each day this week. 

Thanks for watching, hope it was helpful, and as always, have a good one.

Hey guys, CANAS1AN here.

Last week Jayne was making a dedicated push to learn Zarya. You can see the video he made on his progress [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5Qp8ZT3C2I).

Essentially he correctly deduces that his main problems are reloading WAY too much and that he is not getting good usage out of his barriers.

Seeing Jayne dedicate a lot of time to improving the hero, I offered to help and with Jayne's permission, I did 5 Zarya Vod Reviews of his game play. This is the first one.

Expect a new Jayne Analysis each day this week. 

Thanks for watching, hope it was helpful, and as always, have a good one.

,MLQuestions,"I'm a generalist artist. I'm a filmmaker, composer, sound and graphic designer, and photographer.

I'd like to know if it's possible or even valuable (as in is this the most efficient way to do it) to create an A.I. or neural net to look for art for me and find extremely taste resonant art in particular? Or rather put another way, to find **quality** information as fast as possible?

My process involves art discovery / rapid **efficient** exposure in the beginning because: 

""A child never writes his own alphabet. A seed does not grow, it needs soil, water, and radiant energy. A sailboat does not sail, it is pushed by the wind. Nothing in nature is self-activating."" - Jacque Fresco 

I try to find the most taste resonant pieces of art (photography, books, music, films, etc.) as fast as humanly possible through an assortment of techniques. 

Most taste resonant would mean incredibly moving, life-changing, makes me say ""wow"" out loud, or want to jump on my bed from excitement. 

After curating those based on **style** and **taste** I remix them into my own creations. 

However, it takes me quite a while to find REALLY good art (which is my ultimate goal), and I'd like to know if an A.I. can help with that. 

My techniques are as follows: 

1. **Trees**: Like the branches of a tree (or any other fractal form in nature), I find the artist who most inspires me, then I find who influences them online in hopes that I might find someone even better than them / influences me more. I also search for ""relational links"" like ""people also searched for"" or ""fans also like"" or ""related artists"" I use my taste as my compass when searching. 

2. **Ponds**: An example of a pond for me would be a small database of nodes (artists, or artworks) - As in, **artists** in a **gallery**, **books** in a **bookstore**, **records** in a **record label**, **songs** in a **playlist**, etc. etc. I find who published a particular book, and I search through their other books. I can also ""pond jump"" through ""node co-existence"" as in - if a book is in another bookstore I can find that other bookstore by reverse image searching the book's cover on Google, and looking for other ""ponds"" which could be other bookstores that have the same book (and therefore might have a similar style or taste), or blogs, or other sites that might have the same style or taste.  I can also do a ""pond jump"" through ""node path"" - as in I could start with a book at a bookstore, and find who influenced that writer, and then once I find a writer who influenced that writer who is as or more inspiring to me, I find where *their* book has been published, or which bookstores sell it, and so on.  I do this quite a lot with fine art photography. I can also jump back and forth between this technique and the ""Trees"" technique. 

3. **Oceans**: large databases of either nodes, or ponds. There are sites that keep a giant list of film production companies for instance like UniFrance, which I search through to find production companies of the same style or taste. I use ""ocean jumping"" which is exactly like pond jumping, except it uses ponds (small databases) instead of nodes (artists or artworks), but can also use nodes if it's a large database.

These are my current techniques summarized. There is SO much more detail behind those, and so much more can be said (e.g. there's a priority list to types of ponds, and oceans)

I would love to know if it's possible for a neural network to not only use these techniques most efficiently but to find OTHER techniques which are WAY more efficient at getting me the result I want. 

I also want a neural network or A.I. to be able to, say, be trained on a set of fine art photographs and to find other photographs that are similar in style *in addition to* resonant with my taste.  

In other words, the A.I. or neural net will have to somehow develop an almost indistinguishable copy of my own taste over time.

I've got about 15K photographs that I like but they are ""50-60% taste resonant"" as opposed to 100% (I don't know if it would be a bad idea to train a neural net on those, or not...cause it might lead to the same inefficiency of me as a human searcher). With 100% I've got about 800, 2 films, and about 20 songs. 

It takes me about a year to find a 100% taste resonant film, and about 6-12 months to find a 100% taste resonant photograph. I would really love to reduce that as much as possible preferably to a daily level.

Someday I'd love to apply this not just to art but also to science, but the ""filtration"" or ""curation"" system would be quite different...as in it would be ""how scientifically rigorous is this study"" + ""how useful or relevant is this to my current needs"" etc.

I'd also love to apply it to efficient research when it comes to the replication of particular pieces of art (as in technical skill)...to show the neural net a photograph for instance, and it can tell me ""this was possibly done using this type of camera, this type of lighting, with this kind of angle, etc.""",,False,,0,False,Is it possible or even valuable to apply a neural net / A.I. to the problem of exposure to new information / efficient research?,[],,False,,,0.0,,,False,t3_8mm7cz,,dark,,,public,1.0,,{},,,False,[],,False,,,{},,,1,,,,self,1527471092.0,,[],,,True,,1527497853.0,text,,,,text,self.MLQuestions,,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a generalist artist.

I use &amp;quot;ocean jumping&amp;quot; which is exactly like pond jumping, except it uses ponds (small databases) instead of nodes (artists or artworks), but can also use nodes if it&amp;#39;s a large database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are my current techniques summarized. There is SO much more detail behind those, and so much more can be said (e.g. there&amp;#39;s a priority list to types of ponds, and oceans)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to know if it&amp;#39;s possible for a neural network to not only use these techniques most efficiently but to find OTHER techniques which are WAY more efficient at getting me the result I want. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want a neural network or A.I. to be able to, say, be trained on a set of fine art photographs and to find other photographs that are similar in style &lt;em&gt;in addition to&lt;/em&gt; resonant with my taste.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the A.I. or neural net will have to somehow develop an almost indistinguishable copy of my own taste over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got about 15K photographs that I like but they are &amp;quot;50-60% taste resonant&amp;quot; as opposed to 100% (I don&amp;#39;t know if it would be a bad idea to train a neural net on those, or not...cause it might lead to the same inefficiency of me as a human searcher). With 100% I&amp;#39;ve got about 800, 2 films, and about 20 songs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes me about a year to find a 100% taste resonant film, and about 6-12 months to find a 100% taste resonant photograph. I would really love to reduce that as much as possible preferably to a daily level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someday I&amp;#39;d love to apply this not just to art but also to science, but the &amp;quot;filtration&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;curation&amp;quot; system would be quite different...as in it would be &amp;quot;how scientifically rigorous is this study&amp;quot; + &amp;quot;how useful or relevant is this to my current needs&amp;quot; etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d also love to apply it to efficient research when it comes to the replication of particular pieces of art (as in technical skill)...to show the neural net a photograph for instance, and it can tell me &amp;quot;this was possibly done using this type of camera, this type of lighting, with this kind of angle, etc.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

,Psychonaut,"Hey guys, I made a post a few days ago about a trip I was about to undertake and some of you expressed interest in reading of my experience. My actual detailed trip report is so long that I don't think anyone could be bothered reading it; so here's a less structured, more condensed version.

For anyone interested, these are the times the various substances were taken:
• Mescaline (39.5cm san pedro brewed into tea) - T here will start from the consumption of the last sip

• 20g psilocybe utopia sclerotia (truffles) - T+2:45

• Salvia divinorum 20x extract (three 0.05g amounts measured out prior to the trip) - T+4:15 &amp; T+6:30

• Joints totalling 3.5g cannabis smoked at various times throughout (mostly indica, save for a gram being super silver haze)


I'm happy to post the full report, just let me know if you'd like to give it a read.

NOTE: the use of the phrases ""I felt"", ""I experienced"", "" I lived"", etc. after the ego death is simply for ease of reading. I feel it would become too confusing otherwise. There was most certainly no sense of self present.

I consumed the tea over the course of half an hour, whilst I set various alarms to help keep the rest of my dosing on track. The nausea was rather intense; abdominal cramping was the biggest issue. I'll drink it even slower next time. After about an hour and a quarter I could feel some effects starting to kick in.

I turned on my playlist and lay on my bed in the dark as the CEVs got more and more intense. I didn't like the feeling of sinking in the bed, it made me feel surrounded as my sensory awareness was increasing rapidly, so I migrated to the floor. I could feel a familiar injection of empathy flowing through my veins as my mind started to drift towards things like my family (anything but good), future, past, etc.

It is here I ate the truffles.

When the effects started to become noticeable, there was almost a perfect synergy; but at the same time, I felt as though I could identify what was psilocybin and what was the mescaline. I unsealed the gaps around the window and opened the curtains because I was having much trouble distinguishing between CEVs and OEVs. It startled me at first, realising how hard I was tripping. Nothing looked normal and the movement in everything was ridiculous. I lay back down on the floor and stared up at the ceiling. It looked as if it was being pushed up from the middle into a peak and the architraves looked like snakes trying to slither in to the middle in a spiral. I simply cannot describe the colours so I won't even try. I thought  about everyday things that make me exasperated with others' actions. I mean just simple things i.e someone standing in what I would say is a poor choice of placement; like stopping in a doorway or walkway in a crowd - obliviousness is one of, if not the, most frustrating thing to me. I said ""sorry"" out loud as I realised the futility of frustration - people won't realise their obliviousness, as that is the very nature of being oblivious in the first place. All I can do is work on my own awareness, and hope for the best for myself and others. Ill-will gets you nowhere. Empathy was running rampant at this point, and I wanted to give everyone in the universe a hug. I kept losing track of the size of the room I was in. This led to me spending a good 10 minutes in somewhat of a modified version of a ""peek-a-boo"" game with the room and it's ever-altering internal space. Focusing on one wall's distance from myself, only to feel like the walls I wasn't paying attention to were slipping back, diverting my attention accordingly and so on.
I started to rather quickly lose my sense of self, then a random thought would slap it back into me. I felt like my ego was dissolving, returning, dissolving, returning.

It is here I smoked the first of the salvia

Loljks evidently I forgot what using hands was like, and amidst the visuals I spilled my first dose. 2 remaining. Smoked one 0.05g dose through my bong with blue cheese. I held it for what I want to say was about 40 seconds, but I honestly wouldn't know. What I do know, however, was that upon exhaling, it was like a countdown from ten that abruptly stopped at 6 and everything just disappeared. I was surrounded by eternal space. It was like all of a sudden I was in a lucid nightmare. And I could tell that I was, but had no control over it. My mind became separated from my existential awareness, and it just began to run on its own. But it ran so differently to how I would have run it, that I felt like I had lost a part of myself that was essential for letting my consciousness get back in communication with my mind. The separation was eternal in distance and time. Like I was locked outside my mind, looking in through a window; banging, trying to get back in. didn't find it funny but I could not contain my laughter. Insane laughter. I would have probably suited a straitjacket quite well at that point. 
Horizontal became vertical and vice versa, but not as if they just swapped over, it was just very different. I don't know how else to explain it. This shift made me very unbalanced and I fell over to the side; although it felt more like I was pushed heavily to the side.
The empty space started to develop incredible patterns and shapes and I was interacting with them, chasing them, grabbing at them, they would pass through me and give me these indescribable emotions. It seemed they pulsated to the music and to these emotions they created in me. I desperately wanted to get some water, and despite having a bottle with me somehow ended up in the bathroom sitting in the bathtub. The bathroom looked so foreign, and I couldn't really associate the bathtub with anything I'd ever seen before. My foot was over the drain, and I felt as though I began to take the shape of the circular drain. This feeling of the drain under me, along with the visuals, made me feel as though I was being sucked into the drain. Something about salvia just makes it seem so real, and it was making me very uncomfortable. I didn't know who I was. I didn't know what I was. I didn't know what a drain was. All I knew was there was a void beneath me and I was experiencing existence as the first thing to go into it. I felt as though I had become everything, but there were still individual parts. Like single cells comprising one whole body. Like a train, all the rest of existence was to be swirling down into the drain on top of me, and I felt the weight of the universe crushing me. I closed my eyes (like that made a difference) and put my head in my hands. I could feel a growing pressure in the middle of my back and I thought ""OK, this is it. Here comes the weight of the universe"". And then I realised I was still sitting in the same spot I had smoked the salvia, that I hadn't actually moved, and that also I don't even have a bathtub. I felt incredibly relieved but also completely insane, and also, strangely, cheated of my experience to enter this void of unknown with everything as one. It completely makes sense to me how people can think they become floorboards and such whilst under the influence of salvia. There was no reminding myself that I was tripping the whole time, because I was so utterly convinced that it was real. Fucking terrifying. Fucking beautiful.

The peak of the salvia was over, but I felt like I came out of it tripping harder than when I went in. With my own ego completely nonexistent, I was living each life individually. Almost as if trying every possibility out until I found myself again. Each life, every second, every choice. The butterfly effect comes to mind as I write this. Every single option in the multiverse from dawn to demise, from every perspective, was being downloaded into my brain every second, over and over. Complete sensory overload occurred as every visual, tactile, auditory, gustatory and olfactory stimulus was experienced simultaneously.

As I started to slowly gather my sense of self back I had a sense that this was to be the new forever. And then I became somewhat distressed that I'd never get out, and no one would want to help me because they would just think I was tripping and it would be over soon. But I was briefly absolutely convinced that eternity was to be this moment. As if a godsend, the best possible tune for me at the time came on (Roady by Fat Freddy's Drop if you're  interested) and these thoughts were abandoned for a feeling of safety and security with the universe in complete hysteria around me. I could see the music coming from the speakers. I could feel the notes from each track as they impacted my skin. It was like I was a musical instrument resonating the information of the song. Like somewhat of a vinyl player.

The next hour and a half was spent in darkness thinking about my life. I think it would get my thoughts across easier if I just wrote out some of my audio recordings here for an idea:

You need not be true to anyone other than yourself first. Self-deception is poison - this is a path you should make every attempt to avoid. If you can deceive yourself, what's stopping others from deceiving you?
Don't be distracted. Be aware; be open; be informed.
You are never finished learning. Knowledge is power. Power should never be abused. Knowledge is for all... But so is clean water and food and shelter... Fuck what have we done to the world?
Your truth is unique to you, but don't get confused over this: no one is special. You are just like everyone else. Work on your individuality from there; from the ground up. With your ego constantly in check, flourish, grow, develop.

It is here I smoked my last dose of salvia.

Again, massive blast-off. The floor became this semi-permeable liquid-membrane and I started to sink. I wanted to pull myself out but I was paralysed. The room was now full of these dark shadows and they were using their energy to keep me half afloat in the floor. I got the idea they were teasing me with the knowledge of the unknown. I wanted to know now, but the floor solidified again and I found myself scratching and banging on the carpet to get back through. After this I spent some time contemplating whether this was salvia cruelly tempting me with the knowledge of a phantom something that wasn't even there. What does actually exist?

The rest of the trip's duration was spent contemplating various factors of life that either seem too boring after everything that had happened prior, or are too personal to post here. I think for the sake of your time, I may cut it here.

This trip was incredible. If you are experienced, able, curious and ready I would recommend the combination. But be safe.

We tossed this big green ball back and forth for a while, never saying anything directly to one another, but still not quite being silent. I was going through a rough time. I was shut-off from everybody around me, unwilling to let anybody help me. I was stubborn and cynical. I was the girl everybody wanted to be - a pretty blonde, well-liked by all - but I still wasn't happy. I was hollow. Throughout all of it, you remained my best friend even when the only thing you could do was push that green ball back towards me.

Dennis, today I found something incredible. I told you I threw everything away that reminded me of us. I didn't. After I sent off an email and kissed goodbye my former life, I sat on my mom's back porch for a while smoking away. I stared at the ceiling for a while. What I'd just done didn't feel wrong. It felt so right to do what you needed me to do. What I needed me to do. It felt so right to do it for you after I've spent this whole year stubbornly saying ""I'm not doing shit for you."" But the weight of the things that it took to make me realize what I needed to do were crashing down upon me, so I laid and stared at the ceiling for a while after. Just like when I was drinking with my ex-girlfriend a few nights before I tried to commit suicide, the sudden shocking sobriety of the questions you have been asking of me have been remarkably unsettling to say the least. 

Sudden.

Shocking.

Sobriety.

That's what I felt when I retreated into my mom's house to pack some more boxes. She's moving in a week, you know. Her salary is going to double. I'm really happy for her. There's also a ton of mental health resources in the area she's moving which is going to be really solid for me. I'm not gonna be sticking around her town long because I have places to be, things to see, but I'll be there for a little bit just to make sure I'm prepared for the eastern current. Not the western one, that's yours to have. Not the northern one, it was never right for me. Not the northwestern one, either, sadly. Fate just so had it that we won't get that one. 

Sudden.

Shocking.

Sobriety.

I was packing shit away in my room, listening to a playlist I've been constructing for you these past few weeks in case I'd ever get to share it, when I found this little manilla folder that made my heart stop. It was sitting underneath a bunch of old comics and books and shit that I hadn't touched since my mom moved to this town. I grabbed it, hands shaking, in utter disbelief. I've told you before I don't usually believe in signs. I sure as fuck believe this one.

Dennis, what was in that manilla folder was all the rough drafts and comments from my short story I wrote at the writer's workshop we attended four years ago. I didn't realize I still had it. You can't make this shit up dude, this seriously just happened like forty-five minutes ago. I sat down outside and smoked with the folder in hand. I knew what was within it. You know how I told you I threw everything away? Turns out I didn't get to all of it. Turns out God tucked away a remnant of us, before we fucked things up by falling in love, when we were friends. 

Sure enough, I found the copy with your comments on it. There was your name, written in your cleanly cursive, at the top-right. There was the title of my story next to it - ""The Smoking Girl"" - so close to your memory. Not only was I holding something in my hands that was evidence of your memory, but it was *also* before all the hurt and pain that would come when we tried to date. It was pure. It was a remnant of us unfettered by all this shit. When we were just friends. 

I thumbed through the pages and re-read my story for the first time in a while, stopping to see your scribbles every now and then. I remember, during the workshop, how impressed I was by your comments. They were hilarious. A ""wow he's a huge asshole"" comment jotted in after the line about the smoking girl's dad telling her off. A ton of comments ranging from ""your writing is so great oh my god"" to ""arabella's actually pretty relatable??"" to ""arabella why"". I immediately broke down in tears. Fuck, it was you. It sounded like you. It was you that had written those comments all those years ago before we knew all of *this shit* that would follow. God. It's the thing I've been begging for. It's your banter, your enthusiasm, your quick wit and empathy towards all things tragic and beautiful. Dennis...? I cried. I cried so hard. When this whole situation unfolded, the thing I regretted the most was throwing away the things that reminded me of you.

I didn't.

I'm holding your comments on my first short story in my hands. 

Remember what you wrote? You, yourself? I'm looking at it right now. You noticed that a character in my story had the same name as you, and you wrote ""I love Dennis he's great okokok"". I laughed out loud when I read that comment between sobs and aches. ""okokok"". Yep. It was you that I was holding in my hands alright. On another page you jotted down a ""DANG DANG DANG"" as the protagonists' broke up. You wrote ""PHYSICAL PAIN"" over and over as the story ramped up and approached its melodramatic climax. 

At the end, after the smoking girl was saved by the friend she'd shooed away at every turn, you wrote ""I'm so invested in this story like. Shit man. I was so scared she was going to die oh my god."" The tears fucking poured after that. God, talk about fucking serendipity that I would find this after I had just made the right decision - finally! - for our story. That's what this past month or so has been filled with. Pure fucking serendipity. 

I cannot describe to you the sense of closure I felt after reading this thing that had your humor on it and laughing at the way you would write, the things you had to say about me, the way it felt like *you*. I see it as nothing short but God that I found this folder just when I did. I cannot put in words how strongly it reassured me that I've just done the right thing. This is what closure feels like, I think. Laughing with tears at your memory for the first time since we left. 

Dennis.

I miss you. 

I am so grateful for you.

I'm keeping these notes forever. 

You are the best friend I have ever, ever, ever had in my entire life. Doing what was right and then immediately being soothed by your nearly four-year-old words just hours afterwards. This is the sense of closure I think I've been lacking the whole time. Seeing your memory and laughing not at it, but with it. Crying at your memory and feeling so, so good that I was able to. 

I'll leave you with a (joking) comment that you wrote in the margins on one of these pages. 

""I'm in physical pain 
I'm dead. 
You killed me bye."" 

But something tells me this isn't goodbye forever. Until then,

- The Smoking Girl

,beatlescirclejerk,"#🤔 Does Donald J Trump want to eat Paul McCartney's ass?
for some weird reason ( im not gay) the image it stuck in my mind when I saw Paul back in 1992 from a really short distance was that of his huge ass. for years I thought well maybe being squezzed as I was at the time by the crowd in the stadium it messed up my vision a little bit. and now decades later I come across this video and theres a picture of him I have never seen before and is no other than the one at 00:55 showing the big weird looking ass I saw ages ago. I said to people at the time !Paul has a huge fat ass! and they all would say naaa you tripping, dude kind of skinny man! well glad to see the evidence then after all this years. I wasnt tripping AT ALL!

One! Two! Three! Four! We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow submarine, yellow submarine.

# John's Abuse Joked
Idk... but a lot of the jokes being made about Lennon’s abuse both on here and on Instagram really annoy me. I mean, he was going through a rough time... and it wasn’t like it was EXTREMELY severe. He was drunk, high or both a lot of the time. I’m not condoning this, heck, abuse of any kind is one of the worst things to happen to anyone, and I feel bad for Cynthia...

But I feel like it’s wrong and disrespectful to keep either joking about the abuse, or demonizing John for it. That’s just my view. Does anyone agree?

# Finna S U C C John's D I C C A Bit More
This again? John was a complex person. Anyone can be an abusive violent asshole. But John acknowledged his dark side in public and fought from then only to be a better human being and spread the message of love and peace.

So what is the point of this post? To say to everyone that we are are forever trapped in the prison of our genes and upbringing and no attempts that we make to better ourselves will ever count?

# Creepypasta: Run For Your Life
Imagine you're yourself just listening to the Beatles, you're listening to Rubber Soul, you love that album, it's your favorite and you love all the songs on them...almost all of them. Run for your life is a song that John Lennon says he regrets writing, some say it's because it was about abuse (which is BS because he loved to beat his waifu), but rumor has it that the song is cursed, and knowing this, you avoid listening to it, only occasionally accidentally hearing the first few chords. The odd thing is sometimes when you accidentally hear them and then stop the album, you can hear something in the distance , it sounds something like slapping, but you aren't sure.

One day, you're outside, enjoying the summer sun with your phone playing your favorite album while reading your favorite book, you feel relaxed, suddenly, a neighbor comes over (she's a sweet old lady, she talks about her grandchildren and she goes on about how one of them is now graduating high school or something) then while talking, you didn't notice till it started, the song started playing, Run for your life. The song made the lady nervous, when it was almost done, she said she had to go, she waddled away as fast as her wrinkles could carry her.

When she's gone, you hear that slapping sound, it's quiet at first, but grows loud as the seconds tic on, they sound like they're behind you, you turn behind you, you see a blurry thing in the trees behind you, seemingly moving forward. You're scared but look at it was it reveals itself as it comes out of the trees, and bushes, it's a creature that you thought was only a legend, it was an absolute madman. You wanted to scream as it seemingly glides across the grass toward you, holding a poorly drawn knife and blooding coming out of his eyes and him singing ""imagine"" but in a deep pitch. You're so scared, when you finally scream, it's too late and he kills you like he did to Paul in 6619.

How do I know this happened to you? Because I am you, you're dead, I am dead, you're in Hell, I'm in hell, I'm typing this from my computer in my demon apartment (expensive rent by nice view :/ ). I'm also from the future, But you're in the past, The Beatles are in hell, too, all of them except Rigno, physically, his soul is in hell, but his body is still alive for some reason.

You also need to know this, read the first word of every paragraph, and don't look in front of you.

#Creepypasta: I Saw Paul
*October 8th, 2013, Wednesday Morning*

On one sunny day, I was minding my own business having my cup of coffee. (As always) and going outside to get some air. As I was stepping outside I've noticed a blank DVD on my porch steps. The case had nothing on it but mild blood stains. I quickly brought it inside to watch it. As I was starting it up, my computer keyboard went haywire and kept on clicking the Tab button. Nevertheless I thought it glitched out. (Due to the fact that my computer is a Windows Vista.)

The DVD loaded up, and the opening was quite disturbing. It was a figure of John Lennon from a distance stabbing someone on the floor in a dark hall way, with only tiny little beams of light shining. My mind was racing with a whole bunch of question. ""Did The Beatles really do this?"" ""Is that John Lennon?"". As John was stabbing that person his song Imagine was playing in the background. I was quite shock of this!

But the song didn't play normally... Instead it had a much slower tempo to it, and John Lennon was saying ""Imagine there's no Paul, it's easy if you try."" I only guessed one thing, it's Paul McCartney he was stabbing! But why? Why would he kill his own bandmate? I continued to watch it. After John finished stabbing that person, the camera got closer to the body. When the camera made its way to the body, it showed Paul McCartney with his eyes removed, nose sliced off, and blood coming out throw his mouth. The sight of that made me lose my appetite!

Then after that, The scene continues with John Lennon in a dark room repeating, ""Turn me on, dead man"" and, ""I WILL bury Paul"" as John was saying that, he was sharping his knife. Until a gentle knock came on the door. It looked like it was George Harrison. This person said, ""John, wheres Paul?"" John Lennon simply replied with, ""Imagine there's no Paul. It's easy if you try..."" George knew that John went off the deep end.

But he said in a louder tone, ""WHY JOHN??!!! WHY??!!!"" The screen went black. I wasn't sure if it was my computer or the DVD. Anyways, the screen was flashing like if someone was flicking the bathroom lights on you. I paused as quick as I can to see who was under all those lights. After all those unsuccessful attempts, I finally got it. Under all those lights, George was on the floor dead.

The scene then continued to an abandoned city. It showed Ringo Starr, on a small rock, with a noose tied up, and it showed Ringo's hand grabbing it. The screen went black and twisted voice screaming was heard. I felt like vomiting! I've not heard something that demonic since watching The Exorcist. The screen stayed black for about 20 seconds, and during does 20 seconds was the sound of female fans crying.

And by that time, I couldn't take it anymore. So, I took the DVD out, and brought it to dump.

*October 9th, 2013, Wednesday Morning*

I got up this morning, went on my newly updated computer. (Windows 8) and saw the news. Paul McCartney Was Killed! It said that he was stabbed to death. isn't it ironic?

# I Actually Really Like Yellow Submarine Side 2
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Yellow Submarine Side 2. The Lyrics Are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of music theory most of the themes will go over a typical listener’s head. There’s also Jeremy Hillary Boob PhD’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these lyrics, to realise that they’re not just catchy- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Yellow Submarine Side 2 truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the genius in ""Yellow Submarine in Pepperland”, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Faul’s genius wit unfolds itself on their AudioLaserdisc™ player. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Yellow Submarine Side 2 tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

#""People"" Just Can't Grasp The Genius Of The Beatles
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand The Beatles. The lyrics are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical instrumentation most of the notes will go over a typical listener’s head. There’s also John’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his songwriting- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these songs, to realize that they’re not just catchy- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike The Beatles truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the beauty in Paul’s existential track “Why Don't We Do It In The Road,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as The Beatles’ genius wit unfolds itself on their speakers. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, I DO have an Abbey Road tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

#""Based On The Interactions I've Had With The Mods Here, They Are Very Pro-Free Speech""
I've remained mostly silent about this, but yeah I agree. Some of the memes are funny, most of them are not. Like yeah, I get that picture of John looking like a cowboy made of denim is goofy, but it's not as funny to us regulars who've been on the sub for years and have seen this picture dozens of times.

The problem is, we have a large population of younger Beatles fans, and if there's anything I know about people my age, we love memes. I don't have problems when they're well done, but some people think that the shittier your shitpost is, the funnier it is, when that's really not the case.

On the other side, a lot of suggestions that I hear when people talk about this is to either ban them or move them to another sub. I don't believe that either of these are the right solution at all. Banning them is really silly and based on the interactions I've had with the mods here, they are very pro-free speech. For instance, there was a large influx of Paul is Dead nuts posting here one time and I asked the mods if they had considered banning posts related to the conspiracy theory similar to /r/Nirvana did with conspiracy theories around Kurt Cobain's death. Their response was that even if the posts are low quality or factually incorrect, they should still have the right to be able to post them.

My suggestion is this: downvote them. That's all you gotta do. If the people of this sub truly think that these memes are irrelevant to our sub, then downvote it. You guys don't seem to have a problem downvoting me when I give opinions that you don't agree with, why can't you downvote a low effort meme?

#Regarding Memes
Hello all!

I'm going to keep it short and sweet. /r/Beatles has always aimed to be a place for all kinds of beatles fans. Those interested in trivia, photos, jokes, videos and, of course, memes.

It's important to note that we are in no way against memes and try not to censor content at all, memes are one of reddit's main assets after all. However, recently there seems to have been a surge of them and we've seen many of your responses - either in messages to the moderators or as responses to posts.

As a result we have temporarily cracked down on the memes, primarily the repetitive 'madman' ones. This is not a permanent solution and we will not be removing all of them, but enough so that the sub doesn't seem so filled up with them.

Please post your opinions on the situation and how we could possibly take care of it in the comments, we want this to be a place for all beatlemaniacs.

#Can Someone Please Explain...
Could someone please explain this subreddit to me? I only came across it yesterday when I made my second reddit account (this one).

Is it a club of John-haters?

#Why Ringo Starr Is A Reptillian Space Wizard Sent Here To Take Over Our Government
hello my sweet lords, u/stefanristic02 back at you again with another sick post about the johnlennonbeat-les. before i begin the post, dont forget to mod me, and smash that upvote button. lets see if we can get to 2 upvotes.

EDIT - WE DID IT! LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET 10 UPVOTES EDIT 2 - MY SWEET LORD WE DID IT! LETS SEE IF WE CAN GET TO 20 UPVOTES EDIT 3 - DON'T FORGET TO JOIN THE RINGO STAR IS A REPTILLIAN SPACE WIZARD DISCORD - https://discord.gg/Y9eaUsm

all right now im going to teach you a lesson about the buzzles. in 1966 paul mccartney was unfortunately ran over, replaced by ""faul"" mccartney. however, what people havent considered is why he was ran over. some think it was an accident, but it wasn't. the moon landing was an accident , but paul's death wasn't.

It was actually done by the lizardpeople in the white house to distract the world from the real scandal - ringo starr is a reptilian space wizard. of course the battles were aware of this, and the clues are everywhere. ringo is wearing a human flesh suit, and is actually only the size of a hamster. he hides in ringos nose, controlling him, which is why his nose is so big. He named himself Ringo Starr becayse he had ringworm at the time and he came from the starrs

the lizardpeople in the white house were turned into lizards by ringo because he is a space wizard and is magical. he says peace and love a lot because that's a code, as it is an acronym for People Engineer A Cheeky Electrical Accident Near Devon - Lots Of Veal Eaten. this has a clear meaning - humanity can only create faults and mistakes, and eat veal. this is why ringo does not eat veal - he is not a human.

ringo joined the beatles because he promised jim lenin a lifetime supply of strawberry callipos if he could play the drums. jimmy accepted the agreement and was famously very happy with his callipos, and wrote many songs about them. for example, penny lane was actually written to mock the working class, who had to work hard and pay for callipos, while johnny got his own private stash. however, he eventually regretted the agreement - he had beaten his wife so much that he was rather skilled at the drums now.

cheeky ringo

anyway, the other bootles were rather cross with him joining, and wrote many songs hinting it. the song it won't be long was about how it won't be long until ringo took over the world. i'll follow the sun was referencing ringos space ship. I want to be your man was Ringo desperately trying to prove that he is a man. Lovely Rita was actually the space leader. Yesterday was about how faul's girlfriend was probed. john also farted lol.

there are plenty more examples, but ringworm was never caught

until now.

But it goes so much further. ringo not only staged a coup, he also controls everything. literally everything. he is in every atom. proof? Here it is.

Ringos surname is Starr. Starr fish are in the sea. What else is in the sea? Octopi. Octopi release ink when agitated. Ink is used in fountain pens. Fountains are used in parks all the time - parks are a big source of grass to fight global warming - globes don't exist because the earth is flat - tires get flat - that means you can't travel easily - people travel across the world in planes - planes are used by the military - the military use planes to drop bombs - what type of bombs? ATOM BOMBS. ATOM BOMBS DROP ATOMS.

RINGO DROPS ATOMS WHEN HE DROPS THAT ASS BECAUSE HE IS ATOMS

HE IS US

WE ARE HIM

HELP US PLEASE

PLEASE STOP INVADING US RINGWORM

Alright thanks for watching guys, don't forget to make me mod, follow on Instagram and Twitter, don't forget to swipe right on tinder, like my Snapchat page, link in my linkedin, pin my Pinterest, subscribe to my newsletter, buy my book, listen to my Spotify playlist and have a very pleasant day.

Little babies and old fucks are probably familiar with the Beatles, the fab four from Manchester who created songs for a the first generation of Beliebers to listen to. ""Just harmless pop music"" I hear you say. THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG YOU FUCKING MANSPLAINING SHITHEAD! You'd have to be doing a STEM subject, a trade, or special ed not to notice some of their problematic lyrics and images in their records. Some people like my fucking straight white cis male grandpa (glad you're dead you old fuck) say that they're just from a different time and that this was just how things were back then, but that's a problematic viewpoint to have. If art or culture from another time doesn't conform to my 21st century viewpoint, then I'm in my full right to censor it to prevent it from hurting other people. Now, on to the tofu of the matter. These are four songs from the Beatles that are racist, sexist, homophobic or problematic in general.

#The Beatles' PROBLEMATIC Albums
1- She's a Woman

The first entry on my list is a fucking shitty song by Paul McCartney about his ""love"" who was probably a 15 year old groupie, the fucking pedo. The song is fucking boring, except for one line. The title of the song, ""She's a Woman"". HOW FUCKING DARE YOU ASSUME XYR GENDER YOU FUCKING CIS WHITE MALE! This wouldn't be a problem otherwise, but I myself have suffered from gender discrimination. My manager at Walmart referred to me as a ""she"" when I had mentally transitioned to genderneutral the night before. I can't believe that she didn't know about it, as I had tweeted about it and wrote about it on my Tumblr blog.

2- Run For Your Life

Did you know that John Lennon beat his wife? Of course you did, because the shithead just looks like a fucking wife beater. He didn't exactly keep this secret, though, and mentioned it in several of his shitty songs. This one just takes the piss however. ""You better run for your life if you can, little girl"". First, ""little girl"" I THINK THEIR ALL JUST PEDOS!. Secondly, this is a threat that could trigger PTSD in women who have been abused. I myself was once assaulted by a local butcher when he viciously told me to get out of his shop when I was protesting his use of meat. I was only using his fire extinguisher to ruin his murder spoils, he should have helped me! It being his ""property"" doesn't even matter because they're shouldn't even be private property. Remember what Freddie Mercury said. ""Imagine no possessions, I wonder if you can"" and I think he should have listened to more Queen. Anyway, to conclude, John beat his wife.

3- Something

This song is problematic in the fact that it promotes unrealistic standards in women. ""I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long"". How dare George Parasol tell ME how to wear MY hair! Songs like this were probably the reason that boys never talked to me in high school. This song should've promoted body positivity and had a line ""A GIRL CAN BE 197 KILOS AT 16 IF SHE WANTS TO AND ITS YOUR FUCKING FAULT THAT SHES THAT HEAVY ADRIAN JUST BECAUSE YOU WENT OUT WITH THAT WHORE ASHLEY INSTEAD OF ME I BET SHES FUCKING STUPID AND YOU ONLY WENT OUT WITH HER FOR HER FUCKING HUGE TITS! I hope George dies of cancer.

4- George Harrison

George Harrison is a fucking racist. He probably just became a muslim because it was cool. On behalf of all Indians, I apologise for that fucking white person's disrespect of youre country. He had the gall to steal the Suitar from Indistan and play it on his old fuck white people records. I think, if I was an Indian, I would be horrified by the level of cultural appropriation and demand reparations. Another aspect of him thats racist is his use of indian music, which is theirs and you shouldn't be allowed to learn or play if you are a white person. He also started the concert for pakistan, but probably stole all the money because he's a greedy rich white male. He also cheated on his wife because she cheated on him. IF A WOMAN WANTS TO HAVE SEX WITH ANOTHER MAN, SHE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO YOU SEXIST! He is just overall a fucking bigot.

Anyway, those are my reasons that the Beatles are fucking racist, sexist and bigoted and should be banned in any progressive country. Please give me more reasons in the comments and reblog.

#I Will Now Prove That John Lennon Died
I will now prove that John Lennon died. While making Magical Mystery Tour John overdosed on drugs and died. They had to finish the album, and so they had to replace all of Side B with singles. Paul was put in John's place in all his unfinished scenes; The Walrus Was Paul. They had to find someone who looked like him, so they found someone who looked similar, but was married to Yoko Ono. He wouldn't divorce her at any cost, so they had to deal with her as well as this new John. He also had to do a John Lennon impression, so that's why his voice sounds deeper in his songs. He couldn't handle so he just took too many drugs. They had to do the White Album seperatly, because the songwriting wasn't as strong between this fake John and Paul. Blue Jay Way was written about John's death ""Please don't be long"" showing George's dissapproval of them replacing John, wishing he would come back. While My Guitar Gently Weeps is also about that. John was the other guitar player. It's also hinted in the end of Yellow Submarine. At the live action part at the end, John has like 2 lines. On Abbey Road John is the only one in white. White is considered a heavenly colour. Turn Me On Dead Man and I'd love to turn you on. It's Johnnys Birthday was also about John. Sad to see that wonderful man pass away at such a young age, and I wish that they would reveal the truth about it

#Billy Shears Is Dead
The year is 1961. The Beatles have just finished a gig in Hamburg and are celebrating near the docks. Suddenly, in his drunken state, John Lennon mistakes Paul McCartney for his wife and beats him. The tipsy Paul is unable to keep his balance and falls into the waters below. The other Beatles immediately realise what just happened and flee the scene. A month later, they find a replacement for Paul. For the next five years they play and reach world fame with their replacement bassist William 'Pepper' Shears until the fateful date. An unprecedented all-nighter for Revolver ends in the early hours of Wednesday and the Beatles hear a knock at the door. Ringo is the first to answer. ""Who is it"" he asks, ""Postman"" a familiar voice answers. As Ringo opens the door the man on the other side kicks it hard, knocking Ringo to the floor. John takes a second to recognise him. It's Paul McCartney, and he's pissed! He swam back to the shore in a minute that night, but the others had fled the scene before he could make it. He had spent the intervening years practising with his bass, his voice, and a gun. Before John can tackle him, he fires three shots. Billy Shears is hit in the shoulder and runs for the door. Paul is able to swiftly push John off while George is too busy taking a shit. Billy grabs his car keys and starts speeding off, but Paul fires two more shots which hit Billy's tyre and his windscreen. With shattered glass all over his face and losing control of the car, Billy careens off into a nearby lampost and flies through the shattered windscreen. He dies on impact. After disposing of the body, Paul makes his way back into Abbey Road. ""So, where did we leave off?"" Paul asks.

Anyway this is my proof that Paul killed Faul.

fixes Groucho Marx glasses and comedy fake mustache.

#THE FACT THAT
The fact that so many books still name the Beatles as ""the greatest or most significant or most influential"" rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art. Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worthy of being saved.

&lt;p&gt;for some weird reason ( im not gay) the image it stuck in my mind when I saw Paul back in 1992 from a really short distance was that of his huge ass. for years I thought well maybe being squezzed as I was at the time by the crowd in the stadium it messed up my vision a little bit. and now decades later I come across this video and theres a picture of him I have never seen before and is no other than the one at 00:55 showing the big weird looking ass I saw ages ago. I said to people at the time !Paul has a huge fat ass! and they all would say naaa you tripping, dude kind of skinny man! well glad to see the evidence then after all this years. I wasnt tripping AT ALL!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Yellow Submarine Trailer&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing is real. The Beatles, Yellow Submarine. Aaaah, look at all the lonely people. Aaaah look at all the lonely people. Artwork. Photography. Landscapes painted with Beatles sounds. Picture yourself in a boat on a river with tangerine trees, and marmalade skies. We all live in a yellow submarine. The yellow submarine. The forces of good. The Beatles. The Boob. I must complete my bust. Two novels, finished by blueprint. Begin my beguine. Hey Jeremy, must you always talk in rhyme? If I spoke prose, you’d all find out. I don’t know what I talk about. He’s a real nowhere man, sitting in his nowhere land. The forces of evil. Robin, the butterfly stomper. Snapping Turtle Turks. The Apple Bonkers. The terrible Flying Glove. The arch villain, the Blue Meanie. You could pass for the originals. We are the originals. We’re Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, we hope you will enjoy the show! Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, sit back and let the evening go! Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely, Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely, Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band! Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds! Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds! Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds! Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds! All you need is love, love! Love is all you need. It’s all in the mind you know. Hey! Look at John, will ya? What’s the matter, John love? Blue Meanies? Newer and bluer Meanies have been sighted within the vicinity of this theater! There’s only one way to go out. How’s that? Singing! One! Two! Three! Four! We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow submarine, yellow submarine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;John&amp;#39;s Abuse Joked&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idk... but a lot of the jokes being made about Lennon’s abuse both on here and on Instagram really annoy me. I mean, he was going through a rough time... and it wasn’t like it was EXTREMELY severe. He was drunk, high or both a lot of the time. I’m not condoning this, heck, abuse of any kind is one of the worst things to happen to anyone, and I feel bad for Cynthia...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I feel like it’s wrong and disrespectful to keep either joking about the abuse, or demonizing John for it. That’s just my view. Does anyone agree?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Finna S U C C John&amp;#39;s D I C C A Bit More&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This again? John was a complex person. Anyone can be an abusive violent asshole. But John acknowledged his dark side in public and fought from then only to be a better human being and spread the message of love and peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is the point of this post? To say to everyone that we are are forever trapped in the prison of our genes and upbringing and no attempts that we make to better ourselves will ever count?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Creepypasta: Run For Your Life&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you&amp;#39;re yourself just listening to the Beatles, you&amp;#39;re listening to Rubber Soul, you love that album, it&amp;#39;s your favorite and you love all the songs on them...almost all of them. Run for your life is a song that John Lennon says he regrets writing, some say it&amp;#39;s because it was about abuse (which is BS because he loved to beat his waifu), but rumor has it that the song is cursed, and knowing this, you avoid listening to it, only occasionally accidentally hearing the first few chords. The odd thing is sometimes when you accidentally hear them and then stop the album, you can hear something in the distance , it sounds something like slapping, but you aren&amp;#39;t sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, you&amp;#39;re outside, enjoying the summer sun with your phone playing your favorite album while reading your favorite book, you feel relaxed, suddenly, a neighbor comes over (she&amp;#39;s a sweet old lady, she talks about her grandchildren and she goes on about how one of them is now graduating high school or something) then while talking, you didn&amp;#39;t notice till it started, the song started playing, Run for your life. The song made the lady nervous, when it was almost done, she said she had to go, she waddled away as fast as her wrinkles could carry her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she&amp;#39;s gone, you hear that slapping sound, it&amp;#39;s quiet at first, but grows loud as the seconds tic on, they sound like they&amp;#39;re behind you, you turn behind you, you see a blurry thing in the trees behind you, seemingly moving forward. You&amp;#39;re scared but look at it was it reveals itself as it comes out of the trees, and bushes, it&amp;#39;s a creature that you thought was only a legend, it was an absolute madman. You wanted to scream as it seemingly glides across the grass toward you, holding a poorly drawn knife and blooding coming out of his eyes and him singing &amp;quot;imagine&amp;quot; but in a deep pitch. You&amp;#39;re so scared, when you finally scream, it&amp;#39;s too late and he kills you like he did to Paul in 6619.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I know this happened to you? Because I am you, you&amp;#39;re dead, I am dead, you&amp;#39;re in Hell, I&amp;#39;m in hell, I&amp;#39;m typing this from my computer in my demon apartment (expensive rent by nice view :/ ). I&amp;#39;m also from the future, But you&amp;#39;re in the past, The Beatles are in hell, too, all of them except Rigno, physically, his soul is in hell, but his body is still alive for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also need to know this, read the first word of every paragraph, and don&amp;#39;t look in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Creepypasta: I Saw Paul&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;October 8th, 2013, Wednesday Morning&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one sunny day, I was minding my own business having my cup of coffee. (As always) and going outside to get some air. As I was stepping outside I&amp;#39;ve noticed a blank DVD on my porch steps. The case had nothing on it but mild blood stains. I quickly brought it inside to watch it. As I was starting it up, my computer keyboard went haywire and kept on clicking the Tab button. Nevertheless I thought it glitched out. (Due to the fact that my computer is a Windows Vista.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DVD loaded up, and the opening was quite disturbing. It was a figure of John Lennon from a distance stabbing someone on the floor in a dark hall way, with only tiny little beams of light shining. My mind was racing with a whole bunch of question. &amp;quot;Did The Beatles really do this?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Is that John Lennon?&amp;quot;. As John was stabbing that person his song Imagine was playing in the background. I was quite shock of this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the song didn&amp;#39;t play normally... Instead it had a much slower tempo to it, and John Lennon was saying &amp;quot;Imagine there&amp;#39;s no Paul, it&amp;#39;s easy if you try.&amp;quot; I only guessed one thing, it&amp;#39;s Paul McCartney he was stabbing! But why? Why would he kill his own bandmate? I continued to watch it. After John finished stabbing that person, the camera got closer to the body. When the camera made its way to the body, it showed Paul McCartney with his eyes removed, nose sliced off, and blood coming out throw his mouth. The sight of that made me lose my appetite!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then after that, The scene continues with John Lennon in a dark room repeating, &amp;quot;Turn me on, dead man&amp;quot; and, &amp;quot;I WILL bury Paul&amp;quot; as John was saying that, he was sharping his knife. Until a gentle knock came on the door. It looked like it was George Harrison. This person said, &amp;quot;John, wheres Paul?&amp;quot; John Lennon simply replied with, &amp;quot;Imagine there&amp;#39;s no Paul. It&amp;#39;s easy if you try...&amp;quot; George knew that John went off the deep end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he said in a louder tone, &amp;quot;WHY JOHN??!!! WHY??!!!&amp;quot; The screen went black. I wasn&amp;#39;t sure if it was my computer or the DVD. Anyways, the screen was flashing like if someone was flicking the bathroom lights on you. I paused as quick as I can to see who was under all those lights. After all those unsuccessful attempts, I finally got it. Under all those lights, George was on the floor dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scene then continued to an abandoned city. It showed Ringo Starr, on a small rock, with a noose tied up, and it showed Ringo&amp;#39;s hand grabbing it. The screen went black and twisted voice screaming was heard. I felt like vomiting! I&amp;#39;ve not heard something that demonic since watching The Exorcist. The screen stayed black for about 20 seconds, and during does 20 seconds was the sound of female fans crying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by that time, I couldn&amp;#39;t take it anymore. So, I took the DVD out, and brought it to dump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;October 9th, 2013, Wednesday Morning&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got up this morning, went on my newly updated computer. (Windows 8) and saw the news. Paul McCartney Was Killed! It said that he was stabbed to death. isn&amp;#39;t it ironic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;I Actually Really Like Yellow Submarine Side 2&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Yellow Submarine Side 2. The Lyrics Are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of music theory most of the themes will go over a typical listener’s head. There’s also Jeremy Hillary Boob PhD’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these lyrics, to realise that they’re not just catchy- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Yellow Submarine Side 2 truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the genius in &amp;quot;Yellow Submarine in Pepperland”, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Faul’s genius wit unfolds itself on their AudioLaserdisc™ player. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes, by the way, i DO have a Yellow Submarine Side 2 tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&amp;quot;People&amp;quot; Just Can&amp;#39;t Grasp The Genius Of The Beatles&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand The Beatles. The lyrics are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical instrumentation most of the notes will go over a typical listener’s head. There’s also John’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his songwriting- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these songs, to realize that they’re not just catchy- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike The Beatles truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the beauty in Paul’s existential track “Why Don&amp;#39;t We Do It In The Road,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as The Beatles’ genius wit unfolds itself on their speakers. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes, by the way, I DO have an Abbey Road tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&amp;quot;Based On The Interactions I&amp;#39;ve Had With The Mods Here, They Are Very Pro-Free Speech&amp;quot;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve remained mostly silent about this, but yeah I agree. Some of the memes are funny, most of them are not. Like yeah, I get that picture of John looking like a cowboy made of denim is goofy, but it&amp;#39;s not as funny to us regulars who&amp;#39;ve been on the sub for years and have seen this picture dozens of times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is, we have a large population of younger Beatles fans, and if there&amp;#39;s anything I know about people my age, we love memes. I don&amp;#39;t have problems when they&amp;#39;re well done, but some people think that the shittier your shitpost is, the funnier it is, when that&amp;#39;s really not the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side, a lot of suggestions that I hear when people talk about this is to either ban them or move them to another sub. I don&amp;#39;t believe that either of these are the right solution at all. Banning them is really silly and based on the interactions I&amp;#39;ve had with the mods here, they are very pro-free speech. For instance, there was a large influx of Paul is Dead nuts posting here one time and I asked the mods if they had considered banning posts related to the conspiracy theory similar to &lt;a href=""/r/Nirvana""&gt;/r/Nirvana&lt;/a&gt; did with conspiracy theories around Kurt Cobain&amp;#39;s death. Their response was that even if the posts are low quality or factually incorrect, they should still have the right to be able to post them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My suggestion is this: downvote them. That&amp;#39;s all you gotta do. If the people of this sub truly think that these memes are irrelevant to our sub, then downvote it. You guys don&amp;#39;t seem to have a problem downvoting me when I give opinions that you don&amp;#39;t agree with, why can&amp;#39;t you downvote a low effort meme?
&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Regarding Memes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to keep it short and sweet. &lt;a href=""/r/Beatles""&gt;/r/Beatles&lt;/a&gt; has always aimed to be a place for all kinds of beatles fans. Those interested in trivia, photos, jokes, videos and, of course, memes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s important to note that we are in no way against memes and try not to censor content at all, memes are one of reddit&amp;#39;s main assets after all. However, recently there seems to have been a surge of them and we&amp;#39;ve seen many of your responses - either in messages to the moderators or as responses to posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result we have temporarily cracked down on the memes, primarily the repetitive &amp;#39;madman&amp;#39; ones. This is not a permanent solution and we will not be removing all of them, but enough so that the sub doesn&amp;#39;t seem so filled up with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please post your opinions on the situation and how we could possibly take care of it in the comments, we want this to be a place for all beatlemaniacs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-The &lt;a href=""/r/Beatles""&gt;/r/Beatles&lt;/a&gt; Mods&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Can Someone Please Explain...&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could someone please explain this subreddit to me? I only came across it yesterday when I made my second reddit account (this one).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it a club of John-haters?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Why Ringo Starr Is A Reptillian Space Wizard Sent Here To Take Over Our Government&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hello my sweet lords, &lt;a href=""/u/stefanristic02""&gt;u/stefanristic02&lt;/a&gt; back at you again with another sick post about the johnlennonbeat-les. before i begin the post, dont forget to mod me, and smash that upvote button. lets see if we can get to 2 upvotes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT - WE DID IT! LET&amp;#39;S SEE IF WE CAN GET 10 UPVOTES EDIT 2 - MY SWEET LORD WE DID IT! LETS SEE IF WE CAN GET TO 20 UPVOTES EDIT 3 - DON&amp;#39;T FORGET TO JOIN THE RINGO STAR IS A REPTILLIAN SPACE WIZARD DISCORD - &lt;a href=""https://discord.gg/Y9eaUsm""&gt;https://discord.gg/Y9eaUsm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;all right now im going to teach you a lesson about the buzzles. in 1966 paul mccartney was unfortunately ran over, replaced by &amp;quot;faul&amp;quot; mccartney. however, what people havent considered is why he was ran over. some think it was an accident, but it wasn&amp;#39;t. the moon landing was an accident , but paul&amp;#39;s death wasn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was actually done by the lizardpeople in the white house to distract the world from the real scandal - ringo starr is a reptilian space wizard. of course the battles were aware of this, and the clues are everywhere. ringo is wearing a human flesh suit, and is actually only the size of a hamster. he hides in ringos nose, controlling him, which is why his nose is so big. He named himself Ringo Starr becayse he had ringworm at the time and he came from the starrs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the lizardpeople in the white house were turned into lizards by ringo because he is a space wizard and is magical. he says peace and love a lot because that&amp;#39;s a code, as it is an acronym for People Engineer A Cheeky Electrical Accident Near Devon - Lots Of Veal Eaten. this has a clear meaning - humanity can only create faults and mistakes, and eat veal. this is why ringo does not eat veal - he is not a human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ringo joined the beatles because he promised jim lenin a lifetime supply of strawberry callipos if he could play the drums. jimmy accepted the agreement and was famously very happy with his callipos, and wrote many songs about them. for example, penny lane was actually written to mock the working class, who had to work hard and pay for callipos, while johnny got his own private stash. however, he eventually regretted the agreement - he had beaten his wife so much that he was rather skilled at the drums now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cheeky ringo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;anyway, the other bootles were rather cross with him joining, and wrote many songs hinting it. the song it won&amp;#39;t be long was about how it won&amp;#39;t be long until ringo took over the world. i&amp;#39;ll follow the sun was referencing ringos space ship. I want to be your man was Ringo desperately trying to prove that he is a man. Lovely Rita was actually the space leader. Yesterday was about how faul&amp;#39;s girlfriend was probed. john also farted lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there are plenty more examples, but ringworm was never caught&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it goes so much further. ringo not only staged a coup, he also controls everything. literally everything. he is in every atom. proof? Here it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ringos surname is Starr. Starr fish are in the sea. What else is in the sea? Octopi. Octopi release ink when agitated. Ink is used in fountain pens. Fountains are used in parks all the time - parks are a big source of grass to fight global warming - globes don&amp;#39;t exist because the earth is flat - tires get flat - that means you can&amp;#39;t travel easily - people travel across the world in planes - planes are used by the military - the military use planes to drop bombs - what type of bombs? ATOM BOMBS. ATOM BOMBS DROP ATOMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RINGO DROPS ATOMS WHEN HE DROPS THAT ASS BECAUSE HE IS ATOMS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HE IS US&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WE ARE HIM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HELP US PLEASE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PLEASE STOP INVADING US RINGWORM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright thanks for watching guys, don&amp;#39;t forget to make me mod, follow on Instagram and Twitter, don&amp;#39;t forget to swipe right on tinder, like my Snapchat page, link in my linkedin, pin my Pinterest, subscribe to my newsletter, buy my book, listen to my Spotify playlist and have a very pleasant day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little babies and old fucks are probably familiar with the Beatles, the fab four from Manchester who created songs for a the first generation of Beliebers to listen to. &amp;quot;Just harmless pop music&amp;quot; I hear you say. THAT&amp;#39;S WHERE YOU&amp;#39;RE WRONG YOU FUCKING MANSPLAINING SHITHEAD! You&amp;#39;d have to be doing a STEM subject, a trade, or special ed not to notice some of their problematic lyrics and images in their records. Some people like my fucking straight white cis male grandpa (glad you&amp;#39;re dead you old fuck) say that they&amp;#39;re just from a different time and that this was just how things were back then, but that&amp;#39;s a problematic viewpoint to have. If art or culture from another time doesn&amp;#39;t conform to my 21st century viewpoint, then I&amp;#39;m in my full right to censor it to prevent it from hurting other people. Now, on to the tofu of the matter. These are four songs from the Beatles that are racist, sexist, homophobic or problematic in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Beatles&amp;#39; PROBLEMATIC Albums&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1- She&amp;#39;s a Woman&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first entry on my list is a fucking shitty song by Paul McCartney about his &amp;quot;love&amp;quot; who was probably a 15 year old groupie, the fucking pedo. The song is fucking boring, except for one line. The title of the song, &amp;quot;She&amp;#39;s a Woman&amp;quot;. HOW FUCKING DARE YOU ASSUME XYR GENDER YOU FUCKING CIS WHITE MALE! This wouldn&amp;#39;t be a problem otherwise, but I myself have suffered from gender discrimination. My manager at Walmart referred to me as a &amp;quot;she&amp;quot; when I had mentally transitioned to genderneutral the night before. I can&amp;#39;t believe that she didn&amp;#39;t know about it, as I had tweeted about it and wrote about it on my Tumblr blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2- Run For Your Life&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that John Lennon beat his wife? Of course you did, because the shithead just looks like a fucking wife beater. He didn&amp;#39;t exactly keep this secret, though, and mentioned it in several of his shitty songs. This one just takes the piss however. &amp;quot;You better run for your life if you can, little girl&amp;quot;. First, &amp;quot;little girl&amp;quot; I THINK THEIR ALL JUST PEDOS!. Secondly, this is a threat that could trigger PTSD in women who have been abused. I myself was once assaulted by a local butcher when he viciously told me to get out of his shop when I was protesting his use of meat. I was only using his fire extinguisher to ruin his murder spoils, he should have helped me! It being his &amp;quot;property&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t even matter because they&amp;#39;re shouldn&amp;#39;t even be private property. Remember what Freddie Mercury said. &amp;quot;Imagine no possessions, I wonder if you can&amp;quot; and I think he should have listened to more Queen. Anyway, to conclude, John beat his wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3- Something&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This song is problematic in the fact that it promotes unrealistic standards in women. &amp;quot;I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long&amp;quot;. How dare George Parasol tell ME how to wear MY hair! Songs like this were probably the reason that boys never talked to me in high school. This song should&amp;#39;ve promoted body positivity and had a line &amp;quot;A GIRL CAN BE 197 KILOS AT 16 IF SHE WANTS TO AND ITS YOUR FUCKING FAULT THAT SHES THAT HEAVY ADRIAN JUST BECAUSE YOU WENT OUT WITH THAT WHORE ASHLEY INSTEAD OF ME I BET SHES FUCKING STUPID AND YOU ONLY WENT OUT WITH HER FOR HER FUCKING HUGE TITS! I hope George dies of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4- George Harrison&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George Harrison is a fucking racist. He probably just became a muslim because it was cool. On behalf of all Indians, I apologise for that fucking white person&amp;#39;s disrespect of youre country. He had the gall to steal the Suitar from Indistan and play it on his old fuck white people records. I think, if I was an Indian, I would be horrified by the level of cultural appropriation and demand reparations. Another aspect of him thats racist is his use of indian music, which is theirs and you shouldn&amp;#39;t be allowed to learn or play if you are a white person. He also started the concert for pakistan, but probably stole all the money because he&amp;#39;s a greedy rich white male. He also cheated on his wife because she cheated on him. IF A WOMAN WANTS TO HAVE SEX WITH ANOTHER MAN, SHE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO YOU SEXIST! He is just overall a fucking bigot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, those are my reasons that the Beatles are fucking racist, sexist and bigoted and should be banned in any progressive country. Please give me more reasons in the comments and reblog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;I Will Now Prove That John Lennon Died&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will now prove that John Lennon died. While making Magical Mystery Tour John overdosed on drugs and died. They had to finish the album, and so they had to replace all of Side B with singles. Paul was put in John&amp;#39;s place in all his unfinished scenes; The Walrus Was Paul. They had to find someone who looked like him, so they found someone who looked similar, but was married to Yoko Ono. He wouldn&amp;#39;t divorce her at any cost, so they had to deal with her as well as this new John. He also had to do a John Lennon impression, so that&amp;#39;s why his voice sounds deeper in his songs. He couldn&amp;#39;t handle so he just took too many drugs. They had to do the White Album seperatly, because the songwriting wasn&amp;#39;t as strong between this fake John and Paul. Blue Jay Way was written about John&amp;#39;s death &amp;quot;Please don&amp;#39;t be long&amp;quot; showing George&amp;#39;s dissapproval of them replacing John, wishing he would come back. While My Guitar Gently Weeps is also about that. John was the other guitar player. It&amp;#39;s also hinted in the end of Yellow Submarine. At the live action part at the end, John has like 2 lines. On Abbey Road John is the only one in white. White is considered a heavenly colour. Turn Me On Dead Man and I&amp;#39;d love to turn you on. It&amp;#39;s Johnnys Birthday was also about John. Sad to see that wonderful man pass away at such a young age, and I wish that they would reveal the truth about it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Billy Shears Is Dead&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year is 1961. The Beatles have just finished a gig in Hamburg and are celebrating near the docks. Suddenly, in his drunken state, John Lennon mistakes Paul McCartney for his wife and beats him. The tipsy Paul is unable to keep his balance and falls into the waters below. The other Beatles immediately realise what just happened and flee the scene. A month later, they find a replacement for Paul. For the next five years they play and reach world fame with their replacement bassist William &amp;#39;Pepper&amp;#39; Shears until the fateful date. An unprecedented all-nighter for Revolver ends in the early hours of Wednesday and the Beatles hear a knock at the door. Ringo is the first to answer. &amp;quot;Who is it&amp;quot; he asks, &amp;quot;Postman&amp;quot; a familiar voice answers. As Ringo opens the door the man on the other side kicks it hard, knocking Ringo to the floor. John takes a second to recognise him. It&amp;#39;s Paul McCartney, and he&amp;#39;s pissed! He swam back to the shore in a minute that night, but the others had fled the scene before he could make it. He had spent the intervening years practising with his bass, his voice, and a gun. Before John can tackle him, he fires three shots. Billy Shears is hit in the shoulder and runs for the door. Paul is able to swiftly push John off while George is too busy taking a shit. Billy grabs his car keys and starts speeding off, but Paul fires two more shots which hit Billy&amp;#39;s tyre and his windscreen. With shattered glass all over his face and losing control of the car, Billy careens off into a nearby lampost and flies through the shattered windscreen. He dies on impact. After disposing of the body, Paul makes his way back into Abbey Road. &amp;quot;So, where did we leave off?&amp;quot; Paul asks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway this is my proof that Paul killed Faul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fixes Groucho Marx glasses and comedy fake mustache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;THE FACT THAT&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that so many books still name the Beatles as &amp;quot;the greatest or most significant or most influential&amp;quot; rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art. Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worthy of being saved.&lt;/p&gt;

,ultimate,"**TL;DR I got tired of having to dive deep into the youtubeverse whenever I wanted to find non-beginner instructional ultimate videos. I made a list of the ones I did find. 
[Here it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWsvaXhsnJM&amp;list=PLZ0AweYMZTGWIjHD1tSkucsSeLrUDEJPq)**

&gt; 

Hey all,

Happy College Nationals!

After watching callahan videos filled with people who are already better than me after playing for half as long, I decided to push myself even harder than I was before. I can't let these kids get away with passing me like that. 

In that push to get better, I've been on the hunt for videos that go beyond how to run a basic vert/ho and how to throw a flick and backhand. 99% of the people on this sub have already seen those and/or already know how to do it. There's a ton of beginners videos that are readily available, but I feel like we really have to look hard to find anything that teaches new skills/strategies/observations or how to refine skills that already have a solid foundation. 

I searched through youtube for a few hours, watched a lot of videos, and tried to narrow down to videos that I personally thought contained good information for refining skills/strategy/mindset that aren't commonly seen or where many experienced players might know about it but some who haven't been playing long (or even those who have) might not. 

This is mainly just my opinion as to what I think was helpful, fresh, insightful, etc. and it's based on my experience or lack thereof. For example, I've never run a split stack in all my time of playing ultimate (probably a reason why), zone offense and 3-2-2 defense were tricky to me for a long time, and I STILL can't seem to get down throwing my good hucks consistently. I included all of those on this list for that reason.

Some videos might seem really obvious to you or maybe there was a video from a common ultimate youtuber that I didn't include that you think was great. Some of them I put in were kind of meh, but they might have had one really good point or things i hadn't thought of before. If you think a video isn't good (I took out one video last night that I re-watched and realized gave bad advice), let me know which video and why you think it's bad and we could talk about it. Also up for swapping out videos that cover the same topic but you know of one that's better than the one I added.

There's several RISE UP videos on this list, but if you have the time, I would *highly* recommend watching Ben Wiggins talk about marking at UCPC 2007. It's an hour long video on marking, so you know it's juicy.

If you are really interested in more advanced topics/skills/strategies/mindsets and you don't mind spending some money for it, [RISE UP](https://www.riseupultimate.com/) has some fantastic videos.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey all,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy College Nationals!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After watching callahan videos filled with people who are already better than me after playing for half as long, I decided to push myself even harder than I was before. I can&amp;#39;t let these kids get away with passing me like that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that push to get better, I&amp;#39;ve been on the hunt for videos that go beyond how to run a basic vert/ho and how to throw a flick and backhand. 99% of the people on this sub have already seen those and/or already know how to do it. There&amp;#39;s a ton of beginners videos that are readily available, but I feel like we really have to look hard to find anything that teaches new skills/strategies/observations or how to refine skills that already have a solid foundation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I searched through youtube for a few hours, watched a lot of videos, and tried to narrow down to videos that I personally thought contained good information for refining skills/strategy/mindset that aren&amp;#39;t commonly seen or where many experienced players might know about it but some who haven&amp;#39;t been playing long (or even those who have) might not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is mainly just my opinion as to what I think was helpful, fresh, insightful, etc. and it&amp;#39;s based on my experience or lack thereof. For example, I&amp;#39;ve never run a split stack in all my time of playing ultimate (probably a reason why), zone offense and 3-2-2 defense were tricky to me for a long time, and I STILL can&amp;#39;t seem to get down throwing my good hucks consistently. I included all of those on this list for that reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some videos might seem really obvious to you or maybe there was a video from a common ultimate youtuber that I didn&amp;#39;t include that you think was great. Some of them I put in were kind of meh, but they might have had one really good point or things i hadn&amp;#39;t thought of before.

&amp;nbsp;

So as the title says I did have a bit of a slump, started the day pretty well with a victory just to then proceed to lose my a** from Champ I Div 2 to Diamond 3 Div 1.

&amp;nbsp;

Honestly I have no clue what to do, It's gotten to the point where it doesn't matter If we have a lead, I see the ball flying towards our teammate and in my head I call ""okay we'll probably lose"".- What happens next is teammate gets dunked on and in overtime they cheat up a player in kick off and boom the ball and we lost.

&amp;nbsp;

Point I'm trying to make is so many times we've conceded goals after goals because a teammate either pushed up too far when we were trying to make a play happen and just got beat to the ball or missed an easy save and let the goal in (and I did make silly mistakes but fairly less compared to them or atleast from what I've noticed).

&amp;nbsp;

And here comes the biggest problem of all and that is I tried to switch up my play style (defensive, support, offensive) and nothing worked and just kept losing and losing and slowly i became *the Hulk of RL* and after I got the same teammate 3 times in a row who missed alot of balls, he tried to give me a positive criticism on a rotational mistake I made but that was the last drop and I just snapped at the poor guy even though he meant well.

&amp;nbsp;

So what do you guys do to get over this uncertain ""doesn't matter what I do we lose"" or ""I'm just not good enough to carry them, i suck"" feeling?


Do you guys just watch replays? Switch playlist .. or just change camera settings / do something else? Anything that comes to mind would be welcome!

&amp;nbsp;

I'll probably won't be able to make it to Champ to grind for the rewards, I just need advice to become a better person for the next season and overall better teammate instead of this gloomy person I am today.


Also if the guy I snapped on reads this: I'm sorry dude!

This week at Bungie, we lit the Iron Banner again.


Iron Banner 6v6 is back for Season 3. To celebrate its return, we added a reprised version of the Bannerfall map to the playlist. This was another fan favorite we brought forward by popular demand. It will be available in the Iron Banner playlist until the next reset, when it will become available in Quick Play, Competitive, and Private Matches for all players of*&amp;nbsp;Destiny 2*. You also might see it in Trials this weekend, but we’ll know that for sure tomorrow!

##**Hive Annihilation **

Escalation Protocol has been live for two weeks now. Ever since the launch of *Warmind*, we’ve seen Guardians bravely battling hordes of Hive on Mars. The bravest among you have gone on to defeat seven levels of bosses. As always, combat leads to feedback. Today, we’re responding to a popular request for new matchmaking systems that would unite nine players in battle. **Lead Designer Jacob Benton** has some comments about this new activity in Destiny.


**What were the design goals for Escalation Protocol?**


&gt;
&gt;**Jacob**: Escalation Protocol was designed to be a high-difficulty endgame activity for a max-level, three-player fireteam. Other players in the world can contribute to make it easier, but they shouldn’t be required as long as your team is highly skilled and coordinated. We have received a lot of feedback since the original launch of *Destiny 2* that players felt like reaching max Power was not satisfying. There weren’t enough activities that required and rewarded that level of commitment. Escalation Protocol was designed to fill that gap.


**So this activity was not specifically designed for nine players?**


&gt;
&gt;Other than Raid Activities, all PvE activities and private spaces are optimized for three players to allow for multiple types of activities in the space. So no, it wasn’t designed for it, but it’s not a surprise that it’s easier with nine players, given how under-leveled most of us are right now. We knew that players would use the same creative workarounds to get nine players into a space similar to Court of Oryx, but we did not specifically tune the difficulty around requiring that many players.


**Any plans to enable larger fireteams in the future?**


&gt;
&gt;We’ve had a lot of conversations here about what to do to answer the community’s feedback. We’re going to continue to monitor as more players progress up to max Power and are able to attempt Escalation Protocol at the difficulty it was designed for and we’ll determine what, if any action, is necessary. We also hear players are really enjoying large groups of players fighting against enemies, so we’ll use that feedback to inform our future plans.

##**Armor Updates**

We kicked off the beginning of Season 3 with changes to Exotic Weapons. “What about the armor?” has been a popular question. Today, we’re going to start answering it. This is the first wave of changes—the next are currently slated to come in [July](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/46871). **Sandbox Designer Victor Anderson** has the facts on what you can expect on May 29. 


&gt;
&gt;**Victor**: We’ve received a lot of feedback on Exotic Armor in *Destiny* 2. With 1.2.0, we introduced changes to Exotic Weapons to make them punchier and more compelling, and with the 1.2.1 release, we're taking steps to update some of the existing Exotic Armor.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;It’s my hope that the changes to Exotic Armor will result in more interesting choices, whether you're doing a strike or going for wins in the Crucible. When deciding to update the Exotic perks, our goal was to keep the identity of the Exotics the same, even if the way they influence your playstyle is slightly different.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;With the release of 1.2.1, we’re updating six pieces of Exotic Armor, two for each class, and we will be updating more in the future. Please note that any mechanical changes are in addition to the already established effects unless explicitly stated otherwise.


&gt;
&gt;###Titan
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* **Synthoceps**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   * Mechanical Changes—Previously, the perk adjusted your melee damage depending on the number of enemies surrounding you. Now it grants a flat bonus to melee and Super damage when you’re surrounded by three or more enemies. The buff is retained for a short duration after you are no longer surrounded.
&gt;   * Although Synthoceps has gotten a fair bit of love in the Crucible, players are often focused on the increased lunge rate. The outgoing damage bonus was hard to appreciate and plan around with it being so variable in nature. With this change, you will be able to feel the impact more often in all scenarios, particularly in PvE.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* **Lion Rampant**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   * Mechanical Changes—You can hipfire while Lift is active without interrupting it, and your aerial hipfire doesn't have an aerial accuracy penalty.
&gt;   * The Lion Rampant was focused around Lift and how it impacts your playstyle and tactics, so we decided to push further in that direction, emphasizing fast moving aerial assault.
&gt;
&gt;###Hunter
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* **The Dragon’s Shadow**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   * Mechanical Changes—Dodging reloads all weapons simultaneously. The effects of Wraithmetal Mail now also include a bonus to mobility.
&gt;   * Although the Dragon’s Shadow does have a small following, we wanted to make it more useful in a general sense under even neutral conditions, while keeping in the theme of a fast-moving ninja.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* **Mechaneer’s Tricksleeves**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   * Mechanical Changes—Swapping to a sidearm while critically wounded greatly increases its damage.
&gt;   * We went for the fantasy of a holdout weapon; the pistol tucked into your sleeve that you pull out in an emergency to save you. These changes should let you turn around a fight more easily.
&gt;
&gt;###Warlock
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* **Lunafaction Boots**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   * Mechanical Changes—Rift reload is automatic instead of being activated on entry/exit. Empowering Rift makes weapons more effective at extended ranges.
&gt;   * Players having to dip in and out of the Rift to reload their weapons was not consistent with other Rift effects, particularly with the overshield effect on Healing Rift. It’s been made automatic to be easier to understand and use. As this is a more offensive choice in terms of Rift Exotics, we also wanted to further reward players who want to double down with Empowering Rift instead of playing it safe with Healing Rift. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* **Sunbracers**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   * Mechanical Changes—Original effect replaced with: Increases the duration of Solar Grenades. Solar melee kills grant unlimited Solar Grenade energy for a brief time.
&gt;   * While effective under some circumstances in terms of things like flat damage output with your Solar Grenade, Sunbracers didn’t feel flashy enough for gloves where your hands are perpetually on fire. So, while retaining the original flavor of “The Solar Grenade Exotic Armor,” we’ve scaled up the potential output significantly to give the player a strong taste of power on a more frequent basis.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;###**Bungie.net API Issue: Item Equip Currently Disabled**
&gt;
&gt;This week, we identified an issue where players could reach 385 Power within a short amount of time if characters had no items equipped in their weapon inventories. Characters could enter this state only by using the item equip functionality available through the Bungie.net API. As such, the ability to equip or unequip items through the API has been disabled until we can resolve the issue. While players may still transfer items from character to character, any item that is equipped will need to be unequipped within Destiny 2 before it can be transferred using the Destiny Companion App or any third-party application.
&gt;
&gt;The ability to equip items is one of the most used features available through the API, and the decision to disable this functionality was not made without our weighing the impact it would have on the community. To preserve the meaning behind reaching max Power, we decided that this action needed to be taken.
&gt;
&gt;Once a solution to this issue has been identified, we will provide updates on when to expect a hotfix that will allow us to enable these features once more. Stay tuned to [@BungieHelp](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp) on Twitter for updates.

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week at Bungie, we lit the Iron Banner again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iron Banner 6v6 is back for Season 3. To celebrate its return, we added a reprised version of the Bannerfall map to the playlist. This was another fan favorite we brought forward by popular demand. It will be available in the Iron Banner playlist until the next reset, when it will become available in Quick Play, Competitive, and Private Matches for all players of&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;. You also might see it in Trials this weekend, but we’ll know that for sure tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hive Annihilation &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Escalation Protocol has been live for two weeks now. Ever since the launch of &lt;em&gt;Warmind&lt;/em&gt;, we’ve seen Guardians bravely battling hordes of Hive on Mars. The bravest among you have gone on to defeat seven levels of bosses. As always, combat leads to feedback. Today, we’re responding to a popular request for new matchmaking systems that would unite nine players in battle. &lt;strong&gt;Lead Designer Jacob Benton&lt;/strong&gt; has some comments about this new activity in Destiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were the design goals for Escalation Protocol?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jacob&lt;/strong&gt;: Escalation Protocol was designed to be a high-difficulty endgame activity for a max-level, three-player fireteam. Other players in the world can contribute to make it easier, but they shouldn’t be required as long as your team is highly skilled and coordinated. We have received a lot of feedback since the original launch of &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; that players felt like reaching max Power was not satisfying. There weren’t enough activities that required and rewarded that level of commitment. Escalation Protocol was designed to fill that gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So this activity was not specifically designed for nine players?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than Raid Activities, all PvE activities and private spaces are optimized for three players to allow for multiple types of activities in the space. So no, it wasn’t designed for it, but it’s not a surprise that it’s easier with nine players, given how under-leveled most of us are right now. We knew that players would use the same creative workarounds to get nine players into a space similar to Court of Oryx, but we did not specifically tune the difficulty around requiring that many players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any plans to enable larger fireteams in the future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve had a lot of conversations here about what to do to answer the community’s feedback. We’re going to continue to monitor as more players progress up to max Power and are able to attempt Escalation Protocol at the difficulty it was designed for and we’ll determine what, if any action, is necessary. We also hear players are really enjoying large groups of players fighting against enemies, so we’ll use that feedback to inform our future plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armor Updates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We kicked off the beginning of Season 3 with changes to Exotic Weapons. “What about the armor?” has been a popular question. Today, we’re going to start answering it. This is the first wave of changes—the next are currently slated to come in &lt;a href=""https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/46871""&gt;July&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Sandbox Designer Victor Anderson&lt;/strong&gt; has the facts on what you can expect on May 29. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Victor&lt;/strong&gt;: We’ve received a lot of feedback on Exotic Armor in &lt;em&gt;Destiny&lt;/em&gt; 2. With 1.2.0, we introduced changes to Exotic Weapons to make them punchier and more compelling, and with the 1.2.1 release, we&amp;#39;re taking steps to update some of the existing Exotic Armor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s my hope that the changes to Exotic Armor will result in more interesting choices, whether you&amp;#39;re doing a strike or going for wins in the Crucible. When deciding to update the Exotic perks, our goal was to keep the identity of the Exotics the same, even if the way they influence your playstyle is slightly different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the release of 1.2.1, we’re updating six pieces of Exotic Armor, two for each class, and we will be updating more in the future. Please note that any mechanical changes are in addition to the already established effects unless explicitly stated otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Titan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synthoceps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanical Changes—Previously, the perk adjusted your melee damage depending on the number of enemies surrounding you. Now it grants a flat bonus to melee and Super damage when you’re surrounded by three or more enemies. The buff is retained for a short duration after you are no longer surrounded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although Synthoceps has gotten a fair bit of love in the Crucible, players are often focused on the increased lunge rate. The outgoing damage bonus was hard to appreciate and plan around with it being so variable in nature. With this change, you will be able to feel the impact more often in all scenarios, particularly in PvE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lion Rampant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanical Changes—You can hipfire while Lift is active without interrupting it, and your aerial hipfire doesn&amp;#39;t have an aerial accuracy penalty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Lion Rampant was focused around Lift and how it impacts your playstyle and tactics, so we decided to push further in that direction, emphasizing fast moving aerial assault.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Hunter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Dragon’s Shadow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanical Changes—Dodging reloads all weapons simultaneously. The effects of Wraithmetal Mail now also include a bonus to mobility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although the Dragon’s Shadow does have a small following, we wanted to make it more useful in a general sense under even neutral conditions, while keeping in the theme of a fast-moving ninja.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechaneer’s Tricksleeves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanical Changes—Swapping to a sidearm while critically wounded greatly increases its damage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We went for the fantasy of a holdout weapon; the pistol tucked into your sleeve that you pull out in an emergency to save you. These changes should let you turn around a fight more easily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Warlock&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lunafaction Boots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanical Changes—Rift reload is automatic instead of being activated on entry/exit. Empowering Rift makes weapons more effective at extended ranges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Players having to dip in and out of the Rift to reload their weapons was not consistent with other Rift effects, particularly with the overshield effect on Healing Rift. It’s been made automatic to be easier to understand and use. As this is a more offensive choice in terms of Rift Exotics, we also wanted to further reward players who want to double down with Empowering Rift instead of playing it safe with Healing Rift. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunbracers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanical Changes—Original effect replaced with: Increases the duration of Solar Grenades. Solar melee kills grant unlimited Solar Grenade energy for a brief time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While effective under some circumstances in terms of things like flat damage output with your Solar Grenade, Sunbracers didn’t feel flashy enough for gloves where your hands are perpetually on fire. So, while retaining the original flavor of “The Solar Grenade Exotic Armor,” we’ve scaled up the potential output significantly to give the player a strong taste of power on a more frequent basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bungie Versus&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago we kicked off a new type of stream where we have a friendly match against a predetermined team of worthy opponents. Our friends at Vicarious Visions have put their quarters down and called next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/111/111780/05242018_Vicarious_Visions.jpg""&gt;Image Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not familiar with VV, they have partnered with us to create awesome content for Destiny 2. They want to show off their Crucible skills and see whether they can defeat us in a friendly exhibition. Here are the details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bungie Versus Vicarious Visions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 30 at 11 a.m. PDT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch Bungie at &lt;a href=""https://www.twitch.tv/bungie""&gt;twitch.tv/Bungie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch Vicarious Visions at &lt;a href=""https://www.twitch.tv/vicariousvisions""&gt;twitch.tv/VicariousVisions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team Vicarious Visions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barry Morales, Production &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Pietrocarli, Art &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paddy Hennessy, Engineering &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave Keenan, Art &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team Bungie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dmg04, Community&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cozmo, Community&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kevin Yanes, Crucible&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Victor Anderson, Sandbox&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be a best-of-five match. Bungie will pick two game types, and VV will also pick two. The final game will be Mayhem on Bannerfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck, have fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fixing to Fix It  &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/111/111780/D2_DOC.gif""&gt;Image Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have another update inbound. Destiny Player Support is here to tell you when your bits are scheduled to arrive and what you need to know about the upcoming patch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is their report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Update 1.2.1 Release&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Destiny 2 services will undergo maintenance on Tuesday, May 29, 2018. No downtime is expected. During this time, Destiny 2 Update 1.2.1 will become available to players. Please see below for the timeline of the maintenance window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;9 a.m. PDT (1600 UTC) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Destiny 2 server maintenance is scheduled to begin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No downtime is expected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Destiny 2 Update 1.2.1 will be available to download and install&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 p.m. PDT (2000 UTC) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Destiny 2 server maintenance is scheduled to conclude&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Players who have not installed Update 1.2.1 will be removed from activities to begin the download and install process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Patch Note Preview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a quick overview of issues that should be resolved in Destiny Update 1.2.1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixed an issue where players would lose Glory Rank Points for leaving a match too soon after the match ends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixed an issue where the Clan XP Milestone was not granting a powerful reward&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixed an issue where Vanguard Boons would block progression of strike-specific quest steps and milestones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixed an issue where Shriekers would close too quickly during Warsat public events, thus blocking players’ ability to trigger a Heroic public event&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixed an issue where Calus’s shields required too much damage to break after Destiny Update 1.2.0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixed an issue where players would experience long load times for Iron Banner matches on PC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full patch notes will be made available on Tuesday, May 29. Stay tuned to&lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/bungie""&gt; @Bungie&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter for further announcements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bungie.net API Issue: Item Equip Currently Disabled&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, we identified an issue where players could reach 385 Power within a short amount of time if characters had no items equipped in their weapon inventories. Characters could enter this state only by using the item equip functionality available through the Bungie.net API. As such, the ability to equip or unequip items through the API has been disabled until we can resolve the issue. While players may still transfer items from character to character, any item that is equipped will need to be unequipped within Destiny 2 before it can be transferred using the Destiny Companion App or any third-party application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to equip items is one of the most used features available through the API, and the decision to disable this functionality was not made without our weighing the impact it would have on the community. To preserve the meaning behind reaching max Power, we decided that this action needed to be taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a solution to this issue has been identified, we will provide updates on when to expect a hotfix that will allow us to enable these features once more. Stay tuned to &lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/BungieHelp""&gt;@BungieHelp&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter for updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time for our Movie of the Week. This is a recurring segment where we find cool videos that the community has made and award their creators with a special emblem, the Lens of Fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitch Master Scott wanted me to let you know that we have set up a Discord server that is attached to our Twitch account. We’re not using it for messaging; there are plenty of Destiny 2 communities for you to seek out on Discord. We wanted to ensure any subscribers who are supporting the Bungie Foundation can use our Twitch emotes while on Discord.

This week at Bungie, we lit the Iron Banner again.


Iron Banner 6v6 is back for Season 3. To celebrate its return, we added a reprised version of the Bannerfall map to the playlist. This was another fan favorite we brought forward by popular demand. It will be available in the Iron Banner playlist until the next reset, when it will become available in Quick Play, Competitive, and Private Matches for all players of*&amp;nbsp;Destiny 2*. You also might see it in Trials this weekend, but we’ll know that for sure tomorrow!

##**Hive Annihilation **

Escalation Protocol has been live for two weeks now. Ever since the launch of *Warmind*, we’ve seen Guardians bravely battling hordes of Hive on Mars. The bravest among you have gone on to defeat seven levels of bosses. As always, combat leads to feedback. Today, we’re responding to a popular request for new matchmaking systems that would unite nine players in battle. **Lead Designer Jacob Benton** has some comments about this new activity in Destiny.


**What were the design goals for Escalation Protocol?**


&gt;
&gt;**Jacob**: Escalation Protocol was designed to be a high-difficulty endgame activity for a max-level, three-player fireteam. Other players in the world can contribute to make it easier, but they shouldn’t be required as long as your team is highly skilled and coordinated. We have received a lot of feedback since the original launch of *Destiny 2* that players felt like reaching max Power was not satisfying. There weren’t enough activities that required and rewarded that level of commitment. Escalation Protocol was designed to fill that gap.


**So this activity was not specifically designed for nine players?**


&gt;
&gt;Other than Raid Activities, all PvE activities and private spaces are optimized for three players to allow for multiple types of activities in the space. So no, it wasn’t designed for it, but it’s not a surprise that it’s easier with nine players, given how under-leveled most of us are right now. We knew that players would use the same creative workarounds to get nine players into a space similar to Court of Oryx, but we did not specifically tune the difficulty around requiring that many players.


**Any plans to enable larger fireteams in the future?**


&gt;
&gt;We’ve had a lot of conversations here about what to do to answer the community’s feedback. We’re going to continue to monitor as more players progress up to max Power and are able to attempt Escalation Protocol at the difficulty it was designed for and we’ll determine what, if any action, is necessary. We also hear players are really enjoying large groups of players fighting against enemies, so we’ll use that feedback to inform our future plans.

##**Armor Updates**

We kicked off the beginning of Season 3 with changes to Exotic Weapons. “What about the armor?” has been a popular question. Today, we’re going to start answering it. This is the first wave of changes—the next are currently slated to come in [July](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/46871). **Sandbox Designer Victor Anderson** has the facts on what you can expect on May 29. 


&gt;
&gt;**Victor**: We’ve received a lot of feedback on Exotic Armor in *Destiny* 2. With 1.2.0, we introduced changes to Exotic Weapons to make them punchier and more compelling, and with the 1.2.1 release, we're taking steps to update some of the existing Exotic Armor.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;It’s my hope that the changes to Exotic Armor will result in more interesting choices, whether you're doing a strike or going for wins in the Crucible. When deciding to update the Exotic perks, our goal was to keep the identity of the Exotics the same, even if the way they influence your playstyle is slightly different.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;With the release of 1.2.1, we’re updating six pieces of Exotic Armor, two for each class, and we will be updating more in the future. Please note that any mechanical changes are in addition to the already established effects unless explicitly stated otherwise.


&gt;
&gt;###Titan
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* **Synthoceps**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   * Mechanical Changes—Previously, the perk adjusted your melee damage depending on the number of enemies surrounding you. Now it grants a flat bonus to melee and Super damage when you’re surrounded by three or more enemies. The buff is retained for a short duration after you are no longer surrounded.
&gt;   * Although Synthoceps has gotten a fair bit of love in the Crucible, players are often focused on the increased lunge rate. The outgoing damage bonus was hard to appreciate and plan around with it being so variable in nature. With this change, you will be able to feel the impact more often in all scenarios, particularly in PvE.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* **Lion Rampant**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   * Mechanical Changes—You can hipfire while Lift is active without interrupting it, and your aerial hipfire doesn't have an aerial accuracy penalty.
&gt;   * The Lion Rampant was focused around Lift and how it impacts your playstyle and tactics, so we decided to push further in that direction, emphasizing fast moving aerial assault.
&gt;
&gt;###Hunter
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* **The Dragon’s Shadow**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   * Mechanical Changes—Dodging reloads all weapons simultaneously. The effects of Wraithmetal Mail now also include a bonus to mobility.
&gt;   * Although the Dragon’s Shadow does have a small following, we wanted to make it more useful in a general sense under even neutral conditions, while keeping in the theme of a fast-moving ninja.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* **Mechaneer’s Tricksleeves**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   * Mechanical Changes—Swapping to a sidearm while critically wounded greatly increases its damage.
&gt;   * We went for the fantasy of a holdout weapon; the pistol tucked into your sleeve that you pull out in an emergency to save you. These changes should let you turn around a fight more easily.
&gt;
&gt;###Warlock
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* **Lunafaction Boots**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   * Mechanical Changes—Rift reload is automatic instead of being activated on entry/exit. Empowering Rift makes weapons more effective at extended ranges.
&gt;   * Players having to dip in and out of the Rift to reload their weapons was not consistent with other Rift effects, particularly with the overshield effect on Healing Rift. It’s been made automatic to be easier to understand and use. As this is a more offensive choice in terms of Rift Exotics, we also wanted to further reward players who want to double down with Empowering Rift instead of playing it safe with Healing Rift. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* **Sunbracers**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   * Mechanical Changes—Original effect replaced with: Increases the duration of Solar Grenades. Solar melee kills grant unlimited Solar Grenade energy for a brief time.
&gt;   * While effective under some circumstances in terms of things like flat damage output with your Solar Grenade, Sunbracers didn’t feel flashy enough for gloves where your hands are perpetually on fire. So, while retaining the original flavor of “The Solar Grenade Exotic Armor,” we’ve scaled up the potential output significantly to give the player a strong taste of power on a more frequent basis.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* Fixed an issue where Vanguard Boons would block progression of strike-specific quest steps and milestones
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* Fixed an issue where Shriekers would close too quickly during Warsat public events, thus blocking players’ ability to trigger a Heroic public event
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* Fixed an issue where Calus’s shields required too much damage to break after Destiny Update 1.2.0
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;###**Bungie.net API Issue: Item Equip Currently Disabled**
&gt;
&gt;This week, we identified an issue where players could reach 385 Power within a short amount of time if characters had no items equipped in their weapon inventories. Characters could enter this state only by using the item equip functionality available through the Bungie.net API. As such, the ability to equip or unequip items through the API has been disabled until we can resolve the issue. While players may still transfer items from character to character, any item that is equipped will need to be unequipped within Destiny 2 before it can be transferred using the Destiny Companion App or any third-party application.
&gt;
&gt;The ability to equip items is one of the most used features available through the API, and the decision to disable this functionality was not made without our weighing the impact it would have on the community. To preserve the meaning behind reaching max Power, we decided that this action needed to be taken.
&gt;
&gt;Once a solution to this issue has been identified, we will provide updates on when to expect a hotfix that will allow us to enable these features once more. Stay tuned to [@BungieHelp](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp) on Twitter for updates.

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week at Bungie, we lit the Iron Banner again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iron Banner 6v6 is back for Season 3. To celebrate its return, we added a reprised version of the Bannerfall map to the playlist. This was another fan favorite we brought forward by popular demand. It will be available in the Iron Banner playlist until the next reset, when it will become available in Quick Play, Competitive, and Private Matches for all players of&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;. You also might see it in Trials this weekend, but we’ll know that for sure tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/111/111780/IronBannerS3.jpg""&gt;Image Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hive Annihilation &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Escalation Protocol has been live for two weeks now. Ever since the launch of &lt;em&gt;Warmind&lt;/em&gt;, we’ve seen Guardians bravely battling hordes of Hive on Mars. The bravest among you have gone on to defeat seven levels of bosses. As always, combat leads to feedback. Today, we’re responding to a popular request for new matchmaking systems that would unite nine players in battle. &lt;strong&gt;Lead Designer Jacob Benton&lt;/strong&gt; has some comments about this new activity in Destiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were the design goals for Escalation Protocol?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jacob&lt;/strong&gt;: Escalation Protocol was designed to be a high-difficulty endgame activity for a max-level, three-player fireteam. Other players in the world can contribute to make it easier, but they shouldn’t be required as long as your team is highly skilled and coordinated. We have received a lot of feedback since the original launch of &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; that players felt like reaching max Power was not satisfying. There weren’t enough activities that required and rewarded that level of commitment. Escalation Protocol was designed to fill that gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So this activity was not specifically designed for nine players?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than Raid Activities, all PvE activities and private spaces are optimized for three players to allow for multiple types of activities in the space. So no, it wasn’t designed for it, but it’s not a surprise that it’s easier with nine players, given how under-leveled most of us are right now. We knew that players would use the same creative workarounds to get nine players into a space similar to Court of Oryx, but we did not specifically tune the difficulty around requiring that many players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any plans to enable larger fireteams in the future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve had a lot of conversations here about what to do to answer the community’s feedback. We’re going to continue to monitor as more players progress up to max Power and are able to attempt Escalation Protocol at the difficulty it was designed for and we’ll determine what, if any action, is necessary. We also hear players are really enjoying large groups of players fighting against enemies, so we’ll use that feedback to inform our future plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armor Updates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We kicked off the beginning of Season 3 with changes to Exotic Weapons. “What about the armor?” has been a popular question. Today, we’re going to start answering it. This is the first wave of changes—the next are currently slated to come in &lt;a href=""https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/46871""&gt;July&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Sandbox Designer Victor Anderson&lt;/strong&gt; has the facts on what you can expect on May 29. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Victor&lt;/strong&gt;: We’ve received a lot of feedback on Exotic Armor in &lt;em&gt;Destiny&lt;/em&gt; 2. With 1.2.0, we introduced changes to Exotic Weapons to make them punchier and more compelling, and with the 1.2.1 release, we&amp;#39;re taking steps to update some of the existing Exotic Armor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s my hope that the changes to Exotic Armor will result in more interesting choices, whether you&amp;#39;re doing a strike or going for wins in the Crucible. When deciding to update the Exotic perks, our goal was to keep the identity of the Exotics the same, even if the way they influence your playstyle is slightly different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the release of 1.2.1, we’re updating six pieces of Exotic Armor, two for each class, and we will be updating more in the future. Please note that any mechanical changes are in addition to the already established effects unless explicitly stated otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Titan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synthoceps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanical Changes—Previously, the perk adjusted your melee damage depending on the number of enemies surrounding you. Now it grants a flat bonus to melee and Super damage when you’re surrounded by three or more enemies. The buff is retained for a short duration after you are no longer surrounded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although Synthoceps has gotten a fair bit of love in the Crucible, players are often focused on the increased lunge rate. The outgoing damage bonus was hard to appreciate and plan around with it being so variable in nature. With this change, you will be able to feel the impact more often in all scenarios, particularly in PvE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lion Rampant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanical Changes—You can hipfire while Lift is active without interrupting it, and your aerial hipfire doesn&amp;#39;t have an aerial accuracy penalty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Lion Rampant was focused around Lift and how it impacts your playstyle and tactics, so we decided to push further in that direction, emphasizing fast moving aerial assault.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Hunter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Dragon’s Shadow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanical Changes—Dodging reloads all weapons simultaneously. The effects of Wraithmetal Mail now also include a bonus to mobility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although the Dragon’s Shadow does have a small following, we wanted to make it more useful in a general sense under even neutral conditions, while keeping in the theme of a fast-moving ninja.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechaneer’s Tricksleeves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanical Changes—Swapping to a sidearm while critically wounded greatly increases its damage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We went for the fantasy of a holdout weapon; the pistol tucked into your sleeve that you pull out in an emergency to save you. These changes should let you turn around a fight more easily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Warlock&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lunafaction Boots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanical Changes—Rift reload is automatic instead of being activated on entry/exit. Empowering Rift makes weapons more effective at extended ranges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Players having to dip in and out of the Rift to reload their weapons was not consistent with other Rift effects, particularly with the overshield effect on Healing Rift. It’s been made automatic to be easier to understand and use. As this is a more offensive choice in terms of Rift Exotics, we also wanted to further reward players who want to double down with Empowering Rift instead of playing it safe with Healing Rift. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunbracers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanical Changes—Original effect replaced with: Increases the duration of Solar Grenades. Solar melee kills grant unlimited Solar Grenade energy for a brief time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While effective under some circumstances in terms of things like flat damage output with your Solar Grenade, Sunbracers didn’t feel flashy enough for gloves where your hands are perpetually on fire. So, while retaining the original flavor of “The Solar Grenade Exotic Armor,” we’ve scaled up the potential output significantly to give the player a strong taste of power on a more frequent basis.&lt;/li&gt;

,u_DisruptEDTv,"# A Moment with Ted Dintersmith-Part II

By Richard W. Allen, Ed.S.

[Ted Dintersmith](https://i.redd.it/ngnnrvkrctz01.jpg)

Ted Dintersmith\-Author, Speaker &amp; Consultant

After receiving a tremendous response from the first article, A Moment with Ted Dintersmith, I took the chance to reach out to Ted to see if he could answer a few more question for DisruptED TV Magazine. To my delight, he was game! I again reached out to some of our talented educators to give them the opportunity to ask Ted some questions that were on their mind.

But first, I started with a question of my own after reading What School Could Be. I had endorsed the book as a summer reading suggestion for teachers, and I wondered if he “had any resources that might be of use for a school or district that wants to use the book this summer?”

**Ted:** “Great question. We have a fabulous summer reading discussion guide My publisher, Princeton University Press, is offering bulk discounts. And we’ll make the film Most Likely to Succeed available for free this summer to any group reading WSCB. The book’s many examples of remarkable teacher\-led innovations naturally encourages schools to think of their own innovations that have proven successful. If you want a faculty to start the 2018–2019 school year on an upbeat note, this book will do that!”

What follows are some thoughtful questions posed by a few leaders in education, and the insightful responses from Ted Dintersmith.

**Dr. Brian Chinni \-CEO/Founder of TMI Education**

Brian Chinni @drbpchinni\_TMI asked, “I enthusiastically share in your educational philosophy, vision and mission, and given so, I have spent nearly 30 years in the profession striving to realize this vision. I have learned that this is a societal responsibility, one that extends beyond the scope and influence of our educators. To this end, how might we as a society realize an educational system that reflects the attributes of the case studies portrayed in your works?”

**Ted:** “In What School Could Be I write about great initiatives being done to mobilize far more allies in support of the innovations many teachers are itching to move forward with. Each spring, the entire Pittsburgh community comes together for Remake Learning Days, celebrating great teacher\-led advances in ways that the entire community appreciates. In Cedar Rapids, they carried out this brilliant initiative they called the “Billy Madison project,” getting 65 community leaders to come in for a Saturday and experience, from 7:45 am until 3:30 pm, the exact same experience students have all week. And, boy, those community leaders sprung into action in support of teacher\-led innovations. Atlanta’s LAB ATL program brings students from schools all across the city to a semester\-long experience where students work together in teams to take on important community challenges — and in turn let leaders across the city see the how much potential could be unleashed among students and teachers when they attack problems they care about and are trusted to design the learning experience. I think each community, though, needs to step up and support our teachers. We non\-educators need to support and trust our teachers, and rally collaborative energy around a challenge that, IMHO, is every bit as important to the future of our country as fighting in World War II for the future of the free world.”

**Principal Jay Billy**

Jay Billy @JayBilly2 asked, “What would you say should be the first big step to changing schools and re\-defining what education should be?”

**Ted:** “I’m convinced that not much happens until the school community becomes convinced that there’s real urgency in re\-imagining school, and gets excited about the possibilities. Our Innovation Playlist offers resources to energize your community, and encourages schools to draw on Sir Ken Robinson’s epic TED Talk Prince EA’s short video “I Sued the School System” \(with 250,000,000 views!\), and the Sundance\-acclaimed documentary Most Likely to Succeed Every school has change agents and if they can rally the community broadly, they will unleash lots of pent\-up innovation among the teaching force, and help kids find their gifts and potential.”

**Principal Rich Hayzler**

Rich Hayzler @RichHayzler asked, “Having a growth mindset is a critical attribute to creating schools of innovation and curiosity. What advice do you have for teachers and administrators on how the “growth mindset” can be embraced by students and their parents?”

**Ted**: “I’d start with assessments. If a child turns in an assignment and gets a poor grade, can they persevere to improve it? Is their assessment for a class based on a weighted average of scores, or based on the ultimate level of accomplishment they attain? It’s easy to say, “We want kids to develop a growth mindset,” but it’s important to back it up with challenges structured to foster a ‘don’t stop until you’re proud of your work” mindset.”

**Assistant Superintendent Kris Felicello**

Kris Felicello @KFelicello asked, “What suggestions do you have for teacher development programs that would ensure our field is moving in the right direction?”

**Ted**: “When I meet with teachers, they often tell me that their training isn’t what it needs to be. If we want teachers to bring their students more compelling learning challenges, we need to give them the right support — which sure shouldn’t be in the form of boring lecture courses or videos. If the single most important challenge in American education is how to transform an existing school, then we need to offer educators the resources to help them effect positive change.”

**Dr. Robert “Bob” Price \-President Elect LearningForward NJ**

Dr. Robert Price @edefender2061 asked, “If you had the power to make one structural change to our existing system, what would it be?

**Ted**: “K12 education would change rapidly if college admissions officers started to review authentic samples of student work, instead of numbers that are at best loosely\-correlated to some ability to do, down the road, something of consequence. Imagine if 100 top colleges all announced, “We no longer care about grades and test scores. Send us examples of your very best work, letters of recommendation, and explain to us challenges you’ve faced that required you to persevere to make a positive contribution. That’s what we care about, because that’s what matters in life.” In What School Could Be, I write about how the U.S. Naval Academy transformed the admissions process, and all of the positives that came of it. It’s not acceptable to keep pushing millions of K12 kids to do obsolete or irrelevant things just to make life a bit more convenient for admissions offices.”

**Superintendent Glenn Robbins**

Glen Robbins @Glenn1809 asked, “After all your research and travels, did you ever consider starting and funding your own school where you could put your theories into practice?”

**Ted**: “No. While starting a school requires lots of effort, I think many people — given the resources and a clean slate — can start a great new school. The biggest challenge in American education is helping existing schools make informed progress. That’s been the focus of my work. There are 137,000 existing schools in our country. If we can’t help them advance, in significant ways and fairly quickly, we’ll be leaving millions of kids vulnerable in a world of innovation. Machine intelligence is accelerating. Other countries are taking education re\-imagination seriously. So while I applaud anyone who takes on starting a new school, I’m doing my best to help existing schools, since that’s where the kids are.”

**Laura Robb Teacher, Author, Speaker and Author**

Laura Robb @LRobbTeacher asked, “Can you expand on your quote, ‘Life is an unbroken series of complex problems. Dealing with it is nothing like filling in the bubbles of a standardized test.’ \(Dintersmith\)? Why do you feel that states tie standardized testing to teacher evaluation? What specific changes do you feel must happen in this area?”

**Ted**: “ Well, as I’m sure you know, these state\-mandated tests are the dregs of our education system. The states have very limited budgets and need to administer these tests frequently and cheaply, to lots of kids. So you get what you don’t pay for. I encourage people, particularly legislators, to look at the questions on these tests. Many are nonsensical. Yet we hold teachers accountable on these ill\-designed tests — which by the way are often administered in ways that give students no incentive to perform well. Even worse, the teacher gets no feedback from the test that might help improve teaching practice. This accountability approach is shameful and should be ended tomorrow. But, tragically, it’s easy to find education ‘experts’ who say, thoughtlessly, “We have to be able to measure it,” or “We have to use the data that’s available.” So we place high stakes on low\-level flawed tests, and wonder why so many students are bored and not learning, and so many teachers are demoralized.”

**Ted Dintersmith** @dintersmith is a successful venture capitalist and father of two who devotes most of his time and energy to education\-related initiatives. Ted calls for a radical re\-imaging of what and how students learn. Instead of classrooms in which kids learn passively, Ted believes the American educational system should be re\-imagined into cross\-disciplinary programs that allow kids the freedom to develop core competencies through cross\-disciplinary, project\-based learning.

,Devilrp,"“Is the music really necessary?” *[Abigail](https://i.imgur.com/aqQI0ZW.jpg) asks her big brother as she lounges across the backseat of their GMC Sierra. She plays Pokémon on her 3DS, their truck parked on the isolated top floor of a DEVIL car garage, the window open.*

*Sitting out in the truckbed, [Hannibal](https://www.reddit.com/r/Devilrp/comments/7ygx9a/silas_jack_steiner_hannibal/), pushes the brim up on his cowboy hat. He sets the kitchen knife and India sharpening stone to the side. It joins an assortment of Hannibal’s fighting knives and Abby’s duller kitchen utensils.*

“It helps me focus, get in the *zone*,” *he says.*

“If you start going on about ‘ooh, the blade, so mystical, ain’t I cool?’ or other stupid junk, I’mma stop ya right there.” *She sticks out her tongue through the cabin’s back window.*

“You and what army?” *he asks, drying the oil off his hands with a rag.*

*Abby leans back and knocks on a terrarium of [Natashi](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VrS6akzR3sk/maxresdefault.jpg) sitting in the front passenger seat. It and its denizens were a [gift from Vadik](https://www.reddit.com/r/Devilrp/comments/8astdm/might_not_make_it/dx4eax9/).A moment later she’s holding her hand up for Hannibal to see through the window. A small parade of Natashi wave their arms at him.*

“This’n,” *Abby says proudly.*

*Hannibal suppresses a scoff.* “Fight me IRL, I ain’t changing my playlist.”

*Abby raps her Natashi-free hand at the window like an angry boxing cat.*

*He makes a point of ignoring her as he checks his phone and his bluetooth speakers. Ah yes, he loves this song. Perfect to tune up all the knives from home until their apartment block is cleared for return.*

*Abby huffs and sets her handful of spiders back in their terrarium to join their sisters.* “I’m sorry,” *she says. The spiders all collectively shrug and get back to doing adorable spider stuff. Abby just wishes they had somewhere else to go today but hang around DEVIL eating German food. This mask she’s wearing is itchy. But for now, all she can do is kick the Elite Four’s butts and prove herself a Pokémon master.*

*Hannibal goes back to sharpening knives to [smooth music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBVcxb_paYo).*

She plays Pokémon on her 3DS, their truck parked on the isolated top floor of a DEVIL car garage, the window open.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sitting out in the truckbed, &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Devilrp/comments/7ygx9a/silas_jack_steiner_hannibal/""&gt;Hannibal&lt;/a&gt;, pushes the brim up on his cowboy hat. He sets the kitchen knife and India sharpening stone to the side. It joins an assortment of Hannibal’s fighting knives and Abby’s duller kitchen utensils.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It helps me focus, get in the &lt;em&gt;zone&lt;/em&gt;,” &lt;em&gt;he says.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you start going on about ‘ooh, the blade, so mystical, ain’t I cool?’ or other stupid junk, I’mma stop ya right there.” &lt;em&gt;She sticks out her tongue through the cabin’s back window.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You and what army?” &lt;em&gt;he asks, drying the oil off his hands with a rag.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abby leans back and knocks on a terrarium of &lt;a href=""https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VrS6akzR3sk/maxresdefault.jpg""&gt;Natashi&lt;/a&gt; sitting in the front passenger seat. It and its denizens were a &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Devilrp/comments/8astdm/might_not_make_it/dx4eax9/""&gt;gift from Vadik&lt;/a&gt;.A moment later she’s holding her hand up for Hannibal to see through the window. A small parade of Natashi wave their arms at him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This’n,” &lt;em&gt;Abby says proudly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hannibal suppresses a scoff.&lt;/em&gt; “Fight me IRL, I ain’t changing my playlist.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abby raps her Natashi-free hand at the window like an angry boxing cat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He makes a point of ignoring her as he checks his phone and his bluetooth speakers. Ah yes, he loves this song. Perfect to tune up all the knives from home until their apartment block is cleared for return.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abby huffs and sets her handful of spiders back in their terrarium to join their sisters.&lt;/em&gt; “I’m sorry,” &lt;em&gt;she says. The spiders all collectively shrug and get back to doing adorable spider stuff. Abby just wishes they had somewhere else to go today but hang around DEVIL eating German food. This mask she’s wearing is itchy. But for now, all she can do is kick the Elite Four’s butts and prove herself a Pokémon master.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hannibal goes back to sharpening knives to &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBVcxb_paYo""&gt;smooth music&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,DestinyTheGame,"Title! I'm not here to rant per se, just wanted to lay out some thoughts I've been having on the game. For a little background info before I jump in, I played D1 quite a bit, and enjoyed raiding in the first two expansions. I didn't really enjoy TTK's raid, and I never played RoI. Come D2 launch, I was still pretty stoked, and played quite a bit until I hit the massive hole in the endgame. There was NOTHING to do. So, I shelved it. Fast forward to the launch of Warmind, and I thought I'd give it a whirl since I'd have two expansions to go through (I knew it would be short and sweet if it was anything like D1, and whoo boy it was).  


First off, I do agree with a lot of the post that float up to the top on this sub. Bungie really fucked up with D2, and what SHOULD have been basically a massive xpac to ditch the old systems became more of a half baked revamp that has potential, but that potential is still struggling to be realized. To that end,lets get on with the musings related to everything D2:

 - End game is STILL lacking. Destiny imo has always wanted to be a PvP centric MMO-lite game. To keep this spot on the list on the shorter side, I'll just say that they did cater a bit too much to casuals this time around, but that side of the game IS important. The majority of the playerbase resides on consoles, and most people don't have oodles of time to dedicate to the game per week. I think this is why so many people think fondly of D1. It didn't really have too great of an end game, but in since the raid weapons were SO good, and there was no vendor, you came back week after week; even if it was just to raid and log off. It gave the more casual players something to do that wasn't crazy in terms of time investment, and the more hardcore players grinded out strikes and whatever else looking for those god roll PvP weapons. moving forward, I think D2 needs to bring more balance to the game in that regard, it always seems to swing to one side or the other. 

 - PvP is still shit. I miss D1 PvP because it still rewarded well organized teams, but in casual you could just fuck off and do what you want. It was chaotic and fun. If you wanted to get sweaty, trials was there. If you must put in a comp. playlist, it should be solo. Trials should be THE place to go for group-centric competitive PvP. Have a monthly calendar or something so teams can see the upcoming map for the weekend, and keep the card system. Trials should ALSO have some sort of ranking. After each weekend, you elo would go up or down based on your card turns in, etc. Then the next weekend you would be fighting against people in your own division to get that flawless card. It would be a legit carrot to fight for, and a nice badge of skill to know if you're in the top 5% AND you got a flawless card. Aside from those problems, there are still others I could drone on about but I don't think I need too. People don't like the new power drops. People don't like not having a shotty and sniper available. Missing out on radar in comp. is really dumb. You guys made Halo, and it had some of the best and most consistent PvP, so you know how to do this. I think if you need to, bite the bullet and separate PvP and PvE guns. Maybe have a gunsmith who could build PvP guns or something, but you've gotta find a way to balance things so you can actually fine tune the sandbox there.

 - The power level curve is all sorts of fucked. Like I said earlier, Destiny imo is supposed to be an MMO-lite. So why on gods name does the best gear drop from almost anything every week, and then once it's gone good gear is nowhere to be found? Did you finish the story? Go do strikes for the first chunk of power. hit that softcap? Go do heroics now that you know the strikes well enough and you can have some fun with some broken modifiers (and YES, we want the FUN modifiers from the first game). Hit that softcap? Congrats, the exotic quests just opened up and it's time to raid to finish it all up and hit the cap. Exotic engrams should ALWAYS have the chance to drop higher than your current PL due to how rare they are, but they should also have a chance to drop current level as well. I would even argue that you could apply that system to ALL legendary engrams, but with a lower chance to get an upgrade the closer you are to cap. Players will still grind mindlessly, we just want something to show for it. Even if I only got ONE power level from grinding public events for 5-ish hours one week after capping my milestones, I'd still feel better than I do now. 

 - Exotics need to feel more exotic. You're already started on this, and hopefully the armor reworks will be good as well. If you're going to limit how many we can equip, they should be build defining. 

 - Armor and guns need more variation. I'm not sure if I am ready to jump back onto the total RNG platform in terms of guns, but they need something. Same goes for armor. You could have easily added in more creative mods so we could make really specalized builds. I think this is a problem rooted with PvP specifically, so again, I think it's time to bite the bullet, and split that gear grind away from the PvE sandbox. People LOVE cosmetics, and I enjoy being able to wear whatever I want, I just think the new system is a tad too shallow. We don't need a lake however. 

 - The new shader system is good in theory (don't downvote me to hell, pls), but every shader should be dumped into a collection that you can access from anywhere, and any shaders you get past the cap should just turn into glimmer automatically. You could still keep the rarity of some of the shaders in place there, and make people really think about what to use em on. and this way people can still color armor pieces separately as well.

 - The new mtx system is nice now that you've changed how it works. the main problems with it are still imo that you can't reroll ghost and sparrow perks. This is a triple A game with a pretty large playerbase. You don't need to try to be scummy to make a ton of profit off of those silver purchases. I would even suggest maaaybe changing Tess to a battlepass esque system, with challenges and whatnot so each season you can unlock some sick ass cosmetics by PLAYING the game, and you would get the full price of the pass upfront, so no harm no foul. I think the backlash to the Iron Banner emote shows this. I don't mind having stuff like that available for purchase, but if it is, there should be some other stuff available from the event mode to grind for or something. 

 - Last but not least, this community imo prefers LARGE expansions. Whole new zones, good new storylines, etc. You crated faction rallies, iron banner, sparrow racing holiday events and more to keep us interested during the slow times. Why are you still pushing out very shallow and terrible paid content updates? Stop with the season passes, and go to an expansion only model. I think the season passes are ruining the game, giving it way too much bad press, and putting too much pressure on the studio. 

 - And finally, stop with this old age attitude, thinking that if you DON'T give people MM for harder stuff, it'll be a better place. It's not. and half of the people I group up with to raid or do anything else, I never speak to again. I'm sure it's like that for a majority of the playerbase. It's not that I don't want too, but making genuine connections that persist after one session together? It's pretty fuckin' rare. Stop trying to paint that bright picture as the reason you don't want to have MM. Or at the very least, remove the stupid ticket system for guided games. I still think there should be no MM for raids and trials, but nightfalls, escalation protocol (coughcough) should 100% have it.  


I think that's it!

,spotify,"- you can't filter, so you just have to scroll through the 2000+ songs in playlist and look for the specific one you want to play or remove

- it has giant icons you have to scroll down super far to see all of. This takes up way too much space

- there's a whole tab dedicated to premium, and it's right where the library tab used to be. r/assholedesign anyone?

- the songs are located in a ""favorite songs"" playlist rather than their own tab...

- ...which makes no sense, because now you ""like"" both artists and songs, which not only is misleading as to what it does when you follow artists, but also inconsistent: liking artists puts them in a tab, and liking songs puts them in a playlist

- the albums tab doesn't list all of your albums, prioritizing recommendations (thanks to u/dogeisoverlord)

- there's a whole fucking bunch of open space that just needlessly takes up my damn screen

- in order to do anything with a song, album, etc. in search, you have to tap on it and go to its page, instead of just tapping the ... button

- adding on from the last point, you can't add albums to playlists anymore - you have to go to each individual song and add them (thanks to u/patagonian_pegasus)

- the currently playing screen is the worst thing about this update. I love the new buttons, but why does the album cover take up the whole screen like in Google Play Music? This was a thing I really disliked about GPM, and a big part of the culture of Spotify is sharing screenshots of the song you're listening to, which you can clearly see because the cover is small and the title is right underneath it. Also makes it much easier to look at, as you only need to focus your vision in on one small part of the screen. Now, it's all over the place. The cover also has this ugly grey filter over it which takes away from the art and makes it harder to see. Why?

- adding on from the last point, Behinds the Lyrics by Genius is also broken by this (thanks to u/tropicalmonkey)

- the blue shuffle icons don't match the color scheme of the app and are super ugly

- the ""create"" button pushes all the things I actually care about, my playlists, down, and needlessly takes up a quarter of the screen with its giant size and huge amount of empty space surrounding it. Looking at a much better app design style, Material Design has buttons like this in small circles in the bottom right hand corner that overlay everything else, taking up literally no space

- it's now much harder to view one's own profile, which is absolutely awful

- you can't see the length, by time or track count, of playlists anymore

- podcasts have been murdered brutally, as it doesn't sort them by newest episodes and you can't download them anymore

- it doesn't save your place anymore, so leaving it alone for too long makes the now playing bar disappear. So I have to make it shuffle again, giving it the chance of playing a song it's already played - a crucial part of making sure the already bad shuffle is slightly less terrible. Why don't they fix the shuffle algorithm, instead of removing features?

- the queue is gone (thanks to u/takedown1555)

- there appears to be no way to shuffle play when you have the ability to just ""play"" (from the web player and controlling on my phone, or, I assume, premium)

- the browse and radio functions are straight up gone things many people used to listen to new music without having to go searching. All in favor of that fucking premium tab

- some users are having playlists mixed and some are disappearing

- ordering of search an artist pages are a fuckin' mess

- some users' artists tabs have gone blank (thanks to u/tom56)

Small list of things I DO like:

- Settings is now located in the home tab rather than the library tab, which just makes a whole lot more sense

- the buttons in currently playing are nice

- the search tab, before you actually search for something, is really nice

Who the Hell designed this? It's ugly and messy and takes up too much space and is super unintuitive. I almost want to stop using Spotify now, it's that inconvenient. Especially the filter thing. If you agree, make your voice heard. Give bad app store reviews, send out emails, rant on social media (especially Twitter).

EDIT: Thanks to u/toastpaint for gold!",,False,,1,False,The new update is fucking awful,[],,False,6.0,,0.0,,,False,t3_8ldrnr,,dark,,,public,688.0,,{},,,False,[],,False,,,{},,,688,,,,self,1527192068.0,,[],,,True,,1527053146.0,text,6.0,,,text,self.spotify,,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;you can&amp;#39;t filter, so you just have to scroll through the 2000+ songs in playlist and look for the specific one you want to play or remove&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;it has giant icons you have to scroll down super far to see all of. This takes up way too much space&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;there&amp;#39;s a whole tab dedicated to premium, and it&amp;#39;s right where the library tab used to be. &lt;a href=""/r/assholedesign""&gt;r/assholedesign&lt;/a&gt; anyone?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the songs are located in a &amp;quot;favorite songs&amp;quot; playlist rather than their own tab...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;...which makes no sense, because now you &amp;quot;like&amp;quot; both artists and songs, which not only is misleading as to what it does when you follow artists, but also inconsistent: liking artists puts them in a tab, and liking songs puts them in a playlist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the albums tab doesn&amp;#39;t list all of your albums, prioritizing recommendations (thanks to &lt;a href=""/u/dogeisoverlord""&gt;u/dogeisoverlord&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;there&amp;#39;s a whole fucking bunch of open space that just needlessly takes up my damn screen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;in order to do anything with a song, album, etc. in search, you have to tap on it and go to its page, instead of just tapping the ... button&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;adding on from the last point, you can&amp;#39;t add albums to playlists anymore - you have to go to each individual song and add them (thanks to &lt;a href=""/u/patagonian_pegasus""&gt;u/patagonian_pegasus&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the currently playing screen is the worst thing about this update. I love the new buttons, but why does the album cover take up the whole screen like in Google Play Music? This was a thing I really disliked about GPM, and a big part of the culture of Spotify is sharing screenshots of the song you&amp;#39;re listening to, which you can clearly see because the cover is small and the title is right underneath it. Also makes it much easier to look at, as you only need to focus your vision in on one small part of the screen. Now, it&amp;#39;s all over the place. The cover also has this ugly grey filter over it which takes away from the art and makes it harder to see. Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;adding on from the last point, Behinds the Lyrics by Genius is also broken by this (thanks to &lt;a href=""/u/tropicalmonkey""&gt;u/tropicalmonkey&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the blue shuffle icons don&amp;#39;t match the color scheme of the app and are super ugly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the &amp;quot;create&amp;quot; button pushes all the things I actually care about, my playlists, down, and needlessly takes up a quarter of the screen with its giant size and huge amount of empty space surrounding it. Looking at a much better app design style, Material Design has buttons like this in small circles in the bottom right hand corner that overlay everything else, taking up literally no space&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;it&amp;#39;s now much harder to view one&amp;#39;s own profile, which is absolutely awful&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;you can&amp;#39;t see the length, by time or track count, of playlists anymore&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;podcasts have been murdered brutally, as it doesn&amp;#39;t sort them by newest episodes and you can&amp;#39;t download them anymore&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

,KibouPortal,"Theintra wasn't the kind of planet one would visit for leisure or business.    
It wouldn't be a place for scoundrels to hide a base of operations or raw material meant to flow in the galactic black market.  
Theintra was an isolated planet located in a binary star system and it spun irregularly due to the two massive stars that served as sustenance. The massive gravity on the system was such that only few planetoids or asteroids could exist. Theintra was the only exception, but that came with harsh consequences that made the whole planet inhabitable or even unstable.  
The sky which should easily be bright thanks to the suns it orbited, was actually pitch black.  
Plasma storms rushed everywhere, covering the lands in eternal darkness. It would rain lightning and acid. To top it all off, gravity was at least 3 times harsher than in most planets she had been. Landing her ship had almost turned into a suicide mission.  
But Samantha had no choice.  
He was there, and he was waiting on a cliff with his arms behind his back.  
The dreaded leader of the Orion Space Pirates.  
  
""Well, well, well."" He greeted her once she was at least 20 feet away from him, turning towards her in a dramatic fashion. He wore a protective black armor with discreet highlights in purple and red. Unlike the armor she had packed, which served more of a life suit and an all around shield for tougher enemies, his was more closer to light padding. He lacked his typical cape flowing behind, replacing it for a helmet shaped like the head of a dragon. Figures, she thought, that he would find a way to keep himself 'fashionable' despite the harsh weather. ""Look who finally has come to blow the shit out of this planet. I hope you like my choice of location; there is a lot of lithium scattered around and with enough force you could blow this place in smithereens, just like every single *other* planet you go to save or something.""    
""Scott, I've-"" she took a step forward, glaring behind her helmet. He interrupted her speech and advances by lifting his palm at her.  
""Rigel. The name is Rigel now and you know it. As a matter of fact, I've heard the rumors of your accomplishments Sammy. Or should I call you *Red Garnet*?"" She felt a pit on her stomach. It wasn't the fact that she was being called out on her method of sustenance but rather that he was well aware of what she was doing. Had his network gotten bigger during his absence? There was no question that whatever had happened while she was also in stasis had tilted the tides in his favor. ""How original. A legendary bounty hunter that gets the toughest jobs in the galaxy that nobody wants to deal with and is cold, precise and highly marketable. It even sounds familiar.""  
  
Samantha felt like she had to make a move. The planet's distant rumbling and cracking also added to her needs to do so, and yet her opponent remained calm.   
For a moment she paused her thoughts and concentrated better on his demeanor noticing something different about his approach towards her.    
He was as boastful as ever, his levels of flamboyancy have perhaps been incremented slightly more from the last time she took him face to face and she could only imagine what he looked like under his own helmet.    
It was on another system, perhaps some 10 lightyears away, when she faced him head on. Back when she was a confused runaway cadet who fled to the stars to find her long lost sibling who shared Mayor Tom's fate and vanished just when his crew were reaching the rims of the Solar System.  
After gathering enough hints of his whereabouts and ways to reach him, she found him as a commanding a group of space pirates who had their sights on Earth for a while. Apparently, his brother's comments on the planet to their High Command made them interested on what they had to offer and had given him the task to take over.  
In the end, as it would be deemed for these sort of scenarios, she had to take him down to protect the place she still called home.    
That was 30 years ago.  
He must have survived somehow or he was resurrected thanks to the cyber system that coursed through their veins, thus confirming the sad decision of placing herself in stasis to recover energy, youth and condition to find him and finish him off properly.  
  
But he too had changed.  
It wasn't just the experience of death, she concluded as she placed her left hand over a bracelet on her right wrist, nor his level of flamboyance that made her question if they had done something to his mind during the revival process or the simple fact that she did not sense him being afraid at all of the prospect of dying.  
  
""Can you feel it too?"" He asked, extending his hands to his sides. ""Perhaps you do but you can't see it yet. It is rather fascinating but, not recomended. Besides,"" Rigel shook his head and lowered his arms. He rose his right hand to tap the side of his helmet. ""you can't have these problems if you don't know what they are. ""    
""What are you talking about?"" Samantha frowned. A bolt of lightning flashed in the sky, glaring her view briefly. Battling in such a condition was going to be hard, and perhaps that was why he had chosen such a nightmare terrain. The rumbling made it hard to hear the other's words even if they came from the comlink she had established with him.  
""Ah, Sammy. Do you really want to know? This is not the first time we get to fight each other and I don't mean that time you killed me on the Moon. They did a mess trying to bring me back, put me in a stupid metal body..."" He shook his head and held his arms together, grunting. ""Wouldn't recommend it. Sure, it is easy to slaughter half of the population of a planet but what's the fun of that if you can't see it yourself and enjoy it?""  
  
Rigel began to walk towards his sibling. Samantha wasn't sure if the somewhat slow pace of his gait was because of the gravity or just to add more drama to the whole situation. She decided to remain in place, pressing a small button under her bracelet to activate it just in case she needed. An arm cannon would appear with a quick flick of her wrist, followed by some shots in case he would try to sucker punch her.  
But as he reached a mere distance of 3 feet, it didn't seem like he was interested in any of that.  
For the first time since she had returned, she could see the faint figure of his eyes behind the helmet that shielded him from the world around them and she froze at the intense yellow hue emanating from them.  
Some few blinks of his brought upon the characteristic that represented their siblinghood the best: his left eye turning an eerie mechanical red.   
She could feel her right eye react in response.  
  
""Do you really want to know what lies ahead of us? What will happen from now on and until we both die?"" The sudden lack of emotion in his voice put her in alert. She felt her right fist clench. ""What kind of bonds we really share? Here we are, in a desolated place with nobody to witness our encounter. This planet is yours to explode if you want and I'd rather have it so. I don't care. What you do with other things aren't that important, nor what you end up doing with my men. Some of them actually deserve their demise, and even if they didn't I'm at the point where I even ponder their value in this universe.""  
""What the fuck are you talking about?"" Samantha questioned angrily, grabbing him by the shoulder with her left arm. She had little to no time to deal with things like these and the planet was increasingly making it clear that it could collapse at any time. ""Just tell me already.""    
    
Placing his hand gently on her own, the Space Pirate leader smiled. But the smile faded, replaced with thoughtfulness.  
  
""You and I, here and now, are meant to fight forever and ever. We are part of a system that balances the universe. The Yin and Yang. Harmony and Chaos. Light and Darkness. As long as you live, so will I and we will dance in this macabre masquerade through Eternity if it must. But, this is not the first time we do that. Oh, no."" He pushed her hand away and pressed it onto her chest. With a swift move, he grabbed her right wrist tightly, giving her little time to react and strike back. ""It is not the first time we make this dance, Sammy. I've seen what lies in that kaleidoscope that remains far beyond our reach but is still accessible thanks to our connection to the Goddess of Machines. You see, when you die - or at least when our kind dies, I suppose. I have yet to test that and I am not ready to go through that again, thank you. - your consciousness gets released from all the bindings of this universe. The rules that previously held it down and in check are no longer valid and thus can in some ways 'ascend' to a level up to see what the other things below it are doing. But what if you could go up to a level where you could see *every* single iteration possible through this Kaleidoscope? Like the one where you have a Wyvern and I'm stuck in some Castle of Coincidences. Or another one where I'm too big to be featured in a game and yet *somehow* I'm still a final boss of some sort. Some may even go a bit back and flip things a bit where I'm leading in a different way and winning prizes for making incredible stories that I will possibly butcher in 2 or three more sequels. Sammy,"" he moved the hand pressing down her arm on her chest to lift her chin. ""Whether it is fate or just because the ones pulling the strings of our existence are too lazy to think of other things for us to do and enjoys rehashing old ideas that work, you and I will dance and dance this endless tune of ours trying to butcher each other and bring our demise. It's even changed my usual song playlist.""    
  
As soon as he finished his words, he let her sister go and stepped 6 feet away. He took an inviting stance, right arm behind his back and left hand extended at her.  
 
""Now then, my White Queen, may I invite you to this lightning dance?""

Or another one where I&amp;#39;m too big to be featured in a game and yet &lt;em&gt;somehow&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;#39;m still a final boss of some sort. Some may even go a bit back and flip things a bit where I&amp;#39;m leading in a different way and winning prizes for making incredible stories that I will possibly butcher in 2 or three more sequels. Sammy,&amp;quot; he moved the hand pressing down her arm on her chest to lift her chin. &amp;quot;Whether it is fate or just because the ones pulling the strings of our existence are too lazy to think of other things for us to do and enjoys rehashing old ideas that work, you and I will dance and dance this endless tune of ours trying to butcher each other and bring our demise. It&amp;#39;s even changed my usual song playlist.&amp;quot;    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as he finished his words, he let her sister go and stepped 6 feet away. He took an inviting stance, right arm behind his back and left hand extended at her.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now then, my White Queen, may I invite you to this lightning dance?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

,NBAlive,"I know many players, both beginners and veterans alike, have had their fair share of frustrations with NBA Live 18. The game is a decent re-entry as a competitor to 2K, but if it wants to compete, it will need address the many complains that fans have and add much more content. Luckily, for EA's sake, 2K has been dropping the ball for the past two installments, so there is a good chance to claim some consideration in the sub-genre, but like I said, a lot needs to be addressed.

So, here is the list:

1. **Less scripted animations**! This should be the first thing to be addressed! I can't count how many times that I wanted to alter the course of my shot or pass the ball mid-shot, but was unable to do to a scripted event, which almost ALWAYS led to a turnover or a block. This was very common while playing against star players with high block stats like LeBron or Davis. I am not sure if the stats actually affect my ability to make last second adjustments, but it is noticeable.
2. **Better ball physics**. This is just as important as fixing the scripted animations. I am 100% confident that anyone who has played even a single game has had the ball make contact with a teammate or opponent in any fashion, causing the ball to bounce off and travel an usually far distance, usually leading to a steal. 
3. **Better ""man"" tracking**. *sigh* I feel like I don't need to express this one. I think we are all too familiar with the last second adjustments that the game makes while we are on defense, forcing us to guard someone else just moments before they attempt to score. This needs to be fixed as soon as possible, possibly with this recent installment. What I would recommend is that there could be a ""floor general"" who directs the player to guard specific people, akin to what play-makers like Draymond or LeBron do when on the floor. This way, the player can have auditory clues as to who to guard and have time to react. My fourth point will also go more in depth to this.
4. **More decision making over the utilization of zone/junk defenses**. I really do mean this. This game has about 2-3 plays on defense that all pertain to man-to-man coverage. There NEEDS to be more options while on both ends of the floor, but defense should be a higher priority. I would like for the d-pad play a bigger role with specific buttons offering a different type of defense.There would be about 4 or 5 options that the computer generated coach would select before timeout expires. Player input can be added, so if the coach has a game plan that doesn't work for what the player is trying to do, the coach can have an explanation or a diagram of what the opposition has been doing on offense and defense and the player can choose a set of plays that will give them the advantage. These plays are based on multiple factors such as a star defender being in foul trouble early, trouble w/ perimeter or key shooters. and etc. There should also be the option to focus on a specific player to prevent him or her from getting or staying in rhythm. 
5. **Wider camera that can cover the whole floor...or at least scroll with the player**. I use the ESPN Broadcast camera, which I believe is the widest perspective out of the many that are in the game. I still have issues on defense in instances where I cannot completely see the man that I am supposed to be guarding, which almost always leads to a pass for an open shot. 
6. **MUCH more commentary**. I am tired of hearing the same generic commentary for every single game! UHHH! Like, I will never understand why no one ever thought about recording commentary from the NBA games and then place them into the game.  Also, I would like for commentators to point out career milestones for players.When I was playing in The League, my character broke Wilt Chamberlain's record for the most points in a single season by a rookie while breaking the single game record for the most steals. Both were not even recognized. 
7. **Stamina should play a HUGE factor in player performance**. I think that this should also be a immediate change that should be made. Stamina in this game doesn't reflect real life. There should be consequences to utilizing so much energy. The three things that I feel should be added are an increase chance of injury, stamina penalties in the next game, and the decrease in ability to push off or move/create through the space of the floor. This would ultimately have an impact on your shot and overall athleticism, which would obviously force players to more aware about their play style. Another thing would be to simulated practices that can be used in The League and Franchise. These would allow the player temporary boosts to stats that they may lack in. If the player practices often in a particular stats, he/she can receive a permanent boost.Too many practices can eventually wear down the player to the point where they can face the three consequences mentioned previously.
8. **More control as a GM in Franchise Mode + Trade Finder**! I really would like to feel as if I have more influence and impact as a GM. I know many of you guys do too. I want to be able to move my team, schedule team practices, and other responsibilities that comes with being in this position. I really want to be aware of all of the nuances that comes with the job, including financial balancing, maintaining morale, and etc. 2K has been doing this on a much smaller scale, which is not to say that doing so is bad thing by any means, but what I am trying to say is that there is a lot that can be expanded upon in a sport's franchise mode. Also, please...please add a trade finder to the game! I have given up on continuing with my franchise because of the trading system. It is practically impossible to make quality trades. Just do it!
9. **New Modes and more content to pre-existing modes**: Ultimate Team needs to be expanded upon. There is a lot of room for improvement. Same goes for the pick up games. I would like to be able to have a vote as to what the match number will be. If that is too much of a hassle, allow the host of the lobby to select the number. I would also like to see a mode where servers are made for players who want to use their created character and try out for the league. Existing players will not be in this league, only created characters. The league will have a schedule and practices as well. I am not sure if having coaches should be a thing for obvious reasons, but it could be an interesting dynamic if done appropriately. It could also be interesting to have online commentators calling the games. I would think the only way to get quality people to do something like this is if they are benefit in some form or given a load of in game currency to buy items with or something. 
10. **Updated Playlists every month**. Anyone else tired of hearing ""Rollie, Rollie, Rollie with a dab of ranch"" at least three times an hour when we decide to play? I know that I can play songs from Spotify or remove specific tracks from the queue, but my wish is that EA would put on more artists that people may be unfamiliar with. There should also be separate playlists for different genres. I understand that hip-hop and hip-hop are close, but people need more music to get pumped to. Basketball is an international sport, so the music should reflect that.
11. **Higher frame rates while playing online**: Y'all know what I am talking about. Nothing else to add. Moving onto the next point.
12. **Be able to look up historical statistics and set milestones to accomplish them**. One recommendation that I have is that the game should notify you when you are close to breaking a record and have the commentary anticipating the record being broken. It would add a lot of excitement to the game and give players more incentive to play harder until the final whistle. 
13. **Ability to have player's character play in simulated games on The League**. Yep. Nothing to really say here. With the current product being the way that it is, It is just an inconvenience (a chore, really) to have to play in every single game to ensure my team's success. Also, I have read that many people have had their whole round in the playoffs simulated rather than just one game, which is unfortunate for players that have a team full of lackeys. 
14. **The atmosphere needs to be electric**. When I am playing street ball, it never feels like a event where NBA players are showcasing. The parks hosts the average attendance of a little league game. No one is going losing their minds over a dunk or antagonizing their least favorite player. The kids aren't screaming for their favorite player to wake themselves out of a shooting slump. The announcer isn't making subtle or direct taunts on the speakers. Having been to multiple basketball showcases over the years, this game doesn't even try to mimic the atmosphere that street ball games have. The same goes for games in the league. Besides the generic cheering, the crowd never feels alive. In 2K, the crowd is much more dynamic, cheering at the top of their lungs on pivotal plays or silencing after a dagger with only 2 seconds left. The screen doesn't pan out to the crowd after a team comes back from a considerable deficit. Like, nothing feels how it should. 

**Edit**: Thanks to the people who commented on this post! After talking to an associate from the EA forums, it was decided that the best way to contact the developers @ EA Tiburon was to re-post this list of concerns and recommendations in the forums. I need your help one more time, as the more people who comment on the post, the easier it is for the developers to recognize and address our concerns.

DO NOT USE M PULSE LITE.

American Men have to sign up for the Draft to Vote, that's not Equality.

I'm quite aggressive with my speech. Because I want to get my points across quickly and effectively. Time is invaluable. I've done over 1,000 hours of Political and Philosophical research. I update this constantly. I make a '*Right Now' playlist for the videos I'm watching every day. A lot of my research material is in my 'Proof of Concept' playlist. Here's my findings.  :) (There's also Fun Facts and Exercise Advice.)

&gt;One White Nationalist is Violent 

&gt;Reaction: ""ALL THESE VIOLENT NAZIS!!!!"" 

&gt;Islamists Behead and Enslave people consistently 

&gt;Reaction: ""That's not all Muslims, you dumb bigot."" This kind of thinking is what's causing Political Violence. 

The Founding Father's of America allow us, through their actions, to prevent larger Wars, with War. Like how Land Conquests between Countries don't happen much anymore. Ever notice that? We're basically trying to force the World to be Peaceful, (Canada loves it), one death of a person that doesn't allow World Peace at a time. Who else does that? (Without forcing Religious Ideology) I'm not saying that the US should determine how every System of Governance that exists across the Globe should be, or choose the Leaders. Just enforce Peace, and make sure Innocent Peoples Natural Human Rights aren't being Infringed upon. Nobody else cares enough and has the Resources. America keeps all the other Western Countries from being Invaded with Guns, so the EU Politicians are bringing in Violent, Child Raping, Gay Murders to replace the populace. But I'm the problem... Why?

The Gawds I worship are RNGesus, Kek, and Lord Gaben. That's my Holy Trinity. I bought 45 games including XCOM 2, The Witcher III, Crusader Kings II, PUBG, and Ark/w Scorched Earth for $269.24 during the 2017 Steam Summer Sale. Or I could have gotten only 4 of those brand new. &gt;;D

False Rape Allegations ruin Mens Public and Professional lives. Being kicked from College for something you didn't do, and being brandished as a Rapist does ruin your life. The rule of thumb with Rape/Sexual Assault Allegations is first find out if the alleged Victim immediately filed a Police Report, if not, they're probably lying. Especially if many months have passed, or they try to ruin the Mans Public Image- even though He did nothing and She knows that- on Social Media. Hoping the public outrage from the Lie will make the cops have to find evidence, or they're perpetuating ""Rape Culture"" which only actually exists in Islam. Look it up- Sharia Courts can sentence Women to be Ceremonially Raped in front of the Elders. But America is clearly so oppressive. Ideologue Feminists are going to get Millions of people killed if they keep trying to control the way people behave while bringing Islam into the West. Don't say nobody ever coherently warned you without saying ""The End is Near"", but rather that things may get real bad. &gt;:/

Democrats have had uninterrupted control over Chicago for 84 years. They have an average Murder rate of 36 People a Month. That's 432 a year, on average. Stephen Paddock killed 59. But all White people are evil racists for trying desperately to integrate non-white people into a Country founded on Merit, Skill, Freedom that comes with Responsibility, and Hard work. (Asians and Black people from Nigeria are some of the most productive and successful people in Western societies.) After years of giving Single Mothers Welfare and destroying the Black community, people still think just throwing money at the problem will work. People have to earn what they have or they never learn to appreciate anything. I has on Welfare for, 1 1/2 years. I know a little something about this. Democrats destroy the Economy with Taxation and make it to where you need Welfare because there's no good paying entry-level jobs for young people in Bureaucratically gridlocked States with shit like ""Sanctuary Cities"" where Libtard Mayors decide to not enforce the law, which in-turn displaces Natural Born Americans from working so they need Welfare. Socialism is a slime covered crater in the ground that opens up so you fall in to a bottomless pit of High Taxation, Social Degradation, and Welfare Dependence. It's all the White Mans fault no matter how much money we give them- even though there's Affirmative Action Laws that 'positively' discriminate to get more Women, People of Color, and Gay people into the work force. Which pushes Straight White Men out. It's not Racist to hate or discriminate against White people on the basis of skin color, that's absurd. It's 2018.

This is a decent Workout Regiment for anyone. Do 100 Push-Ups, Sit-Ups/w 20lbs or more of Weight, Arm Extensions/w Weight (From Feet to Full Overhead Extension), Squats/w Weight, and Punching Exercises with 5-10lbs, punching with both hands for every number. In sets of 33, 33, 34 for one day, then just 1 Set of 34 every other day. I do this plus around an hour of Cardio- you don't have to Run- just Jog and Fast Walk, but Running burns Calories faster.

YT only cares about you if you stay PC and don't say anything against something a Feminist says is good. Susan, the CEO of YT, is a SJW. She had the YT Team program the YT Video Monitoring Algorithm to target Keywords in the Title, Description, and Tags of all videos Uploaded, even if they're not Public. Then Blacklist Channels and put most of their videos in a ""Limited State,"" also known as Demonetize them if it finds anything it's been told to dislike. I believe many channels like popular Music don't have these limitations. You have to have 1,000 Subscribers, and 4000 Hours of Watch Time on your videos every year before you qualify to receive the Ad Revenue.

Here's why I hate Religion.
50 people spend 3 hours a week performing actions to praise Gawd.=150 Hours. Multiply that by 4 Weeks =600 Hours, Months =7,200 Hours, then Years(Let's say 70) =504,000 Hours. Now start that equation with 1 Billion People. That's why I hate Religion. It's a Waste of Time in Modern Society.

All Plastic is made from Dead Plants and Animals- It's a Refined Material made from Crude Oil from inside Earth. All Consoles, TVs, Tires, Phones, and Plastic Utensils. All of it was made from previously Living things. Let's hope Scientists can't find a way to imitate that. It'd probably eventually be used for horrific things, and help destroy the environment. Build the Wall out of Hard Plastic from Landfills and line it with Solar Panels! :D

There are 3 things I know of to modify text on YT. _ , - , and * . This, This, and This. ;) Everything inside the symbols will change, they must be only touching one side of one character, with both on the very end of what you're changing.

Just because something doesn't make you feel good, doesn't mean it's not what's better for the World. Being a World Superpower doesn't happen without Money. Neither does Socialism. 50% of Americas spending is on Social and Welfare Benefits, 25% on the Military, and 16% on Education. We have a $20 Trillion Debt, and it's not because of War. Many more people would be dead if other Countries were allowed to act as they like, and the Military keeps Americans Employed.
I realize America isn't perfect.

California has Income, Sales, Fast Food, $1.00 on all Cigarette packs, Alcohol, Vehicle Luxury, Property, and as of 10/31/17, an extra 12¢ per Gallon Gas Tax. Gotta pay for those Single Mothers one way or another, to prevent them from beating their Fuck Buddy/Children into a Rioting frenzy to burn down the State.

8.5 Million jobs across America are held by Illegal Immigrants.

America isn't a natural Capitalist system. It's been tainted by the Government with overreach. True Capitalism is Contract Law and Property Rights, with minimal Taxes and Regulation. That's Capitalism, not Gov. Bailouts for Corporations.

Marriage has become a raw deal for Men, a Man can be Cheated on, Abused, Arrested for False Allegations after a Woman is Upset with him, have his Children taken from him by the Mother, be kicked out of his own House Legally, and have to Pay Alimony for her to live life because of Family Court Bias.

Feminists are adapting and creating Laws that fit their Narrative. They're changing the way Children think with In-School Indoctrination (Safe-Schools Program), and trying to eradicate Traditional Gender Roles.

There are Sexual Orientations, not creatable Genders or Sexes. There are Males, Females, Hermaphrodites, and Trans people. So there's people with natural born mutations, and there are also Trans people, but those aren't new Sexes or Genders. They transition from either Male to Female or Female to Male with Hormone treatments. That is Trans-itioning.

Facts, Logic, Science, and Observable Reality are all Tools of the Patriarchy. :')

There are Islamic Grooming Gangs that Rape European Women and Highschool Girls, typically for not wearing a Hijab and not being Muslim. I just don't want Women to be Raped. But no, I'm clearly ""The Patriarchy"" and oppress women by being a Straight White Male. I'm the same species as inbred child rapists. This has nothing to do with Race. It's all about how people behave. Why the fuck are so many Western people too blind, stupid, and sensitive to conceptualize and confront reality? Hiding from these things allows for Women to be Raped and Murdered. But you probably dislike ME for just talking about it and trying to solve it.

Muslim Rapefugees/Immigrants negatively impact Western Culture and Civilizations on a net scale. Islamists will Kill, Convert, or Enslave everyone you know if given the chance. 50% of British Muslims wouldn't Report a Terror Plot if discovered.

,DestinyTheGame,"Last Friday I finally got Redrix's Claymore. As you can imagine, I had to play (and win) a lot of games to get there. I've played as a solo player, a two, a three and a 4 stack.  

I've not gone back through stats and specifics of my previous matches but what I can tell you in my experience is that running as either a solo player or a 3 stack makes life incredibly difficult.  

As a solo player you obviously fall foul of being entirely at the mercy of your three blueberry teammates. More often than not, they will inexplicably push a choke zone and you'll find yourself with 3 lives left after 10 seconds or as the last guardian standing. The difference in skill levels between an average 4 stack and 4 good solo players still very much favours the 4 stack and you will lose to coordination and team work nearly every time.  

As a three stack, as far as I can tell, the game counts you in the same pool as 4 stacks, so you will gain absolutely zero advantage running as three good players with one blueberry against a team of 4.  You will also face, almost exclusively, 4 stack teams.  

However, me and my bud decided to play as a two once the matchmaking changes were made and I have to say, aside from running as a 4 stack, we've had the most success in the comp playlist running as a duo. There are a couple of reasons for this. You get statistically weaker 4 stack opponents as per the Bungie matchmaking update, which means you are more likely to win your 1's. You can still coordinate pinches and flanks with your teammate, plus you can assign one of you to support the blueberries and the other to look for meaningful opportunities to flank and pick off opponents when they are otherwise engaged.  

Don't get me wrong, it still relies on both you and your teammate winning your 1 vs 1s, playing smart and sweating your little butts off, but it's genuinely much, much easier than running alone or as a three (with a blueberry who burns through all your lives or dies immediately.)  

The very best option is still to find 3 good other players and team up as a four. If you're playing as a duo, often you'll be paired with another duo, and if they are good players then party them after the game and run as a 4. My friends list is now full of regular, good PvP players who have either added me after a match or vice versa. It'll make trying to find a four when you log in, a much easier experience.  

Finally, there will be times as a solo player or even as a two when you will lose 2 or 3 games on the bounce. Stop playing. Don't try, like an angry Blackjack player in a casino, and tell yourself you'll win it all back. You won't. You're on tilt, you're not playing the way you usually do and you will undo the hours of work you put in getting those points in the first place.  

I've witnessed some amazing antics from Blueberries - including my favourite which was being 5-3 down in a game of Countdown to a 4 stack. It's a 1 vs 1 with us having the charge set and it being moments away from the other team having time to defuse. Our blueberry has his Arcstrider up which is huge as we all have our supers for the next rounds and the other team burned through all of there's in this round. The opponent pushes to defuse with Last Hope and our blueberry tries to outgun him with Graviton from point blank. He loses. Obviously. I sent him a message afterwards saying GG but why did you not use your super? He replies with 'They were 5-3 up, what's the point?' Anyway, the point of that particular anecdote is two fold. Firstly never underestimate the inexperience of any blueberries on your team and secondly, never get mad at your blueberries either mid game or after. It will not help. At all. It changes nothing aside from making you lose focus.

There are a couple of reasons for this. You get statistically weaker 4 stack opponents as per the Bungie matchmaking update, which means you are more likely to win your 1&amp;#39;s. You can still coordinate pinches and flanks with your teammate, plus you can assign one of you to support the blueberries and the other to look for meaningful opportunities to flank and pick off opponents when they are otherwise engaged.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, it still relies on both you and your teammate winning your 1 vs 1s, playing smart and sweating your little butts off, but it&amp;#39;s genuinely much, much easier than running alone or as a three (with a blueberry who burns through all your lives or dies immediately.)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very best option is still to find 3 good other players and team up as a four. If you&amp;#39;re playing as a duo, often you&amp;#39;ll be paired with another duo, and if they are good players then party them after the game and run as a 4. My friends list is now full of regular, good PvP players who have either added me after a match or vice versa. It&amp;#39;ll make trying to find a four when you log in, a much easier experience.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there will be times as a solo player or even as a two when you will lose 2 or 3 games on the bounce. Stop playing. Don&amp;#39;t try, like an angry Blackjack player in a casino, and tell yourself you&amp;#39;ll win it all back. You won&amp;#39;t. You&amp;#39;re on tilt, you&amp;#39;re not playing the way you usually do and you will undo the hours of work you put in getting those points in the first place.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve witnessed some amazing antics from Blueberries - including my favourite which was being 5-3 down in a game of Countdown to a 4 stack. It&amp;#39;s a 1 vs 1 with us having the charge set and it being moments away from the other team having time to defuse. Our blueberry has his Arcstrider up which is huge as we all have our supers for the next rounds and the other team burned through all of there&amp;#39;s in this round. The opponent pushes to defuse with Last Hope and our blueberry tries to outgun him with Graviton from point blank. He loses. Obviously. I sent him a message afterwards saying GG but why did you not use your super? He replies with &amp;#39;They were 5-3 up, what&amp;#39;s the point?&amp;#39; Anyway, the point of that particular anecdote is two fold. Firstly never underestimate the inexperience of any blueberries on your team and secondly, never get mad at your blueberries either mid game or after. It will not help. At all. It changes nothing aside from making you lose focus.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: The grind is long and it&amp;#39;s real tough but it&amp;#39;s tougher as a 1 or a 3.&lt;/p&gt;

##Global Events

When you have general questions, how Global Events work, check out the summary in the wiki: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/wiki/update_17_summary#wiki_global_events)

##Schedule

* Start: [21.05.2018, 09:00 UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Global+Event+-+Onslaught&amp;iso=20180521T10&amp;p1=293)

##Modifier

* **Onslaught** (Global Modifier)
   * Always active; Deal Burn, Bleed, and Gas effects to enemies in addition to normal damage. Reload to change the effect.
* **Savage Onslaught**
   * Onslaught behavior, enemies are vulnerable to one effect type and resistant to others. Agents take increased damage from resistant enemies.
* **Brutal Onslaught** (Group Modifier)
   * Savage Onslaught behavior, plus when two or more group members kill a vulnerable enemy within two seconds, each member can reload to gain a damage bonus for a single clip.

&amp;nbsp;

**Active Elemental Effect**

With the Global Modifier, you [always have one of three elemental effects active](https://i.imgur.com/FqIVGr0.png). You can have Burn, Bleed and Gas and depending on what is active, you do a different kind of elemental damage. You can switch the elemental effect by reloading your weapon. The Elemental Effects are weapon specific, so you can have different effects on each weapon.

&amp;nbsp;

**Elemental Effect Rotation**

When you reload your weapon, the elemental effects rotate always in the same order: [Burn](https://i.imgur.com/7yAtbzo.png), [Bleed](https://i.imgur.com/Aj4z6vS.png), and [Gas](https://i.imgur.com/68aB9to.png). Keep that in mind when you reload and when you have react to multiple enemies. Also keep different effects on both weapons, so that you can push the NPCs back.

&amp;nbsp;

**NPC Buff/Debuff**

When the second an third modifiers are active, each NPC is vulnerable to a specific set of Elemental Damage and resistant against others. When they are resistant, [the icon is greyed out](https://i.imgur.com/0Avru7o.png), you will do a lot less damage and they do a lot more damage to you. When the NPCs are vulnerable, the [icons are colored out](https://i.imgur.com/kJBR7Z7.png) and you can tear them down fast - even on legendary difficulty. 

The trick is, you have to [match the elemental effect on your agent, to the icon above the NPC](https://i.imgur.com/arxXUNW.png) - only, in this case, you do enough damage to tear them down before they kill you. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Brutal Onslaught - damage bonus (Smart Ammo)**

When two or more group members kill a vulnerable enemy within two seconds, each member can reload to gain a damage bonus for a single clip. That bonus is represented by a [skull](https://i.imgur.com/3IkwVkj.png) that appears next to your weapon. The bonus is weapon specific and will disappear as soon as you reload that weapon or the magazine is empty. As long as the bonus is active, [you can do damage against any NPC](https://i.imgur.com/IWMKe1a.png) and you are not limited to one element.

,DestinyTheGame,"

Bungie is no stranger to the ""Ban Hammer,"" and has used it plenty of times when they helmed the Halo series. Banning players who manipulate the game is an easy solution, but that same solution gets a bit muddy when it comes to people who don't want to stick around for the entire match in Crucible, the random error codes that kick players to orbit or the title screen, and various other problems that exist within most mulitplayer systems. There's no perfect system for patrolling every match, waiting for players to quit, and catching them in the act of ""dashboarding,"" manually leaving for Orbit, or simply turning off their console, but there is a way to weed out and catch more players than we're catching currently. That's why I'm recommending a temp suspend from matchmaking for any occurance where a player leaves a match in progress in the competitive playlist, outside of error codes that boot the player to orbit or the title screen.


- If a player leaves an in progress competitive match, a 15 minute suspend is applied to their profile that restricts any crucible matchmaking across QP &amp; Comp. (15 minutes of in-game time)

- If a player leaves more than 1 competitive match within an hour, an hour suspend is applied to their profile that restricts any crucible matchmaking for QP &amp; Comp, and no streak or glory rewards are rewarded for 3 matches after suspension ends.  (1 hour of in-game time)

- If a player leaves more than 5 matches in a 24 hour period, they're locked out of all crucible matchmaking for 3 hours, no streak or glory rewards are rewarded for 5 matches, and a locked emblem is applied to their gamertag/PSN during matchmaking while playing QP &amp; Comp once the suspend ends. The player is also locked out of Trials of the Nine until the next weekly reset.
(3 hours of in-game time, 3 days of real time for the locked emblem)

- If a player continues to quit comp matches, these stipulations continue to raise and increase in severity with length of ban time, how long they have to wait to earn glory and streak bonuses, and how long the emblem is locked to they gamertag/psn. The long term goal behind this is to keep quitters out of crucible, and give those who want to keep playing comp incentive to stay in game to get rid of that nasty emblem or streak/glory restrictions if they've had a quitting streak. The ones who keep quitting, eventually weed themselves out, and those who just range quit occasionally aren't penalized too severely. 


What about the teammates left behind in these games? Their active streaks and possible glory rewards are at risk because someone(s) quit, so here's a solution for that, too.


- If your team loses 1+ players before 50% of the point threshold has been met, no streak or glory loss will be applied at the end of the match. For staying in the game until match completion, you'll receive an additional 4 crucible tokens. (If the handicaped team wins, rewards towards streaks and Glory points are applied as normal.)

- If your team loses 1+ players after 50% of the point threshold has been met, streak &amp; glory loss are applied as normal with no additional bonus tokens. 

This provides incentive for the left behind teammates to stay in game, and secures their streak &amp; glory points. If teammates are quitting towards the later half of the game or final stretch, there's not a good solution I could think for the ""losing"" team if they're the ones losing players. 


All of this entirely relies on Bungies ability to detect quitters versus error codes or other circumstances outside of actual players quitting. Parts of it might seem harsh, but with a new post going up every hour about how laughable the matchmaking problems in competitive are, this is an on paper solution that might push quitters into staying in matches, or staying out of competitive crucible.

QUESTION 10 [QUEEN LEIGH]
Could you briefly describe the music-making process?

RESPONSE [MADEIRA]
The music making process that we use is we first think of a concept of the song before we get a beat or anything.After thinking the concept we then organise the tune of the song  .The 3rd process is writing the song using the tune that we have organised.After those 3 steps we leave the rest to the producer , hez the 1 who makes  the beat using the tune that we have organised .The 5th and final process is recording the song .After these 5 steps are complete the track will be ready to be released , thats how we make our music.

QUESTION 11 [QUEEN LEIGH]
What are your rehearsals generally like? Do you have a set time each week in which you practice or are rehearsals more spontaneous?

&lt;p&gt;RESPONSE [MADEIRA]
Right now we cant say we have songs that we perform most frequently because most of our projects are still in studio , they are not yet released.As for cover songs we .never play any .For setting the playlist right now we havent bt soon we will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QUESTION 9 [QUEEN LEIGH]
Who writes your songs? What are the main themes or topics for most of your songs? Do you think these topics will change over time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RESPONSE [MADEIRA]
To be honest, we do not have any specific themes yet, we just give people what they deserve. But at the end of the day the fact remains the same that we all from the Ghetto so obviously most of the themes are in favour of the Ghetto people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QUESTION 10 [QUEEN LEIGH]
Could you briefly describe the music-making process?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RESPONSE [MADEIRA]
The music making process that we use is we first think of a concept of the song before we get a beat or anything.After thinking the concept we then organise the tune of the song  .The 3rd process is writing the song using the tune that we have organised.After those 3 steps we leave the rest to the producer , hez the 1 who makes  the beat using the tune that we have organised .The 5th and final process is recording the song .After these 5 steps are complete the track will be ready to be released , thats how we make our music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QUESTION 11 [QUEEN LEIGH]
What are your rehearsals generally like? Do you have a set time each week in which you practice or are rehearsals more spontaneous?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RESPONSE [MADEIRA]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11.There are steps that are behind every song we make. When it comes to rehearsing n whatnot, we choose a day for rehearsals. We cant say it jus happens spontaneously coz us as Boiz tine Mutto, we first plan before heading any further.&lt;/p&gt;

As a group you face so many challenges .People compare you as a group , comparing who is the best. Money is also another  issue,  there are sometimes that we would want to record but the money will be lacking,  but the only way we overcome these problems is that we pray and after that all goes exactly as we plan it&lt;/p&gt;

,offmychest,"I don’t know if it was the butterfly effect taking place or if God just decided to give me some extra guidance today, maybe a little of both.

This could get long because I just need to pour my heart out for a while, so I’ll put a TL;DR at the end because I really can’t blame anyone who doesn’t want to read the entire thing lol.

So, I have not been in a great place mentally lately. To go into the details of why would take way too long, but let’s just say that I’m constantly feeling stressed due to college life and lonely due to growing distant from old friends as well as having new friends not be as reliable as I’d like. The icing on the cake for this particular week is that my SO decided to get laser eye surgery, putting us out of commission for a couple of days. I hate seeing him in pain, and my heart broke when he was shaking from the adrenaline rush walking out of the clinic. I know it’ll get better soon and be worth it in the end since this is something he’s wanted for years, and he’s been sleeping it off for several hours now already. It’s just tough right now on my already-stressed brain with him being in a fragile state at the moment and with everything else I’ve got piling up (and I hate to say that because it probably looks like I’m trying to make it about me, but this is all very relevant).

His friend drove us to the clinic in a city about 40 minutes away. While waiting for the appointment, his friend and I decided to go to the nearby mall to kill some time. I wandered into FYE to see if I could pick up some cheap CDs. Whoever was choosing the music had what can only be described as...eclectic taste, highlighting some of the most polarizing songs the 1970’s had to offer. “Copacabana” and “In The Navy” blared from the speakers as I browsed the ever-shrinking selection of CDs, and as I was checking out and about to leave the store, a cover of the song “MacArthur Park” came on.

Now, I think MacArthur Park is an absolutely ridiculous song in every sense of the word. However, it still has a lot of sentimental value to me because my best friend of several years and I bonded over it. We each went to one of our hometown’s two middle schools but were both in the academically gifted program, which shared one teacher between the two schools. We ended up going to the same high school and hit it off okay, but didn’t become super close at first because I had/(still have but not quite as bad) hella social anxiety that makes it hard for me to get to know people. Then, we were just hanging out one day and she showed me her music playlist. I noticed MacArthur Park, which is an odd choice for a 14-15 year old (or anyone really) to have in their music library in the early 2010’s. For the academically gifted class, the teacher had made us analyze the song’s lyrics for two or three weeks to find the deep meaning behind it. I brought this up to her and we discovered we had both been in this class. She had the song because she loved to poke fun at the ridiculousness of it and of that “gifted class” in general (which itself was hit-or-miss; we did some cool things sometimes but then we also did pointless things like spending a whole month coloring maps of the county). We shared a laugh over this and became instant best friends who have had each others’ backs ever since.

Lately though, staying in touch has been hard. We go to separate colleges three states apart and have very different interests and priorities in life. I’ve grown apart from a lot of my friends back home mostly because I can’t afford to visit often (and honestly, want nothing to do with my home state most of the time anyway). Also, I’ve kind of been off my feet in the past few months as far as having a consistent job situation, and my major is one that may or may not get taken seriously depending on who you are. She on the other hand, has been working two jobs forever and studies a major that is considered much more important in society. We’ve always sort of had those same types of lifestyles and priorities that led us to where we’re at now. In the past she resented me for it at one time because she started to see me as a slacker who had been able to avoid growing up while she was getting a healthy head start into the adult world. In reality however, I feel that the opposite could not have been more true. Even though I never had a job in high school besides the occasional neighborhood odd jobs and could have put more thought into my long-term plans, I was having to grow up very, very fast in my late teens regardless due to family issues, including illnesses and my parents’ ugly separation. This period in my life drained my innocence and left me with a much more cynical worldview. I’d kind of been hiding this from all of my friends because I didn’t want to worry them or draw attention to my issues, and if one of the people closest to me believed the act then that just meant I was doing a good job right? For this reason, I wasn’t hurt by it at all at the time when she confessed this to me out of guilt. I forgave her almost instantly, our friendship healed quickly, and we moved on with life. However, it’s been on my mind again frequently and I have spent a couple of months being worried sick that she might be starting to resent me again. She’s always been a hard worker in life which I respect the hell out of, but every time recently I had tried to text her, we would just make small talk for a bit and the conversation would turn to her being busy and/or feeling tired due to school and work. I worried if she had an accurate picture of what my life really looks like, my struggles would be inferior to hers. I decided to just leave it alone for a while and give her some space even though I could have really used a shoulder to lean on. Lately I have been debating texting her and just being blunt, telling her how much I miss her and our old friend group or that I hope she still thinks well of me. I’ve even had entire paragraphs typed out but just couldn’t bring myself to press send because I hate to be so needy about it. The last time I texted her was her birthday almost two months ago...until today. Today, I saw my chance and took it. I recorded a few seconds of MacArthur Park playing in the store and sent it to her while on the way home.

She responded and we caught up for a bit by text. I told her all about my SO getting his laser eye surgery and about my summer classes and the scope of the projects I need to do for them. She even gave me a couple of awesome ideas for the projects to help me out of the nasty creative block I’ve been stuck in lately. It just felt so damn good to have an organic conversation with her again after months of feeling distant. I’m so thankful that I found a reason to text her out of the blue because who knows how much longer my anxiety would have kept me away? I’m so damn happy to have the reassurance that she still cares about me a lot and that it’s yet another case of my anxiety augmenting a situation to seem much worse than it actually is. Today was a perfect day for this too because my anxiety is running full steam ahead due to the surgery so I desperately needed the distraction. I would have spent my afternoon completely alone in my thoughts otherwise.

Would I have texted her if I decided to not accompany my SO and his friend to the clinic today in favor of getting more sleep? Or if we had decided to wait out in the parking lot instead of heading over to the mall? Or if someone with more normal tastes had been choosing the music today, or played the songs in a different order, or if I had been in the store not even five minutes sooner or later? The answer to all of those is a huge “Probably Not” because I’ve been feeling so down and insecure about most of my friendships lately. Every little choice you make can matter, and that specific combination of small events opened a door that I needed really badly today. I also just have a feeling deep down that God helped me be in the right place at the right time. I’ll admit that I’m not as religious as I probably should be (I am a Christian, but the type that rarely goes to church besides holiday services), but I pray every now and then and lately I’ve been praying that life gets less stressful and that I’ll be equipped to handle the things it throws at me. This is exactly the type of push in the right direction that I need right now. 

If you’ve made it this far, you might be thinking “Seriously? All this deep thought over a cheesy song getting played in a store?” And yes, it is that important to me. It’s the little things like this that keep me going in life and keep from getting burnt out from stress and anxiety.

**TL;DR:** Life has been stressful lately for lots of reasons. A huge part of that stress comes from feeling isolated from friendships. Today, a series of events led me to hearing the infamously cheesy MacArthur Park in a store, and I decided to contact a longtime friend who I’ve grown distant from because of it since it’s sort of an inside joke between us. Turns out I really needed that today and found a lot of comfort in it. Now I’m just thinking about how fortunate I am to have been in the right place at the right time to be pushed to contact her in spite of my anxieties.",,False,,0,False,MacArthur Park is melting in the dark,[],,False,1.0,,0.0,,,False,t3_8kpa8d,,dark,,,public,3.0,,{},,,False,[],,False,,,{},,,3,,,,self,1526781829.0,,[],,,True,,1526804808.0,text,1.0,,,text,self.offmychest,,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if it was the butterfly effect taking place or if God just decided to give me some extra guidance today, maybe a little of both.&lt;/p&gt;

,Blackliberation,"Music streaming service Spotify initiates censorship against R. Kelly and XXXTentacion
By Zac Corrigan
19 May 2018

On May 10, global music streaming platform Spotify began a regime of censorship against artists it accuses of ""Hateful Conduct."" The same day, singers Robert ""R."" Kelly and Jahseh Dwayne Onfroy (known as XXXTentacion) became its first targets.

Under the new policy, Spotify will censor music that ""incites hatred or violence against a group or individual based on characteristics, including race, religion, gender identity, sex, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, veteran status[!], or disability."" Moreover, the announcement goes on, ""When an artist or creator does something that is especially harmful or hateful (for example, violence against children and sexual violence), it may affect the ways we work with or support that artist or creator.""

The same day, the company wrote in a statement, ""We are removing R. Kelly's music from all Spotify owned and operated playlists and algorithmic recommendations."" In other words, Spotify's users will still find works by Kelly if they search for them by name, but the same works are cut off from a wider audience who are not already fans.

Spotify claims that this does not constitute censorship. ""We don't censor content because of an artist's or creator's behavior, but we want our editorial decisions--what we choose to program--to reflect our values,"" they write. This is both dishonest and hypocritical.

Following the news of Spotify's actions, competitor Pandora Radio (81 million users) announced that it would also begin removing Kelly's songs from parts of its platform. And Apple Music (40 million subscribers), it was later revealed, had quietly removed Kelly's music from many prominent playlists already. Apple has not released a statement justifying its action.

Works by the 20-year-old Onfroy (XXXTentacion), who presently faces charges for battery against a pregnant woman, were given the same treatment, including removal from the Spotify playlist ""Rap Caviar,"" which has nearly 10 million followers.

Prior to these acts of censorship, a witch-hunt atmosphere had been whipped up around these two singers in the press and on social media. In the case of Kelly, the group of Hollywood figures known as the ""Time's Up movement"" threw their weight behind an existing campaign to ""Mute R. Kelly."" The manifesto at muterkelly.org makes clear its disdain for democratic rights:

""We have come together to call for a worldwide mute on R&amp;B singer, Robert 'R' Kelly, due to his 25 year history of sexual, physical and emotional abuse allegations. While he hasn't been found guilty in a court of law, the evidence is overwhelming that he has created an uninterrupted pattern of sexual violence in the African American community that must be stopped. If the court system is unable to protect our young Black women and girls, we must step forward to do so ourselves"" [emphasis added].

Kelly denies the allegations against him.

There should be no mistaking the significance of the actions against Kelly and XXXTentacion. This is how censorship and attacks on democratic rights begin in a particular field, with what are perceived to be ""soft targets."" Producer Harvey Weinstein was selected for the same reason. Appealing to and making use of the moral outrage of certain social layers, the authorities in question establish a precedent for ""disappearing"" objectionable or ""controversial"" figures.

Such censorship campaigns never end there. Given changes in the objective situation, they can easily be extended to political dissent and opposition. After all, it is only a relatively small step from banning music that ""incites hatred"" against certain ethnicities, religions or sexual orientations to clamping down on music that ""incites hatred"" against the government or the super-wealthy.

Kelly and Onfroy are simply fall-guys--figures the #MeToo crowd calculates it can throw under the bus, without provoking widespread protest, to help create a more favorable environment for themselves, where democratic rights are dispensed with on the basis of mere allegations of wrongdoing, allegations that can be leveled at anyone who doesn't fall into line. There is nothing remotely progressive or ""left-wing"" about such efforts.

The treatment of Onfroy has a painful aspect to it. The child of Jamaican parents and born into poverty in 1998 near Miami, Florida, Onfroy's biography includes a series of violent episodes stretching back to his childhood, when he reportedly stabbed a man at the age of six in defense of his mother. He was jailed for gun possession as a high-schooler, and currently faces a number of charges, including battery against his pregnant girlfriend.

Onfroy began uploading his original music to the web site SoundCloud at age 15. He became a popular figure in the ""SoundCloud rap"" scene that has since become a major trend in pop music. He has almost 20 million monthly listeners on Spotify, and his newest album, simply entitled ?, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart in March.

His popularity with a portion of the younger generation is attributable in part to the fact that he expresses loneliness and even hopelessness they also feel. Onfroy has his personal demons, but such melancholy sentiments correspond more broadly to the experience of a generation that has grown up in the 21st century, amid endless wars, worsening social conditions and an epidemic of workplace and school violence.

His song ""Hope,"" on ?, begins, ""To all the kids who died in the Parkland [Florida] shooting, rest in peace. This song is dedicated to you."" His biggest single to date, ""SAD!,"" casually mentions suicide in the chorus.

Onfroy's representative responded to Spotify's actions by legitimately asking if the platform intended to extend its censorship to include figures such as David Bowie, Miles Davis, Michael Jackson, James Brown, Seal, Jimmy Page, Dr. Dre and others who have been accused of sexual misconduct. Indeed, if ""objectionable"" musicians and performers are to be removed or pushed into the background on music streaming services, who will be left?

Jillian Mapes, senior editor at the influential music journalism web site Pitchfork, posted a comment May 11 (""Why Spotify's New Policy on Hateful Conduct Is a Flawed Step Forward"") essentially calling for such an extension of the censorship campaign.

""Between the foggy specifics and the focus on the industry's two most controversial alleged abusers right now, Spotify's announcement makes it seem like the ban will center around those in the news--the allegations that outrage the public. How is that fair to the women with just as serious but not so prominent allegations, involving less commercially successful artists?""

Mapes goes on: ""By turning the announcement into a publicity opportunity, instead of just quietly implementing the changes, Spotify has in some ways distracted from the good it is trying to achieve. Though Apple Music has declined to comment officially on such policies, a source familiar with the situation tells Pitchfork that R. Kelly's music has not been promoted on the service's featured playlists for the past couple of weeks. That, to me, seems the more conflict-free way to stop promoting artists who, frankly, deserve to be ignored.""

This upper middle class layer is oblivious to the reactionary, authoritarian implications of actions such as Spotify's.

3-*Yesterday*

Hello everyone! As standard practice, I use my birthday to pin my favorite headliner. Happy birthday to meeeee. Collectively, it’s time to lose our shit! It’s Sir Paul Mc-freaking-Cartney ladies and gents. The one and only; one of the Fab Four; the muse of my teenage self; the musical genius that is MACCA. Guys can I just say I actually called him the day after ACL last year, I have proof too. Maybe I have discovered my new super power, where I can will things in happening or I can predict the future. Honestly call it luck, call it logic, I still nailed it. I’m glad I did too, ACL organizers are correct in saying this is the biggest headliner they have ever grabbed. You guys are in for a fucking treat. The Beatles are the first band that truly got me into music, listening to these 13 albums (counting all LPs) created such an undying passion in myself I can tell it will last my whole life. I know just about all Beatles songs by heart, seriously. I have so many Beatles everything’s: shirts, rock band, biographies, posters, original vintage vinyl, artwork, musical boxes etc, etc... I cannot stress enough how thrilled I am to be able to see Paul McCartney.

Paul is, of course, one of the lead singers of the Beatles, the most popular band of the 20th century and perhaps to this day. Made up of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, The Beatles have transcended through the decades into a kind of cultural immortality. They are accredited with the start of the British Invasion which influenced a rock n roll sensation throughout the world. Their creativity spawned the last 50 years of Rock and Pop.  In less than a decade they charted about 49 #1 singles in less than a decade. They made enough material to cover more than 13 albums in maybe 7 years starting in 62’ and ending in 70’. The Beatles symbolized peace, love, creativity, freedom, rebellion and more. They are known anywhere and everywhere, even in 3rd world countries. To say the Beatles and Paul McCartney are legendary is a given. If you only watched “Across the Universe” and don’t know about anything but basic Beatles you are about to get schooled.

Ok to start with there is so much god damn good music to get through, and then you have to get to Paul’s solo stuff, which by itself is still hefty. Forgive me but I’ll trim some of the deeper cuts and really focus on what he might play live as well as all major Beatles albums one-by-one. I won’t go into how each and every single song sounds but will highlight the big ones for y’all to pin.

Starting with “Please, Please Me” a trailblazing album, the first step in fame for the Beatles. What I think everyone should understand is that this album was the first of a new breed of music, people listened to it until they “got it”. The youth of the day relished in the bold difference for other contemporary showy pop tunes and radio hits. John and Paul were never ones to want to sing boring, repetitive or “safe” tunes. They pushed the envelope constantly and their first LP is no different . Kicks off with *I Saw Her Standing There* a well known beautiful written jam. Please please give a listen to *P.S. I Love You*, and *Love Me Do*, 2 classic Paul songs. The album ends with *Twist And Shout* the amazing dance craze phase song if there ever was one. If you can dance your heart out to *Twist and Shout* like you mean it, I want you as my friend. Accepting applications.

The next album is “With the Beatles”, a masterful album in its own right. This is still riding on the commercial success of “Please Please Me”. The producers and manager basically gave the band even more free reign to make what they wanted, so they did just that. It opens on the classic *It Won’t Be Long*. They really hit home runs on this album, *All My Loving*, *Please Mister Postman*, *Hold Me Tight*, and *I Wanna Be Your Man*. Deep cuts here that I adore are *Money (That’s What I Want*, *You Really Got A Hold On Me*, and *Till There Was You*.

Next we get “A Hard Day’s Night” where we see yet another commercial success. Huge hits here are *A Hard Day’s Night* and *Cant Buy Me Love*. A special song here that I have pinned for my wedding playlist is *And I Love Her* which still kicks me in the feels every time without fail. Deeper in listen to *Things We Said Today* , *If I Fell*, and *I’ll Cry Instead*.

“Beatles For Sale”is next in line, which is another doozy. They really tried to eat up the rock n roll song frontier on this one. Highly recommend *Rock N Roll Music*, personifies their style in this age quite well. The hits here are *I’m A Loser* and *Eight Days A Week*. But the deep cuts are strong with this one: *No Reply*, *Mr Moonlight*, *Words of Love*, and *Kansas City / Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey*.

“Help!” came soon after and stormed the charts. *Ticket to Ride*, *You’re Going Lose That Girl*, *I’ve Just Seen A Face*, *Help!*, and *Yesterday* are killer songs and make this album very hard to look away from. *Yesterday* I have to say, is very special to me. Deep cuts include *You’ve Got To Hide Your Love Away*, *Act Naturally* and *Dizzy Miss Lizzy*

Next up is “Rubber Soul” a real contender for my favorite album. My gamer tag is named after the song *Nowhere Man*. *Drive My Car* kicks off the album in high gear. *Girl* is what starts the movie Across the Universe. The song *In My Life* was chosen as my senior years class song, which I was beyond touched those assholes from high school got something right. The lesser known songs are *Norwegian Wood*, *Michelle*, and *The Word*

Next is “Revolver”, which quite frankly, is a masterpiece. Let me just list some amazing grade A songs: *Taxman*, *Eleanor Rigsby*, *Got To Get You Into My Life*, *Yellow Submarine*, and *Good Day Sunshine*. You see a transition in this album towards an even more new robust sound that is electrifying to the masses. Look to songs *Tomorrow Never Knows*, *Im Only Sleeping*, *And Your Bird Can Sing*, *She Said She Said*, and *Here, There and Everywhere* for those deep cuts.

Ok now is time for “Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band” truly another masterpiece. The Beatles went in a totally new direction with this album doing quite literally anything they wanted with music. I have this record in original vinyl pressing, I ^***love*** this album. The whole thing start to finish is great. Here’s a massive list of hits off the album: *Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band*, *With A Little Help From My Friends*, *Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds*, *Getting Better*, *A Day in The Life*, *Being For The Benefit Of Mr.Kite*, and *When Im Sixty Four*. Trip out to *Within You Without You* with some small cuts with *Lovely Rita* and *Fixing A Hole*

“Magical Mystery Tour” is the peak of the Beatles writing dreamy beautiful, trippy and outlandish songs. Such dreamy imagery displayed in *I Am The Walrus*and *Strawberry Fields Forever*. Of course no one can forget such timeless classics like *Hello, Goodbye* and *All You Need Is Love*. Lesser known tracks are *Penny Lane*, *Magical Mystery Tour* and *Fool On The Hill*.

Ok, this is a huge album “The White Album”. This is a favorite album, mostly because of how underrated it is and chalk full of low key hits. The Beatles made this album after their famous trip to India for meditations insight with Indian gurus. So, naturally, when they came back they were overflowing with creativity as evident by the staggering 31 song album colored only white. Seriously just give this album some time to go through, it has unanimous favorites like *Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da*, *While My Guitar Gently Weeps*, *Why Don’t We Do It In The Road?*, *Blackbird*, *Dear Prudence*, *Helter Skelter*, *Revolution 1* and *Happiness Is A Warm Gun* plus more. There is too many deep cuts here to list but please dive through this album. Strangely enough I even enjoy the slightly scary recording of *Revolution 9*which sounds like a bad trip in audio form.

Mentioning the “Yellow Submarine” movie/soundtrack just because y’all should go watch it (on drugs). Seriously though it’s a great animated film about the triumph of Love over Evil, that includes the Beatles animated personas. I own a copy too. Be sure to listen to *Hey Bulldog!*, and *All Together Now*

In between Abbey Road and White Album was the release of this one single, an 8 min song that  arguably is their most amazing song to date, *Hey Jude*. I can tell you I definitely cried during this song in 2015, there was no stopping it, be warned.

 The last record ever made by the Beatles was “Abbey Road”, a true legendary iconic album. It starts with *Come Together* a killer Lennon song. This album just slays me again and again. Definitely is my favorite. This record was made knowing the band would split up afterwards. So, naturally, they made this record the best they quite possibly could. This record holds the classics, from first to last: *Come Together*, *Something*, *Oh! Darling*, *I Want You (She’s So Heavy)*, *Here Comes The Sun*, *Because*, *She Came In Through The Bathroom Window*, *Carry That Weight*, *Golden Slumbers* and *The End*. I especially love the last line in the *The End*; **“In the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make”**

“Let It Be” was released in 1980 after the band broke up. No one can forget about amazing songs like *Let It Be*, *The Long And Winding Road*, *Across The Universe* or *Get Back*. I just wish John could see how far his reach had become. I wanted him to know he made a difference to so many countless people.

Paul himself kept making music over the years especially with his band the Wings and occasionally strikes gold with his solo stuff, such as *Live And Let Die* which has an awesome heavy fireworks show attached to it. Special mention of a song that really pulls on my heartstrings, *Here Today* which is set as a conversation between Paul and John. It’s a soft song that’s written about what Paul wishes he could say to John if he were here today. When he played it live it blind sided me into tearing up. His other amazing solo songs include *Baby I’m Amazed*, *Band On The Run*, *My Brave Face*, and *New* to keep it criminally short.

My SO and I both agree we were born 50 years late and would have been blessed to grow up with the sensation that is the Beatles. Even if they don’t float your boat you have to admit the Beatles impacted music in immeasurable ways. Arctic Monkeys/ The National/Metallica could all trace their lineage back to the Beatles influence. 

Anthologies 1, 2, and 3 are full of raw unused versions of well known songs, any Beatles-head would love the shit out of. The album “One” holds 27 of their biggest hits and is great to start with for newbies.

My fiancé and I collectively lost our shit finding out Paul was headlining. When we first met we literally fell for each other at first because of a deep shared love for The Beatles. It goes back very far with us, seeing him 3 years ago was more than magical, I can’t wait to share that experience again with all you beautiful people. 

Peace and Love Guys

&lt;p&gt;3-&lt;em&gt;Yesterday&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! As standard practice, I use my birthday to pin my favorite headliner. Happy birthday to meeeee. Collectively, it’s time to lose our shit! It’s Sir Paul Mc-freaking-Cartney ladies and gents. The one and only; one of the Fab Four; the muse of my teenage self; the musical genius that is MACCA. Guys can I just say I actually called him the day after ACL last year, I have proof too. Maybe I have discovered my new super power, where I can will things in happening or I can predict the future. Honestly call it luck, call it logic, I still nailed it. I’m glad I did too, ACL organizers are correct in saying this is the biggest headliner they have ever grabbed. You guys are in for a fucking treat. The Beatles are the first band that truly got me into music, listening to these 13 albums (counting all LPs) created such an undying passion in myself I can tell it will last my whole life. I know just about all Beatles songs by heart, seriously. I have so many Beatles everything’s: shirts, rock band, biographies, posters, original vintage vinyl, artwork, musical boxes etc, etc... I cannot stress enough how thrilled I am to be able to see Paul McCartney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul is, of course, one of the lead singers of the Beatles, the most popular band of the 20th century and perhaps to this day. Made up of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, The Beatles have transcended through the decades into a kind of cultural immortality. They are accredited with the start of the British Invasion which influenced a rock n roll sensation throughout the world. Their creativity spawned the last 50 years of Rock and Pop.  In less than a decade they charted about 49 #1 singles in less than a decade. They made enough material to cover more than 13 albums in maybe 7 years starting in 62’ and ending in 70’. The Beatles symbolized peace, love, creativity, freedom, rebellion and more. They are known anywhere and everywhere, even in 3rd world countries. To say the Beatles and Paul McCartney are legendary is a given. If you only watched “Across the Universe” and don’t know about anything but basic Beatles you are about to get schooled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok to start with there is so much god damn good music to get through, and then you have to get to Paul’s solo stuff, which by itself is still hefty. Forgive me but I’ll trim some of the deeper cuts and really focus on what he might play live as well as all major Beatles albums one-by-one. I won’t go into how each and every single song sounds but will highlight the big ones for y’all to pin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with “Please, Please Me” a trailblazing album, the first step in fame for the Beatles. What I think everyone should understand is that this album was the first of a new breed of music, people listened to it until they “got it”. The youth of the day relished in the bold difference for other contemporary showy pop tunes and radio hits. John and Paul were never ones to want to sing boring, repetitive or “safe” tunes. They pushed the envelope constantly and their first LP is no different . Kicks off with &lt;em&gt;I Saw Her Standing There&lt;/em&gt; a well known beautiful written jam. Please please give a listen to &lt;em&gt;P.S. I Love You&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Love Me Do&lt;/em&gt;, 2 classic Paul songs. The album ends with &lt;em&gt;Twist And Shout&lt;/em&gt; the amazing dance craze phase song if there ever was one. If you can dance your heart out to &lt;em&gt;Twist and Shout&lt;/em&gt; like you mean it, I want you as my friend. Accepting applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next album is “With the Beatles”, a masterful album in its own right. This is still riding on the commercial success of “Please Please Me”. The producers and manager basically gave the band even more free reign to make what they wanted, so they did just that. It opens on the classic &lt;em&gt;It Won’t Be Long&lt;/em&gt;. They really hit home runs on this album, &lt;em&gt;All My Loving&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Please Mister Postman&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hold Me Tight&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;I Wanna Be Your Man&lt;/em&gt;. Deep cuts here that I adore are &lt;em&gt;Money (That’s What I Want&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;You Really Got A Hold On Me&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Till There Was You&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we get “A Hard Day’s Night” where we see yet another commercial success. Huge hits here are &lt;em&gt;A Hard Day’s Night&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cant Buy Me Love&lt;/em&gt;. A special song here that I have pinned for my wedding playlist is &lt;em&gt;And I Love Her&lt;/em&gt; which still kicks me in the feels every time without fail. Deeper in listen to &lt;em&gt;Things We Said Today&lt;/em&gt; , &lt;em&gt;If I Fell&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;I’ll Cry Instead&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Beatles For Sale”is next in line, which is another doozy. They really tried to eat up the rock n roll song frontier on this one. Highly recommend &lt;em&gt;Rock N Roll Music&lt;/em&gt;, personifies their style in this age quite well. The hits here are &lt;em&gt;I’m A Loser&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Eight Days A Week&lt;/em&gt;. But the deep cuts are strong with this one: &lt;em&gt;No Reply&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mr Moonlight&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Words of Love&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Kansas City / Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Help!” came soon after and stormed the charts. &lt;em&gt;Ticket to Ride&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;You’re Going Lose That Girl&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;I’ve Just Seen A Face&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Help!&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Yesterday&lt;/em&gt; are killer songs and make this album very hard to look away from. &lt;em&gt;Yesterday&lt;/em&gt; I have to say, is very special to me. Deep cuts include &lt;em&gt;You’ve Got To Hide Your Love Away&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Act Naturally&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dizzy Miss Lizzy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is “Rubber Soul” a real contender for my favorite album. My gamer tag is named after the song &lt;em&gt;Nowhere Man&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Drive My Car&lt;/em&gt; kicks off the album in high gear. &lt;em&gt;Girl&lt;/em&gt; is what starts the movie Across the Universe. The song &lt;em&gt;In My Life&lt;/em&gt; was chosen as my senior years class song, which I was beyond touched those assholes from high school got something right. The lesser known songs are &lt;em&gt;Norwegian Wood&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Michelle&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Word&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next is “Revolver”, which quite frankly, is a masterpiece. Let me just list some amazing grade A songs: &lt;em&gt;Taxman&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Eleanor Rigsby&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Got To Get You Into My Life&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Yellow Submarine&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Good Day Sunshine&lt;/em&gt;. You see a transition in this album towards an even more new robust sound that is electrifying to the masses. Look to songs &lt;em&gt;Tomorrow Never Knows&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Im Only Sleeping&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;And Your Bird Can Sing&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;She Said She Said&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Here, There and Everywhere&lt;/em&gt; for those deep cuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok now is time for “Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band” truly another masterpiece. The Beatles went in a totally new direction with this album doing quite literally anything they wanted with music. I have this record in original vinyl pressing, I &lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; this album. The whole thing start to finish is great. Here’s a massive list of hits off the album: &lt;em&gt;Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;With A Little Help From My Friends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Getting Better&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;A Day in The Life&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Being For The Benefit Of Mr.Kite&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;When Im Sixty Four&lt;/em&gt;. Trip out to &lt;em&gt;Within You Without You&lt;/em&gt; with some small cuts with &lt;em&gt;Lovely Rita&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Fixing A Hole&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Magical Mystery Tour” is the peak of the Beatles writing dreamy beautiful, trippy and outlandish songs. Such dreamy imagery displayed in &lt;em&gt;I Am The Walrus&lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Strawberry Fields Forever&lt;/em&gt;. Of course no one can forget such timeless classics like &lt;em&gt;Hello, Goodbye&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;All You Need Is Love&lt;/em&gt;. Lesser known tracks are &lt;em&gt;Penny Lane&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Magical Mystery Tour&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Fool On The Hill&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, this is a huge album “The White Album”. This is a favorite album, mostly because of how underrated it is and chalk full of low key hits. The Beatles made this album after their famous trip to India for meditations insight with Indian gurus. So, naturally, when they came back they were overflowing with creativity as evident by the staggering 31 song album colored only white. Seriously just give this album some time to go through, it has unanimous favorites like &lt;em&gt;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Why Don’t We Do It In The Road?&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Blackbird&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dear Prudence&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Helter Skelter&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Revolution 1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Happiness Is A Warm Gun&lt;/em&gt; plus more. There is too many deep cuts here to list but please dive through this album. Strangely enough I even enjoy the slightly scary recording of &lt;em&gt;Revolution 9&lt;/em&gt;which sounds like a bad trip in audio form.&lt;/p&gt;

Darling&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;I Want You (She’s So Heavy)&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Here Comes The Sun&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Because&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;She Came In Through The Bathroom Window&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Carry That Weight&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Golden Slumbers&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The End&lt;/em&gt;. I especially love the last line in the &lt;em&gt;The End&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;“In the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Let It Be” was released in 1980 after the band broke up. No one can forget about amazing songs like &lt;em&gt;Let It Be&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Long And Winding Road&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Across The Universe&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Get Back&lt;/em&gt;. I just wish John could see how far his reach had become. I wanted him to know he made a difference to so many countless people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul himself kept making music over the years especially with his band the Wings and occasionally strikes gold with his solo stuff, such as &lt;em&gt;Live And Let Die&lt;/em&gt; which has an awesome heavy fireworks show attached to it.

,ansible,"Hi everyone, 

I'm trying to figure out how feasable managing my Dell Powerconnect N-series (2000/3000/4000) environment is. 

So far I have been able to: login to my switches with ansible, pull facts, push configurations and commands which tells me this will probably work. 

However I am encountering a major hurdle 'writing' my configuration to the switches memory, so everything preserves on reboot.

So far I have found two documented methods of doing this; both are meeting with failure

Method 1: trigger a save on a playbook condition when the condition changes. using the built in 'save' function of dellos6_config this play successfully pushes the change, identifies when it doesn't need to, and completes. when in debug mode, it seems to claim that it successfully saved, but it doesn't. the config is not saved, and if i reboot the switch the change does not stick

Method 1 example play: 

*see pastebin at the bottom of this post

---

Method 2: use the command method found here: https://github.com/Dell-Networking/ansible-dellos-examples/blob/master/handle_prompt_os6.yaml ; this method fails with a barfy error:     ""An exception occurred during task execution. To see the full traceback, use -vvv. The error was: AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'issubset'
fatal: [sw-64-grid-core10-01]: FAILED! =&gt; {""changed"": false, ""module_stderr"": ""Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \""/tmp/ansible_LVZZC6/ansible_module_dellos6_config.py\"", line 319, in &lt;module&gt;\n    main()\n  File \""/tmp/ansible_LVZZC6/ansible_module_dellos6_config.py\"", line 282, in main\n    ['prompt', 'answer'].issubset(module.params['lines'][0])):\nAttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'issubset'\n"", ""module_stdout"": """", ""msg"": ""MODULE FAILURE"", ""rc"": 1}""

Method 2 example play: 

** see pastebin at the bottom of this post

---

Method 3: notify/handler? Some bits of the dellos code would lead me to believe there is a 'handler' way of achieving this. note the line ""#   notify: save config os6"" found in this playbook: https://github.com/Dell-Networking/ansible-role-dellos-ntp/blob/master/tasks/main.yml

This leads me to believe there is a notify based method of doing this that works, but after pouring through everything I could find to do with ansible &amp; dell, I can find no example of it. 

Any thoughts reddit? Am I screwing up my syntax on these two methods, or missing something obvious? Does anyone have a working play or handler for this?

TL;DR: I want to make ansible save my Dell N-series switch config, but none of the methods I have found seem to work. 

My ansible version: 2.5.2-1 (rpm based from epel)


My ansible platform version: CentOS 7.5.1804

My dell switch type: Powerconnect N3048P

My dell switch version: 6.3.3.14 w/ CPLD 17


Happy automating!


Edit 1: it looks like reddit eats my plays formatting, so I put the two example playlists here: https://pastebin.com/tD1wwJSy 

Edit 2: example play two currently has 'answer' set to 'no', clearly this would have to set to 'yes' to actually work. however it fails and barfs the error regardless of what's here -- even if i comment out the line

Edit 3: a helpful someone told me how to properly format stuff to avoid using pastebin, I'll do that moving forward but CBA to loop back and fix this post.

Update 1: Dell says 'It's a bug' and will have a fix for me in a few days. It will find it's way into Ansible 2.6 and backport to 2.5. Will post the final fix when I have it.

FIX: 

Dell crafted me this fix, which resolves the 'second' scenario and allows the use of their 'write the config' task, which can be farmed out to a handler to only execute when it's needed, or just at the end of the playbook.

,DnD,"I just finished the best roleplaying session I've ever had. Im GMing a low level D&amp;D3.5 game set in Tolkien's Middle Earth. As such there are various restriction and such but thats not the point of this post. This is about an emotional and very fun session.
Warning! 
*Colossal text wall incoming, ready spears against charge**
Im serious this thing is taking a while to write.
(Also I won't use names because there are quite a few, I just used titles most recognizable to what they were""

   So, to set the stage. The characters; an Elven Barbarian, a Human Ranger, and a Hafling Rogue, are on a secret quest and a long journey. This session begins with the party meeting a band of hunters/trappers roaming the wilds looking for pelts. Tensions are high at first because these travelers are suspicious acting and won't tell the Hunters anything about why they are out in the middle of nowhere, a very long ways from civilization. I had already planned for the fact they the party would not get along, however I had a really good side story I wanted to tell. I didn't try to railroad the players though and instead was going to allow them to part ways and continue with the journey.
   All of that changed with some true roleplaying. During conversation with the hunters ""Elf-Barbarian"" lit a pipe from a huge bag of tobacco he had purchased in the last town. Now, the hunters had been months from civilization also and had exhausted there meager supplies of tobacco cheese and ale, however they still had bacon, which the party does not having consumed there last this morning. Thus the Elf not only offers to trade some tobacco for bacon, he also carries a spare pipe and gifts the hunters with some tobacco, this simple act of kindness would irrevocably change the PC's lives.
The PC's, having made a gift, and offered exchange, have now through simple role-play reduced the suspicion of the hunters and secure cordial relations. The PC's are now invited to the hunter's camp to join them in the mid-day meal and make an exchange of goods.
The PC's join the hunters and soon become friends (the hunters leader will be referred to as ""Father"", now two of the hunters ""Uncle"" and ""Son"" left to the North in a log canoe to check on the animal traps spread around up stream of the river and in the nearby marshlands. 
   Sometime after the two hunters leave, a huge flock of crow descends from the North on the hunters and party in camp, the birds have an unusual interest in the camp, swirling and dive from above, seeming to cackle and laugh as the wheel and call. Eventually they leave again to the North. ""Elf-Barbarian"" takes this as an ill omen and believes evil is afoot, and the party redoubles there watch lest they be surprised. Some hours later, as the sun sets, the log canoe come floating down river with the unconscious and barely alive ""Son"" laying in the bottom, an arrow stuck in his back. ""Uncle"" is nowhere to be seen and boy cannot be revived to tell them what is happening.
Now the party knows something is up but dark is coming and they realize that they must hold up here and wait.
   Night is upon the party and with that comes the attack. Three PC's plus 5 healthy ranger NPC's, vs 30 Wildmen and their chieftain. This was not a battle designed to be won. The point was to create an imposing force that would make the player think of other options other than only fighting. 
The PC's had several choices: 
#1. Defend the old ruins that made up the camp, and possibly be overrun
#2. Flee with the horses and supplies and try to cross the river at a dangerous ford, potentially getting caught in the open
#3. Leave the horses and supplies traveling only with what they could carry at moments notice, and cross (or escape down river) the river on the log raft and canoe.
#4 Load the two injured people on horse and try to escape through the forest. 
   The PC's chose the safest option #3. Quickly they formulated a solid plan which they swiftly began to execute. The PC's acted as rear guard while the Hunters escaped to the raft with the wounded. Unfortunately ""Elf-Barbarian"" was cut off and although raging, cutting enemies down left and right, he was taking some serious damage. NPC ""Father"" and PC ""Human-Ranger"" begin a counter attack against ""Elf Barbarians"" attackers. Meanwhile ""Halfling rogue stands alone firing arrows at the charging horde of 20 wild men.
The hunters (minus ""Father"") have now reached the raft and set off down stream. Just as ""Human-Ranger"" and ""Father"" break through the lines to the rescue ""Elf-Barbarian"" goes down, barely hanging onto life and unconscious. 
10 of the Wildmen charging the ""Halfling-Rogue"" have now dispersed into the forest, searching for the Rogue as he has disappeared into a tree due to some amazing stealth checks. the other ten remaining attack ""Father"" and ""Human-Ranger"" raining arrows down on the survivors finishing of their attackers. This is where things get tragic.
Unsupported against numerically superior foe with bows on open ground, things went horribly wrong. The PC ""Human-Ranger” drags “Elf-barbarian” towards the canoe as “Father” is trying to hold off the archers putting down fire of his own. A volley of arrows takes down the “Human-Ranger” with an amazing 4 hits (three of those crits) out of five dice rolled. He is slain instantly, collapsing, pierced with many arrows. The unconscious PC is now laying on the river shore. The only one standing in the immediate group is NPC “Father” seeing that “Human-Ranger” was obviously dead he bodily picks up the collapsed “Elf-Barbarian” PC and throws him into the canoe. Just as he is pushing the boat into the river a second volley cuts the injured “Father” down. I describe as the helpless Elven PC briefly regains consciousness glimpsing being pushed off shore, before blacking out again. Also i would like to note that my background ambience music playlist began playing “The Breaking of the Fellowship” from the LOTR soundtrack, at the exact moment that “Human-Ranger” was killed, it continued playing as the NPC was slain and the canoe floated off into the night born by the currents. The “Halfling Rogue” having evaded his pursuers sets off downstream to catch up with what survivors there may be. 

The emotional impact of that scene was more than I thought was possible in roleplaying. I was the DM and was unsuccessfully fighting tears, my players were stunned, and one was on the verge of tears. The PC and NPC deaths were so selfless and heroic, For my part I had poured my heart into the character and scenario and to see that this NPC family had been so violently torn apart as “Uncle” was slain, “Son” is on the verge of death, then “Father” is killed. If the “Son” ever recovers he will have to deal with such a loss. The PC “Elf-Barbarian” has been deeply affected by what he saw, and the sacrifice made for him. The Player for the “Human-Ranger” loved the dramatic and heroic death also.

That scenario was really the first session where I realized the awesome potential in roleplaying, and I was hooked on GMing. I've been a GM for over 4 years and while we always had fun and I like GMing I preferred the chances I got to be a player. I never understood before this session just how amazing my role is.

Edit: I have since played the follow up session, and while I wrote this several weeks ago I did not post it because I was busy with finals prep, I still wanted to share my experience with you all so I haven't edited this, as I wrote the post with memories and emotions still fresh in my mind.

,Stims,"Tl/Dr: fucking read it or don't.

I DO NOT ADVISE ANY OF YOU TO DO ANYTHING I EVER POST. I HAVE BEEN FOOLISH FOR MOST OF MY LIFE. BEING FOOLISH IS NO EXCUSE.
DO NOT GET HIGH OR DRUNK AND DRIVE. DON'T BE THAT FUCKFACE.

I made this account just for story purposes. 

This is the truth and these are my...
# My Druggie Confessionals

......................................................................................



When trying to think of what to share next I couldn't get past mentally recalling my latest encounter with psychosis. 

I'm no stranger to pushing limits, I love it. Finding what could possibly break myself is the best part of getting high on absolutely anything. 

I had been up 2 days before this night changed my life, binging on free Adderall.

A long time friend of mine, was always obsessed with a weapon of mine. My first gun. The plinker. The forever missed, now. My 25 round, .22LR semi auto AR style rifle. The baby brother to my 25 round, .223 S&amp;W AR-15.

The cheapest and most fun thing I've bought that actually lasted longer than the next day. Anyways, I had to sell it or risk not getting high. I hate myself for this.

 The time had come. It was in my possession from the time before I was married, became to call a car my home and then back to moving into my families house again. I honestly miss it. Selling it taught me a lesson.

I notified my friend that I was going to let it go and he was to get ""first dibs"" if he'd like to buy it. He immediately wrote back showing interest.

Within 2 hours I met him at a local hotel where he was essentially ""trapping"" meth out of, like usual. The agreement was $200 and when I arrived I was handed $100 and an 8ball of the devils dandruff. 

I didn't want it honestly. I needed money. I wanted Suboxone, cigarettes and gas. Enough to get me out of this cycle for at least a week or two and still have money to spend time with my girlfriend. I told him this and he understood, but other than the ole Franklin... He was tapped out due to needing a re-up.

Upon arriving at the hotel, I had another friend blowing up my phone almost as soon as he handed the cash and bag to me for inspection. She wanted meth. It was really odd and somewhat out of character. I hadn't told anyone I was even around it. That sealed my fate itself. It was sold.

I got home and immediately split up the bag into smaller, $20s.

""2 for sale, 1 to rail"" I muttered to myself until the bag was divided.

Meeting up with my other friend I sold a bit over a gram and then proceeded to use her counter and money to shove my nose full of psychosis. I did nearly a gram line. I had made my over $200 already. 

Fuck it. It's fun time. I've never did that much at once before. I probably will again though if I'm being honest. It was a life lesson in a nostril.

Within 10 minutes I was dripping wet. Tears had ran out of my eye, damn near leaving a spot so large on my shirt that it looked like I split water on the collar. My words became jumbled. I was geeked. 

# *Ding* 

A text from my loved one. Fuck. How could I fucking do this before I saw her tonight? I'm such an idiot. She'd fucking kill me and her brother for this. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

I don't lie to my girlfriend. She doesn't lie to me. Well, I definitely do lie about methamphetamine. That's it though, truly. I don't want to lose her because I do shit like this from time to time. I love her.

I put on my game face, completely unaware of what was in store, told my friend I'd see her later and thank you for the business and then proceeded to my girlfriends home.

10 miles away from where she was nearly took an hour for me to drive to. I was fucking flying, but I was getting nowhere. Every block I drove caused me to pull into a gas station, a business or a driveway. The police. 

Every fucking time I overdo ole Tina, the first indication that I know I'm gonna turn into a monster is extreme paranoia ahout the police.

To top it off, it was later in the evening, my eyesight is fairly shitty, I'm higher than an aliens nipples, I have no license, the car isn't in my name, no insurance, no license plates, as usual I had a warrant and now I have to act like I'm not a 100% less AIDsy heterosexual Charlie Sheen. But, at this moment, I am.

Never once actually seeing a police officer, I pull into my girlfriends house. I have 3 polar pops in my car. One in one hand, two in the cup holder. I kept buying them on my way over to ""look normal"".  

# I'm not.

I'm not going to bore you to death with the lovey dovey shit from her house, especially seeing as we ended the night and seeing each other with a fight. I somehow pulled it off though, blaming my heartbeat that could double as drumline on my actual heart issue. I was relieved, but you couldn't tell how relaxed that made me. I was also relieved we were arguing now, always over something stupid, and that I could bury my lie in anger.

On my way home, I stopped at my best friend's house and then decided to *do more speeeeeeeeeeddddddd*

 I'm a fairly intelligent idiot. Did I mention that?

# By the order of the Jarl, stop right there! You have committed crimes against Skyrim and her people. What say you in defense?

Laughter that is common when we are all together became sinister. Something was wrong.

""Could it be the the copious amounts-o-shard?"" Nay.

It's never the drugs fault. These people who I've known for over a decade aren't friends. They have been using this time to plan my demise. They poisoned my water.
(They didn't)


I run to the bathroom, throwing up stomach acid and possibly arsenic water tainted water. My friend asks if I'm okay from the other side of the door. I am silent. 

""Think. Did any of them get near the water?"" I search the corners of my mind. ""Fuck! I gotta get out of here""

I bolt out of the house. I needed to be sure they did something before I retaliated and I wasn't sure. I was willing to die rather than kill my friend and I'm so fucking grateful for this because the thought truly crossed my mind. He would've never seen it coming and honestly no one in that house would have a chance. As I said, I'm a monster on binges like this. This is why I only buy $20-$50 at a time.

My phone rings. It's them. Tears steam my face because I'm not sure what's real. I've never experienced this and definitely never expected to. They are family to me. He's my unrelated brother. The others in the house I can also say the same for, besides one woman who is an unrelated sister to me. In my eyes and to their admittance.

(This is also the fastest I've ever experienced a bout with psychosis. It starts on late day 4 and is full blown late day 5 for me and I try to never make it there surrounded by anyone but myself)

I don't give a shit about the police lurking, stalking me on the long ride home. I need to know what I'm dealing with. I need sanity. Headlights behind me that remind me of his truck appear on a dark road a mile from my house. My phone rings again.

""Bring it to the fuck on! We were family you cocksucking piece of shit"" I yell into my phone as I pull into my driveway.
The truck creeps by, but I couldn't see it well enough. 

I walked inside.

There is no sanity to be found. Only my AR-15 and a quick bump of stalactite.

Loading up, as I know my friend is also a gun lover and could possibly come to finish the job since I thwarted his poison plan, I pulled a lawn chair to my front porch and sat in the freezing cold with enough rounds to start a war and end everyone on my side of town.

The truck rumbles by again. I can still remember that exhaust. It's identical to my friends and I still hear it today. In the same house.

I point my rifle at the truck as it FLYS by after seeing me.

""That's what the fuck I thought"" echo's behind it. I notice myself saying this when giving people ultimatums or overall being a shitty person at times, luckily rarely.

Rising out of the chair at every sound. Ready to die and take em with me. If war is war then war it is.
That goddamn truck drove by again. I had enough.

I jumped into my car, so irresponsibly that it's gross, with a small .380 pistol, 24 rounds total and made my way to the back roads, hunting a ghost. 

I am so fucking lucky at this point and honestly I'm not sure why God himself didn't strike me from this planet when I got into my car, but I pulled into gas station and lost my gun. Someone stole it out of my car as I walked in to get my final pack of cigarettes on this Earth. 

I broke down. Life was over and I've done nothing but disappoint everyone I've ever loved and that's not a long list of people. I've squandered my life away and the only friend's I can truly call friend's are trying to kill me. My girlfriend is asleep and I can't say goodbye. I'm all alone with a bag of dope and nothing else but a phone thats being texted.

""Dude wtf? You ok? What happened""

*""You know what fucking happened. Just finish this.""*

""Dog idk WTF ur talking about, where are you?""

Fuck this. I wish I had my gun. I'd kill myself. Someone needs to come back and finish the job. I don't even want to kill whose after me. I just wanted to scare them away and out of my life. 

I began praying to a God that I hope is out there. The same prayer I've prayed ever since I was a child honestly.

""Please, just end this. Let me go. I don't want to be here anymore. I'm not built for this place. I've been a lowly piece of shit for what you made me to be. Please do everyone a favor and take me away. I hate this fucking rock and everything on it.""

A song plays from my playlist on my Bluetooth radio in the car. 

MGK - Home.

**""Home**


**A place where I can go**

**To take this off my shoulders**


**Someone take me home**


**Home**


**A place where I can go**


**To take this off my shoulders**


**Someone take me home**


**Someone take me""**


It's funny that sometimes little shit like that happens when you're in a bad, bad place. I can recall a few other moments that a sign was given throughout my life. Whether it be imaginary, real or coincidence. It doesn't matter. It was enough.

# I was going home, to go home.

As I pulled into my driveway I called the police to tell them my gun was stolen, denying requests to come in to give the serial number and fill out the paperwork, and I locked my door behind me as I kneeled on my floor in front of it and continued my prayer.

A good amount of time I did this before I raided my bathroom cabinets and took an entire bottle of 20+ Tyenol PMs as I returned to my spot in front of the door.

My heart didn't know what to do that this point. I faded in and out of consciousness. Each time I can remember little flashes of my view of my kitchen cabinets and my heart stopping completely and then pumping once more before I returned to darkness.

I woke nearly 2 days later. Stiff. Sore. Hurt physically and emotionally. So many texts of confusion. My girlfriend thought I was in jail and spent one day calling around to see where I was, thinking the worst of my well being. 
My friend hurt that I thought he tried to kill me, I had texted him to tell him to finish the job before I did and stopped responding. He actually showed up at my house to see if I was okay, but couldn't get in and didn't want to have me arrested which was inevitable had he called police. I later found my pistol. I was too high to remember where I put it at the time.

This is my second worst decision of my life. Falling in love with a crystal mistress. She made me reckless, wicked, dangerous and cold. She taught me a lesson I'll never forget.

Don't push limits with substances so strong. I did irreversible shit during that time. I have spasms in my arms, hands and neck still to this day from that night a couple months ago. Writing these honestly takes a bit of time because my thumb will jerk and cause errors. I barely speak to anyone in that house out of embarrassment. I further disappointed myself and my loved ones and I could've really hurt someone over nothing.

Everyone likes to joke on here about how great meth is, I'm here to show you the truth. It's fun. It's exciting. It's everything everyone says, but it's also misery and evil when you push your limits.

I tell people to stay safe in a lot of my messages and posts on here because of experiences like this. I never was and it could've lead to a serious negative outcome.

Sorry if this wasn't what you expected. It may be poorly written, it may shed a light on me that I'm a bad guy. I'm not. I'm just here to tell you don't do what you know can hurt someone. Think long and hard before you make your choice because you might be lucky or, even a higher possibility, you may be unlucky.

# Stay safe.

&lt;p&gt;This is the truth and these are my...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;My Druggie Confessionals&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;......................................................................................&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When trying to think of what to share next I couldn&amp;#39;t get past mentally recalling my latest encounter with psychosis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m no stranger to pushing limits, I love it. Finding what could possibly break myself is the best part of getting high on absolutely anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been up 2 days before this night changed my life, binging on free Adderall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long time friend of mine, was always obsessed with a weapon of mine. My first gun. The plinker. The forever missed, now. My 25 round, .22LR semi auto AR style rifle. The baby brother to my 25 round, .223 S&amp;amp;W AR-15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cheapest and most fun thing I&amp;#39;ve bought that actually lasted longer than the next day. Anyways, I had to sell it or risk not getting high. I hate myself for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time had come. It was in my possession from the time before I was married, became to call a car my home and then back to moving into my families house again. I honestly miss it. Selling it taught me a lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I notified my friend that I was going to let it go and he was to get &amp;quot;first dibs&amp;quot; if he&amp;#39;d like to buy it. He immediately wrote back showing interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within 2 hours I met him at a local hotel where he was essentially &amp;quot;trapping&amp;quot; meth out of, like usual. The agreement was $200 and when I arrived I was handed $100 and an 8ball of the devils dandruff. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t want it honestly. I needed money. I wanted Suboxone, cigarettes and gas. Enough to get me out of this cycle for at least a week or two and still have money to spend time with my girlfriend. I told him this and he understood, but other than the ole Franklin... He was tapped out due to needing a re-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon arriving at the hotel, I had another friend blowing up my phone almost as soon as he handed the cash and bag to me for inspection. She wanted meth. It was really odd and somewhat out of character. I hadn&amp;#39;t told anyone I was even around it. That sealed my fate itself. It was sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got home and immediately split up the bag into smaller, $20s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;2 for sale, 1 to rail&amp;quot; I muttered to myself until the bag was divided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting up with my other friend I sold a bit over a gram and then proceeded to use her counter and money to shove my nose full of psychosis. I did nearly a gram line. I had made my over $200 already. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck it. It&amp;#39;s fun time. I&amp;#39;ve never did that much at once before. I probably will again though if I&amp;#39;m being honest. It was a life lesson in a nostril.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within 10 minutes I was dripping wet. Tears had ran out of my eye, damn near leaving a spot so large on my shirt that it looked like I split water on the collar. My words became jumbled. I was geeked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ding&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A text from my loved one. Fuck. How could I fucking do this before I saw her tonight? I&amp;#39;m such an idiot. She&amp;#39;d fucking kill me and her brother for this. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t lie to my girlfriend. She doesn&amp;#39;t lie to me. Well, I definitely do lie about methamphetamine. That&amp;#39;s it though, truly. I don&amp;#39;t want to lose her because I do shit like this from time to time. I love her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put on my game face, completely unaware of what was in store, told my friend I&amp;#39;d see her later and thank you for the business and then proceeded to my girlfriends home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10 miles away from where she was nearly took an hour for me to drive to. I was fucking flying, but I was getting nowhere. Every block I drove caused me to pull into a gas station, a business or a driveway. The police. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every fucking time I overdo ole Tina, the first indication that I know I&amp;#39;m gonna turn into a monster is extreme paranoia ahout the police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To top it off, it was later in the evening, my eyesight is fairly shitty, I&amp;#39;m higher than an aliens nipples, I have no license, the car isn&amp;#39;t in my name, no insurance, no license plates, as usual I had a warrant and now I have to act like I&amp;#39;m not a 100% less AIDsy heterosexual Charlie Sheen. But, at this moment, I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never once actually seeing a police officer, I pull into my girlfriends house. I have 3 polar pops in my car. One in one hand, two in the cup holder. I kept buying them on my way over to &amp;quot;look normal&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;I&amp;#39;m not.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not going to bore you to death with the lovey dovey shit from her house, especially seeing as we ended the night and seeing each other with a fight. I somehow pulled it off though, blaming my heartbeat that could double as drumline on my actual heart issue. I was relieved, but you couldn&amp;#39;t tell how relaxed that made me. I was also relieved we were arguing now, always over something stupid, and that I could bury my lie in anger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my way home, I stopped at my best friend&amp;#39;s house and then decided to &lt;em&gt;do more speeeeeeeeeeddddddd&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a fairly intelligent idiot. Did I mention that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;By the order of the Jarl, stop right there! You have committed crimes against Skyrim and her people. What say you in defense?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laughter that is common when we are all together became sinister. Something was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Could it be the the copious amounts-o-shard?&amp;quot; Nay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s never the drugs fault. These people who I&amp;#39;ve known for over a decade aren&amp;#39;t friends. They have been using this time to plan my demise. They poisoned my water.
(They didn&amp;#39;t)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I run to the bathroom, throwing up stomach acid and possibly arsenic water tainted water. My friend asks if I&amp;#39;m okay from the other side of the door. I am silent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Think. Did any of them get near the water?&amp;quot; I search the corners of my mind. &amp;quot;Fuck! I gotta get out of here&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bolt out of the house. I needed to be sure they did something before I retaliated and I wasn&amp;#39;t sure. I was willing to die rather than kill my friend and I&amp;#39;m so fucking grateful for this because the thought truly crossed my mind. He would&amp;#39;ve never seen it coming and honestly no one in that house would have a chance. As I said, I&amp;#39;m a monster on binges like this. This is why I only buy $20-$50 at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My phone rings. It&amp;#39;s them. Tears steam my face because I&amp;#39;m not sure what&amp;#39;s real. I&amp;#39;ve never experienced this and definitely never expected to. They are family to me. He&amp;#39;s my unrelated brother. The others in the house I can also say the same for, besides one woman who is an unrelated sister to me. In my eyes and to their admittance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This is also the fastest I&amp;#39;ve ever experienced a bout with psychosis. It starts on late day 4 and is full blown late day 5 for me and I try to never make it there surrounded by anyone but myself)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t give a shit about the police lurking, stalking me on the long ride home. I need to know what I&amp;#39;m dealing with. I need sanity. Headlights behind me that remind me of his truck appear on a dark road a mile from my house. My phone rings again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Bring it to the fuck on! We were family you cocksucking piece of shit&amp;quot; I yell into my phone as I pull into my driveway.
The truck creeps by, but I couldn&amp;#39;t see it well enough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no sanity to be found. Only my AR-15 and a quick bump of stalactite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loading up, as I know my friend is also a gun lover and could possibly come to finish the job since I thwarted his poison plan, I pulled a lawn chair to my front porch and sat in the freezing cold with enough rounds to start a war and end everyone on my side of town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truck rumbles by again. I can still remember that exhaust. It&amp;#39;s identical to my friends and I still hear it today. In the same house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I point my rifle at the truck as it FLYS by after seeing me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s what the fuck I thought&amp;quot; echo&amp;#39;s behind it. I notice myself saying this when giving people ultimatums or overall being a shitty person at times, luckily rarely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rising out of the chair at every sound. Ready to die and take em with me. If war is war then war it is.
That goddamn truck drove by again. I had enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I jumped into my car, so irresponsibly that it&amp;#39;s gross, with a small .380 pistol, 24 rounds total and made my way to the back roads, hunting a ghost. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am so fucking lucky at this point and honestly I&amp;#39;m not sure why God himself didn&amp;#39;t strike me from this planet when I got into my car, but I pulled into gas station and lost my gun. Someone stole it out of my car as I walked in to get my final pack of cigarettes on this Earth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I broke down. Life was over and I&amp;#39;ve done nothing but disappoint everyone I&amp;#39;ve ever loved and that&amp;#39;s not a long list of people. I&amp;#39;ve squandered my life away and the only friend&amp;#39;s I can truly call friend&amp;#39;s are trying to kill me. My girlfriend is asleep and I can&amp;#39;t say goodbye. I&amp;#39;m all alone with a bag of dope and nothing else but a phone thats being texted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dude wtf? You ok? What happened&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;You know what fucking happened. Just finish this.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dog idk WTF ur talking about, where are you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck this. I wish I had my gun. I&amp;#39;d kill myself. Someone needs to come back and finish the job. I don&amp;#39;t even want to kill whose after me. I just wanted to scare them away and out of my life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To take this off my shoulders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Someone take me home&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Home&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A place where I can go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To take this off my shoulders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Someone take me home&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

# My Druggie Confessionals

......................................................................................



When trying to think of what to share next I couldn't get past mentally recalling my latest encounter with psychosis. 

I'm no stranger to pushing limits, I love it. Finding what could possibly break myself is the best part of getting high on absolutely anything. 

I had been up 2 days before this night changed my life, binging on free Adderall.

A long time friend of mine, was always obsessed with a weapon of mine. My first gun. The plinker. The forever missed, now. My 25 round, .22LR semi auto AR style rifle. The baby brother to my 25 round, .223 S&amp;W AR-15.

The cheapest and most fun thing I've bought that actually lasted longer than the next day. Anyways, I had to sell it or risk not getting high. I hate myself for this.

 The time had come. It was in my possession from the time before I was married, became to call a car my home and then back to moving into my families house again. I honestly miss it. Selling it taught me a lesson.

I notified my friend that I was going to let it go and he was to get ""first dibs"" if he'd like to buy it. He immediately wrote back showing interest.

Within 2 hours I met him at a local hotel where he was essentially ""trapping"" meth out of, like usual. The agreement was $200 and when I arrived I was handed $100 and an 8ball of the devils dandruff. 

I didn't want it honestly. I needed money. I wanted Suboxone, cigarettes and gas. Enough to get me out of this cycle for at least a week or two and still have money to spend time with my girlfriend. I told him this and he understood, but other than the ole Franklin... He was tapped out due to needing a re-up.

Upon arriving at the hotel, I had another friend blowing up my phone almost as soon as he handed the cash and bag to me for inspection. She wanted meth. It was really odd and somewhat out of character. I hadn't told anyone I was even around it. That sealed my fate itself. It was sold.

I got home and immediately split up the bag into smaller, $20s.

""2 for sale, 1 to rail"" I muttered to myself until the bag was divided.

Meeting up with my other friend I sold a bit over a gram and then proceeded to use her counter and money to shove my nose full of psychosis. I did nearly a gram line. I had made my over $200 already. 

Fuck it. It's fun time. I've never did that much at once before. I probably will again though if I'm being honest. It was a life lesson in a nostril.

Within 10 minutes I was dripping wet. Tears had ran out of my eye, damn near leaving a spot so large on my shirt that it looked like I split water on the collar. My words became jumbled. I was geeked. 

# *Ding* 

A text from my loved one. Fuck. How could I fucking do this before I saw her tonight? I'm such an idiot. She'd fucking kill me and her brother for this. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

I don't lie to my girlfriend. She doesn't lie to me. Well, I definitely do lie about methamphetamine. That's it though, truly. I don't want to lose her because I do shit like this from time to time. I love her.

I put on my game face, completely unaware of what was in store, told my friend I'd see her later and thank you for the business and then proceeded to my girlfriends home.

10 miles away from where she was nearly took an hour for me to drive to. I was fucking flying, but I was getting nowhere. Every block I drove caused me to pull into a gas station, a business or a driveway. The police. 

Every fucking time I overdo ole Tina, the first indication that I know I'm gonna turn into a monster is extreme paranoia ahout the police.

To top it off, it was later in the evening, my eyesight is fairly shitty, I'm higher than an aliens nipples, I have no license, the car isn't in my name, no insurance, no license plates, as usual I had a warrant and now I have to act like I'm not a 100% less AIDsy heterosexual Charlie Sheen. But, at this moment, I am.

Never once actually seeing a police officer, I pull into my girlfriends house. I have 3 polar pops in my car. One in one hand, two in the cup holder. I kept buying them on my way over to ""look normal"".  

# I'm not.

I'm not going to bore you to death with the lovey dovey shit from her house, especially seeing as we ended the night and seeing each other with a fight. I somehow pulled it off though, blaming my heartbeat that could double as drumline on my actual heart issue. I was relieved, but you couldn't tell how relaxed that made me. I was also relieved we were arguing now, always over something stupid, and that I could bury my lie in anger.

On my way home, I stopped at my best friend's house and then decided to *do more speeeeeeeeeeddddddd*

 I'm a fairly intelligent idiot. Did I mention that?

# By the order of the Jarl, stop right there! You have committed crimes against Skyrim and her people. What say you in defense?

Laughter that is common when we are all together became sinister. Something was wrong.

""Could it be the the copious amounts-o-shard?"" Nay.

It's never the drugs fault. These people who I've known for over a decade aren't friends. They have been using this time to plan my demise. They poisoned my water.
(They didn't)


I run to the bathroom, throwing up stomach acid and possibly arsenic water tainted water. My friend asks if I'm okay from the other side of the door. I am silent. 

""Think. Did any of them get near the water?"" I search the corners of my mind. ""Fuck! I gotta get out of here""

I bolt out of the house. I needed to be sure they did something before I retaliated and I wasn't sure. I was willing to die rather than kill my friend and I'm so fucking grateful for this because the thought truly crossed my mind. He would've never seen it coming and honestly no one in that house would have a chance. As I said, I'm a monster on binges like this. This is why I only buy $20-$50 at a time.

My phone rings. It's them. Tears steam my face because I'm not sure what's real. I've never experienced this and definitely never expected to. They are family to me. He's my unrelated brother. The others in the house I can also say the same for, besides one woman who is an unrelated sister to me. In my eyes and to their admittance.

(This is also the fastest I've ever experienced a bout with psychosis. It starts on late day 4 and is full blown late day 5 for me and I try to never make it there surrounded by anyone but myself)

I don't give a shit about the police lurking, stalking me on the long ride home. I need to know what I'm dealing with. I need sanity. Headlights behind me that remind me of his truck appear on a dark road a mile from my house. My phone rings again.

""Bring it to the fuck on! We were family you cocksucking piece of shit"" I yell into my phone as I pull into my driveway.
The truck creeps by, but I couldn't see it well enough. 

I walked inside.

There is no sanity to be found. Only my AR-15 and a quick bump of stalactite.

Loading up, as I know my friend is also a gun lover and could possibly come to finish the job since I thwarted his poison plan, I pulled a lawn chair to my front porch and sat in the freezing cold with enough rounds to start a war and end everyone on my side of town.

The truck rumbles by again. I can still remember that exhaust. It's identical to my friends and I still hear it today. In the same house.

I point my rifle at the truck as it FLYS by after seeing me.

""That's what the fuck I thought"" echo's behind it. I notice myself saying this when giving people ultimatums or overall being a shitty person at times, luckily rarely.

Rising out of the chair at every sound. Ready to die and take em with me. If war is war then war it is.
That goddamn truck drove by again. I had enough.

I jumped into my car, so irresponsibly that it's gross, with a small .380 pistol, 24 rounds total and made my way to the back roads, hunting a ghost. 

I am so fucking lucky at this point and honestly I'm not sure why God himself didn't strike me from this planet when I got into my car, but I pulled into gas station and lost my gun. Someone stole it out of my car as I walked in to get my final pack of cigarettes on this Earth. 

I broke down. Life was over and I've done nothing but disappoint everyone I've ever loved and that's not a long list of people. I've squandered my life away and the only friend's I can truly call friend's are trying to kill me. My girlfriend is asleep and I can't say goodbye. I'm all alone with a bag of dope and nothing else but a phone thats being texted.

""Dude wtf? You ok? What happened""

*""You know what fucking happened. Just finish this.""*

""Dog idk WTF ur talking about, where are you?""

Fuck this. I wish I had my gun. I'd kill myself. Someone needs to come back and finish the job. I don't even want to kill whose after me. I just wanted to scare them away and out of my life. 

I began praying to a God that I hope is out there. The same prayer I've prayed ever since I was a child honestly.

""Please, just end this. Let me go. I don't want to be here anymore. I'm not built for this place. I've been a lowly piece of shit for what you made me to be. Please do everyone a favor and take me away. I hate this fucking rock and everything on it.""

A song plays from my playlist on my Bluetooth radio in the car. 

MGK - Home.

**""Home**


**A place where I can go**

**To take this off my shoulders**


**Someone take me home**


**Home**


**A place where I can go**


**To take this off my shoulders**


**Someone take me home**


**Someone take me""**


It's funny that sometimes little shit like that happens when you're in a bad, bad place. I can recall a few other moments that a sign was given throughout my life. Whether it be imaginary, real or coincidence. It doesn't matter. It was enough.

# I was going home, to go home.

As I pulled into my driveway I called the police to tell them my gun was stolen, denying requests to come in to give the serial number and fill out the paperwork, and I locked my door behind me as I kneeled on my floor in front of it and continued my prayer.

A good amount of time I did this before I raided my bathroom cabinets and took an entire bottle of 20+ Tyenol PMs as I returned to my spot in front of the door.

My heart didn't know what to do that this point. I faded in and out of consciousness. Each time I can remember little flashes of my view of my kitchen cabinets and my heart stopping completely and then pumping once more before I returned to darkness.

I woke nearly 2 days later. Stiff. Sore. Hurt physically and emotionally. So many texts of confusion. My girlfriend thought I was in jail and spent one day calling around to see where I was, thinking the worst of my well being. 
My friend hurt that I thought he tried to kill me, I had texted him to tell him to finish the job before I did and stopped responding. He actually showed up at my house to see if I was okay, but couldn't get in and didn't want to have me arrested which was inevitable had he called police. I later found my pistol. I was too high to remember where I put it at the time.

This is my second worst decision of my life. Falling in love with a crystal mistress. She made me reckless, wicked, dangerous and cold. She taught me a lesson I'll never forget.

Don't push limits with substances so strong. I did irreversible shit during that time. I have spasms in my arms, hands and neck still to this day from that night a couple months ago. Writing these honestly takes a bit of time because my thumb will jerk and cause errors. I barely speak to anyone in that house out of embarrassment. I further disappointed myself and my loved ones and I could've really hurt someone over nothing.

Everyone likes to joke on here about how great meth is, I'm here to show you the truth. It's fun. It's exciting. It's everything everyone says, but it's also misery and evil when you push your limits.

I tell people to stay safe in a lot of my messages and posts on here because of experiences like this. I never was and it could've lead to a serious negative outcome.

Sorry if this wasn't what you expected. It may be poorly written, it may shed a light on me that I'm a bad guy. I'm not. I'm just here to tell you don't do what you know can hurt someone. Think long and hard before you make your choice because you might be lucky or, even a higher possibility, you may be unlucky.

# Stay safe.

&lt;p&gt;I made this account just for story purposes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the truth and these are my...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;My Druggie Confessionals&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;......................................................................................&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When trying to think of what to share next I couldn&amp;#39;t get past mentally recalling my latest encounter with psychosis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m no stranger to pushing limits, I love it. Finding what could possibly break myself is the best part of getting high on absolutely anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been up 2 days before this night changed my life, binging on free Adderall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long time friend of mine, was always obsessed with a weapon of mine. My first gun. The plinker. The forever missed, now. My 25 round, .22LR semi auto AR style rifle. The baby brother to my 25 round, .223 S&amp;amp;W AR-15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cheapest and most fun thing I&amp;#39;ve bought that actually lasted longer than the next day. Anyways, I had to sell it or risk not getting high. I hate myself for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time had come. It was in my possession from the time before I was married, became to call a car my home and then back to moving into my families house again. I honestly miss it. Selling it taught me a lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I notified my friend that I was going to let it go and he was to get &amp;quot;first dibs&amp;quot; if he&amp;#39;d like to buy it. He immediately wrote back showing interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within 2 hours I met him at a local hotel where he was essentially &amp;quot;trapping&amp;quot; meth out of, like usual. The agreement was $200 and when I arrived I was handed $100 and an 8ball of the devils dandruff. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t want it honestly. I needed money. I wanted Suboxone, cigarettes and gas. Enough to get me out of this cycle for at least a week or two and still have money to spend time with my girlfriend. I told him this and he understood, but other than the ole Franklin... He was tapped out due to needing a re-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon arriving at the hotel, I had another friend blowing up my phone almost as soon as he handed the cash and bag to me for inspection. She wanted meth. It was really odd and somewhat out of character. I hadn&amp;#39;t told anyone I was even around it. That sealed my fate itself. It was sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got home and immediately split up the bag into smaller, $20s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;2 for sale, 1 to rail&amp;quot; I muttered to myself until the bag was divided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting up with my other friend I sold a bit over a gram and then proceeded to use her counter and money to shove my nose full of psychosis. I did nearly a gram line. I had made my over $200 already. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck it. It&amp;#39;s fun time. I&amp;#39;ve never did that much at once before. I probably will again though if I&amp;#39;m being honest. It was a life lesson in a nostril.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within 10 minutes I was dripping wet. Tears had ran out of my eye, damn near leaving a spot so large on my shirt that it looked like I split water on the collar. My words became jumbled. I was geeked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ding&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A text from my loved one. Fuck. How could I fucking do this before I saw her tonight? I&amp;#39;m such an idiot. She&amp;#39;d fucking kill me and her brother for this. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t lie to my girlfriend. She doesn&amp;#39;t lie to me. Well, I definitely do lie about methamphetamine. That&amp;#39;s it though, truly. I don&amp;#39;t want to lose her because I do shit like this from time to time. I love her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put on my game face, completely unaware of what was in store, told my friend I&amp;#39;d see her later and thank you for the business and then proceeded to my girlfriends home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10 miles away from where she was nearly took an hour for me to drive to. I was fucking flying, but I was getting nowhere. Every block I drove caused me to pull into a gas station, a business or a driveway. The police. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every fucking time I overdo ole Tina, the first indication that I know I&amp;#39;m gonna turn into a monster is extreme paranoia ahout the police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To top it off, it was later in the evening, my eyesight is fairly shitty, I&amp;#39;m higher than an aliens nipples, I have no license, the car isn&amp;#39;t in my name, no insurance, no license plates, as usual I had a warrant and now I have to act like I&amp;#39;m not a 100% less AIDsy heterosexual Charlie Sheen. But, at this moment, I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never once actually seeing a police officer, I pull into my girlfriends house. I have 3 polar pops in my car. One in one hand, two in the cup holder. I kept buying them on my way over to &amp;quot;look normal&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;I&amp;#39;m not.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not going to bore you to death with the lovey dovey shit from her house, especially seeing as we ended the night and seeing each other with a fight. I somehow pulled it off though, blaming my heartbeat that could double as drumline on my actual heart issue. I was relieved, but you couldn&amp;#39;t tell how relaxed that made me. I was also relieved we were arguing now, always over something stupid, and that I could bury my lie in anger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my way home, I stopped at my best friend&amp;#39;s house and then decided to &lt;em&gt;do more speeeeeeeeeeddddddd&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a fairly intelligent idiot. Did I mention that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;By the order of the Jarl, stop right there! You have committed crimes against Skyrim and her people. What say you in defense?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laughter that is common when we are all together became sinister. Something was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Could it be the the copious amounts-o-shard?&amp;quot; Nay.&lt;/p&gt;

,BABYMETAL,"I started this post Monday morning on the plane ride back home from Houston. It ended up being too much to type on a phone so I continued in segments in between work and real life so I can finally bring this dissertation to you. The first two parts are aimed at the ""fence of life"" aka the first time concert goers lol. The third and final part is under ""Episode VII"" and is my review of the show I attended in Houston and the revelation I received while watching Su-Metal. Scroll all the way down if thats the only part you are interested in.

 If the bots delete this post I'll repost them in smaller segments. Caveat: It's pretty long. hahaha


**What I learned**

**Kitsune is Kitsune:**
I have yet to meet a bad one although i'm sure some may exist. They are as polite in real life as they are online. The ones I have encountered online reply to your messages with vital information; sometimes they don't reply at all but regardless of how long ts been without an answer they still reply with an apology. It isn't necessary bit it's very nice. At the venue they greeted me with smiles and acknowledged my existence which was comforting being that I was wandering the town alone the past 24 hours prior. They offered me water (critical because it was 90+ out in Houston), cookies, snacks also with memorabilia that they put their own time and money to make for you. ( I received a wristband, magnet, beer cozy, and pin) I met L-Metal and T-Metal ( I don't want to use their real names lol) and we pretty much stuck to each other for rest of the day. I thought they came together but it turns out they were both travelling alone  and became friends at the Austin show checking in their bags. It is nice to see human compassion for strangers and I wish it didn't have to take something as epic as babymetal to bring it out of people. With that being said I do not encourage you hanging out and spilling your guts to the next person wearing a babymetal t-shirt. Please use common sense in who you choose to be-friend and always stay alert to your surroundings; if you have a history of making bad decisions you shouldn't be traveling alone to begin with. Like I said I have yet to meet any kitsune like this but I won't rule out that they don't exist.

**Barrier vs Merch:**
From what I read it's almost impossible to get both done in one night but it really all depends on how the venue plans it out. After attending my first concert I can confirm picking one over the other will drastically reduce your chances for the other to happen. Commit to one and stick with it. Barrier is close to impossible without paying the premium for early entrance (The One package, VIP, VIP2,  Fastpass, then GA are the entrance order) GA guarantees you entrance and that is it. I guess there was Unicorn sighting in Houston because I was told most BM fans never saw a venue sell merch outside the venue which actually happened at the Houston venue. Inside they sold the sweaters so I guess not everything was available to the general public. Sizes are limited also so being early for merch does hold some value to it. Try not buy merch drunk I can guarantee you'll overspend lol

**GA vs Balcony (or VIP tables):**
 Without paying the premium for an early entrance getting to the barrier is impossible. If you are familiar with the culture Babymetal does encourage friendly moshing which can happen anywhere at anytime for any reason. Fans push, mosh, crowd surf, and things will be spilled on you for sure. Being a first timer to a metal concert and enjoying my personal space I opted to admire from afar as my first time before venturing to the pit where you are basically welcoming anyone to invade your personal space unwarranted AND it will definitely be your fault for the simple fact you chose to be on the floor lol. The Houston venue offered VIP tables which I heard again was rare for a BM concert because they usually only offer GA/floor or Balcony seating. For some reason they didn't offer balcony seats for this show despite having them available; at the concert and in the fan cams I saw online recording in the venue I saw a couple of people up there; not sure if they had permission for access or if they sneaked up there. From where I sat at the VIP tables I was able to get served alcohol and food while being far away enough to enjoy the show without using earplugs; I'm sure they are mandatory for the barrier and GA floor because it was still loud from where I sat but not uncomfortable. Like raging? Aim for the barrier and floor. Any other answer that isnt a yes probably means you are better off purchasing a seat rather than GA

**Skyharbor:** 
Never heard of them without Babymetal. I've read people complain about their style and how they can't get into it and I can see that. They are a far cry from the sound that is Babymetal but they still rocked in my opinion. A big plus for any concert for me is when they check in with the crowd and they repeatedly asked how Houston was doing and thanked the crowd for the opportunity on several occasions. The lead singer's growling was simply amazing and you can tell they put a lot of work into their music. Im not a metal head at all but if you asked what I think it sounds like I would probably go with Emo Metal; you can also see why they are not the best band to get you excited for babymetal lol. Their energy is easily of the higher level however on the opposite end of the spectrum of Babymetal; one makes you happy while the other makes you gloomy and I say that last part with no negativity involved at all. I have to reiterate that the growling was sensational ; in the last song the lead singer did a Marathon growl; (imagine how the announcer screams GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAL when a goal is made in soccer) and Jesus was it epic. I felt like I needed to eat a bag of Halls after seeing/hearing that. I tip my hat to them and can see why they were chosen as an opening act due to the professionalism of their craft. If you are still salty and think they suck the fact that they are able to get paid to open let alone share  a stage with Babymetal already makes their lives 100000000 X better than yours lol





**-What I would do different-**

**Plan better:**
My story goes somewhere along the lines of... 
1. Babymetal announces tour dates 
2. Purchased 3 GA tickets for myself and two other people despite not knowing if they could commit. 
3. Scared that they would not like Babymetal let alone the pit I upgrade the tickets to the VIP tables
3. They can't commit.
4. I fly into Houston not knowing what I should do before or after the show.
5. Despite posting it weeks before no one takes my offer on the tickets being for sale.
6. I upgraded T-Metal and L-Metal's (people I just met that day) GA tickets to VIP seats but end up wasting the GA tickets. I had someone ask about it when I was already in the venue and not allowed back outside but by that time I was really drunk anyways and wan't coming out anyways lol. 

The lesson here is if you are not a local then plan your trip better than I did. Because of FOMO (fear of missing out) I ended up overpaying and wasting money on tickets that no one ever used despite offering them for free several times.

**Orphan Metal:**
This is the term I use to explain someone who was supposed to with a group but everyone inin that group could not make it anymore leaving you the only person attending the show. If this is the case don't panic. The show doesn't change because you are coming with less people and I promise you it will still be just as epic. It will give you the opportunity to meet fellow kitsune that probably would not of happen if you were always just hanging with your own group of friends. If you are stuck with extra tickets like me keep posting and posting and posting until someone asks about them. A lot of the times people online just don't trust deals too good to be true but if you post it enough I'm sure someone will have to be interested. The fact I let two tickets go to waste almost feels sacrilegious. 

**Reconnaissance:** 
Next venue I go to that requires travelling great distances I will do so much recon that it will look like I'm robbing the place. If you are gunning for merch or barrier you should be pushing yourself to be there as early as possible; you are basically committing to camping outside the show. A day prior to my arrival I would study the venue's surrounding layout to see what is and isn't available to me. The revention center in Houston was connected to a string of restaurants so food and bathrooms were easily accessible. If there isnt any food available near you, try to bring food that can last you throughout the day prior to arriving. Make friends with the people standing with you because you want to establish a tag system with them because they are just as scared of losing their spot just as much as you are lol. They can hold your spot in exchange for bringing back food/snacks for all of you or tagging in and out to use the restrooms. T-Metal held our spots while I grabbed us some beer from the sushi place 30 ft away from us  lol

**Mingle more:** 
I wish I made more time to mingle . After I met T-Metal and L-Metal (people I met the same day of the concert) I spent the rest of my day with them talking about  their cultural background and even more about Babymetal (surprise). I would of been awesome to start a bigger discussion with any Kitsune that wanted in. 

**Bring a portable speaker:** 
No one was playing music while we were waiting in line at the Venue. I would of loved to play some babymetal while waiting; I would love even more to let other Kitsune request songs or link up to play their own playlists or YouTube videos. (Babymetal only please lol) Everyone had portable batteries for charging including myself and mine could charge an iphone 10 times before it begins to lose its power. Charging a small speaker would of been a piece of cake.

**Make and distribute keepsakes:** 
To me, the fan made keepsakes that fellow Kitsune make for everyone was just as important as the merch I bought. Next time I would like to create something where I could do the same. I've encountered posts where people asked for ideas of what they can do to contribute and were called childish for even entertaining the idea. To anyone reading this that wants to contribute just ignore these thoughtless a-holes. You are putting up your own time and money to share your love for something; being thoughtful and trying to make people happy shouldn't be limited to only Babymetal and are quality traits that you should change for no one but yourself.





**Episode VII:**

The good: New music. 
The bad: The addition of the chosen VII and straying from original format of it being only the 3 girls.
The Queen: She doesn't give a fuck.

The only losers here are first time concert goers who came for the trio and of course the Yui-Oshimen (literally Yui member support aka Yui Fanboys). 

**My initial perception** 
After finally getting my chance to see these legendary girls live I see a trailer saying that they are adding 7 more members. I am immediately am disappointed and can tell you that I was not looking forward to what was going to happen. Then this happened; after the first show it was confirmed that Yui was not there. Even more despair rushed my body and I immediately took my frustrations out on the two back up dancers who apparently aren't confirmed yet to be apart of the chosen 7. Everything is ruined; my first concert was going to suck and I would not get the magic I overly binged watch on the internet; the very show I bought the ticket for.


**The actual truth and why I was wrong from the start**

If you made it this far from the start I want to thank you for taking the time to read all this :) To speed this up I will add in my observations from the show as well.


**New outfits**
Think lord of the rings meets roman gladiator meets mortal combat ninja outfits. They are definitely venturing into the dark side and thats Ok with me. They are not little girls anymore and they are dressed up for he part. Still not a fan of the leather headband thing and I don't think Ill ever be. 

**New music**
The addition of distortion, elevator girl, and tattoo is the water we desperately needed from the current drought we were on prior to episode VII. It seems that ""in the name of"" is the official opener for the new tour and I do say that it brings the same build up and anticipation that Babymetal death does. It gives me that sacrificial vibe that something is going to die which is pretty much true because Su-Metal eventually murders the show in all her glory.

Distortion: Very anime OP sounding but still hard enough to rock hard to; there is a clapping part for the fans to clap with Su to and that part should get anyone hyped up. A well titled track that will always remind me of the distortion and chaos it created in BM community lol

Elevator girl: I'm sure it will grow on me because all songs from babymetal eventually do but as of right now it's my least favorite. It's a bit too bubbly and pop sounding; it reminds me of a bunch of girls shopping in the big city riding up and down elevators with several shopping bags on each arm lol Majority of baby metal songs that I play the least (note how I refuse to say songs I don't like) are the ones that focus more on the blend of other musical elements/genres (fdtd, meta taro, tales of destiny) rather than the metal ones. These blendings are cool but I fell in love with babymetal because of the Metal like Headbangerrrr, Babymetal death, Megitsune, and one of my all time favorites Syncopation. I will admit the choreography is excellent. 

Tattoo: I'll save this review for last; this song is nothing less than magical if not pure witchcraft. This will be covered under ""The Queen""

 **Absolutely Yuisless** 
My heart goes out to all the fans who came to see Yui specifically; majority of the episode 7 backlash came from this act alone. The second part that sucks is that the trio isnt complete and also means black babymetal is not as well. The ongoing joke is 3-1= 4 which is in regards to the addition to the back up dancers added. In the beginning I did not like it. I thought the change was too radical and somehow got tied in with me thinking Yui might not come back. In reality it works out really well. The back up dancers are no joke and got the choreography down to a T. They are in sync with Su and Moa and are able to mirror the girls every move; they are nothing less than sensational. I remember watching legend S and it broke my heart to see only Moa and Su performing. It was uneven like watching a monster battle while missing  a ligament. Think Mohammad Ali fighting a match missing one of his arms. Regardless the addition works out well because it allows Su to become the focal point again which was something that immediately stood out when compared to watching legend S. Adding only one dancer would be too similar to the Yui formation which already has too much attention on it due to her absence; adding 2 in my opinion was the better move because it balanced out the stage where Su is now surrounded in the middle again.

**Super Moa chan**
One of the reasons you can't be mad at the absence of Yui is because Moa goes super hard and is actually performing both parts in GJ and carrying the weight of her missing sister. She doesn't miss a beat and Maybe it could just be because this is the first time Ive ever seen her live but It seemed like she had twice the energy that I usually see her have in her other performances probably because she knows what's on the line. I may have been drunk but it was like watching a unicorn cry rainbow tears with a basket of sleeping kittens and puppies being held in it's mouth. It was truly magical lol. I can go on about Moa for days as I am her Oshimen but to say the most in the very least she lived up to every expectation I had and you can see that she doesn't let anything get in the way of doing her job. Simply amazing.

**The Queen**
So the reason why any of my thoughts on Episode 7 do not matter is because of Su-Metal alone. I never realized it until now but I am a huge fan of all her Solos especially no rain no rainbow, rondo nightmare, and of course Akatsuki. Tattoo just blew all of them away to the frog pits of Hell. This performance was Su's defining moment; declaring that she is no longer a girl but a Goddess of Metal and rock. She sways back and forth to music, head banging, rocking out carelessly, while not giving any f*cks and she looked absolutely gorgeous doing it. It felt like she sent wave after wave of middle fingers at me that scream  ""FUUUCK YOOOU"" piercing me like arrows; they rain on me mercilessly punishing me for ever doubting Babymetal and forgetting she has the ability to carry the band by herself. In minutes she diminished every doubt I had about Babymetal for the next 10 years; I awoke out of a trance forgiven and was allowed to continue to blessed by her divine vocals. It was truly that epic. Tattoo is currently my favorite babymetal song because it is simply well composed and Su's singing has just been refined to such a high level. Her bravado is of a true rocker and she just owns the every chord that song makes as if she composed it herself. I can't give this song enough praise and is also the reason I came to my revelation. If Babymetal continues to make such music the story line really doesn't matter anymore. I fell in love with Babymetal because of the music. They are the ones who introduced me to Metal and Rock and it's songs like Tattoo that put me in a euphoric rage of joy. Of course their charm, skills, and dedication play a huge part in it but it's because they manage those strengths in perfect harmony that they are able to continue being successful. Episode 7 sucks because it strays from what we are normally used to from Babymetal and leaves more questions than answers; the speculation is at all time high because of it. But I dare you to go to one of their shows and try that BS with the Queen. I love Babymetal as whole. Moa and Yui are 15 kilotons of TNT each; the Kami band is four 55 gallon drums of high octane gasoline; Su of course is the raging flame, without her the rest can't be set off. To create the explosion that is Babymetal you will need all three elements in unison. I thought episode 7 sucked because of all the changes but because of it we are now in state to cherish all of their old work which needless to say are already classics. The time is now to venture forward to new music and adventures  with your Queen wiling to take you there herself. There is no them. There is no us. There is only the one. 


If you made it to the end of this I thank you for your time in reading this; I put a lot of thought into this  post as a testament for my love of Babymetal the community involved in it.

\v/



",,False,,0,False,"3 in 1 post: Episode VII sucks and here is why you should not care: What I learned from my first Baby metal concert in H-Town, what I would do different, and how I found out Su-Metal doesn't give a f**k about how you feel about Episode VII",[],,False,6.0,,0.0,,,False,t3_8k2fda,,dark,,,public,31.0,,{},,,False,[],,False,,,{},,,31,,,,self,False,,[],,,True,,1526571206.0,text,6.0,,,text,self.BABYMETAL,,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started this post Monday morning on the plane ride back home from Houston. It ended up being too much to type on a phone so I continued in segments in between work and real life so I can finally bring this dissertation to you. The first two parts are aimed at the &amp;quot;fence of life&amp;quot; aka the first time concert goers lol. The third and final part is under &amp;quot;Episode VII&amp;quot; and is my review of the show I attended in Houston and the revelation I received while watching Su-Metal. Scroll all the way down if thats the only part you are interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the bots delete this post I&amp;#39;ll repost them in smaller segments. Caveat: It&amp;#39;s pretty long. hahaha&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I learned&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kitsune is Kitsune:&lt;/strong&gt;
I have yet to meet a bad one although i&amp;#39;m sure some may exist. They are as polite in real life as they are online. The ones I have encountered online reply to your messages with vital information; sometimes they don&amp;#39;t reply at all but regardless of how long ts been without an answer they still reply with an apology. It isn&amp;#39;t necessary bit it&amp;#39;s very nice. At the venue they greeted me with smiles and acknowledged my existence which was comforting being that I was wandering the town alone the past 24 hours prior. They offered me water (critical because it was 90+ out in Houston), cookies, snacks also with memorabilia that they put their own time and money to make for you. ( I received a wristband, magnet, beer cozy, and pin) I met L-Metal and T-Metal ( I don&amp;#39;t want to use their real names lol) and we pretty much stuck to each other for rest of the day. I thought they came together but it turns out they were both travelling alone  and became friends at the Austin show checking in their bags. It is nice to see human compassion for strangers and I wish it didn&amp;#39;t have to take something as epic as babymetal to bring it out of people. With that being said I do not encourage you hanging out and spilling your guts to the next person wearing a babymetal t-shirt. Please use common sense in who you choose to be-friend and always stay alert to your surroundings; if you have a history of making bad decisions you shouldn&amp;#39;t be traveling alone to begin with. Like I said I have yet to meet any kitsune like this but I won&amp;#39;t rule out that they don&amp;#39;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barrier vs Merch:&lt;/strong&gt;
From what I read it&amp;#39;s almost impossible to get both done in one night but it really all depends on how the venue plans it out. After attending my first concert I can confirm picking one over the other will drastically reduce your chances for the other to happen. Commit to one and stick with it. Barrier is close to impossible without paying the premium for early entrance (The One package, VIP, VIP2,  Fastpass, then GA are the entrance order) GA guarantees you entrance and that is it. I guess there was Unicorn sighting in Houston because I was told most BM fans never saw a venue sell merch outside the venue which actually happened at the Houston venue. Inside they sold the sweaters so I guess not everything was available to the general public. Sizes are limited also so being early for merch does hold some value to it. Try not buy merch drunk I can guarantee you&amp;#39;ll overspend lol&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GA vs Balcony (or VIP tables):&lt;/strong&gt;
 Without paying the premium for an early entrance getting to the barrier is impossible. If you are familiar with the culture Babymetal does encourage friendly moshing which can happen anywhere at anytime for any reason. Fans push, mosh, crowd surf, and things will be spilled on you for sure. Being a first timer to a metal concert and enjoying my personal space I opted to admire from afar as my first time before venturing to the pit where you are basically welcoming anyone to invade your personal space unwarranted AND it will definitely be your fault for the simple fact you chose to be on the floor lol. The Houston venue offered VIP tables which I heard again was rare for a BM concert because they usually only offer GA/floor or Balcony seating. For some reason they didn&amp;#39;t offer balcony seats for this show despite having them available; at the concert and in the fan cams I saw online recording in the venue I saw a couple of people up there; not sure if they had permission for access or if they sneaked up there. From where I sat at the VIP tables I was able to get served alcohol and food while being far away enough to enjoy the show without using earplugs; I&amp;#39;m sure they are mandatory for the barrier and GA floor because it was still loud from where I sat but not uncomfortable. Like raging? Aim for the barrier and floor. Any other answer that isnt a yes probably means you are better off purchasing a seat rather than GA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-What I would do different-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan better:&lt;/strong&gt;
My story goes somewhere along the lines of...

2. Purchased 3 GA tickets for myself and two other people despite not knowing if they could commit. 
3. Scared that they would not like Babymetal let alone the pit I upgrade the tickets to the VIP tables

This is the term I use to explain someone who was supposed to with a group but everyone inin that group could not make it anymore leaving you the only person attending the show. If this is the case don&amp;#39;t panic. The show doesn&amp;#39;t change because you are coming with less people and I promise you it will still be just as epic. It will give you the opportunity to meet fellow kitsune that probably would not of happen if you were always just hanging with your own group of friends. If you are stuck with extra tickets like me keep posting and posting and posting until someone asks about them. A lot of the times people online just don&amp;#39;t trust deals too good to be true but if you post it enough I&amp;#39;m sure someone will have to be interested. The fact I let two tickets go to waste almost feels sacrilegious. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reconnaissance:&lt;/strong&gt; 
Next venue I go to that requires travelling great distances I will do so much recon that it will look like I&amp;#39;m robbing the place. If you are gunning for merch or barrier you should be pushing yourself to be there as early as possible; you are basically committing to camping outside the show. A day prior to my arrival I would study the venue&amp;#39;s surrounding layout to see what is and isn&amp;#39;t available to me. The revention center in Houston was connected to a string of restaurants so food and bathrooms were easily accessible. If there isnt any food available near you, try to bring food that can last you throughout the day prior to arriving. Make friends with the people standing with you because you want to establish a tag system with them because they are just as scared of losing their spot just as much as you are lol. They can hold your spot in exchange for bringing back food/snacks for all of you or tagging in and out to use the restrooms. T-Metal held our spots while I grabbed us some beer from the sushi place 30 ft away from us  lol&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mingle more:&lt;/strong&gt; 
I wish I made more time to mingle .

(Babymetal only please lol) Everyone had portable batteries for charging including myself and mine could charge an iphone 10 times before it begins to lose its power. Charging a small speaker would of been a piece of cake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make and distribute keepsakes:&lt;/strong&gt; 
To me, the fan made keepsakes that fellow Kitsune make for everyone was just as important as the merch I bought. Next time I would like to create something where I could do the same. I&amp;#39;ve encountered posts where people asked for ideas of what they can do to contribute and were called childish for even entertaining the idea. To anyone reading this that wants to contribute just ignore these thoughtless a-holes. You are putting up your own time and money to share your love for something; being thoughtful and trying to make people happy shouldn&amp;#39;t be limited to only Babymetal and are quality traits that you should change for no one but yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Episode VII:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good: New music. 
The bad: The addition of the chosen VII and straying from original format of it being only the 3 girls.
The Queen: She doesn&amp;#39;t give a fuck.&lt;/p&gt;

Adding only one dancer would be too similar to the Yui formation which already has too much attention on it due to her absence; adding 2 in my opinion was the better move because it balanced out the stage where Su is now surrounded in the middle again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Moa chan&lt;/strong&gt;
One of the reasons you can&amp;#39;t be mad at the absence of Yui is because Moa goes super hard and is actually performing both parts in GJ and carrying the weight of her missing sister. She doesn&amp;#39;t miss a beat and Maybe it could just be because this is the first time Ive ever seen her live but It seemed like she had twice the energy that I usually see her have in her other performances probably because she knows what&amp;#39;s on the line. I may have been drunk but it was like watching a unicorn cry rainbow tears with a basket of sleeping kittens and puppies being held in it&amp;#39;s mouth. It was truly magical lol. I can go on about Moa for days as I am her Oshimen but to say the most in the very least she lived up to every expectation I had and you can see that she doesn&amp;#39;t let anything get in the way of doing her job. Simply amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Queen&lt;/strong&gt;
So the reason why any of my thoughts on Episode 7 do not matter is because of Su-Metal alone. I never realized it until now but I am a huge fan of all her Solos especially no rain no rainbow, rondo nightmare, and of course Akatsuki. Tattoo just blew all of them away to the frog pits of Hell. This performance was Su&amp;#39;s defining moment; declaring that she is no longer a girl but a Goddess of Metal and rock. She sways back and forth to music, head banging, rocking out carelessly, while not giving any f*cks and she looked absolutely gorgeous doing it. It felt like she sent wave after wave of middle fingers at me that scream  &amp;quot;FUUUCK YOOOU&amp;quot; piercing me like arrows; they rain on me mercilessly punishing me for ever doubting Babymetal and forgetting she has the ability to carry the band by herself. In minutes she diminished every doubt I had about Babymetal for the next 10 years; I awoke out of a trance forgiven and was allowed to continue to blessed by her divine vocals. It was truly that epic. Tattoo is currently my favorite babymetal song because it is simply well composed and Su&amp;#39;s singing has just been refined to such a high level. Her bravado is of a true rocker and she just owns the every chord that song makes as if she composed it herself. I can&amp;#39;t give this song enough praise and is also the reason I came to my revelation. If Babymetal continues to make such music the story line really doesn&amp;#39;t matter anymore. I fell in love with Babymetal because of the music. They are the ones who introduced me to Metal and Rock and it&amp;#39;s songs like Tattoo that put me in a euphoric rage of joy. Of course their charm, skills, and dedication play a huge part in it but it&amp;#39;s because they manage those strengths in perfect harmony that they are able to continue being successful. Episode 7 sucks because it strays from what we are normally used to from Babymetal and leaves more questions than answers; the speculation is at all time high because of it. But I dare you to go to one of their shows and try that BS with the Queen. I love Babymetal as whole. Moa and Yui are 15 kilotons of TNT each; the Kami band is four 55 gallon drums of high octane gasoline; Su of course is the raging flame, without her the rest can&amp;#39;t be set off. To create the explosion that is Babymetal you will need all three elements in unison. I thought episode 7 sucked because of all the changes but because of it we are now in state to cherish all of their old work which needless to say are already classics. The time is now to venture forward to new music and adventures  with your Queen wiling to take you there herself. There is no them. There is no us. There is only the one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you made it to the end of this I thank you for your time in reading this; I put a lot of thought into this  post as a testament for my love of Babymetal the community involved in it.&lt;/p&gt;

,askgaybros,"Hey, so I'll try to keep this as short as possible (still failed after all). There was a guy (24, I'm 23) at work with whom we had chemistry both inside and outside at work, he wanted us to mess around, which I was in for, but I wasn't making any moves because I don't do hookups (not judging those who do, it just doesn't interest me). He wasn't making any actual move on me, because a) he was a supervisor at work, b) he didn't know if I liked him back.

In the end, we kissed at a party, immediately after which he had to catch a plane to go to his country for a week. The kiss was great for both of us, and after it he said we should talk about us when he got back, to which I agreed. When he did come back, he didn't mention anything but he was still giving clear signs he wanted more. Before all this, I knew (from him and our friends) that he'd be moving back to his country for good within 2 months, for very serious reasons. Finally, I told him I had to see him, so we went out and talked - we liked each other, but from his side the issue was a)he was a Supervisor at work, b) he would be leaving soon and c) he was HIV+ (hence his departure, as the health system here is very unreliable). However, our night out continued and we ended up being together for 7 hours. We were going out a lot with our friends on the weekends, but it was the first time that it was the two of us - and without going clubbing. I then tried from my side to shut the whole thing down, as I wouldn't be getting what I wanted - something serious. But he didn't really help, asking why I was acting weird at work (I just stopped being flirty) and still pushing me in his way for us to finally have sex. 

We then went with our friends to a trip, during which there was a lot of kissing and in the end, we had sex, but due to exhaustion and lots of alcohol, we only did oral without cumming. He still wanted more, caressing me as I was driving and, as I dropped him on the way back, he kissed me in the mouth goodbye (cue some retards on bikes shouted us off 'fags', to which we kissed again). Meanwhile at work, we were sending songs to each other and had ""our thing"" still going on strong as ever, our friends - and even him, jokingly referring to us as a couple.

On one more night out in the club, he was again waiting for me to make a move, but I didn't as I was still confused. When you're with someone you like a lot in the same job and the same group of friends, there's no easy way to 'cut someone off' without things getting messy. After all, he invited me to his flat his last night before leaving the country, we had sex for the second time, with the exact same result... due to the fact that it was morning already and I had to leave for work. 

Now, me and my friend will coincidentally go on a trip in June in the same city, which is only 2 hours away to his city, and I was thinking of inviting him for the weekend, he could stay in my airbnb. But I found out that he was going out with someone already, I don't know how serious, but apparently they would talk about the two of them soon. My friend invited him and said I would be there too, to which he answered in a rather ""stingy"", for a lack of better word, ""he's not coming here for me, he's coming for a concert"".Now, this and many other things from the story are/seem childish, but it has (again) left me in a bizarre place - I wanted to keep in touch, as it's likely I'll move the same country in a few moths, but maybe it's not worth it if he's with someone else.

There are other details, for example how he was asking common friends why I hesitate, and if I worry about his HIV+ status, and if I have feelings for him before inviting me to his house - when the friend answered 'no', he was apparently relieved, or that he had in his playlist the song I had sent to him at work.

I don't want to have false hopes, but I also don't want to look back and ask 'what if I had sent that invitation?'. In my gut, I think it's not worth it, between the possibility that he only wanted the sex, and that he may be with someone else, but.. what would you do? I want to see him, but not as a friend, we never had that dynamic. Sorry for the silliness of this post, you can say I'm late comer to all of this (he isn't).

I feel as though some people I know can observe my actions and thoughts from my perspective. It’s very strange. Here it is again, as I write this, I become exceptionally paranoid that people will judge me for this. It’s crippling, borderline debilitating. I know these are all fallacies, logically I can derive that all of my compulsory behaviors are irrational and my fallacies are untrue, but my compulsions urge me to feel otherwise.

WHAT IF SHE YELLS AT YOU? THEN EVERYONE ON THE CLASS WITH THINK YOURE AN IDIOT” It feels like that in my brain. I never end up with the pencil, screwing myself over for he remainder of the class.

This can also compound and cause sensory overload, even in a quiet room without significant sensory input. Just the buzz of my brain going ballistic is enough to overwhelm me, and that’s the one thing I can’t escape from.

,DestinyTheGame,"Hello all. It seems to me that the Free Trial of Destiny 2 has ended, and as a result so has my tenure as a Guardian, for now. I have compiled a guide based on my accumulated f2p knowledge for whoever wants it, for whoever needs it.

While you were all busy studying the Light, I ran the campaign (up to Titan) 14 times in total across two platforms (PC and XBox One, where I only needed Eye of Another World). Why, you ask? Well, simply to collect as many exotics as I could. The Trial allowed you to get through Titan, and so you had access to the first round of exotic armors in the game, the three options given by Sloane. As a free-to-play, I had quite a bit open to me - public events, crucible quickplay (especially once Warmind dropped and the playlists were collapsed) - but Exotics and Powerful Gear were few and far between. While this is no longer relevant, I hope future Guardians can learn something from my trial^(ha^ha it's a pun, geddit?):

---

##On Speedrunning:  

###Earth: Homecoming - Tower  
+ When you start out in the burning Tower, spec Triple Jump and Incendiary grenade for Hunters, Strafe Lift and Pulse grenade for Titans, and Burst Glide and Scatter grenade for Warlocks.
+ In the room where your flashlight first turns on and you are accosted by a shielded Centurion, all you need to do is kill the three Cabal in the sealed drop pod on the other end of the room to advance. I suggest getting on top of it and then throwing a grenade down as it opens. A Scatter Grenade will usually take them all out, while a pulse grenade and Incendiary will require a few follow up shots.
+ In the Tower Hanger, none of the Cabal need to be killed. Just jump over the burning wreckage and head to the Tower Plaza.
+ After meeting Ikora, the section where you encounter the Cabal Incendiors can be bypassed entirely. All you need to do is get through the doors at the end and kill everything in the courtyard.

###Earth: Homecoming - Cabal Ship  
+ After passing through the orange barrier, do not kill anyone as you move down the first hallway. If you reach the end of the corridor in time, the Yellow Bar at the end will slam down and push you down the next corridor, saving a few precious seconds.
+ While on the open decks, you don't need to kill the Yellow Bar who lands on the raised platform to proceed. Take him to low health, and once he retreats near the door it will soon open.
+ When entering the Shield Generator chamber, hug the right outer ledge. Make sure you land and stay on the pipes, as the rest of the ledge is too uneven to maintain a sprint. Move counterclockwise. Your position on the ledges gives you clear shots on the turbines, while a correctly chosen jump option will let you easily clear the gap of the second turbine. The third Turbine can be shot from the exit platform.

###EDZ: Adieu - The Last City  
+ While I am not certain of this, I believe having mobility enhancing gear makes the slow walk section faster. For titans, if you have an app that lets you transfer armors and you have spares at level one, most likely a Refugee set, make sure to put them on and keep them on for the entirety of the mission.

###EDZ: Adieu - City Outskirts
+ Once you pick up the [Sorrow MG2](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/DestinyInventoryItemDefinition/1195725819) **KEEP IT OUT**. Its Lightweight perk has a minor, yet noticeable affect on the segments where you cannot run. This and other lightweight weapons will also help cut down time while running by other enemies later in the campaign, so pick them up if they are available.
+ When accosted by Cabal Warbeasts, continue walking toward the end of the section. This fight is not required, and if specced for mobility with a lightweight weapon out they should not be able to attack you. by Cabal Warbeasts?

###EDZ: Adieu - Twilight Gap  
+ Once again, when accosted by Cabal Warbeasts, this time with their lone Cabal Handler, you can safely walk by them. The best strategy I found was to head left around the outcrop the Legionary stands on. All the Warbeasts come down on the right side of it, so your path should be clear.

###EDZ: Spark  
+ Once again, keep your Lightweight weapon out and you can make quick work of the mission. All fights but the one near the shard of the Traveler can be bypassed.
+ Feel free to ignore the first chest. You will get weapons at higher light later, and you do not need to fight much if you are speedrunning.
+ When you are confronted by Wretches, there is a gap in the ridge right before where a Wretch stand on top of a rock. You can leap through this gap.

###EDZ: A New Frontier Adventure
+ After scanning the Fallen Banner, immediately head right and outside. The first building on your left contains a region chest that Devrim will ask you to open. This building has a dip in the wall of the second floor, a large sign sticking out under that dip, and a car beneath it all. As a Titan or Warlock, you will be able to leap directly up and through that dip. As a Hunter, you will have to leap onto the car, then onto the sign to make it in.
+ When investigating the Lost Sector, the only enemy you need to kill is the Captain at the end. However, killing all adds is the only way to make the doors at the end of the sector open. In addition, the adds are actually quite lethal. Make use of the many Explosive Barrels in the Lost Sector to help clear out adds. This is especially useful if you are truly speedrunning, as your super should not be up yet.

###EDZ: Combustion  
+ In the part right after you are able to collect the [Dead Zone Rifle](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/DestinyInventoryItemDefinition/254156943) and enter a long vertical shaft, you only need to kill the three shanks to make the barrier below drop. 
+ When faced with the laser tripwires, there is always a key tripmine that, when destroyed, will set off a chain reaction, detonating the rest. They will be the ones that do not have a red laser pointing at them. The first is on the ground, angled upwards and to the right. The second is trickier: the first laser is not actually part of the group. Instead, walk forwards and right, and hug the wall while looking left. You should see the end of the actual Key tripmine poking out from the wall. Once they are detonated, simply run through the remaining single tripmine, it will not hurt you.
+ Alternatively, if you have received a [Stay Away](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/DestinyInventoryItemDefinition/2734369894), a single grenade detonated in the middle of the laser field will do the trick.
+ In the final room before the elevators, the only things that need to be killed are the three servitors, and then the Yellow Bar Servitor when it shows up. Facing from the Lift towards the back of the room, I suggest first killing the one in the middle, then the left, then the right.

###Titan: Hope  
+ All fights can be bypassed except the Hive Egg Room and the final miniboss. Leap over the Thrall, but make sure to keep momentum - slowing down is a guaranteed way to get swarmed and killed.
+ Upon receiving the [Penumbra GSM](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/DestinyInventoryItemDefinition/2936850735), equip it. It will be a welcome boost to your light level and will be vital for the next few areas.
+ Once you've reached the open deck of Siren's Watch, the only Hive that are really a problem are the second Knight and his retinue that spawn directly in front of the Egg Room. If you have Power Ammo, this is the time to use your new Grenade Launcher.
+ The only goal in the Egg Room is to destroy the glowing yellow eggs; however, you will probably end up fighting the Hive as you go about the room. Pick off as many eggs from the entrance as you can before you are forced inside by the Hive at your back. If you have a super, this is the room for it.

###Titan: Riptide  
+ When you first see Hive and Fallen engaging each other, head right through the open door. It will not only avoid enemies, but also put you in place for the next step.
+ After exiting the hallway, you will find yourself next to a bridge with a Shrieker at the end. As a Titan or Warlock, with Strafe Lift or Burst Glide you can cross the gap in one leap. As a Hunter, the furthest you can leap is to the middle of the bridge, which will still shorten your time.
+ Upon entering Tidal Anchor, a pair of Hive Acolytes will be engaged by Exploder Shanks. These Shanks are actually immune to damage, and so cannot be shot, only evaded. 
+ The requirement to Enable the Wave Converters is to kill all Fallen. You can ignore the Hive.
+ Once the Wave Converters have been enabled and the Slowing Mines avoided, there is one last Laser Tripwire room. You don't need to find the Key tripmine here, as you have a better key: a Grenade Launcher.
+ At the Tidal Anchors, there will be large towers connecting long bridge segments. Do not enter them through the middle, as they are filled with Cursed Thrall. Instead, take either the right or left paths around the central hallways. 
+ When destroying the Hive Growths on the Pistons, I suggest an SMG. I highly recommend the [Daystar SMG2](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/DestinyInventoryItemDefinition/531591353), as it is not only a Lightweight weapon, but also Solar to deal with later Wizards. Melees take four hits to completely de-gunk a piston, but you need to clear fast and hands too slow.

And that's it. After clearing out the two Wizards and enabling power, you can get your exotic from Sloane. As a f2p, here I stashed everything I wanted to keep in my Vault and ran the campaign through again. A single run took about an hour and a half to an hour and forty-five minutes. I won't go into Utopia, as honestly I never played it enough to learn its ins and outs, but the general rules should still apply: Avoid as many fights as you can and keep a Lightweight weapon at the ready.

##On Power Level

The Maximum Power Level attainable without an inventory management app is 93, while with one it is 97. During Homecoming, if you have spare level 1 armor, use the app to toss it onto your Guardian and store the starter set in your vault. After beginning Adieu, feel free to equip your level 1, power level 100 armor. The Power Level is beyond anything you can receive on gear at level 8, except for the Exotic armors you receive from Sloane, as those are at Power Level 105. The highest Attack weapon you can get in the Trial is the [Lionheart](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/DestinyInventoryItemDefinition/2903592984), and it is a solid weapon with High Caliber Rounds.

---

##On Fashion:

This is, I am sure you'll agree, the most important section. Certain exotics pair well with certain uncommon armor sets. 

###Hunters:  
+ Raiden Flux pairs well with the Scavenger Suit set
+ Mechaneer's Tricksleeves pairs well with the Makeshift Suit set

###Titans: 
+ Actium War Rig pairs well with the Fieldplate Type 10 set
+ ACD/0 Feedback Fence pairs well with the Firebreak Field set

###Warlocks:
+ Wings of Sacred Dawn pairs well with the Vector Home set
+ Sunbracers pairs well with the Cry Defiance set

And that's it. There's the entirety of a f2p's knowledge. Cherish it, because the time of the f2p is at an end.

tl;dr: totally got cucked by Bungo, so have a guide on speedrunning the early game",,False,,0,False,"The Tale of the F2P, Trial Breakdown","[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Guide'}]",,False,6.0,guide,0.0,,,False,t3_8jwwsa,,dark,,,public,0.0,,{},,,False,[],,False,,,{},Guide,,0,,,,self,False,,[],,,True,,1526521365.0,richtext,6.0,,,text,self.DestinyTheGame,,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all. It seems to me that the Free Trial of Destiny 2 has ended, and as a result so has my tenure as a Guardian, for now. I have compiled a guide based on my accumulated f2p knowledge for whoever wants it, for whoever needs it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you were all busy studying the Light, I ran the campaign (up to Titan) 14 times in total across two platforms (PC and XBox One, where I only needed Eye of Another World). Why, you ask? Well, simply to collect as many exotics as I could. The Trial allowed you to get through Titan, and so you had access to the first round of exotic armors in the game, the three options given by Sloane. As a free-to-play, I had quite a bit open to me - public events, crucible quickplay (especially once Warmind dropped and the playlists were collapsed) - but Exotics and Powerful Gear were few and far between. While this is no longer relevant, I hope future Guardians can learn something from my trial&lt;sup&gt;ha&lt;sup&gt;ha&lt;/sup&gt; it&amp;#39;s a pun, geddit?&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;On Speedrunning:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Earth: Homecoming - Tower&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you start out in the burning Tower, spec Triple Jump and Incendiary grenade for Hunters, Strafe Lift and Pulse grenade for Titans, and Burst Glide and Scatter grenade for Warlocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the room where your flashlight first turns on and you are accosted by a shielded Centurion, all you need to do is kill the three Cabal in the sealed drop pod on the other end of the room to advance. I suggest getting on top of it and then throwing a grenade down as it opens. A Scatter Grenade will usually take them all out, while a pulse grenade and Incendiary will require a few follow up shots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Tower Hanger, none of the Cabal need to be killed. Just jump over the burning wreckage and head to the Tower Plaza.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After meeting Ikora, the section where you encounter the Cabal Incendiors can be bypassed entirely. All you need to do is get through the doors at the end and kill everything in the courtyard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Earth: Homecoming - Cabal Ship&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After passing through the orange barrier, do not kill anyone as you move down the first hallway. If you reach the end of the corridor in time, the Yellow Bar at the end will slam down and push you down the next corridor, saving a few precious seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While on the open decks, you don&amp;#39;t need to kill the Yellow Bar who lands on the raised platform to proceed. Take him to low health, and once he retreats near the door it will soon open.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When entering the Shield Generator chamber, hug the right outer ledge. Make sure you land and stay on the pipes, as the rest of the ledge is too uneven to maintain a sprint. Move counterclockwise. Your position on the ledges gives you clear shots on the turbines, while a correctly chosen jump option will let you easily clear the gap of the second turbine. The third Turbine can be shot from the exit platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;EDZ: Adieu - The Last City&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While I am not certain of this, I believe having mobility enhancing gear makes the slow walk section faster. For titans, if you have an app that lets you transfer armors and you have spares at level one, most likely a Refugee set, make sure to put them on and keep them on for the entirety of the mission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;EDZ: Adieu - City Outskirts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you pick up the &lt;a href=""https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/DestinyInventoryItemDefinition/1195725819""&gt;Sorrow MG2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;KEEP IT OUT&lt;/strong&gt;. Its Lightweight perk has a minor, yet noticeable affect on the segments where you cannot run. This and other lightweight weapons will also help cut down time while running by other enemies later in the campaign, so pick them up if they are available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When accosted by Cabal Warbeasts, continue walking toward the end of the section. This fight is not required, and if specced for mobility with a lightweight weapon out they should not be able to attack you. by Cabal Warbeasts?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;EDZ: Adieu - Twilight Gap&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once again, when accosted by Cabal Warbeasts, this time with their lone Cabal Handler, you can safely walk by them. The best strategy I found was to head left around the outcrop the Legionary stands on. All the Warbeasts come down on the right side of it, so your path should be clear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;EDZ: Spark&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once again, keep your Lightweight weapon out and you can make quick work of the mission. All fights but the one near the shard of the Traveler can be bypassed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feel free to ignore the first chest. You will get weapons at higher light later, and you do not need to fight much if you are speedrunning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you are confronted by Wretches, there is a gap in the ridge right before where a Wretch stand on top of a rock. You can leap through this gap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;EDZ: A New Frontier Adventure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After scanning the Fallen Banner, immediately head right and outside. The first building on your left contains a region chest that Devrim will ask you to open. This building has a dip in the wall of the second floor, a large sign sticking out under that dip, and a car beneath it all. As a Titan or Warlock, you will be able to leap directly up and through that dip. As a Hunter, you will have to leap onto the car, then onto the sign to make it in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When investigating the Lost Sector, the only enemy you need to kill is the Captain at the end. However, killing all adds is the only way to make the doors at the end of the sector open. In addition, the adds are actually quite lethal. Make use of the many Explosive Barrels in the Lost Sector to help clear out adds. This is especially useful if you are truly speedrunning, as your super should not be up yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;EDZ: Combustion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the part right after you are able to collect the &lt;a href=""https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/DestinyInventoryItemDefinition/254156943""&gt;Dead Zone Rifle&lt;/a&gt; and enter a long vertical shaft, you only need to kill the three shanks to make the barrier below drop. &lt;/li&gt;

You should see the end of the actual Key tripmine poking out from the wall. Once they are detonated, simply run through the remaining single tripmine, it will not hurt you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternatively, if you have received a &lt;a href=""https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/DestinyInventoryItemDefinition/2734369894""&gt;Stay Away&lt;/a&gt;, a single grenade detonated in the middle of the laser field will do the trick.&lt;/li&gt;

Lars von Trier’s latest film “The House That Jack Built” just premiered at the Cannes Film Festival — and audiences were walking out in droves, according to several critics on the scene. **One even said the director had “gone too far this time.”**

**“Just left Lars Von Trier’s The House that Jack Built. Gross. Pretentious. Vomitive. Torturous. Pathetic,”** wrote one critic.

“People are walking out of the new Lars Von Trier movie,” tweeted another. “Like they didn’t know exactly what they were getting into.”

**“Walked out on LarsvonTrier [sic]. Vile movie. Should not have been made. Actors culpable,”** tweeted another.

Some rushed to the defense of the filmmaker, writing, “I mean, it’s a Lars von Trier movie, what were they expecting?” and “can we talk about the cluelessness of the Cannes audience expecting to be mildly entertained by a lars von trier film about a serial killer lmao.”

Much has been made of von Trier’s return after being declared persona non grata by the festival in 2011. Ahead of his Monday night premiere, IFC Films dropped a teaser trailer for the Matt Dillon film. **The ’80s heartthrob appears to be a haphazard serial killer in the throes of an existential crisis. Uma Thurman and Riley Keough make Hitchcockian blonde cameos as von Trier seems to be commenting on his own body of work through Dillon’s character.**

**In the official Cannes program, a warning appears next to the film’s schedule times: “Certain scenes are likely to offend the sensitivity of the spectators.”**

See reactions below.

&gt; why can’t Lars von Trier just make a normal fcking movie for once. pushing limits is one thing but he’s just a complete sadist expressing his narcissism and contempt for the world through his art.

&gt; Lars Von Trier is fuckin trash

&gt; I’ve never seen anything like this at a film festival. More than 100 people have walked out of Lars von Trier’s ‘The House That Jack Built,’ which depicts the mutilation of women and children. “It’s disgusting,” one woman said on her way out.

&gt; I've just walked out of #LarsVonTrier premiere at #Cannes2018 because seeing children being shot and killed is not art or entertainment

Some excerpts from reviews

**Los Angeles Times**

&gt; *Lars von Trier is a stupid, arrogant troll and, when the mood strikes him, a reasonably talented filmmaker. But there are only a few moments in ""The House That Jack Built"" in which his stupidity doesn't entirely overwhelm and negate his talent.*

&gt; *Presented as the story of a serial killer's lonely formation, rise and fall, it is better understood as a calculated outrage, a #MeToo think-piece magnet and a 2½-hour trolling session.*

&gt; *Jack, confessing his crimes to Verge in voiceover, likes to hold forth on subjects like viticulture, Gothic cathedral architecture and the music of Glenn Gould, whose performance of Bach's Partita No. 2 in C Minor is repeated here on an endless loop with David Bowie's ""Fame.""*

**The Guardian**

&gt; Lars von Trier, the giggling charlatan-genius of world cinema, has returned in a kind of triumph to the Cannes playground of provocation from which he was temporarily exiled in 2011, having miscalculated a Nazi gag at a press conference, and proved unable or unwilling to walk it back. He has reappeared to give the finger to all America’s liberal complainers, with a film that casts Uma Thurman – yes, the male-auteur-nemesis Uma Thurman – as the very, very stupid victim of a serial killer, a film that also mocks the sexual politics of grievance and for good measure makes light of tightening up America’s gun laws.

&gt; The film ends with a colossal but semi-serious bang, an extravagant visual flourish and a cheeky musical outro over the closing credits to leave you laughing in spite of yourself as the house lights come up.

**The Telegraph**

&gt; And while goading your audience into hoping that a female character gets murdered is provocation-by-numbers, it’s a vision of ambiguity next to Jack’s #MeToo-baiting speech, in which he complains “Why is it always the men’s fault? No matter where you go, it’s like you’re some kind of wandering guilty person… If one is so unfortunate to have been born male, you are always the victim, right?”

**The Playlist**

&gt; *Murder is a cathedral, or a pointed arch, or art or something! Also, Goethe sat under the oak tree that grew in Buchenwald concentration camp and William Blake wrote about tigers and lambs — such are the lofty topics discussed in Jack’s voiced-over conversation with Verge, as in Virgil, writer of The Aeneid and Dante’s guide to hell, here played by Bruno Ganz, an actor whose two most famous roles are Hitler and an angel.*

&gt; *...Riley Keough’s dim sexpot character who is actually in a relationship with Jack and whom he insists on calling “Simple.” Even before the mammary mutilation scene that is destined to live on in infamy, his verbal and psychological abuse of Simple is among the film’s ickiest elements, which is saying something considering there are also scenes of amateur taxidermy in which the body of a small boy is crudely fashioned into a little statue wearing a grotesque, carved-in grin.*

&gt; *So the structure is a kind of “Human Centipede” ass-to-mouth concertina of gruesome misogyny and utter tedium.*

&gt; *Here are just a few of the interest groups he works hard to offend repeatedly: women; law enforcement; anyone who’s ever defended him or one of his movies in the past (boy do we feel like idiots now); all his actors; people with children; people who were once children; art historians; classical scholars; Glenn Gould fans; serial killers; people with eyes; everyone who applauded him as he arrived at the film’s premiere; ducks; and of course the Cannes Film Festival selection committee.*

&gt; *Sitting in a room with the very people who banned von Trier “for life” (actually 7 years) from this festival because of comments he made about understanding Hitler, and watching the long sequence in which Jack extols the brilliance of Nazi architect Albert Speer, over documentary footage of Speer and Adolf yukking it up, was certainly one of the more epic meta-trolls I’ve ever been privy to.*

&gt; *All of which guarantees that this tawdry, nasty little movie is destined to immediately attain cult status as a dog whistle for the particular brand of filmbro who will wear it as a badge of honor that somehow they “get” it in a way that snowflake critics such as myself simply do not.*

&gt; *P.S. Hi there to the first #filmbrodude who devastates everyone with his witty bravado by replying with some variation on “wow, even more stoked to see this now!” Your prize is: you are a douchebag. xxx*

,SignalHorrorFiction,"It was a little before nine on a sunny Sunday morning and I was sitting on the front porch of the dilapidated house just off campus I was renting for the summer. My best friend, Hugh, was sitting across from me. We had been out all night drinking and arguing about 20th century literature and Rick and Morty’s place in the canon , and by now we were too tired to argue but not too tired to continue sipping on Gentleman Jack out of stolid, cut crystal tumblers on my porch.

A thunderclap came out of nowhere--so sudden and harsh it felt like a punch in the gut, and then rain started to fall right through the still sunny morning sky.

“Fuck, bro,” said Hugh, “back in New Orleans when it rains on sunny days we’d say ‘The Devil is beatin’ on his wife,’ and when Old Sugah is riled up, that’s my cue to exit.”

“Alright, bro,” I muttered, pretty content to try to sleep all this off anyway. But then I was suddenly curious, “Wait, who the fuck is Old Sugah?”

“Oh, my granny used to call the Devil Old Sugar. Because of how he was Lord of the Flies, they said, and she figured the lord of the flies would have a sugarcube for a head. Made him the lord of absinthe, too, the real shit, not the weak concoction they sell now--cuz the real shit tastes so evil you have to sweeten it with a cube of burning sugar.”

“You come from quite a family, Hugh.”

“Don’t I know it. Old Sugah beatin’ on his wife,” he remarked again, pointing his handsome face directly into the sun as if to stare it down, “means today is gonna be a weird one.”

“I guess so,” I said to his back as he ambled down the sidewalk and out of sight, and then thought that right about now I could use a weird day. At least a weird day would be some kind of change--it was all these normal ones that were blowing my shit.

Hugh and I were both English graduate students at the University of Illinois in the Middle of Fucking Nowhere. It was easy to pretend we both had similar futures ahead of us--but whereas Hughbert Kempton Ruggles Boyd was a brilliant 20something who came from old Cavalier money down in Louisiana, I was a half-smart Yankee boy who came from a Chicago burb with a family that didn’t give a shit if he lived or died.

There was a PhD and probably an eventual tenured job at a prestigious university in Hugh’s future. My own future was more likely to involve lecturing suburban high school kids about the dangers of comma splices, and possibly being thought of as a semi-cool teacher because I knew who Cardi B was and probably wouldn’t bother to confiscate their Juuls most of the time.

I had written a screenplay, of course, just like everyone else I knew; one I had honestly believed was going to make me rich. But there had been no traction, no representation, not even any social media buzz. And so here I was sitting and listening to the sounds of rain through heavy sunshine and hoping for one fuck of a weird day.

A black millipede, big and fat as my thumb scurried across the rickety white Ikea table Hugh’s emptied tumbler and my tumbler, still half full of rich brown booze, rested on. I considered crushing the brazen beastie with my sturdy, cut crystal tumbler, felt too squeamish, and decided against it. Just the thought of its pinkish guts sprawled across the table made me feel like dry heaving.

A huge black millipede is my cue to leave basically any situation, so I downed the rest of my Gentleman Jack in a single gulp and took one last look around my neighborhood and muttered “Oh well. PIss on all of it,” and staggered into my bedroom to prepare to pass out while another peal of thunder whooped across the sunny sky.

I was drunk enough to not undress from my old madras short sleeve button down shirt and khaki shorts, but sober enough to cue up my preferred sleeping playlist on Spotify (heavy on The National and The Mountain Goats) and I dozed off at long last while Matt Berninger moodily sang to me that, while I may not want an angel watching over me, (surprise surprise!) they wouldn’t wanna watch.

A little before 3, I woke up to the charmless sensation of an enormous black house fly landing on my lips like a lover’s kiss. This time I slapped furiously at the fly and missed completely, succeeding only in rapping myself in the nose like you might swat a bad puppy who has just chewed up your one pair of loafers suitable for job interviews. The fly was a bona fide monster, and it just hung lazily in the air over my face for a moment, buzzing languidly, and then drifted off to rest on my drapes.

“Fuuuuuuck,” I said, hopping to my feet. “Shiiiiiiit,” I added, reminiscing unfondly about the bug that had just been poised on my lips, probably pooping, as I recalled reading somewhere that flies poop everywhere they land.

I stormed angrily to the adjoining bathroom and brushed my teeth and looked back into the bedroom to note that four or five more big black flies had begun buzzing around the bedroom. The buzzing of the flies combined into a single, ominous drone that filled me with a hazy but unmistakable sense of dread.

I got angrier to try to keep from getting scared. It didn’t really work.

There was nothing to be scared of, I assured myself. This was just one of those mindfucks where all the free floating panic in my brain had been looking for a nice place to land and have a picnic and today my old pal Dreadful Panic had finally decided to land on my reactions to a little bit of weird weather and a few gross but harmless bugs, and now the panic was contentedly chilling out and having a nice meal--and my peace of mind was the main course.

I popped gooseflesh.

Probably sick too, I realized--or else too much booze was thinning my blood and making warm rooms on a warm day in a hot month feel chilly.

I rinsed my mouth out. Took care not to look in my bathroom mirror, because I’ve had a weird, vague horror of mirrors ever since I was a little kid, and when I start getting spooked I start to avoid them. I know there’s no boogeyman standing behind me, but I’ve always known I have the kind of brain who can conjure one up, and if I glance in a mirror and my brain plays a funny trick on me like making me believe there is some kind of man shaped thing with the head of a housefly (or a sugar cube) standing right behind me then I’m definitely going to go nuts as soon as I see it and I’ve always feared insanity more than anything else.

I took a deep breath and strutted back into my bedroom to take my phone from the bedside table. Then I walked right back out into the living room, swatting away a couple of flies I hadn’t noticed before in the process.

Walked. Didn’t run but walked. Made it a point to walk in a nice, measured way--a crazy person losing his shit would run, but I was avid to prove to myself that I was calming down. Buddha-like, basically--that was me.

I tried to think of a reason to leave the house that wouldn’t feel like a horror film protagonist running out of the haunted house and praying that his car engine turns over. Checked the time and weather--3:10 in the afternoon and the weather was supposed to be hot and humid but no more thunderstorms were in the forecast.

I realized that just going through some of my normal routines was calming me down. My friends were living their lives all over my FaceBook account, and everything was churning along like clockwork. Someone had posted several photos from the academic conference they were at in Arizona, someone else posted some pics of their new baby, an adamantly child-free mutual acquaintance posted some pics of her Labradoodle in response, and I realized after a few minutes of liking and loving and babbling banal bullshit comments from time to time, my breathing was back to normal and I didn’t feel the same unsettling chill. To be on the safe side, I ambled over and shut the door to my bedroom (as freaked out as I had been, the fact I had not thought to do that only further confirmed I have the survival instincts of a hamster) and then opened up my computer to while away a little time working on my screenplay.

Let me tell you about my screenplay. Ha just kidding! Come back, I wouldn’t do that to you.

The important thing was, I had kept assuring myself, that I had a screenplay. I had created a thing and now I had to help that created thing find a place in the world. Or, to be more crass, I had to keep working until the thing I had created was a thing other people would want to consume. Something they would be willing to pay to consume. I was a long way from where I needed to be.

I had written a plodding, and fairly polite coming of age film about a hapless male protagonist and his ill-fated efforts to win the love of his so-far-out-of-his-league best lady friend. In the end, although he doesn’t get the girl, my protagonist is a little wiser for his disappointment. Looking back now, I can promise you it was every bit as hollow and banal and bland as it sounds. Call it “Woke Say Anything.” Call it “Indistinguishable from half the movies released in the past half decade.” Call it bullshit. That’s what I finally did. Right then and there, sitting at my computer and staring at the screen, I realized that was my one and only problem: The thing I had created was boring bullshit and I had better goddamn well make something scintillating unless I wanted a future of trying to teach kids with 10k Twitter followers and the attention spans of gnats what a “gerund” is.

There was an empty tumbler and a full bottle of Bulleit Rye by my computer when I sat down, feeling suddenly energized. “Don’t mind if I do,” I said to no one at all, pouring a glass of rye and opening up a blank document.

I wrote furiously, in a kind of reverie. I got my ass to work on a screenplay that was gonna push everybody’s buttons. Now the protagonist, the apparent “nice guy” led a double life as a sadistic Lothario. I channeled every frustrated “nice dude’s” deep, dark id and just aired it all out. The fantasies about sexual dominance to overcome the feelings of deep inadequacy. Fantasies about playing fucked up psychosexual games (at one point the “hero” of the story blackmails a woman by threatening to send the receipt for the abortion he had paid for to her super-religious mother). Pivotal scenes about using sexual conquests for their only real purpose to guys like the narrator--as dominance displays to cow other, weaker males. The narrator was infuriating. He was amoral. He was the Red Pill subreddit come to life. He was Patrick Bateman for Generation InCel and I was absolutely certain that I had such incendiary content on my hands, even after such a rough pass, that it was going to make me rich and infamous.

Did I lose track of time as I pounded out my draft? You bet I did. I was vaguely aware of the room growing colder and colder. When I reached the point in the narrative where the narrator first lets his masque of niceness slip and reveals that he has poisoned the beloved pet parrot of his gay neighbor for no other reason than to surreptitiously record the pathetic man breaking down in tears and post it to his YouTube channel I was aware of a loud, cacophonous buzzing and vaguely noted that the flies must have found their way in. This felt strangely reassuring to me--the swarms of flies felt like a handshake, like something clicking into place.

It was when I reached the pivotal scene--in which the narrator blackmails his ex lover into giving him one last blowjob in exchange for not revealing the details of her abortion to her rich, deeply Christian mother who would both cut off all her love and cut her daughter out of the will if she knew--that it dawned on me at some point I must have put on my heaviest turtleneck sweater and still I was so cold I was shivering and when I looked up I saw that the room was now full of huge, buzzing flies weaving around in desultory, erratic flight paths.

I looked down at my work and saw that it was good.

In only a few hours, I had written something infinitely more marketable, and better, than the screenplay I had been dicking around on bit by bit for over a year. The flies buzzed and I grinned.

I decided to take a long, fast drive on the backroads just outside of the small university town where I lived. It seemed like a good way to exorcise the very nearly sexual sense of ecstasy I was experiencing and get myself together enough to finish up the screenplay.

It was 6:30 when I went out to my 2003 midnight blue Celica Sedan, now dressed appropriately for the season in my old madras shorts and a Father John Misty tee shirt. I slid into my seat. I buckled my seatbelt. I started the car. I began to check my mirror, and still couldn’t quite bring myself to deal with a mirror right now, so I did a slow K Turn in my driveway and pulled out onto Division Street.

As unsettled as I had felt for much of the day, I was exuberant about the progress I’d made on my project and was willing to write off the angst and the anxiety as the cost of doing business for someone whose creative juices were finally starting to flow. I glided down narrow, dark streets and cranked up my Spotify on the car stereo, singing along enthusiastically while Frank Black explained that he was, was a Debaser.

I left the city limits of Champaign-Urbana, the very small city that contains the U of I and drove out into the very large and dark Nothing just outside town where the roads have names like “Rural Route 6” or “County Drive 31,” and where farmers live in big houses and make their living by growing some crops and by being paid by the government to, for the love of GOD NOT GROW ANY MORE of some others; which seems like pretty good work if you can get it.

It was late enough in the season that almost all the crops had been harvested anyway and so, though the air was still redolent with the sweet sick smell of fertilizer, and though some heavy machinery still rested in the fields, the fields themselves were mostly vast swaths of brutalized dirt and rows of desiccated, seared, harvested corn stalks swayed in the wind like men with broken necks swinging from gallows. The moon, I noted, was full and fat and seemed preternaturally close to the earth.

Thanks to the magic of Google Maps I was able to drive willy nilly, giving no fucks about paying attention to where I had just turned or which cardinal direction my car was even pointing anymore and feel secure I could find my way back. I had turned down a particularly dark and desolate road which, unlike all the others, was named--BlackFriar Bridge Road the sign read, and Nirvana’s cover of The Man Who Sold the World had just come on Spotify when I heard another long, loud peal of thunder although it was not accompanied by lightning and no rain fell.

I was unnerved. I was exhilarated. I was amped as fuck, bro. The thunder, once again, felt like some kind of agreement being proffered.

I remember hearing Cobain on my radio just after I checked my clock and saw that it was 8:04 PM:

""Who knows?/Not me/We never lost control /You’re face To face /With the man who sold the world.""

I don’t know what happened after this.

The next thing I knew, it was 10:13 PM, my car was significantly lower on gas than it had been, and as far as I could tell I was still driving on BlackFriar Bridge Road, which would have meant either it was the longest, straightest, flattest road in the world or there was something wrong with the clock on my phone. I had only snapped back to attention, in fact, because a pair of super bright headlights were making my eyes throb as a car had come up behind me and was tailgating me aggressively.

At first, I thought it was surely a police car using some of the more charmless cop car tactics to try to make a hapless driver fuck up and get an excuse to pull him over. As it happened, my cruise control was still set to 55 and as far as I could tell I had done an admirable job of driving pretty safely while completely blacked out for some reason, and so the putative cop I was imagining behind me must have been making constipated faces and chomping down angrily on his cigar like old Boss Hogg failing to railroad those Duke Boys one more time.

I felt a sudden, sharp sense of confused relief when I realized there were no longer headlights blinding me from behind. Then I felt a sudden, sharp sense of confused panic when I looked up and saw that the car was now directly in front of me. It was a big, black car, a 1960 Cadillac De Ville to be exact. All the windows were tinted, and it was gliding in front of me just slowly enough to force me to pump my brakes and take my own speed down to about 50.

Even though the windows were tinted, I was absolutely sure there were two men in the car, one in the front and one in the back who was the driver’s boss. The car had no license plate but was otherwise in pristine condition. I could taste the battery acid flavored bile rise up in my throat that always comes when my adrenal glands are pumping hell for leather to try to keep me alert to an unsettling situation.

I considered flashing the car with my brights, then thought better of it. What the fuck would that do, I asked myself. This car seems to have disappeared from tailgating me and teleported directly in front of me to fuck with me by pumping its brakes--what the fuck interest did I have in taunting the goddamn demon car?

In fact, I slammed on my brakes hard with the wild notion that maybe I could turn around right in the middle of the road and then outrun the 60 Cadillac with my old Celica. The car was about fifty feet in front of me and still gliding forward when my car ground to a halt and I spun the wheel as far to the right as I could with plans of turning around 180 degrees in the fewest, fastest possible number of turns. I slammed on the gas and then slammed on the brakes just as fast, mashing me up against the steering wheel because the black car was now just sitting beside me, idling.

I puked up more battery acid tasting bile and my heart thumped savagely when the heavily tinted driver’s window began to roll down, agonizingly slowly. I gritted my teeth. I held my breath. I felt hot tears running down my cheeks.

A silver haired white man in his mid 60s, wearing a chauffeur’s uniform and cap, was staring at me serenely. His gaze had the sort of beatific brilliance, radiating such calm that I was stunned into serenity or something like it myself. I could feel the tightness between my shoulders start to melt away. My breathing returned to normal. I could swallow again. We never broke eye contact.

(Well you wouldn’t want an angel watching over you…)

The man grinned at me and I grinned back. As his hand reached under his seat, I had such a peaceful and loving feeling that I half expected him to pull out

(Well surprise, surprise, they wouldn’t wanna watch)

a piece of candy and offer it to me. But then instead

(We never lost control)

He was reaching for something else and as he brought it up to his face I saw that it was the most grotesque, reddest devil’s masque I had ever seen. He stared at me through the masque. It was the face of a red, leering devil with huge horns protruding from his temples and a grotesquely oversized, phallic nose which I was involuntarily picturing poking around on me, violating me and I lost my shit completely and screamed myself hoarse and felt the sensation of hot piss running down my left leg and now I just threw my car into reverse and drove backward as fast as I possibly could, totally indifferent to the likelihood of being able to maintain control or even stay on the road.

I refused to use my mirror and so I craned and lurched my neck back as far as I could to watch behind me to try to stay on the road. There was nothing in front of me that I wanted to look at, I was sure of that much. I don’t know how long I drove this way, my neck craned to the back and in reverse going 35, 40, 45 miles per hour and expecting, at any moment, to be overtaken from in front by the godawful car that had begun to torture me for no apparent reason on what had been shaping up to be a pivotal night in my life.

Keeping control of my own steering wheel was difficult with my blurry vision and trembling hands. My vision was good enough, navigating exclusively through the faint glow of my tail lights and blind instinct, to stay on the road, but several times the car veered off far enough to the right or the left shoulder to start kicking up gravel and try to lurch into the ditch. I was totally positive that, if I went off the road, that was going to be all she wrote. I’d die alone out here in the dark under the stars, stark mad and gibbering against my fate to the very end.

I took a deep breath and looked up, forward and dead ahead, and saw no car. I craned my neck once more, and saw no car behind me either, laying in wait. The comparatively wide country boulevard was also clear to my right and to my left. I sighed deeply, slowed down, came to a stop.

I was free.

Thank God, I was free from whatever had been tormenting me.

The moment I realized the car had just vanished like a phantasm melting away, , I started to rationalize the experience. Blamed it on my own overheated brain. Blamed it on the woman I’d loved who had left me high and dry a month ago. Blamed it on my parents, who had made it clear that if I wanted to continue my useless degree I was going to be on my own and out in the cold. Hell, I even blamed it on myself. Decided part of the problem was certainly that I’d become too narcissistic, too self-obsessed in the past few months. Decided to treat the evening as a wakeup call, as the kind of brush with insanity that ultimately serves as a reality check.

I decided to pull over to the side of the road, set my navigation to take me home, put on a little music, and try to get a little sleep.

Like any good driver, I checked my rearview mirror.

My sanity snapped.

In the mirror, I clearly saw a man in an impeccable grey suit sitting ramrod straight in my back seat. He had not been there fifteen seconds previous.

His head was a cube of sugar.

The cube of sugar was on fire.

I tried to look away from the mirror and turn around to see if he was really there but I could not tear my gaze away from the horror.

Thousands of flies swarmed around the fiery cube of sugar. They flew near the flame. They flew into the flame. They caught fire and the smell of burning matter joined the overpowering pungence of burning sugar.

The longer I stared into the mirror, the more overwhelming the fragrance became and the louder the flies droned. It was as though, staring at the scene through the mirror, I was cementing its reality.

I prayed to God this was all a figment of my imagination.

I felt a fly land on my scalp. Another. I shut my eyes and mumbled “No no nononono.” I felt something hot singe the back of my beck. A burning, crackling fly, no doubt, burning itself into my skin.

I turned around and hoped I would see nothing at all again, just an empty back seat.

I saw a man in an impeccable grey suit with a flaming cube of sugar for a head. I knew it was Old Sugah. Old Nick. The Lord of the Flies. Flies buzzed around by the thousand. Big fat flies. Some fast, some slow. Some orbited the flaming cube of sugar, some caught fire. In Old Sugah’s left hand, he held a piece of paper. I knew it was a contract. I knew it was for me. I had a fair idea of its terms.

I lost my sanity. I lost my consciousness.

When I woke up, it was sunny and warm. The first thing I was conscious of, as I opened my eyes, was that my left hand hurt like hell.

I was laying propped up against an old, gnarled oak tree. My left hand had been nailed to the tree, with a contract written in spidery, crimson letters pierced by the same huge iron nail. Although I was in so much pain that snot and tears were running down my face, the contract was easy to read and understand. There was, of course, a needle glistening in the grass near my right hand. The hole in my left hand was caked with dried blood. I pricked my left index finger with the pin, and smeared enough blood on my right hand to affix my signature to the document and even as I finished crossing the last “t” in my name relief washed over me and I fell into another slumber amidst the smell of sugar just short of overpowering now.",,False,,0,False,The Devil is Beating on his Wife,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'BROADCAST'}]",,False,,broadcast,0.0,,,False,t3_8jpsm6,,dark,,,public,12.0,,{},,,False,[],,False,,,{},BROADCAST,,12,,,,self,False,,[],,,True,,1526452067.0,richtext,,,,text,self.SignalHorrorFiction,,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a little before nine on a sunny Sunday morning and I was sitting on the front porch of the dilapidated house just off campus I was renting for the summer. My best friend, Hugh, was sitting across from me. We had been out all night drinking and arguing about 20th century literature and Rick and Morty’s place in the canon , and by now we were too tired to argue but not too tired to continue sipping on Gentleman Jack out of stolid, cut crystal tumblers on my porch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thunderclap came out of nowhere--so sudden and harsh it felt like a punch in the gut, and then rain started to fall right through the still sunny morning sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fuck, bro,” said Hugh, “back in New Orleans when it rains on sunny days we’d say ‘The Devil is beatin’ on his wife,’ and when Old Sugah is riled up, that’s my cue to exit.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Alright, bro,” I muttered, pretty content to try to sleep all this off anyway. But then I was suddenly curious, “Wait, who the fuck is Old Sugah?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh, my granny used to call the Devil Old Sugar. Because of how he was Lord of the Flies, they said, and she figured the lord of the flies would have a sugarcube for a head. Made him the lord of absinthe, too, the real shit, not the weak concoction they sell now--cuz the real shit tastes so evil you have to sweeten it with a cube of burning sugar.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You come from quite a family, Hugh.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t I know it. Old Sugah beatin’ on his wife,” he remarked again, pointing his handsome face directly into the sun as if to stare it down, “means today is gonna be a weird one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was an empty tumbler and a full bottle of Bulleit Rye by my computer when I sat down, feeling suddenly energized. “Don’t mind if I do,” I said to no one at all, pouring a glass of rye and opening up a blank document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote furiously, in a kind of reverie. I got my ass to work on a screenplay that was gonna push everybody’s buttons. Now the protagonist, the apparent “nice guy” led a double life as a sadistic Lothario. I channeled every frustrated “nice dude’s” deep, dark id and just aired it all out. The fantasies about sexual dominance to overcome the feelings of deep inadequacy. Fantasies about playing fucked up psychosexual games (at one point the “hero” of the story blackmails a woman by threatening to send the receipt for the abortion he had paid for to her super-religious mother). Pivotal scenes about using sexual conquests for their only real purpose to guys like the narrator--as dominance displays to cow other, weaker males. The narrator was infuriating. He was amoral. He was the Red Pill subreddit come to life. He was Patrick Bateman for Generation InCel and I was absolutely certain that I had such incendiary content on my hands, even after such a rough pass, that it was going to make me rich and infamous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I lose track of time as I pounded out my draft? You bet I did. I was vaguely aware of the room growing colder and colder. When I reached the point in the narrative where the narrator first lets his masque of niceness slip and reveals that he has poisoned the beloved pet parrot of his gay neighbor for no other reason than to surreptitiously record the pathetic man breaking down in tears and post it to his YouTube channel I was aware of a loud, cacophonous buzzing and vaguely noted that the flies must have found their way in. This felt strangely reassuring to me--the swarms of flies felt like a handshake, like something clicking into place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was when I reached the pivotal scene--in which the narrator blackmails his ex lover into giving him one last blowjob in exchange for not revealing the details of her abortion to her rich, deeply Christian mother who would both cut off all her love and cut her daughter out of the will if she knew--that it dawned on me at some point I must have put on my heaviest turtleneck sweater and still I was so cold I was shivering and when I looked up I saw that the room was now full of huge, buzzing flies weaving around in desultory, erratic flight paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked down at my work and saw that it was good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In only a few hours, I had written something infinitely more marketable, and better, than the screenplay I had been dicking around on bit by bit for over a year. The flies buzzed and I grinned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to take a long, fast drive on the backroads just outside of the small university town where I lived. It seemed like a good way to exorcise the very nearly sexual sense of ecstasy I was experiencing and get myself together enough to finish up the screenplay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was 6:30 when I went out to my 2003 midnight blue Celica Sedan, now dressed appropriately for the season in my old madras shorts and a Father John Misty tee shirt. I slid into my seat. I buckled my seatbelt. I started the car. I began to check my mirror, and still couldn’t quite bring myself to deal with a mirror right now, so I did a slow K Turn in my driveway and pulled out onto Division Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As unsettled as I had felt for much of the day, I was exuberant about the progress I’d made on my project and was willing to write off the angst and the anxiety as the cost of doing business for someone whose creative juices were finally starting to flow. I glided down narrow, dark streets and cranked up my Spotify on the car stereo, singing along enthusiastically while Frank Black explained that he was, was a Debaser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left the city limits of Champaign-Urbana, the very small city that contains the U of I and drove out into the very large and dark Nothing just outside town where the roads have names like “Rural Route 6” or “County Drive 31,” and where farmers live in big houses and make their living by growing some crops and by being paid by the government to, for the love of GOD NOT GROW ANY MORE of some others; which seems like pretty good work if you can get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was late enough in the season that almost all the crops had been harvested anyway and so, though the air was still redolent with the sweet sick smell of fertilizer, and though some heavy machinery still rested in the fields, the fields themselves were mostly vast swaths of brutalized dirt and rows of desiccated, seared, harvested corn stalks swayed in the wind like men with broken necks swinging from gallows. The moon, I noted, was full and fat and seemed preternaturally close to the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the magic of Google Maps I was able to drive willy nilly, giving no fucks about paying attention to where I had just turned or which cardinal direction my car was even pointing anymore and feel secure I could find my way back. I had turned down a particularly dark and desolate road which, unlike all the others, was named--BlackFriar Bridge Road the sign read, and Nirvana’s cover of The Man Who Sold the World had just come on Spotify when I heard another long, loud peal of thunder although it was not accompanied by lightning and no rain fell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was unnerved. I was exhilarated. I was amped as fuck, bro. The thunder, once again, felt like some kind of agreement being proffered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember hearing Cobain on my radio just after I checked my clock and saw that it was 8:04 PM:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Who knows?/Not me/We never lost control /You’re face To face /With the man who sold the world.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what happened after this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next thing I knew, it was 10:13 PM, my car was significantly lower on gas than it had been, and as far as I could tell I was still driving on BlackFriar Bridge Road, which would have meant either it was the longest, straightest, flattest road in the world or there was something wrong with the clock on my phone. I had only snapped back to attention, in fact, because a pair of super bright headlights were making my eyes throb as a car had come up behind me and was tailgating me aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought it was surely a police car using some of the more charmless cop car tactics to try to make a hapless driver fuck up and get an excuse to pull him over. As it happened, my cruise control was still set to 55 and as far as I could tell I had done an admirable job of driving pretty safely while completely blacked out for some reason, and so the putative cop I was imagining behind me must have been making constipated faces and chomping down angrily on his cigar like old Boss Hogg failing to railroad those Duke Boys one more time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt a sudden, sharp sense of confused relief when I realized there were no longer headlights blinding me from behind. Then I felt a sudden, sharp sense of confused panic when I looked up and saw that the car was now directly in front of me. It was a big, black car, a 1960 Cadillac De Ville to be exact. All the windows were tinted, and it was gliding in front of me just slowly enough to force me to pump my brakes and take my own speed down to about 50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the windows were tinted, I was absolutely sure there were two men in the car, one in the front and one in the back who was the driver’s boss. The car had no license plate but was otherwise in pristine condition. I could taste the battery acid flavored bile rise up in my throat that always comes when my adrenal glands are pumping hell for leather to try to keep me alert to an unsettling situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I considered flashing the car with my brights, then thought better of it. What the fuck would that do, I asked myself. This car seems to have disappeared from tailgating me and teleported directly in front of me to fuck with me by pumping its brakes--what the fuck interest did I have in taunting the goddamn demon car?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I slammed on my brakes hard with the wild notion that maybe I could turn around right in the middle of the road and then outrun the 60 Cadillac with my old Celica. The car was about fifty feet in front of me and still gliding forward when my car ground to a halt and I spun the wheel as far to the right as I could with plans of turning around 180 degrees in the fewest, fastest possible number of turns. I slammed on the gas and then slammed on the brakes just as fast, mashing me up against the steering wheel because the black car was now just sitting beside me, idling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I puked up more battery acid tasting bile and my heart thumped savagely when the heavily tinted driver’s window began to roll down, agonizingly slowly. I gritted my teeth. I held my breath. I felt hot tears running down my cheeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A silver haired white man in his mid 60s, wearing a chauffeur’s uniform and cap, was staring at me serenely. His gaze had the sort of beatific brilliance, radiating such calm that I was stunned into serenity or something like it myself. I could feel the tightness between my shoulders start to melt away. My breathing returned to normal. I could swallow again. We never broke eye contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Well you wouldn’t want an angel watching over you…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man grinned at me and I grinned back. As his hand reached under his seat, I had such a peaceful and loving feeling that I half expected him to pull out&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Well surprise, surprise, they wouldn’t wanna watch)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a piece of candy and offer it to me. But then instead&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(We never lost control)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was reaching for something else and as he brought it up to his face I saw that it was the most grotesque, reddest devil’s masque I had ever seen. He stared at me through the masque. It was the face of a red, leering devil with huge horns protruding from his temples and a grotesquely oversized, phallic nose which I was involuntarily picturing poking around on me, violating me and I lost my shit completely and screamed myself hoarse and felt the sensation of hot piss running down my left leg and now I just threw my car into reverse and drove backward as fast as I possibly could, totally indifferent to the likelihood of being able to maintain control or even stay on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I refused to use my mirror and so I craned and lurched my neck back as far as I could to watch behind me to try to stay on the road. There was nothing in front of me that I wanted to look at, I was sure of that much. I don’t know how long I drove this way, my neck craned to the back and in reverse going 35, 40, 45 miles per hour and expecting, at any moment, to be overtaken from in front by the godawful car that had begun to torture me for no apparent reason on what had been shaping up to be a pivotal night in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping control of my own steering wheel was difficult with my blurry vision and trembling hands. My vision was good enough, navigating exclusively through the faint glow of my tail lights and blind instinct, to stay on the road, but several times the car veered off far enough to the right or the left shoulder to start kicking up gravel and try to lurch into the ditch. I was totally positive that, if I went off the road, that was going to be all she wrote. I’d die alone out here in the dark under the stars, stark mad and gibbering against my fate to the very end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a deep breath and looked up, forward and dead ahead, and saw no car. I craned my neck once more, and saw no car behind me either, laying in wait. The comparatively wide country boulevard was also clear to my right and to my left. I sighed deeply, slowed down, came to a stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank God, I was free from whatever had been tormenting me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moment I realized the car had just vanished like a phantasm melting away, , I started to rationalize the experience. Blamed it on my own overheated brain. Blamed it on the woman I’d loved who had left me high and dry a month ago. Blamed it on my parents, who had made it clear that if I wanted to continue my useless degree I was going to be on my own and out in the cold. Hell, I even blamed it on myself. Decided part of the problem was certainly that I’d become too narcissistic, too self-obsessed in the past few months. Decided to treat the evening as a wakeup call, as the kind of brush with insanity that ultimately serves as a reality check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to pull over to the side of the road, set my navigation to take me home, put on a little music, and try to get a little sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any good driver, I checked my rearview mirror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sanity snapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mirror, I clearly saw a man in an impeccable grey suit sitting ramrod straight in my back seat. He had not been there fifteen seconds previous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His head was a cube of sugar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cube of sugar was on fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to look away from the mirror and turn around to see if he was really there but I could not tear my gaze away from the horror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thousands of flies swarmed around the fiery cube of sugar. They flew near the flame. They flew into the flame. They caught fire and the smell of burning matter joined the overpowering pungence of burning sugar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The longer I stared into the mirror, the more overwhelming the fragrance became and the louder the flies droned. It was as though, staring at the scene through the mirror, I was cementing its reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prayed to God this was all a figment of my imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt a fly land on my scalp. Another. I shut my eyes and mumbled “No no nononono.” I felt something hot singe the back of my beck. A burning, crackling fly, no doubt, burning itself into my skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned around and hoped I would see nothing at all again, just an empty back seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw a man in an impeccable grey suit with a flaming cube of sugar for a head. I knew it was Old Sugah. Old Nick. The Lord of the Flies. Flies buzzed around by the thousand. Big fat flies. Some fast, some slow. Some orbited the flaming cube of sugar, some caught fire. In Old Sugah’s left hand, he held a piece of paper. I knew it was a contract. I knew it was for me. I had a fair idea of its terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lost my sanity. I lost my consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I woke up, it was sunny and warm. The first thing I was conscious of, as I opened my eyes, was that my left hand hurt like hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was laying propped up against an old, gnarled oak tree. My left hand had been nailed to the tree, with a contract written in spidery, crimson letters pierced by the same huge iron nail. Although I was in so much pain that snot and tears were running down my face, the contract was easy to read and understand. There was, of course, a needle glistening in the grass near my right hand. The hole in my left hand was caked with dried blood. I pricked my left index finger with the pin, and smeared enough blood on my right hand to affix my signature to the document and even as I finished crossing the last “t” in my name relief washed over me and I fell into another slumber amidst the smell of sugar just short of overpowering now.&lt;/p&gt;

,nosleep,"It was a little before nine on a sunny Sunday morning and I was sitting on the front porch of the dilapidated house just off campus I was renting for the summer. My best friend, Hugh, was sitting across from me. We had been out all night drinking and arguing about 20th century literature and Rick and Morty’s place in the canon , and by now we were too tired to argue but not too tired to continue sipping on Gentleman Jack out of stolid, cut crystal tumblers on my porch.

A thunderclap came out of nowhere\-\-so sudden and harsh it felt like a punch in the gut, and then rain started to fall right through the still sunny morning sky.

“Fuck, bro,” said Hugh, “back in New Orleans when it rains on sunny days  we’d say ‘The Devil is beatin’ on his wife,’ and when Old Sugah is riled up, that’s my cue to exit.”

“Alright, bro,” I muttered, pretty content to try to sleep all this off anyway. But then I was suddenly curious, “Wait, who the fuck is Old Sugah?”

“Oh, my granny used to call the Devil Old Sugar. Because of how he was Lord of the Flies, they said, and she figured the lord of the flies would have a sugarcube for a head. Made him the lord of absinthe, too, the real shit, not the weak concoction they sell now\-\-cuz the real shit tastes so evil you have to sweeten it with a cube of burning sugar.”

“You come from quite a family, Hugh.”

“Don’t I know it. Old Sugah beatin’ on his wife,” he remarked again, pointing his handsome face directly into the sun as if to stare it down, “means today is gonna be a weird one.”

“I guess so,” I said to his back as he ambled down the sidewalk and out of sight, and then thought that right about now I could use a weird day. At least a weird day would be some kind of change\-\-it was all these normal ones that were blowing my shit.

Hugh and I were both English graduate students at the University of Illinois in the Middle of Fucking Nowhere. It was easy to pretend we both had similar futures ahead of us\-\-but whereas Hughbert Kempton Ruggles Boyd was a brilliant 20something who came from old Cavalier money down in Louisiana, I was a half\-smart Yankee boy who came from a Chicago burb with a family that didn’t give a shit if he lived or died. 

There was a PhD and probably an eventual tenured job at a prestigious university in Hugh’s future. My own future was more likely to involve lecturing suburban high school kids about the dangers of comma splices, and possibly being thought of as a semi\-cool teacher because I knew who Cardi B was and probably wouldn’t bother to confiscate their Juuls most of the time.

I had written a screenplay, of course, just like everyone else I knew; one I had honestly believed was going to make me rich. But there had been no traction, no representation, not even any social media buzz. And so here I was sitting and listening to the sounds of rain through heavy sunshine and hoping for one fuck of a weird day.

A black millipede, big and fat as my thumb scurried across the rickety white Ikea table Hugh’s emptied tumbler and my tumbler, still half full of rich brown booze, rested on. I considered crushing the brazen beastie with my sturdy, cut crystal tumbler, felt too squeamish, and decided against it.  Just the thought of its pinkish guts sprawled across the table made me feel like dry heaving.

A huge black millipede is *my* cue to leave basically any situation, so I downed the rest of my Gentleman Jack in a single gulp and took one last look around my neighborhood and muttered “Oh well. PIss on all of it,” and staggered into my bedroom to prepare to pass out while another peal of thunder whooped across the sunny sky.

I was drunk enough to not undress from my old madras short sleeve button down shirt and khaki shorts, but sober enough to cue up my preferred sleeping playlist on Spotify \(heavy on The National and The Mountain Goats\) and I dozed off at long last while Matt Berninger moodily sang to me that, while I may not want an angel watching over me, \(surprise surprise!\) they wouldn’t wanna watch.

A little before 3, I woke up to the charmless sensation of an enormous black house fly landing on my lips like a lover’s kiss. This time I slapped furiously at the fly and missed completely, succeeding only in rapping myself in the nose like you might swat a bad puppy who has just chewed up your one pair of loafers suitable for job interviews. The fly was a bona fide monster, and it just hung lazily in the air over my face for a moment, buzzing languidly, and then drifted off to rest on my drapes.

“Fuuuuuuck,” I said, hopping to my feet. “Shiiiiiiit,” I added, reminiscing unfondly about the bug that had just been poised on my lips, probably pooping, as I recalled reading somewhere that flies poop everywhere they land.

I stormed angrily to the adjoining bathroom and brushed my teeth  and looked back into the bedroom to note that four or five more big black flies had begun buzzing around the bedroom. The buzzing of the flies combined into a single, ominous drone that filled me with a hazy but unmistakable sense of dread.

I got angrier to try to keep from getting scared. It didn’t really work.

There was nothing to be scared of, I assured myself. This was just one of those mindfucks where all the free floating panic in my brain had been looking for a nice place to land and have a picnic and today my old pal Dreadful Panic had finally decided to land on my reactions to  a little bit of weird weather and a few gross but harmless bugs, and now the panic was contentedly chilling out and having a nice meal\-\-and my peace of mind was the main course.

I popped gooseflesh.

Probably sick too, I realized\-\-or else too much booze was thinning my blood and making warm rooms on a warm day in a hot month feel chilly.

I rinsed my mouth out. Took care not to look in my bathroom mirror, because I’ve had a weird, vague horror of mirrors ever since I was a little kid, and when I start getting spooked I start to avoid them. I know there’s no boogeyman standing behind me, but I’ve always known I have the kind of brain who can conjure one up, and if I glance in a mirror and my brain plays a funny trick on me like making me believe there is some kind of man shaped thing with the head of a housefly \(or a sugar cube\)  standing right behind me then I’m definitely going to go nuts as soon as I see it and I’ve always feared insanity more than anything else.

I took a deep breath and strutted back into my bedroom to take my phone from the bedside table. Then I walked right back out into the living room, swatting away a couple of flies I hadn’t noticed before in the process.

Walked. Didn’t run but walked. Made it a point to walk in a nice, measured way\-\-a crazy person losing his shit would run, but I was avid to prove to myself that I was calming down. Buddha\-like, basically\-\-that was me.

I tried to think of a reason to leave the house that wouldn’t feel like a horror film protagonist running out of the haunted house and praying that his car engine turns over. Checked the time and weather\-\-3:10 in the afternoon and the weather was supposed to be hot and humid but no more thunderstorms were in the forecast.

I realized that just going through some of my normal routines was calming me down. My friends were living their lives all over my FaceBook account, and everything was churning along like clockwork. Someone had posted several photos from the academic conference they were at in Arizona, someone else posted some pics of their new baby, an adamantly child\-free mutual acquaintance posted some pics of her Labradoodle in response, and I realized after a few minutes of liking and loving and babbling banal bullshit comments from time to time, my breathing was back to normal and I didn’t feel the same unsettling chill. To be on the safe side, I ambled over and shut the door to my bedroom \(as freaked out as I had been, the fact I had not thought to do that only further confirmed I have the survival instincts of a hamster\) and then opened up my computer to while away a little time working on my screenplay.

Let me tell you about my screenplay. Ha just kidding! Come back, I wouldn’t do that to you.

The important thing was, I had kept assuring myself, that I *had* a screenplay. I had created a thing and now I had to help that created thing find a place in the world. Or, to be more crass, I had to keep working until the thing I had created was a thing other people would want to consume. Something they would be willing to *pay* to consume. I was a long way from where I needed to be.

I had written a plodding, and fairly polite coming of age film about a hapless male protagonist and his ill\-fated efforts to win the love of his so\-far\-out\-of\-his\-league best lady friend. In the end, although he doesn’t get the girl, my protagonist is a little wiser for his disappointment. Looking back now, I can promise you it was every bit as hollow and banal and bland as it sounds. Call it “Woke Say Anything.” Call it “Indistinguishable from half the movies released in the past half decade.” Call it bullshit. That’s what I finally did. Right then and there, sitting at my computer and staring at the screen, I realized *that* was my one and only problem: The thing I had created was boring bullshit and I had better goddamn well make something scintillating unless I wanted a future of trying to teach kids with 10k Twitter followers and the attention spans of gnats what a “gerund” is.

There was an empty tumbler and a full bottle of Bulleit Rye by my computer when I sat down, feeling suddenly energized. “Don’t mind if I do,” I said to no one at all, pouring a glass of rye and opening up a blank document.

I wrote furiously, in a kind of reverie. I got my ass to work on a screenplay that was gonna push *everybody’s* buttons. Now the protagonist, the apparent “nice guy” led a double life as a sadistic Lothario. I channeled every frustrated “nice dude’s” deep, dark id and just aired it all out. The fantasies about sexual dominance to overcome the feelings of deep inadequacy. Fantasies about playing fucked up psychosexual games \(at one point the “hero” of the story blackmails a woman by threatening to send the receipt for the abortion he had paid for to her super\-religious mother\). Pivotal scenes about using sexual conquests for their only real purpose to guys like the narrator\-\-as dominance displays to cow other, weaker males. The narrator was infuriating. He was amoral. He was the Red Pill subreddit come to life. He was Patrick Bateman for Generation InCel and I was absolutely certain that I had such incendiary content on my hands, even after such a rough pass, that it was going to make me rich and infamous.

Did I lose track of time as I pounded out my draft? You bet I did. I was vaguely aware of the room growing colder and colder. When I reached the point in the narrative where the narrator first lets his masque of niceness slip and reveals that he has poisoned the beloved pet parrot of his gay neighbor for no other reason than to surreptitiously record the pathetic man breaking down in tears and post it to his YouTube channel I was aware of a loud, cacophonous buzzing and vaguely noted that the flies must have found their way in. This felt strangely reassuring to me\-\-the swarms of flies felt like a handshake, like something clicking into place.

It was when I reached the pivotal scene\-\-in which the narrator blackmails his ex lover into giving him one last blowjob in exchange for not revealing the details of her abortion to her rich, deeply Christian mother who would both cut off all her love and cut her daughter out of the will if she knew\-\-that it dawned on me at some point I must have put on my heaviest turtleneck sweater and still I was so cold I was shivering and when I looked up I saw that the room was now full of huge, buzzing flies weaving around in desultory, erratic flight paths.

I looked down at my work and saw that it was good.

In only a few hours, I had written something infinitely more marketable, and better, than the screenplay I had been dicking around on bit by bit for over a year. The flies buzzed and I grinned.

I decided to take a long, fast drive on the backroads just outside of the small university town where I lived. It seemed like a good way to exorcise the very nearly sexual sense of ecstasy I was experiencing and get myself together enough to finish up the screenplay.

It was 6:30 when I went out to my 2003 midnight blue Celica Sedan, now dressed appropriately for the season in my old madras shorts and a Father John Misty tee shirt. I slid into my seat. I buckled my seatbelt. I started the car. I began to check my mirror, and still couldn’t *quite* bring myself to deal with a mirror right now, so I did a slow K Turn in my driveway and pulled out onto Division Street.

As unsettled as I had felt for much of the day, I was exuberant about the progress I’d made on my project and was willing to write off the angst and the anxiety as the cost of doing business for someone whose creative juices were finally starting to flow. I glided down narrow, dark streets and cranked up my Spotify on the car stereo, singing along enthusiastically while Frank Black explained that he was, was a Debaser.

I left the city limits of Champaign\-Urbana, the very small city that contains the U of I and drove out into the very large and dark Nothing just outside town where the roads have names like “Rural Route 6” or “County Drive 31,” and where farmers live in big houses and make their living by growing some crops and by being paid by the government to, for the love of GOD NOT GROW ANY MORE of some others; which seems like pretty good work if you can get it.

It was late enough in the season that almost all the crops had been harvested anyway and so, though the air was still redolent with the sweet sick smell of fertilizer, and though some heavy machinery still rested in the fields, the fields themselves were mostly vast swaths of brutalized dirt and rows of desiccated, seared, harvested corn stalks swayed in the wind like men with broken necks swinging from gallows. The moon, I noted, was full and fat and seemed preternaturally close to the earth.

Thanks to the magic of Google Maps I was able to drive willy nilly, giving no fucks about paying attention to where I had just turned or which cardinal direction my car was even pointing anymore and feel secure I could find my way back. I had turned down a particularly dark and desolate road which, unlike all the others, was named\-\-BlackFriar Bridge Road the sign read, and Nirvana’s cover of The Man Who Sold the World had just come on Spotify when I heard another long, loud peal of thunder although it was not accompanied by lightning and no rain fell.

I was unnerved. I was exhilarated. I was amped as fuck, bro. The thunder, once again, felt like some kind of agreement being proffered.

I remember hearing Cobain on my radio just after I checked my clock and saw that it was 8:04 PM:

""Who knows?/Not me/We never lost control /You’re face To face /With the man who sold the world.""

I don’t know what happened after this.

The next thing I knew, it was 10:13 PM, my car was significantly lower on gas than it had been, and as far as I could tell I was still driving on BlackFriar Bridge Road, which would have meant either it was the longest, straightest, flattest road in the world or there was something wrong with the clock on my phone. I had only snapped back to attention, in fact, because a pair of super bright headlights were making my eyes throb as a car had come up behind me and was tailgating me aggressively.

At first, I thought it was surely a police car using some of the more charmless cop car tactics to try to make a hapless driver fuck up and get an excuse to pull him over. As it happened, my cruise control was still set to 55 and as far as I could tell I had done an admirable job of driving pretty safely while completely blacked out for some reason, and so the putative cop I was imagining behind me must have been making constipated faces and chomping down angrily on his cigar like old Boss Hogg failing to railroad those Duke Boys one more time.

I felt a sudden, sharp sense of confused relief when I realized there were no longer headlights blinding me from behind.  Then I felt a sudden, sharp sense of confused panic when I looked up and saw that the car was now directly in front of me. It was a big, black car, a 1960 Cadillac De Ville to be exact.  All the windows were tinted, and it was gliding in front of me just slowly enough to force me to pump my brakes and take my own speed down to about 50.

Even though the windows were tinted, I was absolutely sure there were two men in the car, one in the front and one in the back who was the driver’s boss. The car had no license plate but was otherwise in pristine condition. I could taste the battery acid flavored bile rise up in my throat that always comes when my adrenal glands are pumping hell for leather to try to keep me alert to an unsettling situation.

I considered flashing the car with my brights, then thought better of it. What the fuck would that do, I asked myself. This car seems to have disappeared from tailgating me and teleported directly in front of me to fuck with me by pumping its brakes--what the fuck interest did I have in taunting the goddamn demon car?

In fact, I slammed on my brakes hard with the wild notion that maybe I could turn around right in the middle of the road and then outrun the 60 Cadillac with my old Celica. The car was about fifty feet in front of me and still gliding forward when my car ground to a halt and I spun the wheel as far to the right as I could with plans of turning around 180 degrees in the fewest, fastest possible number of turns. I slammed on the gas and then slammed on the brakes just as fast, mashing me up against the steering wheel because the black car was now just sitting beside me, idling.

I puked up more battery acid tasting bile and my heart thumped savagely when the heavily tinted driver’s window began to roll down, agonizingly slowly. I gritted my teeth. I held my breath. I felt hot tears running down my cheeks.

A silver haired white man in his mid 60s, wearing a chauffeur’s uniform and cap, was staring at me serenely. His gaze had the sort of beatific brilliance, radiating such calm that I was stunned into serenity or something like it myself. I could feel the tightness between my shoulders start to melt away. My breathing returned to normal. I could swallow again. We never broke eye contact.

(Well you wouldn’t want an angel watching over you…)

The man grinned at me and I grinned back. As his hand reached under his seat, I had such a peaceful and loving feeling that I half expected him to pull out

(Well surprise, surprise, they wouldn’t wanna watch)

a piece of candy and offer it to me. But then instead

(We never lost control)

He was reaching for something else and as he brought it up to his face I saw that it was the most grotesque, reddest  devil’s masque I had ever seen. He stared at me through the masque. It was the face of a red, leering devil with huge horns protruding from his temples and a grotesquely oversized, phallic nose which I was involuntarily picturing poking around on me, violating me and I lost my shit completely and screamed myself hoarse and felt the sensation of hot piss running down my left leg and now I just threw my car into reverse and drove backward as fast as I possibly could, totally indifferent to the likelihood of being able to maintain control or even stay on the road.

I refused to use my mirror and so I craned and lurched  my neck back as far as I could to watch behind me to try to stay on the road. There was nothing in front of me that I wanted to look at, I was sure of that much. I don’t know how long I drove this way, my neck craned to the back and in reverse going 35, 40, 45 miles per hour and expecting, at any moment, to be overtaken from in front by the godawful car that had begun to torture me for no apparent reason on what had been shaping up to be a pivotal night in my life.

Keeping control of my own steering wheel was difficult with my blurry vision and trembling hands. My vision was good enough, navigating exclusively through the faint glow of my tail lights and blind instinct, to stay on the road, but several times the car veered off far enough to the right or the left shoulder to start kicking up gravel and try to lurch into the ditch. I was totally positive that, if I went off the road, that was going to be all she wrote. I’d die alone out here in the dark under the stars, stark mad and gibbering against my fate to the very end.

I took a deep breath and looked up, forward and dead ahead, and saw no car. I craned my neck once more, and saw no car behind me either, laying in wait. The comparatively wide country boulevard was also clear to my right and to my left. I sighed deeply, slowed down, came to a stop.

I was free.

Thank God, I was free from whatever had been tormenting me.

The moment I realized the car had just vanished like a phantasm melting away, , I started to rationalize the experience. Blamed it on my own overheated brain. Blamed it on the woman I’d loved who had left me high and dry a month ago. Blamed it on my parents, who had made it clear that if I wanted to continue my useless degree I was going to be on my own and out in the cold. Hell, I even blamed it on myself. Decided part of the problem was certainly that I’d become too narcissistic, too self\-obsessed in the past few months. Decided to treat the evening as a wakeup call, as the kind of brush with insanity that ultimately serves as a reality check.

I decided to pull over to the side of the road, set my navigation to take me home, put on a little music,  and try to get a little sleep.

Like any good driver, I checked my rearview mirror.

My sanity snapped.

In the mirror, I clearly saw a man in an impeccable grey suit sitting ramrod straight in my back seat. He had not been there fifteen seconds previous.

His head was a cube of sugar.

The cube of sugar was on fire.

I tried to look away from the mirror and turn around to see if he was really there but I could not tear my gaze away from the horror.

Thousands of flies swarmed around the fiery cube of sugar. They flew near the flame. They flew into the flame. They caught fire and the smell of burning matter joined the overpowering pungence of burning sugar.

The longer I stared into the mirror, the more overwhelming the fragrance became and the louder the flies droned. It was as though, staring at the scene through the mirror, I was cementing its reality.

I prayed to God this was all a figment of my imagination.

I felt a fly land on my scalp. Another. I shut my eyes and mumbled “No no nononono.” I felt something hot singe the back of my beck. A burning, crackling fly, no doubt, burning itself into my skin.

I turned around and hoped I would see nothing at all again, just an empty back seat.

I saw a man in an impeccable grey suit with a flaming cube of sugar for a head. I knew it was Old Sugah. Old Nick. The Lord of the Flies. Flies buzzed around by the thousand. Big fat flies. Some fast, some slow. Some orbited the flaming cube of sugar, some caught fire. In Old Sugah’s left hand, he held a piece of paper. I knew it was a contract. I knew it was for me. I had a fair idea of its terms.

I lost my sanity. I lost my consciousness.

When I woke up, it was sunny and warm. The first thing I was conscious of, as I opened my eyes, was that my left hand hurt like hell.

I was laying propped up against an old, gnarled oak tree. My left hand had been nailed to the tree, with a contract written in spidery, crimson letters pierced by the same huge iron nail. Although I was in so much pain that snot and tears were running down my face, the contract was easy to read and understand. There was, of course, a needle glistening in the grass near my right hand. The hole in my left hand was caked with dried blood. I pricked my left index finger with the pin, and smeared enough blood on my right hand to affix my signature to the document and even as I finished crossing the last “t” in my name relief washed over me and I fell into another slumber amidst the smell of sugar just short of overpowering now.",,False,,0,False,Production Hell The Devil is Beating on his Wife,[],,False,6.0,,0.0,,,False,t3_8jlf05,,dark,,,public,30.0,,{},,,False,[],,False,,,{},,,30,,,,self,1526391182.0,,[],,['writing'],True,,1526418380.0,text,6.0,,,text,self.nosleep,,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a little before nine on a sunny Sunday morning and I was sitting on the front porch of the dilapidated house just off campus I was renting for the summer. My best friend, Hugh, was sitting across from me. We had been out all night drinking and arguing about 20th century literature and Rick and Morty’s place in the canon , and by now we were too tired to argue but not too tired to continue sipping on Gentleman Jack out of stolid, cut crystal tumblers on my porch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thunderclap came out of nowhere--so sudden and harsh it felt like a punch in the gut, and then rain started to fall right through the still sunny morning sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fuck, bro,” said Hugh, “back in New Orleans when it rains on sunny days  we’d say ‘The Devil is beatin’ on his wife,’ and when Old Sugah is riled up, that’s my cue to exit.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Alright, bro,” I muttered, pretty content to try to sleep all this off anyway. But then I was suddenly curious, “Wait, who the fuck is Old Sugah?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh, my granny used to call the Devil Old Sugar. Because of how he was Lord of the Flies, they said, and she figured the lord of the flies would have a sugarcube for a head. Made him the lord of absinthe, too, the real shit, not the weak concoction they sell now--cuz the real shit tastes so evil you have to sweeten it with a cube of burning sugar.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You come from quite a family, Hugh.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t I know it. Old Sugah beatin’ on his wife,” he remarked again, pointing his handsome face directly into the sun as if to stare it down, “means today is gonna be a weird one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I guess so,” I said to his back as he ambled down the sidewalk and out of sight, and then thought that right about now I could use a weird day. At least a weird day would be some kind of change--it was all these normal ones that were blowing my shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugh and I were both English graduate students at the University of Illinois in the Middle of Fucking Nowhere. It was easy to pretend we both had similar futures ahead of us--but whereas Hughbert Kempton Ruggles Boyd was a brilliant 20something who came from old Cavalier money down in Louisiana, I was a half-smart Yankee boy who came from a Chicago burb with a family that didn’t give a shit if he lived or died. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a PhD and probably an eventual tenured job at a prestigious university in Hugh’s future. My own future was more likely to involve lecturing suburban high school kids about the dangers of comma splices, and possibly being thought of as a semi-cool teacher because I knew who Cardi B was and probably wouldn’t bother to confiscate their Juuls most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had written a screenplay, of course, just like everyone else I knew; one I had honestly believed was going to make me rich. But there had been no traction, no representation, not even any social media buzz. And so here I was sitting and listening to the sounds of rain through heavy sunshine and hoping for one fuck of a weird day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A black millipede, big and fat as my thumb scurried across the rickety white Ikea table Hugh’s emptied tumbler and my tumbler, still half full of rich brown booze, rested on. I considered crushing the brazen beastie with my sturdy, cut crystal tumbler, felt too squeamish, and decided against it.  Just the thought of its pinkish guts sprawled across the table made me feel like dry heaving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A huge black millipede is &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; cue to leave basically any situation, so I downed the rest of my Gentleman Jack in a single gulp and took one last look around my neighborhood and muttered “Oh well. PIss on all of it,” and staggered into my bedroom to prepare to pass out while another peal of thunder whooped across the sunny sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was drunk enough to not undress from my old madras short sleeve button down shirt and khaki shorts, but sober enough to cue up my preferred sleeping playlist on Spotify (heavy on The National and The Mountain Goats) and I dozed off at long last while Matt Berninger moodily sang to me that, while I may not want an angel watching over me, (surprise surprise!) they wouldn’t wanna watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little before 3, I woke up to the charmless sensation of an enormous black house fly landing on my lips like a lover’s kiss. This time I slapped furiously at the fly and missed completely, succeeding only in rapping myself in the nose like you might swat a bad puppy who has just chewed up your one pair of loafers suitable for job interviews. The fly was a bona fide monster, and it just hung lazily in the air over my face for a moment, buzzing languidly, and then drifted off to rest on my drapes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fuuuuuuck,” I said, hopping to my feet. “Shiiiiiiit,” I added, reminiscing unfondly about the bug that had just been poised on my lips, probably pooping, as I recalled reading somewhere that flies poop everywhere they land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stormed angrily to the adjoining bathroom and brushed my teeth  and looked back into the bedroom to note that four or five more big black flies had begun buzzing around the bedroom. The buzzing of the flies combined into a single, ominous drone that filled me with a hazy but unmistakable sense of dread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got angrier to try to keep from getting scared. It didn’t really work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was nothing to be scared of, I assured myself. This was just one of those mindfucks where all the free floating panic in my brain had been looking for a nice place to land and have a picnic and today my old pal Dreadful Panic had finally decided to land on my reactions to  a little bit of weird weather and a few gross but harmless bugs, and now the panic was contentedly chilling out and having a nice meal--and my peace of mind was the main course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I popped gooseflesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably sick too, I realized--or else too much booze was thinning my blood and making warm rooms on a warm day in a hot month feel chilly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rinsed my mouth out. Took care not to look in my bathroom mirror, because I’ve had a weird, vague horror of mirrors ever since I was a little kid, and when I start getting spooked I start to avoid them. I know there’s no boogeyman standing behind me, but I’ve always known I have the kind of brain who can conjure one up, and if I glance in a mirror and my brain plays a funny trick on me like making me believe there is some kind of man shaped thing with the head of a housefly (or a sugar cube)  standing right behind me then I’m definitely going to go nuts as soon as I see it and I’ve always feared insanity more than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a deep breath and strutted back into my bedroom to take my phone from the bedside table. Then I walked right back out into the living room, swatting away a couple of flies I hadn’t noticed before in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walked. Didn’t run but walked. Made it a point to walk in a nice, measured way--a crazy person losing his shit would run, but I was avid to prove to myself that I was calming down. Buddha-like, basically--that was me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to think of a reason to leave the house that wouldn’t feel like a horror film protagonist running out of the haunted house and praying that his car engine turns over. Checked the time and weather--3:10 in the afternoon and the weather was supposed to be hot and humid but no more thunderstorms were in the forecast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized that just going through some of my normal routines was calming me down. My friends were living their lives all over my FaceBook account, and everything was churning along like clockwork. Someone had posted several photos from the academic conference they were at in Arizona, someone else posted some pics of their new baby, an adamantly child-free mutual acquaintance posted some pics of her Labradoodle in response, and I realized after a few minutes of liking and loving and babbling banal bullshit comments from time to time, my breathing was back to normal and I didn’t feel the same unsettling chill. To be on the safe side, I ambled over and shut the door to my bedroom (as freaked out as I had been, the fact I had not thought to do that only further confirmed I have the survival instincts of a hamster) and then opened up my computer to while away a little time working on my screenplay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you about my screenplay. Ha just kidding! Come back, I wouldn’t do that to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important thing was, I had kept assuring myself, that I &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; a screenplay. I had created a thing and now I had to help that created thing find a place in the world. Or, to be more crass, I had to keep working until the thing I had created was a thing other people would want to consume. Something they would be willing to &lt;em&gt;pay&lt;/em&gt; to consume. I was a long way from where I needed to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had written a plodding, and fairly polite coming of age film about a hapless male protagonist and his ill-fated efforts to win the love of his so-far-out-of-his-league best lady friend. In the end, although he doesn’t get the girl, my protagonist is a little wiser for his disappointment. Looking back now, I can promise you it was every bit as hollow and banal and bland as it sounds. Call it “Woke Say Anything.” Call it “Indistinguishable from half the movies released in the past half decade.” Call it bullshit. That’s what I finally did. Right then and there, sitting at my computer and staring at the screen, I realized &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; was my one and only problem: The thing I had created was boring bullshit and I had better goddamn well make something scintillating unless I wanted a future of trying to teach kids with 10k Twitter followers and the attention spans of gnats what a “gerund” is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was an empty tumbler and a full bottle of Bulleit Rye by my computer when I sat down, feeling suddenly energized. “Don’t mind if I do,” I said to no one at all, pouring a glass of rye and opening up a blank document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote furiously, in a kind of reverie. I got my ass to work on a screenplay that was gonna push &lt;em&gt;everybody’s&lt;/em&gt; buttons. Now the protagonist, the apparent “nice guy” led a double life as a sadistic Lothario. I channeled every frustrated “nice dude’s” deep, dark id and just aired it all out. The fantasies about sexual dominance to overcome the feelings of deep inadequacy. Fantasies about playing fucked up psychosexual games (at one point the “hero” of the story blackmails a woman by threatening to send the receipt for the abortion he had paid for to her super-religious mother). Pivotal scenes about using sexual conquests for their only real purpose to guys like the narrator--as dominance displays to cow other, weaker males. The narrator was infuriating. He was amoral. He was the Red Pill subreddit come to life. He was Patrick Bateman for Generation InCel and I was absolutely certain that I had such incendiary content on my hands, even after such a rough pass, that it was going to make me rich and infamous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I lose track of time as I pounded out my draft? You bet I did. I was vaguely aware of the room growing colder and colder. When I reached the point in the narrative where the narrator first lets his masque of niceness slip and reveals that he has poisoned the beloved pet parrot of his gay neighbor for no other reason than to surreptitiously record the pathetic man breaking down in tears and post it to his YouTube channel I was aware of a loud, cacophonous buzzing and vaguely noted that the flies must have found their way in. This felt strangely reassuring to me--the swarms of flies felt like a handshake, like something clicking into place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was when I reached the pivotal scene--in which the narrator blackmails his ex lover into giving him one last blowjob in exchange for not revealing the details of her abortion to her rich, deeply Christian mother who would both cut off all her love and cut her daughter out of the will if she knew--that it dawned on me at some point I must have put on my heaviest turtleneck sweater and still I was so cold I was shivering and when I looked up I saw that the room was now full of huge, buzzing flies weaving around in desultory, erratic flight paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked down at my work and saw that it was good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In only a few hours, I had written something infinitely more marketable, and better, than the screenplay I had been dicking around on bit by bit for over a year. The flies buzzed and I grinned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to take a long, fast drive on the backroads just outside of the small university town where I lived. It seemed like a good way to exorcise the very nearly sexual sense of ecstasy I was experiencing and get myself together enough to finish up the screenplay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was 6:30 when I went out to my 2003 midnight blue Celica Sedan, now dressed appropriately for the season in my old madras shorts and a Father John Misty tee shirt. I slid into my seat. I buckled my seatbelt. I started the car. I began to check my mirror, and still couldn’t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; bring myself to deal with a mirror right now, so I did a slow K Turn in my driveway and pulled out onto Division Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As unsettled as I had felt for much of the day, I was exuberant about the progress I’d made on my project and was willing to write off the angst and the anxiety as the cost of doing business for someone whose creative juices were finally starting to flow. I glided down narrow, dark streets and cranked up my Spotify on the car stereo, singing along enthusiastically while Frank Black explained that he was, was a Debaser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left the city limits of Champaign-Urbana, the very small city that contains the U of I and drove out into the very large and dark Nothing just outside town where the roads have names like “Rural Route 6” or “County Drive 31,” and where farmers live in big houses and make their living by growing some crops and by being paid by the government to, for the love of GOD NOT GROW ANY MORE of some others; which seems like pretty good work if you can get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was late enough in the season that almost all the crops had been harvested anyway and so, though the air was still redolent with the sweet sick smell of fertilizer, and though some heavy machinery still rested in the fields, the fields themselves were mostly vast swaths of brutalized dirt and rows of desiccated, seared, harvested corn stalks swayed in the wind like men with broken necks swinging from gallows. The moon, I noted, was full and fat and seemed preternaturally close to the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the magic of Google Maps I was able to drive willy nilly, giving no fucks about paying attention to where I had just turned or which cardinal direction my car was even pointing anymore and feel secure I could find my way back. I had turned down a particularly dark and desolate road which, unlike all the others, was named--BlackFriar Bridge Road the sign read, and Nirvana’s cover of The Man Who Sold the World had just come on Spotify when I heard another long, loud peal of thunder although it was not accompanied by lightning and no rain fell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was unnerved. I was exhilarated. I was amped as fuck, bro. The thunder, once again, felt like some kind of agreement being proffered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember hearing Cobain on my radio just after I checked my clock and saw that it was 8:04 PM:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Who knows?/Not me/We never lost control /You’re face To face /With the man who sold the world.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what happened after this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next thing I knew, it was 10:13 PM, my car was significantly lower on gas than it had been, and as far as I could tell I was still driving on BlackFriar Bridge Road, which would have meant either it was the longest, straightest, flattest road in the world or there was something wrong with the clock on my phone. I had only snapped back to attention, in fact, because a pair of super bright headlights were making my eyes throb as a car had come up behind me and was tailgating me aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought it was surely a police car using some of the more charmless cop car tactics to try to make a hapless driver fuck up and get an excuse to pull him over. As it happened, my cruise control was still set to 55 and as far as I could tell I had done an admirable job of driving pretty safely while completely blacked out for some reason, and so the putative cop I was imagining behind me must have been making constipated faces and chomping down angrily on his cigar like old Boss Hogg failing to railroad those Duke Boys one more time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt a sudden, sharp sense of confused relief when I realized there were no longer headlights blinding me from behind.  Then I felt a sudden, sharp sense of confused panic when I looked up and saw that the car was now directly in front of me. It was a big, black car, a 1960 Cadillac De Ville to be exact.  All the windows were tinted, and it was gliding in front of me just slowly enough to force me to pump my brakes and take my own speed down to about 50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the windows were tinted, I was absolutely sure there were two men in the car, one in the front and one in the back who was the driver’s boss. The car had no license plate but was otherwise in pristine condition. I could taste the battery acid flavored bile rise up in my throat that always comes when my adrenal glands are pumping hell for leather to try to keep me alert to an unsettling situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I considered flashing the car with my brights, then thought better of it. What the fuck would that do, I asked myself. This car seems to have disappeared from tailgating me and teleported directly in front of me to fuck with me by pumping its brakes--what the fuck interest did I have in taunting the goddamn demon car?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I slammed on my brakes hard with the wild notion that maybe I could turn around right in the middle of the road and then outrun the 60 Cadillac with my old Celica. The car was about fifty feet in front of me and still gliding forward when my car ground to a halt and I spun the wheel as far to the right as I could with plans of turning around 180 degrees in the fewest, fastest possible number of turns. I slammed on the gas and then slammed on the brakes just as fast, mashing me up against the steering wheel because the black car was now just sitting beside me, idling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I puked up more battery acid tasting bile and my heart thumped savagely when the heavily tinted driver’s window began to roll down, agonizingly slowly. I gritted my teeth. I held my breath. I felt hot tears running down my cheeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A silver haired white man in his mid 60s, wearing a chauffeur’s uniform and cap, was staring at me serenely. His gaze had the sort of beatific brilliance, radiating such calm that I was stunned into serenity or something like it myself. I could feel the tightness between my shoulders start to melt away. My breathing returned to normal. I could swallow again. We never broke eye contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Well you wouldn’t want an angel watching over you…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man grinned at me and I grinned back. As his hand reached under his seat, I had such a peaceful and loving feeling that I half expected him to pull out&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Well surprise, surprise, they wouldn’t wanna watch)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a piece of candy and offer it to me. But then instead&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(We never lost control)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was reaching for something else and as he brought it up to his face I saw that it was the most grotesque, reddest  devil’s masque I had ever seen. He stared at me through the masque. It was the face of a red, leering devil with huge horns protruding from his temples and a grotesquely oversized, phallic nose which I was involuntarily picturing poking around on me, violating me and I lost my shit completely and screamed myself hoarse and felt the sensation of hot piss running down my left leg and now I just threw my car into reverse and drove backward as fast as I possibly could, totally indifferent to the likelihood of being able to maintain control or even stay on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I refused to use my mirror and so I craned and lurched  my neck back as far as I could to watch behind me to try to stay on the road. There was nothing in front of me that I wanted to look at, I was sure of that much. I don’t know how long I drove this way, my neck craned to the back and in reverse going 35, 40, 45 miles per hour and expecting, at any moment, to be overtaken from in front by the godawful car that had begun to torture me for no apparent reason on what had been shaping up to be a pivotal night in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping control of my own steering wheel was difficult with my blurry vision and trembling hands. My vision was good enough, navigating exclusively through the faint glow of my tail lights and blind instinct, to stay on the road, but several times the car veered off far enough to the right or the left shoulder to start kicking up gravel and try to lurch into the ditch. I was totally positive that, if I went off the road, that was going to be all she wrote. I’d die alone out here in the dark under the stars, stark mad and gibbering against my fate to the very end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a deep breath and looked up, forward and dead ahead, and saw no car. I craned my neck once more, and saw no car behind me either, laying in wait. The comparatively wide country boulevard was also clear to my right and to my left. I sighed deeply, slowed down, came to a stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank God, I was free from whatever had been tormenting me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moment I realized the car had just vanished like a phantasm melting away, , I started to rationalize the experience. Blamed it on my own overheated brain. Blamed it on the woman I’d loved who had left me high and dry a month ago. Blamed it on my parents, who had made it clear that if I wanted to continue my useless degree I was going to be on my own and out in the cold. Hell, I even blamed it on myself. Decided part of the problem was certainly that I’d become too narcissistic, too self-obsessed in the past few months. Decided to treat the evening as a wakeup call, as the kind of brush with insanity that ultimately serves as a reality check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to pull over to the side of the road, set my navigation to take me home, put on a little music,  and try to get a little sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any good driver, I checked my rearview mirror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sanity snapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mirror, I clearly saw a man in an impeccable grey suit sitting ramrod straight in my back seat. He had not been there fifteen seconds previous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His head was a cube of sugar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cube of sugar was on fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to look away from the mirror and turn around to see if he was really there but I could not tear my gaze away from the horror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thousands of flies swarmed around the fiery cube of sugar. They flew near the flame. They flew into the flame. They caught fire and the smell of burning matter joined the overpowering pungence of burning sugar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The longer I stared into the mirror, the more overwhelming the fragrance became and the louder the flies droned. It was as though, staring at the scene through the mirror, I was cementing its reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prayed to God this was all a figment of my imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt a fly land on my scalp. Another. I shut my eyes and mumbled “No no nononono.” I felt something hot singe the back of my beck. A burning, crackling fly, no doubt, burning itself into my skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned around and hoped I would see nothing at all again, just an empty back seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw a man in an impeccable grey suit with a flaming cube of sugar for a head. I knew it was Old Sugah. Old Nick. The Lord of the Flies. Flies buzzed around by the thousand. Big fat flies. Some fast, some slow. Some orbited the flaming cube of sugar, some caught fire. In Old Sugah’s left hand, he held a piece of paper. I knew it was a contract. I knew it was for me. I had a fair idea of its terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lost my sanity. I lost my consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I woke up, it was sunny and warm. The first thing I was conscious of, as I opened my eyes, was that my left hand hurt like hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was laying propped up against an old, gnarled oak tree. My left hand had been nailed to the tree, with a contract written in spidery, crimson letters pierced by the same huge iron nail. Although I was in so much pain that snot and tears were running down my face, the contract was easy to read and understand. There was, of course, a needle glistening in the grass near my right hand. The hole in my left hand was caked with dried blood. I pricked my left index finger with the pin, and smeared enough blood on my right hand to affix my signature to the document and even as I finished crossing the last “t” in my name relief washed over me and I fell into another slumber amidst the smell of sugar just short of overpowering now.&lt;/p&gt;

,u_Perkspiration,"Do you sometimes feel that you’re not as passionate about working out now as you were when you first started? Does morning sleep sound better to you as compared to heading to the gym and kicking some ass? It’s nothing to be disheartened over. Even the best of all get these occasional bouts where they feel bored and dissatisfied with our workouts. During these phases it’s hard to [get motivated to exercise](https://perkspiration.com/). You need something that pumps you up and gives you the zeal to get a stronger and healthier body. What can you do when you go through these slumps and your exercise motivation is severely lacking? What special things can you do so that you always get motivated to exercise?

Below are few things that you can try out the next time you’re stuck in a rut and finding it hard to find the motivation to get off the couch:

https://i.redd.it/f08n5cflszx01.png

* **Go To Someplace Other Than the Gym** 

Yes, your gym has all the workout paraphernalia you need to challenge yourself. But ditching the gym doesn’t mean that you’re not challenging yourself. A 10\-mile hike along the hiking trail nearby your place, a quick bike ride around the town, or a 60\-minute class of Vinyasa yoga at your home can be just as grueling. Maybe you’re not tired of working out, only tired of working out in the same place for a long time. Take advantage of the sights and sounds of your town while you get your work\-out in. You might find ways to move and places to exercise that you were unaware of. A change of venue might just be the monotony\-breaker your mind seeks.

https://i.redd.it/ypgjriepszx01.jpg

* **Sign Up for a Fitness Rewards Program** 

Register for a ***fitness rewards program*** that gives you reward points for every challenging workout that you complete. Sometimes the reward of exercise is just not enough to get you moving. You know whole\-heartedly all of the benefits that you will receive but you just can’t quite clear the hurdle. The fact that you can earn points towards some exciting rewards can be that last bit of motivation you need to get up and get going. Especially as you get closer to earning enough points to get that reward you’ve had your eye on. And really, if it motivates you to keep your workouts regular even when you are not mentally motivated, the rewards program has done it‘s job. It can be like that annoying friend who won’t let you quit even when you know you want to.

https://i.redd.it/nfta3gpsszx01.jpg

* **Tune In to Some Good Music** 

If you don’t already, it’s about time you start listening to your favorite music while working out. It’s fun to synchronize your exercise movements with the music beats that you love. You get lost in the songs and find that you’ve pushed yourself that much further. When you really can’t be bothered to start your workout put on your regular get pumped mix and sooner than later you’ll find yourself picking up something heavy or getting your heart rate elevated. Don’t forget to sometimes revamp your playlist.  Sure, Eye of the Tiger is always going to get you pumped but there are always new tunes out there that will get you motivated to exercise. It’s always exciting to seek them out.

https://i.redd.it/jjpbqg1wszx01.jpg

* **Include New Exercises in Your Routine** 

They say that variety is the spice of life.  Boredom is the enemy of motivation and can signal the end of your fitness program.  When you find yourself tired of the same old conventional deadlifts try some other variations of this explosive exercise? Like stiff\-leg deadlifts, Romanian deadlifts, or sumo deadlifts? Or maybe you’re bored of the standard lunges, in which case you can switch to walking lunges, side lunges, reverse lunges, etc. No matter what exercise you do, there is a way to change it up to make it more or less difficult, more or less explosive, and more or less strenuous.  Vary your routine with modifications and new exercises and you will find yourself motivated to exercise like never before.  

https://i.redd.it/3zwdboszszx01.jpg

When you need to get motivated and you just are not there mentally you have the power to turn it around with a few minor changes which will do the job in getting you off the couch and fired up.  Instead of crashing for the extra couple of hours in the morning get pumped up with your favorite tunes.  Get excited because you’re trying a new exercise today.  Get jazzed up because you are going to a new gym or taking a new trail.  Get psyched because you’re going to be one step closer to getting that reward you’ve had your eye on.

*Shout out to the Bucks and Cody. I was always pretty confident that they could sell out the show, but I never expected them to do it in less than an hour. This is a moment that will be talked about in their future Hall of Fame video packages.*

---

- **WCW Uncensored is in the books, complete with a Hogan/Flair double turn** and ending with Ric Flair winning either his 14th, 18th, or 22nd world title, depending on how you choose to keep count. Also worth noting that, at 50, Ric Flair has been able to carry Hogan to 2 of his best matches in years on back-to-back PPVs, and successfully played heel so well that he got the crowd to cheer for Hogan (which they weren't biting on at the beginning of the match). It was generally a pretty good show with a hot crowd, which WCW desperately needed right now, although there was still plenty wrong. Billy Kidman had a great match against the debuting Mikey Whipwreck and Dave thinks Kidman has obvious superstar potential but WCW has been dropping the ball on him big time. Whipwreck also had a hell of an impressive debut. Chris Jericho faced Perry Saturn in a dog collar match and before the match, they repeatedly said Jericho had never had a dog collar match before, at which point Dave reminds us that Jericho had a dog collar match against Lizmark Jr. on Nitro JUST LAST WEEK whilst building up for this match. Dave ponders if maybe it didn't happen and perhaps he's just having hallucinations. During the Hak/Raven/Bigelow hardcore match, there were multiple, massive ""ECW"" chants which the WCW producers immediately tried to mute by lowering the audio each time.

- **Speaking of Flair's multiple title reigns, Dave basically breaks down what the real number is** and says it depends on what you consider being a world champion and whether you count various phantom title changes and overturned Dusty-finishes and whatnot. Or various times where Flair would lose the title just to get a big pop from the crowd and then move on to the next city like it never happened and do it again. Shit like that used to happen back in the early-80s when there was no internet and average fans didn't know what was happening in other territories. Like the time Flair lost the NWA title to Harley Race in New Zealand and then won it back 2 days later in Singapore, but it was never publicly acknowledged. It gets even more confusing when you factor in shit like the NWA/WCW split, Flair leaving WCW as champion while still being recognized by the NWA as champion, the weird ""WCW International Title"" debacle, and so on and so forth. Dave does a breakdown of basically every single one of Flair's title wins and losses and gives his analysis and opinions on what should count and what shouldn't. Anyway, long story short, Dave's personal opinion is that as of March 14, 1999, Ric Flair is now an 18-time world champion, although you can make an argument from anywhere between 14 and 22 and you'd probably still be right.

- **As usual, Raw beat Nitro in the ratings again**, but for what it's worth, WCW actually closed the gap this week and even barely edged out Raw to win the last over-run segment of the show. But overall, the final rating still wasn't really close, with Raw pretty much dominating.

- **AJPW held a retirement ceremony for Jumbo Tsuruta this week, leading to Dave giving a big long career recap**. He basically says Tsuruta was one of those guys had everything needed to be THE top guy but he was always in the shadow of Inoki and Baba. Sorta like how Larry Bird was always in the shadow of Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan, or how Hank Aaron was always in the shadow of Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays. He was just that guy who had all the tools, but there was always someone with some intangible ""it"" that was always a slightly bigger star. Calls Tsuruta one of the top 5 or 6 stars in the history of Japanese wrestling and one of the most amazing athletes to ever step foot in a wrestling ring. He was trained by Dory Funk Jr. and interestingly enough, Dory also says that new WWF rookie Kurt Angle is similar in that way. Tsuruta was the first wrestler that Giant Baba signed to AJPW in 1972. Recaps all his major feuds and angles. In 1992, he started missing a lot of time due to a mysterious illness (which I believe ended up being some form of Hepatitis) and it destroyed his health and basically ended his career. He continued to wrestle but was nowhere near what he used to be and mostly became a midcard, part-time comedy act until finally hanging up the boots. He mostly stuck around out of loyalty to Baba and almost as soon as Baba died, Tsuruta announced his retirement and is moving to Portland, OR to start a new life outside of wrestling.

- **A CD called ""Slammin' Wrestling Hits"" was pulled out of stores after the record label was sued by WWF**. The album was essentially full of nearly exact re-creations of WWF and WCW theme songs that was released without permission. The album had sold around 60,000 copies before being pulled from stores and was at #139 on the Billboard charts, but a judge ordered the album pulled. The label had produced around 300,000 copies of it before the judge made his ruling. WWF has their own album, called ""WWF The Music: Vol. 3"" in stores now and the judge ruled that this likely cut into the WWF album sales since it's basically the exact same songs (here's a playlist of the whole album and yeah, this is an obvious rip-off. Not sure how they thought they could get away with this).

- **CMLL announced there will be a Perro Aguayo retirement match later this year** and that he will team with his son Perro Aguayo Jr. for his final match, probably in Sept. or Dec. (nah, he pretty much continues working a full time schedule all the way through 2002 and then has his last match in 2007).

- **There's still a bit of a backstage power struggle in AJPW between Misawa and Giant Baba's widow Motoko Baba**. Most people seem to be siding with Misawa as far as who should run the day-to-day operations. Word is AJPW plans to make an official announcement of what the new company hierarchy will be sometime next month.

- **As expected, Naoya Ogawa defeated Dan Severn to win the NWA title, which Severn had held since early-1995**. All the major media outlets in Japan covered it as a huge sports story and talked about Ogawa winning the same title held by legends like Lou Thesz, Dory Funk, and of course, Giant Baba. This is exactly how Antonio Inoki planned it when he booked this match, so....big win for Inoki and his UFO promotion.

- **Terry Funk is reportedly planning to start winding down his career soon** (lol). Funk spent the last several months recovering from Hepatitis and was in poor health. While he was recovering, Funk said he and his wife discussed his future and agreed that he would finish out a few last bookings he had promised to do before he got sick and then call it a career, although he didn't rule out the possibility of doing a show here and there. But he's decided his days on the road are over and that it's time to stay home (he'll be working a full-time schedule with WCW in less than a year).

- **Bob Backlund was interviewed by a Connecticut newspaper regarding his planned U.S. Congress run** and he didn't exactly have a lot of substantive ideas when it comes to the issues. On drugs he said, ""If we take away the demand, there won't be any supply."" On crime he said, ""My motto is to treat people how you want to be treated."" On education he said, ""I think if we believe kids are good, they'll do good things."" Hot takes there, Bob.

- **The financial situation in ECW is still the biggest topic of discussion there**. Paul Heyman has basically described the situation by saying they're just trying to survive until they get video game licensing money coming in which is expected to be soon and said that more checks may bounce in the meantime. There have also been bounced checks to various venues and local promoters who help them book buildings, among other things. Vince McMahon and Jim Ross both contacted Heyman and said they were willing to help ECW. Dave says it's in WWF's best interest for ECW to stay alive and to keep Heyman on their good side. If ECW goes out of business, it could lead to an influx of wrestlers and perhaps even Heyman going to WCW otherwise. Plus, it's good to have ECW indebted to them. Even WCW has somewhat put the word out there that they are willing to help in some way. Neither promotion wants to see ECW die because they don't want the other side to snatch up the remains if it happens. As of now, Heyman seemingly hasn't taken either company up on their offers.

- **Big Dick Dudley and John Kronus** are gone from ECW, no reason given (neither would ever return).

- **Although Tommy Dreamer spoke last week about being willing to take an offer from WWF or WCW if it comes up**, apparently that's not entirely true. Raven contacted Dreamer just a few weeks ago about coming in to WCW to form a tag team with him and said he could get Dreamer a good deal. But Dreamer turned it down.

- **Justin Credible's ECW future may be in question**. He has a 5-year contract, but has reportedly had talks with WCW recently and had spoken to Heyman about leaving. Heyman offered to release Credible from his contract if he wanted to leave, but Credible changed his mind and decided to stay.

- **Lots of rumors that Eric Bischoff may be planning to quit WCW**. He was on vacation in France for a couple of weeks but just returned and privately, he's apparently told some people that he's considering leaving. It's also become obvious to those backstage that he seems burned out and disinterested in running things anymore.

- **Nitro was mostly the same ol' shit show this week but there were 2 really good parts that Dave gives credit to**. Mysterio vs. Kidman was the best American TV match this year. And the angle with Scott Steiner attacking Buff Bagwell's neck with a chair was a great angle and for once, even the announcers sold it well and it made for an awesome angle. But, ya know, then there was the other 2 and a half hours...

- **Bret Hart wasn't on Nitro last week, and surely there was a good reason, right?** Maybe dealing with an injury, or perhaps he was off filming something else? Right?? Nope. He was backstage, ready to go. They just didn't have anything for him so he wasn't booked.

- **Bischoff has discussed doing an advertising campaign for WCW** in order to emphasize that WCW isn't like WWF because it's not as crude and sexual. They're tired of being lumped in with all of WWF's bad publicity.

- **Various random WCW notes that are too brief for their own paragraph**: Bobby Heenan, Larry Zbyszko, and Disco Inferno all signed new 3-year contracts. Randy Savage has been medically cleared to return to the ring. Steve McMichael no-showed Nitro. Chris Benoit, Kevin Nash, and Hogan are all booked for upcoming episodes of TSN's Off The Record. Former MTV VJ Ricky Rachmann has been hired as a backstage interviewer. Bam Bam Bigelow recently suffered a seizure and was hospitalized. And finally, Ron Reis had his contract renewed, leading to Dave to remind us that, ""This is the same company that fired Steve Austin.""

- **David Flair** is apparently serious about becoming a full-time wrestler and has been training at the Power Plant.

- **ESPN's Outside The Lines has been filming for an upcoming episode about wrestling**. They spoke to both Hogan and Scott Steiner regarding steroids. Hogan said he used to use them but doesn't anymore. Steiner also denied using steroids, a lie so blatant that it nearly gives Dave an aneurysm trying to process it.

- **Bischoff recently spoke with Chris Jericho about his future and made it clear that WCW wants to keep him**. They haven't made him a big money offer yet but it's believed they will soon. They have also talked about giving Jericho his own weekly Piper's Pit-style talk show segment on Nitro if he stays (maybe they could call it the Highlight Reel). Those close to Jericho say he hasn't really made his mind up 100% either way but most people think he's still leaning towards going to WWF.

- **Nitro is expected to get a cosmetic makeover in the coming weeks**. Dave compares it to how every woman in the business is apparently required to get cosmetic surgery these days and he wonders if WCW can ""implant"" more good wrestling into the product instead of worrying about changing logos and shit.

- **After years of ignoring all the times Shane Douglas called him out, Ric Flair finally had something to say about Douglas** on a WCW Live audio show on their website. Here's what Flair had to say:

---

&gt;He is a quarterback that thought he was going to go in the first round, that went in the seventh round, that knew because he went in the seventh round he had to play harder, but never made it. He threw the ball ten yards shorter. He ran the 40 a tenth of a second slower. Everything he's done in life, he's done behind the scenes, and he's cried about everything and everybody. If it's not me, it's Nash. If it's not Nash, it's Hall. If it's not Hall, it's McMahon. If it's not McMahon, it's Bischoff. At some point in time, you got to look in the mirror. Do you think that fans listen to that shit? Ten years ago, he told me he was going to be a medical doctor. Everything in his life is pretty much a dream, or a thought, or an afterthought. And I'm happy that he's making money where he's at, because he'd never go anywhere else. He's, you know, been given the opportunity and some guys cut it, and some guys don't.

&gt;I understand he challenged me to the ultimate fight or something like that. Let me tell you this. If you take the needle out of his ass, he's 140 pounds, at best. And you tell him, 90 days after he takes the needle out of his ass, anytime, anywhere, and I'm 50 years old. As a matter of fact, my son Reid, with the needle out of his ass, will beat him in record time. And Reid's 11-years-old and weighs 126. I think Shane Douglas, off the gas, is about 126 pounds soaking wet. If I'm Bob Barker [one of the names Douglas has called Flair in the past], he's, let me see, who was that cop on Andy Griffith that walked around with the hat on sideways? He's Barney Fife

&gt;Excuse me, Dr. Douglas who never went to school. Dr. Douglas who never made it in WCW, who blamed me for it. I wasn't the booker, however. Dr. Douglas, who didn't make it in WWF. Dr. Douglas, who's alienated himself. Dr. Douglas, who is blown up at 220 pounds. You can't beat my 11-year-old son. How 'bout that?""

---

- Paging /r/MurderedByWords 

- **So anyway, Shane Douglas was quick to respond** with a statement of his own over on 1Wrestling.com

---

&gt;""I'm honored that after five years of me dogging your ass, that you finally had, well, enough balls if you'd call it that, to bring up the challenge and make this response. I'm sitting here reading, having a good laugh. First of all, Mr. Flair, taking the ""needle out of my ass,"" maybe you ought to re-investigate this and learn your syntax, Mr. Flair. Going to medical school? Yeah, I was accepted to medical school. Maybe that's something you can't understand in that pea brain of yours. Because I choose to stay in this business and dog your ass, thinking you might be man enough some day to accept the challenge. Maybe I should have gone to medical school. I'd had a bigger challenge with a cadaver. As far as your syntax goes Mr. Flair, ""As a matter of fact, my son Reid, with a needle out of his ass, will beat him in record time."" Well, I suggest that you stop stooging your son off if he's using the juice. Secondly, maybe you should take the needle out of his ass, shove it in your own ass, and maybe those tits won't flap around like they do all the damn time. Maybe if you don't put juice in it, maybe put a little Viagara, maybe you'd get a little backbone, enough to stick up for yourself and fight like a goddamned man for once, instead of being the big pussy that you are.""

---

- **Dave says that Douglas's statement actually went on a lot longer from this point** and basically turned into a dumb wrestling promo, with dumb shit like claiming Flair was begging Heyman for a job in ECW and how Taz is the real world champion and other such shit. Dave says he was so embarrassed for Douglas that he doesn't even want to type up the rest of it. Dave says that unless this ever turns into a real angle or they end up in the same company, this is the last time he's going to waste space writing about it (they end up in the same company in just a few short months).

- **As mentioned previously, WWF is actively trying to push Michael Cole as the new permanent lead Raw announcer**. Interestingly enough, before going with Cole, they actually made an offer to TSN Off The Record host Michael Landsberg. He was interested, but then TSN told him that if he did it, he would have to give up his OTR show and he didn't want to do that.

- **Sable's issue of Playboy magazine** is legitimately close to becoming the all-time best selling issue of Playboy in history. She's also taking acting lessons and is considering taking more acting roles.

- **Jerry Lawler was arrested in Memphis this week after an incident where he ran over a cop's foot**. An officer was giving him a ticket for being parked on the curb at the airport for too long and she ended up in an argument with Lawler. He ended up balling up the ticket and throwing it at the cop and then driving off. As he drove off, he ran over the cop's foot. Lawler surrendered himself to the police a few days later and was booked and released pending a court date (I remember this. It was a huge story here at the time and later on when he ran for mayor, his opponents made a huge deal about it).

- **Nicole Bass** has signed a WWF developmental contract and may be brought in as Sable's bodyguard.

- **Fitness model Trish Stratus has not signed with WWF**, contrary to rumors, but was told to send a resume to Jim Ross.

- **The letters section this week** is pretty much all just letters from people who can't comprehend how WCW manages to suck as much as it does right now.

&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shout out to the Bucks and Cody. I was always pretty confident that they could sell out the show, but I never expected them to do it in less than an hour. This is a moment that will be talked about in their future Hall of Fame video packages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WCW Uncensored is in the books, complete with a Hogan/Flair double turn&lt;/strong&gt; and ending with Ric Flair winning either his 14th, 18th, or 22nd world title, depending on how you choose to keep count. Also worth noting that, at 50, Ric Flair has been able to carry Hogan to 2 of his best matches in years on back-to-back PPVs, and successfully played heel so well that he got the crowd to cheer for Hogan (which they weren&amp;#39;t biting on at the beginning of the match). It was generally a pretty good show with a hot crowd, which WCW desperately needed right now, although there was still plenty wrong. Billy Kidman had a great match against the debuting Mikey Whipwreck and Dave thinks Kidman has obvious superstar potential but WCW has been dropping the ball on him big time. Whipwreck also had a hell of an impressive debut. Chris Jericho faced Perry Saturn in a dog collar match and before the match, they repeatedly said Jericho had never had a dog collar match before, at which point Dave reminds us that Jericho had a dog collar match against Lizmark Jr. on Nitro JUST LAST WEEK whilst building up for this match. Dave ponders if maybe it didn&amp;#39;t happen and perhaps he&amp;#39;s just having hallucinations. During the Hak/Raven/Bigelow hardcore match, there were multiple, massive &amp;quot;ECW&amp;quot; chants which the WCW producers immediately tried to mute by lowering the audio each time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaking of Flair&amp;#39;s multiple title reigns, Dave basically breaks down what the real number is&lt;/strong&gt; and says it depends on what you consider being a world champion and whether you count various phantom title changes and overturned Dusty-finishes and whatnot. Or various times where Flair would lose the title just to get a big pop from the crowd and then move on to the next city like it never happened and do it again. Shit like that used to happen back in the early-80s when there was no internet and average fans didn&amp;#39;t know what was happening in other territories. Like the time Flair lost the NWA title to Harley Race in New Zealand and then won it back 2 days later in Singapore, but it was never publicly acknowledged. It gets even more confusing when you factor in shit like the NWA/WCW split, Flair leaving WCW as champion while still being recognized by the NWA as champion, the weird &amp;quot;WCW International Title&amp;quot; debacle, and so on and so forth. Dave does a breakdown of basically every single one of Flair&amp;#39;s title wins and losses and gives his analysis and opinions on what should count and what shouldn&amp;#39;t. Anyway, long story short, Dave&amp;#39;s personal opinion is that as of March 14, 1999, Ric Flair is now an 18-time world champion, although you can make an argument from anywhere between 14 and 22 and you&amp;#39;d probably still be right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As usual, Raw beat Nitro in the ratings again&lt;/strong&gt;, but for what it&amp;#39;s worth, WCW actually closed the gap this week and even barely edged out Raw to win the last over-run segment of the show. But overall, the final rating still wasn&amp;#39;t really close, with Raw pretty much dominating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AJPW held a retirement ceremony for Jumbo Tsuruta this week, leading to Dave giving a big long career recap&lt;/strong&gt;. He basically says Tsuruta was one of those guys had everything needed to be THE top guy but he was always in the shadow of Inoki and Baba. Sorta like how Larry Bird was always in the shadow of Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan, or how Hank Aaron was always in the shadow of Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays. He was just that guy who had all the tools, but there was always someone with some intangible &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; that was always a slightly bigger star. Calls Tsuruta one of the top 5 or 6 stars in the history of Japanese wrestling and one of the most amazing athletes to ever step foot in a wrestling ring. He was trained by Dory Funk Jr. and interestingly enough, Dory also says that new WWF rookie Kurt Angle is similar in that way. Tsuruta was the first wrestler that Giant Baba signed to AJPW in 1972. Recaps all his major feuds and angles. In 1992, he started missing a lot of time due to a mysterious illness (which I believe ended up being some form of Hepatitis) and it destroyed his health and basically ended his career. He continued to wrestle but was nowhere near what he used to be and mostly became a midcard, part-time comedy act until finally hanging up the boots. He mostly stuck around out of loyalty to Baba and almost as soon as Baba died, Tsuruta announced his retirement and is moving to Portland, OR to start a new life outside of wrestling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A CD called &amp;quot;Slammin&amp;#39; Wrestling Hits&amp;quot; was pulled out of stores after the record label was sued by WWF&lt;/strong&gt;. The album was essentially full of nearly exact re-creations of WWF and WCW theme songs that was released without permission. The album had sold around 60,000 copies before being pulled from stores and was at #139 on the Billboard charts, but a judge ordered the album pulled. The label had produced around 300,000 copies of it before the judge made his ruling. WWF has their own album, called &amp;quot;WWF The Music: Vol. 3&amp;quot; in stores now and the judge ruled that this likely cut into the WWF album sales since it&amp;#39;s basically the exact same songs (here&amp;#39;s a playlist of the whole album and yeah, this is an obvious rip-off. Not sure how they thought they could get away with this).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re7mLDVIe4k&amp;amp;list=PL0L_N7xIuyJwXTispKZx9DVjjGO5BETU3""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLAYLIST: Slammin&amp;#39; Wrestling Hits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CMLL announced there will be a Perro Aguayo retirement match later this year&lt;/strong&gt; and that he will team with his son Perro Aguayo Jr. for his final match, probably in Sept. or Dec. (nah, he pretty much continues working a full time schedule all the way through 2002 and then has his last match in 2007).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There&amp;#39;s still a bit of a backstage power struggle in AJPW between Misawa and Giant Baba&amp;#39;s widow Motoko Baba&lt;/strong&gt;. Most people seem to be siding with Misawa as far as who should run the day-to-day operations. Word is AJPW plans to make an official announcement of what the new company hierarchy will be sometime next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As expected, Naoya Ogawa defeated Dan Severn to win the NWA title, which Severn had held since early-1995&lt;/strong&gt;. All the major media outlets in Japan covered it as a huge sports story and talked about Ogawa winning the same title held by legends like Lou Thesz, Dory Funk, and of course, Giant Baba. This is exactly how Antonio Inoki planned it when he booked this match, so....big win for Inoki and his UFO promotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terry Funk is reportedly planning to start winding down his career soon&lt;/strong&gt; (lol). Funk spent the last several months recovering from Hepatitis and was in poor health. While he was recovering, Funk said he and his wife discussed his future and agreed that he would finish out a few last bookings he had promised to do before he got sick and then call it a career, although he didn&amp;#39;t rule out the possibility of doing a show here and there. But he&amp;#39;s decided his days on the road are over and that it&amp;#39;s time to stay home (he&amp;#39;ll be working a full-time schedule with WCW in less than a year).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob Backlund was interviewed by a Connecticut newspaper regarding his planned U.S. Congress run&lt;/strong&gt; and he didn&amp;#39;t exactly have a lot of substantive ideas when it comes to the issues. On drugs he said, &amp;quot;If we take away the demand, there won&amp;#39;t be any supply.&amp;quot; On crime he said, &amp;quot;My motto is to treat people how you want to be treated.&amp;quot; On education he said, &amp;quot;I think if we believe kids are good, they&amp;#39;ll do good things.&amp;quot; Hot takes there, Bob.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The financial situation in ECW is still the biggest topic of discussion there&lt;/strong&gt;. Paul Heyman has basically described the situation by saying they&amp;#39;re just trying to survive until they get video game licensing money coming in which is expected to be soon and said that more checks may bounce in the meantime. There have also been bounced checks to various venues and local promoters who help them book buildings, among other things. Vince McMahon and Jim Ross both contacted Heyman and said they were willing to help ECW. Dave says it&amp;#39;s in WWF&amp;#39;s best interest for ECW to stay alive and to keep Heyman on their good side. If ECW goes out of business, it could lead to an influx of wrestlers and perhaps even Heyman going to WCW otherwise. Plus, it&amp;#39;s good to have ECW indebted to them. Even WCW has somewhat put the word out there that they are willing to help in some way. Neither promotion wants to see ECW die because they don&amp;#39;t want the other side to snatch up the remains if it happens. As of now, Heyman seemingly hasn&amp;#39;t taken either company up on their offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big Dick Dudley and John Kronus&lt;/strong&gt; are gone from ECW, no reason given (neither would ever return).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Although Tommy Dreamer spoke last week about being willing to take an offer from WWF or WCW if it comes up&lt;/strong&gt;, apparently that&amp;#39;s not entirely true. Raven contacted Dreamer just a few weeks ago about coming in to WCW to form a tag team with him and said he could get Dreamer a good deal. But Dreamer turned it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin Credible&amp;#39;s ECW future may be in question&lt;/strong&gt;. He has a 5-year contract, but has reportedly had talks with WCW recently and had spoken to Heyman about leaving. Heyman offered to release Credible from his contract if he wanted to leave, but Credible changed his mind and decided to stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lots of rumors that Eric Bischoff may be planning to quit WCW&lt;/strong&gt;. He was on vacation in France for a couple of weeks but just returned and privately, he&amp;#39;s apparently told some people that he&amp;#39;s considering leaving. It&amp;#39;s also become obvious to those backstage that he seems burned out and disinterested in running things anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nitro was mostly the same ol&amp;#39; shit show this week but there were 2 really good parts that Dave gives credit to&lt;/strong&gt;. Mysterio vs. Kidman was the best American TV match this year. And the angle with Scott Steiner attacking Buff Bagwell&amp;#39;s neck with a chair was a great angle and for once, even the announcers sold it well and it made for an awesome angle. But, ya know, then there was the other 2 and a half hours...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bret Hart wasn&amp;#39;t on Nitro last week, and surely there was a good reason, right?&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe dealing with an injury, or perhaps he was off filming something else? Right?? Nope. He was backstage, ready to go. They just didn&amp;#39;t have anything for him so he wasn&amp;#39;t booked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bischoff has discussed doing an advertising campaign for WCW&lt;/strong&gt; in order to emphasize that WCW isn&amp;#39;t like WWF because it&amp;#39;s not as crude and sexual. They&amp;#39;re tired of being lumped in with all of WWF&amp;#39;s bad publicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Various random WCW notes that are too brief for their own paragraph&lt;/strong&gt;: Bobby Heenan, Larry Zbyszko, and Disco Inferno all signed new 3-year contracts. Randy Savage has been medically cleared to return to the ring. Steve McMichael no-showed Nitro. Chris Benoit, Kevin Nash, and Hogan are all booked for upcoming episodes of TSN&amp;#39;s Off The Record. Former MTV VJ Ricky Rachmann has been hired as a backstage interviewer. Bam Bam Bigelow recently suffered a seizure and was hospitalized. And finally, Ron Reis had his contract renewed, leading to Dave to remind us that, &amp;quot;This is the same company that fired Steve Austin.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Flair&lt;/strong&gt; is apparently serious about becoming a full-time wrestler and has been training at the Power Plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ESPN&amp;#39;s Outside The Lines has been filming for an upcoming episode about wrestling&lt;/strong&gt;. They spoke to both Hogan and Scott Steiner regarding steroids. Hogan said he used to use them but doesn&amp;#39;t anymore. Steiner also denied using steroids, a lie so blatant that it nearly gives Dave an aneurysm trying to process it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bischoff recently spoke with Chris Jericho about his future and made it clear that WCW wants to keep him&lt;/strong&gt;. They haven&amp;#39;t made him a big money offer yet but it&amp;#39;s believed they will soon. They have also talked about giving Jericho his own weekly Piper&amp;#39;s Pit-style talk show segment on Nitro if he stays (maybe they could call it the Highlight Reel). Those close to Jericho say he hasn&amp;#39;t really made his mind up 100% either way but most people think he&amp;#39;s still leaning towards going to WWF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nitro is expected to get a cosmetic makeover in the coming weeks&lt;/strong&gt;. Dave compares it to how every woman in the business is apparently required to get cosmetic surgery these days and he wonders if WCW can &amp;quot;implant&amp;quot; more good wrestling into the product instead of worrying about changing logos and shit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After years of ignoring all the times Shane Douglas called him out, Ric Flair finally had something to say about Douglas&lt;/strong&gt; on a WCW Live audio show on their website. Here&amp;#39;s what Flair had to say:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is a quarterback that thought he was going to go in the first round, that went in the seventh round, that knew because he went in the seventh round he had to play harder, but never made it. He threw the ball ten yards shorter. He ran the 40 a tenth of a second slower. Everything he&amp;#39;s done in life, he&amp;#39;s done behind the scenes, and he&amp;#39;s cried about everything and everybody. If it&amp;#39;s not me, it&amp;#39;s Nash. If it&amp;#39;s not Nash, it&amp;#39;s Hall. If it&amp;#39;s not Hall, it&amp;#39;s McMahon. If it&amp;#39;s not McMahon, it&amp;#39;s Bischoff. At some point in time, you got to look in the mirror. Do you think that fans listen to that shit? Ten years ago, he told me he was going to be a medical doctor. Everything in his life is pretty much a dream, or a thought, or an afterthought. And I&amp;#39;m happy that he&amp;#39;s making money where he&amp;#39;s at, because he&amp;#39;d never go anywhere else. He&amp;#39;s, you know, been given the opportunity and some guys cut it, and some guys don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand he challenged me to the ultimate fight or something like that. Let me tell you this. If you take the needle out of his ass, he&amp;#39;s 140 pounds, at best. And you tell him, 90 days after he takes the needle out of his ass, anytime, anywhere, and I&amp;#39;m 50 years old. As a matter of fact, my son Reid, with the needle out of his ass, will beat him in record time. And Reid&amp;#39;s 11-years-old and weighs 126. I think Shane Douglas, off the gas, is about 126 pounds soaking wet. If I&amp;#39;m Bob Barker [one of the names Douglas has called Flair in the past], he&amp;#39;s, let me see, who was that cop on Andy Griffith that walked around with the hat on sideways? He&amp;#39;s Barney Fife&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excuse me, Dr. Douglas who never went to school. Dr. Douglas who never made it in WCW, who blamed me for it. I wasn&amp;#39;t the booker, however. Dr. Douglas, who didn&amp;#39;t make it in WWF. Dr. Douglas, who&amp;#39;s alienated himself. Dr. Douglas, who is blown up at 220 pounds. You can&amp;#39;t beat my 11-year-old son. How &amp;#39;bout that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paging &lt;a href=""/r/MurderedByWords""&gt;/r/MurderedByWords&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So anyway, Shane Douglas was quick to respond&lt;/strong&gt; with a statement of his own over on 1Wrestling.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m honored that after five years of me dogging your ass, that you finally had, well, enough balls if you&amp;#39;d call it that, to bring up the challenge and make this response. I&amp;#39;m sitting here reading, having a good laugh. First of all, Mr. Flair, taking the &amp;quot;needle out of my ass,&amp;quot; maybe you ought to re-investigate this and learn your syntax, Mr. Flair. Going to medical school? Yeah, I was accepted to medical school. Maybe that&amp;#39;s something you can&amp;#39;t understand in that pea brain of yours. Because I choose to stay in this business and dog your ass, thinking you might be man enough some day to accept the challenge. Maybe I should have gone to medical school. I&amp;#39;d had a bigger challenge with a cadaver. As far as your syntax goes Mr. Flair, &amp;quot;As a matter of fact, my son Reid, with a needle out of his ass, will beat him in record time.&amp;quot; Well, I suggest that you stop stooging your son off if he&amp;#39;s using the juice. Secondly, maybe you should take the needle out of his ass, shove it in your own ass, and maybe those tits won&amp;#39;t flap around like they do all the damn time. Maybe if you don&amp;#39;t put juice in it, maybe put a little Viagara, maybe you&amp;#39;d get a little backbone, enough to stick up for yourself and fight like a goddamned man for once, instead of being the big pussy that you are.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dave says that Douglas&amp;#39;s statement actually went on a lot longer from this point&lt;/strong&gt; and basically turned into a dumb wrestling promo, with dumb shit like claiming Flair was begging Heyman for a job in ECW and how Taz is the real world champion and other such shit. Dave says he was so embarrassed for Douglas that he doesn&amp;#39;t even want to type up the rest of it. Dave says that unless this ever turns into a real angle or they end up in the same company, this is the last time he&amp;#39;s going to waste space writing about it (they end up in the same company in just a few short months).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As mentioned previously, WWF is actively trying to push Michael Cole as the new permanent lead Raw announcer&lt;/strong&gt;. Interestingly enough, before going with Cole, they actually made an offer to TSN Off The Record host Michael Landsberg. He was interested, but then TSN told him that if he did it, he would have to give up his OTR show and he didn&amp;#39;t want to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sable&amp;#39;s issue of Playboy magazine&lt;/strong&gt; is legitimately close to becoming the all-time best selling issue of Playboy in history. She&amp;#39;s also taking acting lessons and is considering taking more acting roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jerry Lawler was arrested in Memphis this week after an incident where he ran over a cop&amp;#39;s foot&lt;/strong&gt;. An officer was giving him a ticket for being parked on the curb at the airport for too long and she ended up in an argument with Lawler. He ended up balling up the ticket and throwing it at the cop and then driving off. As he drove off, he ran over the cop&amp;#39;s foot. Lawler surrendered himself to the police a few days later and was booked and released pending a court date (I remember this. It was a huge story here at the time and later on when he ran for mayor, his opponents made a huge deal about it).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nicole Bass&lt;/strong&gt; has signed a WWF developmental contract and may be brought in as Sable&amp;#39;s bodyguard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fitness model Trish Stratus has not signed with WWF&lt;/strong&gt;, contrary to rumors, but was told to send a resume to Jim Ross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The letters section this week&lt;/strong&gt; is pretty much all just letters from people who can&amp;#39;t comprehend how WCW manages to suck as much as it does right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

**UPDATE: THREAD IS OPEN UNTIL SUNDAY MAY 26!**

Don’t post just glitch or just hip hop, glitch hop is its own entity. 

As always, feel free to post a brief description of the genre as well. It is always super nice to have an elevator pitch for a genre which describes how it is similar and different from other genres – basically what to look out for. 

Due to technical difficulties last week that limited responses the DRUMSTEP THREAD IS OPEN UNTIL 5/20!

**Intro**

One of the most amazing things about music is that its variety allows it to cater to the tastes of everyone despite the great differences in between people. This can also lead to a challenge, however, as, despite our best efforts to categorize music into genres that can be used to neatly describe specific styles, discussing tastes can be challenging to someone who is unfamiliar. Especially now that there are so many different genres, it can be daunting to try to find what a new genre is really about or how to explain your favorite genre to a friend. To combat this issue, I have decided to start this weekly activity in which everyone can work together to create /r/electronicmusic ‘s extremely genre specific playlists.

It's simple, nominate a song by posting it, and *upvote* the ones you like that fit well within the genre. The top 20 songs from individual artists will be made into a playlist.

**Guidelines for Posting**

• Keep it one song per post.

• Please check the thread to see if your song has already been posted.

• Always remember to use Artist – Song.

• No songs that were already on a playlist. 

• Please include a link to the song.

• Please limit yourself to *10* submissions per genre.

• Be aware that by sorting comments by ""top"" you may be missing out on a lot of good songs.

• Don't be afraid to NICELY inform someone the song is better suited to another genre, and don't be offended if someone tells you this. 

• *Please upvote. A good general rule is for every post you submit you should vote on at least one other submission.*

**Week 38: Glitch Hop**

RYM Definition of [Glitch Hop]( https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/Glitch+Hop/): 


Glitch hop, as the name implies, is a combination of Hip Hop beats with elements of Glitch music. While the genre has its early roots in the late 1990s with IDM artists such as Autechre and Funkstorung, glitch hop really started to take shape in the early 2000s with electronic producers Prefuse 73 and Dabrye (both of whom released their debut albums on June 11 2001) fusing Hip Hop instrumentals with glitchy effects and techniques including beat repeaters, sweeps cutting, skipping, repeating, chopping and bit crush reduction. Later in the mid 2000s, artists from Los Angeles such as Daedelus and edIT further expanded the genre by including influences from other music genres such as Folktronica. 
 
In 2006, the Low End Theory night club was established in Los Angeles by producer and Alpha Pup Records label head Daddy Kev and would become the epicenter of the burgeoning Los Angeles' instrumental hip hop scene. The collective of producers that would frequent the venue (including Flying Lotus and his associated Brainfeeder label, Nosaj Thing, The Gaslamp Killer and Shlohmo) became associated with the colloquially titled L.A. beat scene. These artists employed J Dilla's unqantised and off-kilter approach to beatmaking and experimented with other different styles and techniques, melding Instrumental Hip Hop, Dubstep, Ambient and Jazz music among other genres. Many of these artists went on to define the Wonky sound. 
 
By the 2010s, the genre was adopted by Electronic Dance Music DJs that increasingly drew influence from the maximalist, bass-focused sounds of Brostep and Neurofunk with acts like edIT's The Glitch Mob, Pretty Lights and KOAN Sound headlining festivals around the world. Meanwhile, producers on independent labels such as Matthewdavid's Leaving Records continued to push the boundaries of the genre by stripping away traditional structure, rhythm and form. The fractured, lo-fi sample constructions of artists like Ahnnu and dakim blurred the lines between sample based hip hop, Plunderphonics and experimental Sound Collage.

The removal of watching playlists in reverse order, the notification algorithm etc. But, something I recently became aware of is that YouTube doesn&amp;#39;t notify you of ALL replies to your comments. (Or replies to comments you have replied too) This &amp;quot;feature&amp;quot; in typical YouTube/Google fashion, doesn&amp;#39;t allow you set it otherwise. This seems to be caused by one of two things. (Or possibly both) Commenting on a video getting a lot of traction such as a political video, or commenting a large amount of times on a single video. So regardless of which is the actual cause, there is sometimes a chance that you won&amp;#39;t get any sort of notification to a comment by email, push notification, or even in your activity. &lt;/p&gt;

,StarWarsBattlefront,"TLDR: Making HvV free to play and supporting it will single handedly save this game

I DONT THINK THAT WORD MEANS WHAT YOU THINK IT MEANS
Let me help you make this a live service you wanted to make

Im going to be honest I havent opened the game since the end of TLJ events, I had my fun, it got stale and I lost intrest/found another game.  Although I have watched from the sidelines and checked back everyday to see if something would yank me back in. I almost came back to try ewok hunt thing.  I was a big fan of HvV but with no voice chat to communicate/coordinate, people leaving, after 1 point and waiting so long to find team mates it pushed me away.

So with all this talk about season 2 content not being everyones cup of tea and speculation of dice shifting focus from the game (if true its probably because the ongoing monitization model isnt what they had in mind for what it is now) I think there could be a better way to monitize the game and generate some buzz.

Listen up Dice/EA Im bout to save yo shit, make you multiple kiddie pools of skrilla and make your comeback story better than Rainbow six siege.

Step 1: There is more to the Star Wars Universe than 8 movies

You have exclusive rights to a huge IP you need to utilize it.  I am going to assume disney is regulating the balls out of what parts of the IP you can use.  With how disney uncanonized a huge chunk of the SW universe I wonder if they backed themselves into a corner.  They let you already create multiple characters for the universe (Is Iden and most of the campaign characters specificly made for the game?) GO to Disney if this is true, and tell them of these kiddie pools I mentioned. They should then let you go hogwild into the vaults.

Step 2: Immitation is the sincerest form of making that cash 

Short story....
Im not sure that most people know that fortnite was on deaths door.  Let alone know that fortnite originally wasnt even a free battle royale game.  The more important thing about fortnite is that they looked at themselves and said we are failing what do we do.  Instead of walking away from all the work they did they pivoted, looked at the industry,  and used the assets they had to imitate and improve on what was popular.  Bam, free to play game mode, monetize it, hundreds of kiddie pools later, bet you cant go a day without hearing the word fortnite.

MAKE YOUR HvV GAME MODES FREE TO PLAY!!! I really think that fortnite showed that you can have a paid for part of your game and then make a killing with a free part of it. Start pumping out new heroes and skins on a repeated schedule that you hype with videos and announcements (you can even get away with 1 hero at a time) LIKE an almost unknown game called League of Legends ( I think they may have made a kiddie poolor two in their time)  I can guarantee this will fix your not making money from lootbox situation.

Then these heroes and skins will also be available for other game modes as well (to be purchased with crystals/credits) for people who own the actual paid version of the game.  

Hell you could even do this,  for people who dont own the paid game the only way they can unlock a specific hero is by paying for it with crystals, otherwise they have to deal with a rotating free to play hero list that changes every whatever days.  This will ONE get people to buy the main version of the game which makes you money or B have people who dont own the game give you some money.  BOTH WAYS MAKE YOU CASH from people you wouldnt normally have made money from. 

Putting a huge focus into HvV can allow you to monetize in a way people want you to while making you bank at the same time.  Brings in new potential spenders you may not have reached otherwise.  Which in turn could then then turn into people purchasing the full game.

Step 3: MOAR HvV game modes but just for a lil bit

Time to copy another successful game, umm I mean draw inspiration from.  Ewok was a nice version of what Overwatch does, limited time events that are different and fun and here just long enough for you not to get bored of them.  Although I saw some people want it to stay around its not smart to split up the community more with another playlist to que for.  There are only like 15 people who wanna play capture the flag mode ( I cant even remember what it was called because I only played it for quests when I had to)  you take people away from that might as well remove that playlist. Start making more limited time events.  Use those big names from the IP and build game modes around it.  A mode where vader boards the ship like at the beginning of a new hope and its 20 v 1 where vader needs to get the plans while the 20 others work to get them to a point in the map.  A mode where yoda and palp throw the senate at each other, idk get cray with it.

Step 4:  PROFIT

Hire people to help you fill put all that cash into all your kiddie pools.

I don’t mind spending Saturday doing nothing but daydreaming of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s night, and I’m back in my cold bed. I start your playlist over and stare at my ceiling. In the darkness I imagine you’re next to me. I can almost imagine what it would be like to hold your hand and hear those three words. Sadness takes over me when I realize I’m nothing but a friend, and suddenly the words in those love songs choke me and push the words I want to say back down. I doze off with teardrops clung to my lashes and dream of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it’s Sunday, and all I can do is think about seeing you tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weekdays aren’t so bad if I can see you.&lt;/p&gt;

,CallOfDutyWorldWarTwo,"The Blitzkrieg Community Event came to an end this week, but that doesn’t mean Captain Butcher won’t be back. Until he returns, we’ve got a whole lineup of Midweek Mobilize and Weekend Warfare days for you that are full of bonus XP opportunities!

 

 

Dom 75. This is now the new standard on all platforms, so make sure to get in there and play!

 

Weapon Contract and Daily Orders. This week’s Weapon Contract is for the [Sterling](https://twitter.com/SHGames/status/993904716441518080). Make sure to pick it up before 10AM PDT on Tuesday, May 15.

 

Special Order/Weapon Bribe Issue. For those of you affected, check out ATVIAssist’s Reddit post:

""Greetings everyone, 
We identified an issue with the dupe-protection behavior with the Bribes offered in the last weekend’s Special Order. We’ve since adjusted the dupe behavior, and going forward players can expect Bribes to contain one dupe-protected item as intended.
We’re currently working on a makegood for all players who completed the Special Order before the fix.
We’ll update you when the makegood is live.
-ATVI Support ""

on this for info about a makegood.

 

Master Prestige Rewards. We're working on some new rewards for you guys, and want to make them special. While they're not quite ready yet, we aim to have them ready for you for our next big game update. Thanks for your patience!

 

Weekend Warfare. This weekend, make sure to hop on and take advantage of [2XP on the Throwback Moshpit](https://twitter.com/SHGames/status/995015323970514944) playlist in the Featured tab, live until Monday, May 14. We’re talking old-school Modern Warfare and MW2 perks as Basic Trainings! We saw how much the community enjoyed the traditional Killstreaks with the Blitzkrieg Basic Training, so we decided to bring back some more MW classics. They are as follows:

 

Commando Pro:

+ Increased melee range, and no damage from falling

+ Bonus: Melee faster

 

Danger Close:

+ Explosives deal more damage

+ Bonus: Frag x3

 

Double Tap:

+ Greatly increased fire rate of weapons

+ Bonus: Significantly improved hip-fire accuracy

 

Juggernaut:

+ Increased health

 

Martyrdom:

+ Drop a live grenade on death

+ Bonus: Shortens fuse of explosives

 

Stopping Power:

+ Deal Increased bullet damage

 

Stun x3:

+ Three British No69 concussion grenades

+ Bonus: Immune to Shell Shock &amp; Tactical Equipment

 

Lots of oldies, but goodies, in there, so don’t miss out!

 

Ground War. We’ve heard your feedback here. Thank you for your enthusiasm for this mode! As a result, we’re bringing Ground War back next Wednesday, and it will be here to stay.

 

Requisitions Nerf. After taking into consideration community feedback and data, we nerfed Requisitions. We wanted to give the community some insight into our decision. First off, the Requisitions Basic Training was intended to provide novice players with a route to earn mid-tier Scorestreaks. Only on exceptional matches were highly-skilled players meant to be able to acquire top-tier streaks like the Ball Turret Gunner. However, the current frequency with which players are able to earn these top-tier streaks with the training is far too high. To address this issue, we’ve raised the cost of the top 5 Scorestreaks by 600-1200 score when using the Requisitions Basic Training.

 

We’d also like to provide some additional insight into our tuning philosophy. With the Divisions Overhaul on April 10th, we took two initial steps that we hoped would reduce Requisitions usage. These steps were adding the Blitzkrieg Basic Training and buffing the Ordnance Basic Training. A month has passed since the Divisions Overhaul, and Requisitions remains the most-used Basic Training in the game (since the removal of Primed). Due to a difference in score/XP between game modes and maps, Requisitions is tough to tune. The Training has mainly been an issue in Domination, Hardpoint, and on the Shipment 1944 map. For other modes like Team Deathmatch, Requisitions seemed fairly balanced. The aim with today’s tuning is to get Requisitions into a fair place for Dom and HP on non-Shipment 1944 maps. Many of the top streaks will now be exceptionally difficult to earn in TDM. Shipment 1944 will be a bit less chaotic than it has been, but that’s the nature of the map and we can’t tune the game around this very specific edge case. Below are the adjusted Scorestreak costs:

 

Emergency Airdrop: Increased from 1800 to 2400

Fire Bombing Run: Increased from 1950 to 2700

Paratroopers: Increased from 2400 to 3300

Carpet Bombing: Increased from 2850 to 3850

Ball Turret Gunner: Increased from 3600 to 4800

 

War Bonds. Until May 15, you can pick up [War Bonds](https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/994262182882758657) to earn extra COD Points. The “Hit the Front” Bond gives you 200 COD Points when you sign in. The “Get Intel” Bond gives you 100 COD Points when you sign up for the Call of Duty newsletter.

[Spotify Link](https://open.spotify.com/user/12132197489?si=CY63e-QWSTqpMqAnifwltg)

Compilations of metal and heavy rock based on mood as opposed to genre for cohesion and ease of flow.  As you know, progressive metal/rock is an umbrella term for a wide variety of musical expression that may not have much in common apart from being unformulaic and pushing the boundaries.

""Immersive Prog"" features mostly long progressive songs with shifting moods and pace.  Requires active liatening and introspection.  *Almost exclusively clean* Features Dream Theater, Symphony X, Earthside, Pain of Salvation, Devin Townsend, Between the Buried and Me, and more

""Insufferable Meatheads"" is comprised of straightforward metal and heavy rock that are riff-oriented, melody-driven, and embodying an upbeat rock and roll drive.  *Mixed vocals*  
Features Black Label Society, Jorn, Adrenaline Mob, Lamb Of God, Amon Amarth, Chrome Division, Dream Theater, and more

""Grief-Stricken"" is one that flows really well.  An almost exclusively *clean* mix of melancholic songs. 
Features Katatonia, Woods of Ypres V, Leprous, Warrel Dane, Opeth, Steven Wilson, and more

""Proggy and Hooky"" is perhaps the most restrictive of the playlists genre-wise.  It's crafted after the band Thank You Scientist, and to an extent, Dear Hunter.  I can't actually pinpoint the genre exactly.  The theme is upbeat prog; almost dancy.  Complex but not quite math-rock.  Lots of interesting finds in this one.  It does have a tendency to be sugary at times (You have been warned).

Compilations of metal and heavy rock based on mood as opposed to genre for cohesion and ease of flow.  As you know, progressive metal/rock is an umbrella term for a wide variety of musical expression that may not have much in common apart from being unformulaic and pushing the boundaries.

""Immersive Prog"" features mostly long progressive songs with shifting moods and pace.  Requires active listening and introspection.  *Almost exclusively clean* Features Dream Theater, Symphony X, Earthside, Pain of Salvation, Devin Townsend, Between the Buried and Me, and more

""Insufferable Meatheads"" is comprised of straightforward metal and heavy rock that are riff-oriented, melody-driven, and embodying an upbeat rock and roll drive.  *Mixed vocals*  
Features Black Label Society, Jorn, Adrenaline Mob, Lamb Of God, Amon Amarth, Chrome Division, Dream Theater, and more

""Grief-Stricken"" is one that flows really well.  An almost exclusively *clean* mix of melancholic songs. 
Features Katatonia, Woods of Ypres V, Leprous, Warrel Dane, Opeth, Steven Wilson, and more

""Proggy and Hooky"" is perhaps the most restrictive of the playlists genre-wise.  It's crafted after the band Thank You Scientist, and to an extent, Dear Hunter.  I can't actually pinpoint the genre exactly.  The theme is upbeat prog; almost dancy.  Complex but not quite math-rock.  Lots of interesting finds in this one.

**Laurence Tremayne’s Hut**

The Villa Tremayne on the outskirts of town, relatively close to Wilmington House, had once been the world’s most chaste “gay twink palace”, back when the driving force behind the Laurence Tremayne character had been variously his niceness and gayness, but after Laurent Le Foll had decided to retool Tremayne’s shtick into that of a satanic faggot - with satanic always coming first - he had torn down the entire mansion and replaced it with a witch’s hut, which looked just as you might expect, all rickety and wooden and covered with strange plants and jutting out at odd angles. The one thing stopping Tremayne’s hut from being a perfectly wiccan structure was where it was situated. Le Foll could tear down the building and replace it with something else, but he couldn’t tear down the ground, nor was he inclined to try. As such, Tremayne’s hut was still behind the massive iron-gate and driveway that had made his mansion the fourth biggest house in the Darkplace area (After the MoggMansion, Bono’s house, and, if you counted it, the castle), making it look less sinister and more “just odd”. Mary Rees-Mogg was currently walking up this just odd driveway, which was a struggle for her, as thanks to major comfort eating following the termination of her, what, two day old-relationship with Dale MacLachlan, she had gained almost thirty pounds, and was now what some people might class as “pleasantly plump”, although they would be wrong, as the correct definition is “a chubby bitch”. Mary had skipped school (To be more specific: PE, which she could barely do anyway.) in order to retrieve the love potion she’d ordered from Tremayne a day earlier, but as she reached the fungus-covered stairs of the shack and knocked on the door to no reply, it dawned on her that she might have been stood up.

**MARY:** Son of a bitch…

Mary quickly set down her school bag and unzipped it, pulling out a home-knitted Dale MacLachlan doll that in every way resembled the man currently (most likely) twerking on a park bench in town. 

**MARY:** What do we do next, Agent McCoolGuy??

**PUPPET MAC:** Jeez Mary, I’m not really sure. I know that whenever I encounter a mystery, I always do my utmost to investigate it in a professional manner.

**MARY:** Do you mean I should break in?

**PUPPET MAC:** You betcha. 

Mary gave the puppet a thumbs-up, before manipulating its tiny woollen hands into giving her one in reply. Leaving her bag, but taking her boy (As these characters formed into words, we are all of us now aware as to why it can be “my girl” or “my man” but not “my boy” or “my woman”, unless, of course, you’re Robert Plant, in which case the last one comprises 90% of your song lyrics), she headed around the side of the hut, looking for an entrance of some sort. Finding the windows all shut and the lights on the inside as turned off as anyone after seeing her transformation over these last six months, Mary deliberated on whether to just go to school or not, but she eventually decided that her love for Mac had to come before her education, and picked up a particularly hefty rock that had once been part of Tremayne’s garden. 

**MARY:** I love you, Maccy!

Using all of her womanly strength, Mary hurled the rock at Tremayne’s window, tipping herself in the process. While Mary fell down onto the ground, the stone managed to hit its mark and crashed right through the glass, completely obliterating what had once been Darkplace’s only quadruple glazed window. Picking herself back up, Mary ran over to the window and jumped right through it, narrowly avoiding getting stuck in the frame. Once on the inside, she found herself in a surprisingly well-furnished room (Well, we say surprisingly, but the decor of the original gay mansion surely had to be repurposed somehow), with several armchairs, a table, and a massive flat-screen TV.

**MARY:** Hello?

No response. Mary walked over to one of the armchairs and sat down on it, but the second she did, the entire seat collapsed, leaving her sitting in the ruins of what was once furniture. After she got over the shock of the seat giving way on her, Mary began to cry, which is something she apparently does often.

**MARY:** You’re such a stupid fat bitch!

We find it hard to argue with any of that. As Mary was surely (and rightly) contemplating ending it all, she put her hand on one of the broken bits of the seat and realised that it felt strange. Picking it up, Mary took a good long look at it, and came to the conclusion that the seat was actually made out of cardboard. 

**MARY:** Huh. Any clue what’s going on here, Maccy?????

**PUPPET MAC:** Maybe the entire house is made out of cardboard? I’d check the TV, if I were you.

**MARY:** Good idea!

Mary picked herself up and headed over to the TV, which, upon closer inspection, turned out to simply be a large sheet of cardboard painted black.

**MARY:** Mystery kino…

Mary’s eyes soon fell on Tremayne’s coffee table, perhaps the only non-cardboard element of the house, as well as a book sitting on top of it. Waddling over to it, the obese ho picked the book up, and blew off a layer of dust that had gathered for aesthetic reasons. The cover read: *Character notes on Laurence Tremayne*. 

**MARY:** Huh.

**St. Paul the Evangelist High School**

Like many great leaders before him, Malik Brownman, Principal of St. Paul the Evangelist High School, sat at his desk, sipping a glass of water in lieu of the typical bourbon, since that isn’t exactly something you can just whip out and start drinking in the middle of a high school. The brown man was currently flipping through a stack of papers in between sips of what the Darkplace youth affectionately called “based haitch two oh.” Unlike in many other narratives which start out this way, however, these papers would actually serve as something for the character in question to be doing at the start of the scene. The papers were, in fact, submitted resumes for the recently vacated position of “Chief Head of her Royal Majesty’s Custodial Service,” which was a polite and frankly outdated way of saying janitor. The principal had already interviewed five candidates for the job, and finding each to have their own set of problems (three of the five had a laundry list of prior convictions and one of them was a literal Nazi, as opposed to the figurative kind. The other one sort of just rubbed him the wrong way), had yet to decide on who would fill this prestigious position. As candidate six walked in through the door, Malik Brownman’s expectations were the opposite of high - which is to say, they were low. 

**BROWNMAN:** I’d like to thank you taking the time to come in today, Mr… Gremlin. I’m sure you will bring your own unique perspective to the community here at St. Paul’s!

**GREMLIN:** Yeh, heheheheh.

The Gremlin sat down on the chair in front of Brownman and shook the principal’s outstretched hand with his own, impossibly sticky one.

**GREMLIN:** I’m gonna be up front with you, Mr. Brownman. My shtick is that I’m the world’s ultimate bang-goblin. If I get employed here, I’m definitely gonna menace the students. 

**BROWNMAN:** What kind of menacing are you describing, Mr. Gremlin?

**GREMLIN:** Y’know. Standard uneasy potential child groomer figure. Might give the kids some candy, might inappropriately invade their personal space in a way that leaves them confused as to if I’m a diddler or just weird. 

**BROWNMAN:** So, let me get this straight, Mr. Gremlin, there won’t be any actual.. diddling involved in this planned menacing? 

**GREMLIN:** Not if I can help it, sir. Course, sometimes events slip out of my control, but I’m not going into this planning to diddle anyone. 

**BROWNMAN:** And...if there was any diddling, what...form would that take?

**GREMLIN:** Light molestation always. 

The Gremlin then mimed cutting his own throat.

**GREMLIN:** No rapes. 

**BROWNMAN:** I’m really glad you said that, Mr. Gremlin, I really am. Now, uh, how do I phrase this last one.. Do you hold any sort of prejudices towards other groups of people that might pose an issue around campus? I’m only asking because one of the five applicants before you had some rather antiquated views on race and I’d like to avoid a repeat of that. 

**GREMLIN:** Not at all.

**BROWNMAN:** Well, that concludes the background check, then. Mr. Gremlin, I think I’ve made my decision - you’re hired!

**GREMLIN:** You’d better go ahead and give the kiddies a head start, then, ‘cause they’re gonna need it! 

**BROWNMAN:** Epic reply from the Gremlin! Er, sorry about that, I’ve just been trying to brush up on current slang so I can connect to the student body on a more personal level. Anyway, your first shift starts… right now! We can worry about the paperwork and such later, but there’s a broom closet down the hall and to the left where I imagine you’ll be spending a lot of time. You can find all your cleaning supplies there. 

Ignoring the fact that “epic” had exited the parlance of the youth around the same time as “like a boss,” the Gremlin started to vigorously shake Brownman’s hand, beaming.

**GREMLIN:** I won’t let you down, sir! 

The Gremlin turned around and stepped out of Brownman’s office, heading down the hallway and out into one of the many busy corridors of St. Paul’s high school, a place where both learning and fun somehow went to die. As the Gremlin pushed passed overweight mexicans, polish immigrants, jocks, cheerleaders, goths, emos, and all of the other kinds of goon you encounter in a high school, he began to queerly powerwalk to the tune of George Harrison’s 1970 hit [What is Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XFfUt7HQWM). As you no doubt know, the Ambighter for Learning, Barney the Dinosaur, had decreed that music must be played at all times within the confines of the “folkish learnhall”, from a playlist specifically devised by the Oferlord’s great ally, Johnny Marr. Passing by a skateboarding Andromeda Frost, who didn’t give a single s*hit about Brownman’s rules, the Gremlin decided to menace the first student he came across. As luck would have it, that student was Mary Rees-Mogg, who, arriving late, was trying to stuff her books (burgers) into her locker (mouth). The new chief janitor stepped out in front of Mary, blocking her path like a brave woodsman resisting the Tribe, before speaking to her. 

**GREMLIN:** Supersize this, baby! 

“This” referred to his crotch, which the Gremlin proceeded to grab Michael Jackson-style (not to say that MJ was at all guilty of the things (((they))) said he was). Mary, taken aback by the wanton ludity displayed by this complete stranger, attempted to simply walk around the Gremlin, but due to her newfound sluggishness, the janitor was able to quickly mirror her movement. 

**GREMLIN:** Hehehe, not so fast, missy! You’re gonna have to do a bit more than that to shake ole’ Gremster off your tail! 

Mary was unable to stop herself as the Gremlin stepped out in front of her, and the two of them collided. The Gremlin hadn’t been expecting the impact, and standing wide-legged, was sent falling to the ground while Mary, who was sturdier than she had once been, stayed on her feet. The attention of almost everyone in the hall was captured by this, including that of Rudeboy Rudy, a member of the East Side Jets who was known for his quips and brazen disregard for political correctness - he had, actually, been the man who uttered the infamous drive-by slag “Donna, you’ve gone from bore to whore”. 

**RUDY:** Sumo wrestling!

Unfortunately for Rudy and his fellow bystanders, however, there would be no such thing, as Mary soon darted off in the opposite direction, hoping to flee the mockery of the crowd (Pro-tip: It’ll just come for you later). As she ran out one of the school doors and into the courtyard, Mary realised that she’d actually shown up in the middle of lunch time, something that she always tried to avoid on account of having lost all of her friends over the last six months. Faced with no other option, Mary decided to go to the water fountain and then try and walk around the school in laps to give the appearance that she was actually heading somewhere. As she approached the fountain, in the corner of the courtyard, she saw that Donna Frost was already using it - just her luck, because Donna was the one person she’d come in to see. 

**MARY:** Hiya, Donna!

Donna lifted her mouth up from the fountain and looked at Mary through her sunglasses, before finishing drinking and removing them. 

**DONNA:** What...the *hell* happened to you? 

**MARY:** Oh, you mean the hair? I honestly didn’t expect you to notice, girl, but I’ve been using a different kind of shampoo lately that’s meant to give your hair a more mane-like quality. Funny thing, it actually started out as horse shampoo before someone had the bright idea of trying it out on people and found it did wonders for volume and texture!

**DONNA:** Whatever, I don’t actually care.

Donna attempted to walk away, but Mary suddenly produced the MacLachlan puppet from under her shirt (Who can say WHAT it was getting up to??) and waved it at her.

**PUPPET MAC:** Ms. Frost, I have a few questions I’d like to ask you.  

**DONNA:** A puppet? God, that’s so childish. The real world’s going to hit you hard, Mary.

**MARY:** You know what else hit me hard?

**DONNA:** I don’t care? 

Mary pulled out the book that she’d found at Laurence Tremayne’s house from under her shirt. It seemed that when you went up three sizes, you got a lot of extra space to hide thing.

**MARY:** The character notes on Laurence Tremayne...or should I say...Laurain’t...T’...fake!

**DONNA:** Okay? What do you expect me to say, Mary? I honestly couldn’t care less about Tremayne, he’s almost as childish and just.. uncool as you. Besides, if he decides to be fake, he’d only be joining the trillions of other people on the planet doing the same thing. I can guarantee you’ve got a mask on too right now, because for some reason, people like you can’t stand the fact that if you’re just yourself, other equally uncool people are gonna judge you.

**MARY:** But this, this is like, his creative book for the entire Laurence Tremayne persona. He’s as real as Maccy’s rejection of me. 

Donna considered this.

**MARY:** That means he isn’t real!

Donna then initiated human contact for the first time since her return to Darkplace, grabbing Mary by the hand and pulling her over behind a wall.

**DONNA:** Listen, kid. You’re still young, so there’s still time to save you. You just need to unwind sometime and stop pretending to care about people. It’s done wonders for me.

Had it?

**MARY:** Uhm…

**DONNA:** Have you ever even fucked anyone, Mary?

**MARY:** Well, I mean… not strictly speaking, no, but I’ve had this real romantic idea floating in my head for a while where Agent Smoochie and I finally get to spend some quality time alone and, well, you know how those things to, and soon enough we’re getting ready to make passionate, sweaty love but at the last minute I’m filled with total anxiety, like all shaky and stuff, and Maccy asks what’s wrong and I tell him I’m a virgin and I’m just sitting there waiting for him to laugh at me or something but then the unexpected happens. He.. he says he’s also a virgin. And suddenly I don’t feel so nervous, Donna. I ask him, “really?” And you know how he could never tell a lie so goes “no, but I thought it’d make you less nervous.” Isn’t that just the most considerate thing, Donna, isn’t that just so dreamy? I like to think so, anyway. 

**DONNA:** Not really.

**MARY:** Oh.

**DONNA:** What you need to do is just go out and find someone to *fuck*. It worked for me.

**MARY:** Maybe that worked for you, but I’m...I’m a human pork sausage!

**DONNA:** Yeah.

It was true.

**DONNA:** I’m sure you can come up with something. If you can’t, well, I don’t really give a fuck either way.

Mary realised that this would potentially be her only chance to ask the elder sage Donna (Born 4 months after Mary) about how to best take advantage of her womanly attributes.

**MARY:** How did you do it, Donna?

**DONNA:** Well, if you really care so much about this, I guess I can tell you. It was when I took over Elizabeth’s meals-on-wheels route last Christmas or whenever that was. I remember it was on Maudlin Street because I had two houses there. Anyway, I walked up to the first house and rang the doorbell and this woman named Arabella Chalfont answered and then she invited me in I guess out of kindness or whatever and we talked a bit, just asking questions and shit. At first it was just normal questions like about my family but they kept getting more and more personal until she asked me if I’d ever kissed a girl, and she’d already taken off some of her clothing because it was hot, and I told her I’d never and then I guess it kind of just happened. I mean, it was alright, I guess.

She’s lying, Duke! 

**MARY:** Uhm..

**DONNA:** Yeah, well, if you want to try it, go ahead. Or don’t, I really don’t care either way. 

**MARY:** But...but...I’m not a lesbian.

**DONNA:** Yeah, me either. Who gives a shit, though? 

**MARY:** Are you sure…?

**DONNA:** I’m entirely comfortable with my own sexuality. If you aren’t, you’re just a loser. 

She wasn’t.

Donna then brought her shades back down over her eyes and, reaching into her leather jacket pocket, retrieved her lighter and a cigarette from her pack, which she then lit up in blatant and oh-so-cool disregard for the school’s anti-smoking policy. After taking a few drags of the death-stick, as Agent MacLachlan would call it, Donna looked to her left and saw Mary still standing there. 

**DONNA:** Why are you here? 

After Donna vocalised what we all surely thought, Mary quickly scurried away from the water fountain, leaving her to get lung cancer in peace, or so she thought. As Mary fucked off, Andromeda Frost fucked in. As you might remember, Andromeda and Donna shared the same parents, but they also had something else in common: they were sisters. The most elite native representative of the Edfolkness in Darkplace (By virtue of Pete and Joan being shit communists) came walking around the corner, holding her skateboard under her left arm. “Based Drom”, as she was for some reason known, seemed surprised to see Donna at the fountain, while Donna was aghast to see her. 

**ANDROMEDA:** Sister mine, before I make mean my inting with you now, I bid you unburden your mouth of that most outlandish thing. You do yourself and indeed the folk a great gaingiving by bearing that windling so. 

**DONNA:** Huh?

**ANDROMEDA:** The smoke stick, I frain you kindly to unmouth it so I may speak to you unbothered by its unfolkish offgivings. 

**DONNA:** Ugh, fine, whatever. I don’t care enough to argue over it. 

Donna then proceeded to “unmouth” the cigarette, but not before blowing a plume of smoke into Drom’s face in an act of great rebellion, causing the writer for the Folkish Herald to start violently coughing. 

**ANDROMEDA:** A foul - a foul d - 

Andromeda’s coughing intensified, and in order to deal with it, she pushed past Donna and drank from the fountain, something that she had always tried to avoid due to the trace amounts of lead that she had discovered in the school’s water supply a year or two ago.

**ANDROMEDA:** A foul deed have you done this day, loutish bitch!

**DONNA:** Whatever.

**ANDROMEDA:** Hear me now, she-fiend, this open strongfucking of the meanwealth, of mean rightness, shall not go unstrafed! 

**DONNA:** ...What?

Donna had clearly skipped the mandatory Anglish class that all students had been forced to take in the earlier part of the school year in order to get railed by her lover (At the time, and potentially now) James. 

**DONNA:** When did you get so fucking weird, Drom? Not that I really give a shit about you. 

**ANDROMEDA:** Have you ever bethunk that haps *you* might be the weird one, Donna? 

**DONNA:** Honestly, I’m beyond being weird. Maybe you’ll realise that when you grow up. Once you stop caring about what PEOPLE think of you, PEOPLE stop caring about what you do.

For her part, Andromeda thought that Donna cared far more about what other people thought of her than she ever had before she went off to Cardiff, but didn’t feel particularly bothered to voice this opinion. 

**DONNA:** This isn’t an art gallery, Drom - either move along and quit staring at me or spit it out… or don’t. Yeah. 

**ANDROMEDA:** I bear with me a weighty fraining of you.

**DONNA:** Okay. 

**ANDROMEDA:** I bid you tell mother and father that I shall not be back as gewonely early after school today, for I am to meet with the Overlord himself. 

**DONNA:** Alright, got it. Are we done here, or..? 

**ANDROMEDA:** I shall waste not a mete more of your time, then. Farewell, sister. 

With that, Andromeda headed into the school building, while Donna lit up another unfolkish smokestick, before heading off from the school’s middle courtyard to the back one, which was, as you might suppose, behind it. A popular hangout place for Donna’s classmates at St. Paul’s, the courtyard was naturally filled with many students engaged in various activities ranging from drug use, petty gambling with kooky multi-coloured die, gross displays of PDA, and the odd pair of students actually studenting, er, studying. Donna scanned the mass of students for familiar faces to grace with her presence, before her glance fell upon a very familiar face indeed, that of her boyfriend(????)/one-time rapist James Hightower. James was chasing after a friendly neighborhood cat that had wandered into the school, attempting to poke it up the bum with a big stick.

**JAMES:** Come back here, Top Cat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

James attempted to pounce on and sodomise the cat, but he was met with thin air, the cat having used one of his or her nine lives to slip away. Matches, one of James’ reject mates in the retard crew known as the Junk Hunks or whatever came running up to him, also holding a stick.

**MATCHES:** I really thought you had it this time, boss! 

**JAMES:** Yeah Matches, I know. How did yours go?

**MATCHES:** Oh. Rusty Dan and I couldn’t find that rabbit, so I just stuck it up his ass instead.


**JAMES:** Rough, man. But he knew what he was getting into. Thems how the dices roll sometimes, innit?????????

As this conversation unfolded, Donna approached two of the men that had been stuffed inside her various orifices the previous day, flicking her ash in their general direction so that they would know that despite what had happened, Donna didn’t give a s*hit about them, or something along those lines of delusion. 

**JAMES:** Why so cold, babe??!?!?????

**MATCHES:** I bet it’s because of the horseshoe theory, J-man!

The basic logic here was that, as they believed Donna was “hot”, she would thus come off as “cold”. It was very fallible. 

**DONNA:** Why the hell do you care about horses, Matches? You know, at the end of the day, they’re just glue. That’s all they are.

Donna wasn’t aware of the fact that in recent decades, synthetic glues had replaced animal glues almost entirely, and she probably also knew nothing about the loyalty, companionship, and overall friendliness of some horses. 

**JAMES:** You should show Matches some respect, babe!!!! He’s more than earned your tribute in his time!!!!!!!!!!

Donna must have been massively ignorant about the benefits of horses. So ignorant, in fact, that it was probably the crux of her various personality issues. When Donna returned from Cardiff, she somehow managed to sync it up with Cherry Bomb, which, we assume, she believed was a song reflective of her nature. Here’s the thing, bitch: the fox *we’re* waiting for wouldn’t turn down a shetland pony.

**DONNA:** Respect is for losers. 

Donna was one of those herself, so we don’t see the problem.

**JAMES:** Pay tribute to Matches, babe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**MATCHES:** It’s alright, J-man. If Donna doesn’t respect my prestige, there are plenty of people who do -

Were there?

**MATCHES:** Like Maxwell. 

Maxwell didn’t count as a person, so this statement was quite dishonest. 

**DONNA:** Maxwell has a tiny penis. 

Someone save us from this unceasing nightmare out of which there appears no possible escape.

**JAMES:** Maxwell is average sized, babe!!!!!!!!!!!!!

As this was going on, Strike Eagle and Smokey came walking around the corner, sans any other members of the East Side Jets.

**LANTERMAN:** Well, bro, you know how things are -

Strike Eagle took one look at James, and then processed what he’d just heard.

**LANTERMAN:** What the hell, bro? Why would you know that? 

**JAMES:** Just what are you trying to accuse me of, Strike Eagle??!?!?!??!?!! I’ll take you down the highway to -

**SMOKEY:** No, man. Shut up. We don’t care. 

**DONNA:** You only think you don’t care. Once you experience -

**SMOKEY:** Shut the fuck up, bitch. I genuinely, man, I *genuinely* don’t give a shit about what you’re doing if it’s not some retarded gangbang. Hit her with your line, Strike Eagle, bro!

BASED SMOKEY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**LANTERMAN:** Donna, you suck up air at the same rate as you suck dick!

**SMOKEY:** Not as good as you hyped it up as, man. 

**JAMES:** Alright, I’ve gotta lay down the law here. It was one thing for you to diss me, but the minute you brought my girl into that is the minute you bought two fucking one-way tickets down the highway to hell!!!!21!!!!!!1! Yeah, and maybe when they’re through with your a*sses there you’ll think twice before FUCKING with my girl… or maybe not since you’re so fuckin’ dumb!!!! You fucking Jets never learn, do you? You never learn not to fuck with the Junk Boys! You never learn not to fuck with me!! Heh, you know it’s kinda funny that even when you’re in the **LEARNHALL** you punk-ass bitches still can’t learn a damn thing! Maybe you’re just fucking retarded like uh.. Like… uh.. uhhh….

Like you, James. Other acceptable answer choices include: Sixtus Rees-Mogg, Andy Smalls, and whoever invented revolving doors. 

**MATCHES:** Boss, they left. 

James opened his eyes for the first time since he began his rant and discovered that Matches spoke true: Smokey and Strike Eagle had promptly fucked off. The two far superior high school seniors had returned to the school building, where Johnny Marr’s official learnhall playlist was blasting, for all Anglish students, the renowned Philip Davies anthem [Death of a Clown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coCjlhyFug8). As they pushed through a set of double-doors near Sister Anne-Marie’s Spanish room, they arrived at the elevator that functioned as the traditional lunch-time hangout of the East Side Jets. The gang was all there, which is to say, Joey, Bueno Excellente, Rudy, and anyone else we decide to retroactively add at a later date. Smokey and Strike Eagle walked up to their fellows, but as they did, they passed the now uniformed Gremlin, who was haphazardly mopping the floor, muttering to himself all the while.

**GREMLIN:** Ehhhhhhhhh…..gremlin gremlin gremlin….

Ashebrooke was sitting on a windowsill when the other two East Side Jets arrived, staring at the Gremlin with much suspicion. 

**JOEY:** That guy definitely rapes, bros. 

**BUENO:** Weird theory, but what if he’s the breeder, ese? No one knows what he looks like, nawmean? 

**JOEY:** Are you retarded, bro? I’ve like, literally seen old man Hurley with my own eyes. 

**BUENO:** Ay, tranquilo, man, I wasn’t trying to step on any toes here. 

**JOEY:** You’re stepping on my fuckin’ brain with this retarded shit, man! 

Strike Eagle and Smokey rejoined the group as Joey told his mexican comrade what he thought of his ethnically-impaired breeding theories. 

**LANTERMAN** What’s going on, bro? 

**JOEY:** Bueno’s trying to say the new janitor’s the goddamn breeder!

**LANTERMAN:** Shit, man, but that’s like...he’d have to have shrunk, bro! Is that even possible??? Shit, man, what if he got his hands on one of Tremayne’s shrinking potions?!

**RUDY:** Someone should buy Mary one of those!

Everyone, in unison, shouted “zing!”, because, well, it was Rudy. After zinging, though, Smokey had a lingering question.

**SMOKEY:** What do you mean, man?

**RUDY:** Well...she should get a shrinking potion...to...if you’re following me here, hoss, make herself thin again. 

**SMOKEY:** What do you mean *again*? 

**BUENO:** Are you blind, holmes?

**SMOKEY:** Huh?

**JOEY:** Mary got big into comfort eating, and now she like, weighs as much as Sixtus, man. 

**SMOKEY:** Really?

**JOEY:** Yeah.

**SMOKEY:** I mean...I guess I haven’t seen her in ages, man. I had no idea. Shit, sometimes things just work out weird. 

In actuality, Smokey had seen Mary several times in recent months, and actually even talked to her in passing once, it was just that he didn’t recognise her at all with her new winter padding. 

**SMOKEY:** What was she eating, Joe? 

**JOEY:** How should I know, man?...McDonalds or something, I think she like, y’know, stuffs herself with that every day, man. 

A few seconds after saying this, a realisation simultaneously dawned on Joey and the other Jets.

**JOEY:** McDonalds, man!

**LANTERMAN:** She’s fat as fuck, bro! She must have gallons of breeder juice in her by now!

**JOEY:** So what, you think we should like.. Pump her stomach or something?

**LANTERMAN:** Nah, man, that’s just ridiculous. It’s the sauce, man, we need that fucking sauce. 

**SMOKEY:** When I was snooping around the back room of that McDonald’s before they threw me out I coulda sworn I saw some of the Breeder’s cum pipelines. I mean, they looked like regular pipes like you’d expect to see back there except these ones were fuckin’ encrusted with something white, and I’m telling you it wasn’t ranch dressing. 

**JOEY:** We gotta check those pipes out, bros. 

**SMOKEY:** I’m right there with you, man, I haven’t been able to shake that shit from my head since I saw it. I’ve been dying to get back there again. 

**LANTERMAN:** Maybe we should try and be a bit stealthier this time though, like with balaclavas and shit. Maybe even grappling hooks, who knows. 

**JOEY:** Man, I like the idea and all but why would we need grappling hooks for a one-story building? 

**BUENO:** What if we bust in with our gats out, hombre?

**JOEY:** That’d just get us arrested, brother. 

**RUDY:** You guys could honestly just get a uniform and walk in. McDonalds has a higher turnover rate than the subs here since they got rid of Mr. Long.

The Mr. Long in question was one Jerry Long, a local man whose occupation was best described as professional substitute teacher in the sense that he was Principal Brownman’s go-to sub whenever one of his staff members fell ill (these days it was almost always the plague). No one at the school was quite sure where Mr. Long came from, what he did before subbing for classes, or even who first hired him but it certainly wasn’t Malik Brownman or any of the living former principals of St. Paul’s. What they were sure of, though, was that he gave everyone a serious case of the uncomfies whenever he came in to sub. This was largely because of things that Jerry had no real control over such as his age, his unsettlingly quiet, raspy voice, and his oddly-shaped and groomed eyebrows, which sat on his forehead like two caterpillars. Some of it, however, could be attributed to his own doings. For instance, Long had a habit of being caught staring at some of his female pupils and, because he was, as we mentioned before, Malik Brownman’s go-to sub, would often go up to said female pupils and inquire as to whether he’d “had” them (in class) before (nyeahhh), resulting in uncomfortably drawn-out conversations with them about their post-high school plans and whether they “liked boys” yet. Needless to say, Jerry had developed something of a reputation around St. Paul’s and indeed the wider Darkplace area as an innocently creepy old man at best and a full-blown diddler at worst, and consequently was the subject of numerous complaints by his unwilling female conversation partners and their parents. Jerry’s ways could have feasibly been overlooked by school administration, were it not for the advent of something real wacky. That something was none other than Dr. Alfonso Gomez, the aptly-named “Doctor of Pain and Shame” who terrorised Darkplace and surrounding communities some years ago. The unparalleled child-lusting of Gomez, which affected countless lives and set a high score which not even the Night Stalker looked set to equal, caused the town to enter into a great panic and the school, not wishing to look complicit in Long’s suspected wrongdoings, decided to get ahead of the scandal and fired him, or rather, quit calling him whenever a substitute teacher was needed. Jerry, however, would have the last laugh, as only a week after his sacking, the entire teaching staff would go on strike and the school, now without their main substitute, would be forced to close down for a week. To this day, there is still debate over whether Long, who hasn’t been seen since his firing, was guilty of the things he was accused of. Personally, we think he raped a pile of underaged girls, but we’ll leave it up to the reader to reach their own conclusions. Oh, and he probably tickled them with his eyebrows - but this isn’t Longplace, so who cares?

**SMOKEY:** Good idea, man.

It wasn’t really.

**Wilmington House**

While some people in Darkplace were concerned about the arrival of the Night Stalker, and others about the potential return of Bruce Hurley and/or Aquarius Jackson, and a few more about the calamitous press-conference last night that had seen Earl Winston make his presence felt, while Rees-Moggs Jacob and Tommy were most alarmed by the arrival of the First Ambighter, Jeremy Corbyn, and Morrissey, the Overlord of all Anglishmen. The Conservative candidate in the Grant by-election was standing in front of his desk, while his campaign coordinator, manager, door-to-door vote suggester, and entire electoral machine was standing in front of him. To be be clear, those are all the same person, and that person was his brother. In the corner of the room was a television screen, which had been wheeled in by Sixtus, who was taking the day off school thanks to a so-called “stummy hort”. The two Moggs were deep in conversation about the Overlord’s arrival and how to best deal with it.

**MOGG:** - I tell you, this is the only way, brother!

**TOMMY:** No! 

**MOGG:** Yes! The only way to counteract the arrival of that vegetable fascist and defeat Pete is to gain outside support, brother! We must contact Samuel of the Tribe, and regain their patronage!

Jacob walked over to the television screen - in actuality a cleverly disguised Audiovisual Israelite Transmitter - and started to hook it up to the electricity socket and try to set the antenna up right. 

**TOMMY:** There has to be another way, Brother Jake! Is winning the election that important??

**MOGG:** Thomas! I expected better of you. You of all people should know how important it is that we defeat this Anglishism once and for all! The House of Commons needs a strong Tory voice once again, or things are going to go from bad to worse in this nation! Why, they don’t even speak English anymore!

Mogg flicked the switch, allowing the grainy AVIT to flicker to life.

**MOGG:** And with Morrissey and that communist Corbyn here in Darkplace, we have great need of the Tribe’s aid. It’s the only way forward.

Samuel’s bearded face soon appeared on the screen. From the sounds in the background, it appeared that the master of tribal propaganda was currently on the set of another one of his blockbuster films.

**SAMUEL:** I’ve told you a thousand times, Justin, just let the Arabs fuck your froy!

The Elder narrowed his eyes, taking stock of the people standing on the other end of what was probably his phone’s screen.

**SAMUEL:** Oy gevalt, Jacob, I thought you were someone else. What do you want with me, goy? You fell from our favour months ago!

**MOGG:** I understand that, Lord Samuel, but I speak to you now with hopes of rekindling the strong alliance I once knew with your most esteemed council of elders. 

**SAMUEL:** Alliance? No, Jacob, you were our shabbos goy, and a lousy one at that! 

**MOGG:** Oh Lord Samuel, I have been such a foolish goy!

Mogg fell to his knees in front of the TV, striking a begging pose. 

**MOGG:** Lord Samuel, you must know that I never meant to harbour that awful Tremayne in my business! He duplicitously lured me into thinking he was just some harmless, though ultimately homosexual fashionista! Oh, my Tribal overlord, I have been foolish, and now the Folkish Band stand poised to seize my constituency! 

**SAMUEL:** Quit your kvetching, goy! You opened yourself up to this when you let we Heebs down! Do it yourself, gentile!

**MOGG:** But, master, Morrissey and Corbyn have come to stand against me! 

**SAMUEL:** Why didn’t you open with that, Jakey? That changes things. An opportunity to show up that pair of mashuganas comes up once in a blue moon. You will have our backing.

**MOGG:** Oh, glorious!

**SAMUEL:** But be warned, Jacob. The price will be steep...very steep indeed.

As Samuel closed the connection, the Moggs were left contemplating just how steep he meant. Like, countryside steep (£5 for a pint) or city steep (£12 for a pint)? We can’t say.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laurence Tremayne’s Hut&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Villa Tremayne on the outskirts of town, relatively close to Wilmington House, had once been the world’s most chaste “gay twink palace”, back when the driving force behind the Laurence Tremayne character had been variously his niceness and gayness, but after Laurent Le Foll had decided to retool Tremayne’s shtick into that of a satanic faggot - with satanic always coming first - he had torn down the entire mansion and replaced it with a witch’s hut, which looked just as you might expect, all rickety and wooden and covered with strange plants and jutting out at odd angles. The one thing stopping Tremayne’s hut from being a perfectly wiccan structure was where it was situated. Le Foll could tear down the building and replace it with something else, but he couldn’t tear down the ground, nor was he inclined to try. As such, Tremayne’s hut was still behind the massive iron-gate and driveway that had made his mansion the fourth biggest house in the Darkplace area (After the MoggMansion, Bono’s house, and, if you counted it, the castle), making it look less sinister and more “just odd”. Mary Rees-Mogg was currently walking up this just odd driveway, which was a struggle for her, as thanks to major comfort eating following the termination of her, what, two day old-relationship with Dale MacLachlan, she had gained almost thirty pounds, and was now what some people might class as “pleasantly plump”, although they would be wrong, as the correct definition is “a chubby bitch”. Mary had skipped school (To be more specific: PE, which she could barely do anyway.) in order to retrieve the love potion she’d ordered from Tremayne a day earlier, but as she reached the fungus-covered stairs of the shack and knocked on the door to no reply, it dawned on her that she might have been stood up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Son of a bitch…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary quickly set down her school bag and unzipped it, pulling out a home-knitted Dale MacLachlan doll that in every way resembled the man currently (most likely) twerking on a park bench in town. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARY:&lt;/strong&gt; What do we do next, Agent McCoolGuy??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PUPPET MAC:&lt;/strong&gt; Jeez Mary, I’m not really sure. I know that whenever I encounter a mystery, I always do my utmost to investigate it in a professional manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you mean I should break in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PUPPET MAC:&lt;/strong&gt; You betcha. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary gave the puppet a thumbs-up, before manipulating its tiny woollen hands into giving her one in reply. Leaving her bag, but taking her boy (As these characters formed into words, we are all of us now aware as to why it can be “my girl” or “my man” but not “my boy” or “my woman”, unless, of course, you’re Robert Plant, in which case the last one comprises 90% of your song lyrics), she headed around the side of the hut, looking for an entrance of some sort. Finding the windows all shut and the lights on the inside as turned off as anyone after seeing her transformation over these last six months, Mary deliberated on whether to just go to school or not, but she eventually decided that her love for Mac had to come before her education, and picked up a particularly hefty rock that had once been part of Tremayne’s garden. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARY:&lt;/strong&gt; I love you, Maccy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using all of her womanly strength, Mary hurled the rock at Tremayne’s window, tipping herself in the process. While Mary fell down onto the ground, the stone managed to hit its mark and crashed right through the glass, completely obliterating what had once been Darkplace’s only quadruple glazed window. Picking herself back up, Mary ran over to the window and jumped right through it, narrowly avoiding getting stuck in the frame. Once on the inside, she found herself in a surprisingly well-furnished room (Well, we say surprisingly, but the decor of the original gay mansion surely had to be repurposed somehow), with several armchairs, a table, and a massive flat-screen TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No response. Mary walked over to one of the armchairs and sat down on it, but the second she did, the entire seat collapsed, leaving her sitting in the ruins of what was once furniture. After she got over the shock of the seat giving way on her, Mary began to cry, which is something she apparently does often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARY:&lt;/strong&gt; You’re such a stupid fat bitch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We find it hard to argue with any of that. As Mary was surely (and rightly) contemplating ending it all, she put her hand on one of the broken bits of the seat and realised that it felt strange. Picking it up, Mary took a good long look at it, and came to the conclusion that the seat was actually made out of cardboard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Huh. Any clue what’s going on here, Maccy?????&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PUPPET MAC:&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe the entire house is made out of cardboard? I’d check the TV, if I were you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Good idea!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary picked herself up and headed over to the TV, which, upon closer inspection, turned out to simply be a large sheet of cardboard painted black.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Mystery kino…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary’s eyes soon fell on Tremayne’s coffee table, perhaps the only non-cardboard element of the house, as well as a book sitting on top of it. Waddling over to it, the obese ho picked the book up, and blew off a layer of dust that had gathered for aesthetic reasons. The cover read: &lt;em&gt;Character notes on Laurence Tremayne&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Huh. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St. Paul the Evangelist High School&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many great leaders before him, Malik Brownman, Principal of St. Paul the Evangelist High School, sat at his desk, sipping a glass of water in lieu of the typical bourbon, since that isn’t exactly something you can just whip out and start drinking in the middle of a high school. The brown man was currently flipping through a stack of papers in between sips of what the Darkplace youth affectionately called “based haitch two oh.” Unlike in many other narratives which start out this way, however, these papers would actually serve as something for the character in question to be doing at the start of the scene. The papers were, in fact, submitted resumes for the recently vacated position of “Chief Head of her Royal Majesty’s Custodial Service,” which was a polite and frankly outdated way of saying janitor. The principal had already interviewed five candidates for the job, and finding each to have their own set of problems (three of the five had a laundry list of prior convictions and one of them was a literal Nazi, as opposed to the figurative kind. The other one sort of just rubbed him the wrong way), had yet to decide on who would fill this prestigious position. As candidate six walked in through the door, Malik Brownman’s expectations were the opposite of high - which is to say, they were low. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BROWNMAN:&lt;/strong&gt; I’d like to thank you taking the time to come in today, Mr… Gremlin. I’m sure you will bring your own unique perspective to the community here at St. Paul’s!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GREMLIN:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeh, heheheheh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gremlin sat down on the chair in front of Brownman and shook the principal’s outstretched hand with his own, impossibly sticky one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GREMLIN:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m gonna be up front with you, Mr. Brownman. My shtick is that I’m the world’s ultimate bang-goblin. If I get employed here, I’m definitely gonna menace the students. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BROWNMAN:&lt;/strong&gt; What kind of menacing are you describing, Mr. Gremlin?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GREMLIN:&lt;/strong&gt; Y’know. Standard uneasy potential child groomer figure. Might give the kids some candy, might inappropriately invade their personal space in a way that leaves them confused as to if I’m a diddler or just weird. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BROWNMAN:&lt;/strong&gt; So, let me get this straight, Mr. Gremlin, there won’t be any actual.. diddling involved in this planned menacing? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GREMLIN:&lt;/strong&gt; Not if I can help it, sir. Course, sometimes events slip out of my control, but I’m not going into this planning to diddle anyone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BROWNMAN:&lt;/strong&gt; And...if there was any diddling, what...form would that take?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GREMLIN:&lt;/strong&gt; Light molestation always. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gremlin then mimed cutting his own throat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GREMLIN:&lt;/strong&gt; No rapes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BROWNMAN:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m really glad you said that, Mr. Gremlin, I really am. Now, uh, how do I phrase this last one.. Do you hold any sort of prejudices towards other groups of people that might pose an issue around campus? I’m only asking because one of the five applicants before you had some rather antiquated views on race and I’d like to avoid a repeat of that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GREMLIN:&lt;/strong&gt; Not at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BROWNMAN:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, that concludes the background check, then. Mr. Gremlin, I think I’ve made my decision - you’re hired!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GREMLIN:&lt;/strong&gt; You’d better go ahead and give the kiddies a head start, then, ‘cause they’re gonna need it! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BROWNMAN:&lt;/strong&gt; Epic reply from the Gremlin! Er, sorry about that, I’ve just been trying to brush up on current slang so I can connect to the student body on a more personal level. Anyway, your first shift starts… right now! We can worry about the paperwork and such later, but there’s a broom closet down the hall and to the left where I imagine you’ll be spending a lot of time. You can find all your cleaning supplies there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignoring the fact that “epic” had exited the parlance of the youth around the same time as “like a boss,” the Gremlin started to vigorously shake Brownman’s hand, beaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GREMLIN:&lt;/strong&gt; I won’t let you down, sir! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gremlin turned around and stepped out of Brownman’s office, heading down the hallway and out into one of the many busy corridors of St. Paul’s high school, a place where both learning and fun somehow went to die. As the Gremlin pushed passed overweight mexicans, polish immigrants, jocks, cheerleaders, goths, emos, and all of the other kinds of goon you encounter in a high school, he began to queerly powerwalk to the tune of George Harrison’s 1970 hit &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XFfUt7HQWM""&gt;What is Life&lt;/a&gt;. As you no doubt know, the Ambighter for Learning, Barney the Dinosaur, had decreed that music must be played at all times within the confines of the “folkish learnhall”, from a playlist specifically devised by the Oferlord’s great ally, Johnny Marr. Passing by a skateboarding Andromeda Frost, who didn’t give a single s*hit about Brownman’s rules, the Gremlin decided to menace the first student he came across. As luck would have it, that student was Mary Rees-Mogg, who, arriving late, was trying to stuff her books (burgers) into her locker (mouth). The new chief janitor stepped out in front of Mary, blocking her path like a brave woodsman resisting the Tribe, before speaking to her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GREMLIN:&lt;/strong&gt; Supersize this, baby! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This” referred to his crotch, which the Gremlin proceeded to grab Michael Jackson-style (not to say that MJ was at all guilty of the things (((they))) said he was). Mary, taken aback by the wanton ludity displayed by this complete stranger, attempted to simply walk around the Gremlin, but due to her newfound sluggishness, the janitor was able to quickly mirror her movement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GREMLIN:&lt;/strong&gt; Hehehe, not so fast, missy! You’re gonna have to do a bit more than that to shake ole’ Gremster off your tail! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary was unable to stop herself as the Gremlin stepped out in front of her, and the two of them collided. The Gremlin hadn’t been expecting the impact, and standing wide-legged, was sent falling to the ground while Mary, who was sturdier than she had once been, stayed on her feet. The attention of almost everyone in the hall was captured by this, including that of Rudeboy Rudy, a member of the East Side Jets who was known for his quips and brazen disregard for political correctness - he had, actually, been the man who uttered the infamous drive-by slag “Donna, you’ve gone from bore to whore”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RUDY:&lt;/strong&gt; Sumo wrestling!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for Rudy and his fellow bystanders, however, there would be no such thing, as Mary soon darted off in the opposite direction, hoping to flee the mockery of the crowd (Pro-tip: It’ll just come for you later). As she ran out one of the school doors and into the courtyard, Mary realised that she’d actually shown up in the middle of lunch time, something that she always tried to avoid on account of having lost all of her friends over the last six months. Faced with no other option, Mary decided to go to the water fountain and then try and walk around the school in laps to give the appearance that she was actually heading somewhere. As she approached the fountain, in the corner of the courtyard, she saw that Donna Frost was already using it - just her luck, because Donna was the one person she’d come in to see. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Hiya, Donna!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donna lifted her mouth up from the fountain and looked at Mary through her sunglasses, before finishing drinking and removing them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONNA:&lt;/strong&gt; What...the &lt;em&gt;hell&lt;/em&gt; happened to you? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, you mean the hair? I honestly didn’t expect you to notice, girl, but I’ve been using a different kind of shampoo lately that’s meant to give your hair a more mane-like quality. Funny thing, it actually started out as horse shampoo before someone had the bright idea of trying it out on people and found it did wonders for volume and texture!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONNA:&lt;/strong&gt; Whatever, I don’t actually care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donna attempted to walk away, but Mary suddenly produced the MacLachlan puppet from under her shirt (Who can say WHAT it was getting up to??) and waved it at her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PUPPET MAC:&lt;/strong&gt; Ms. Frost, I have a few questions I’d like to ask you.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONNA:&lt;/strong&gt; A puppet? God, that’s so childish. The real world’s going to hit you hard, Mary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARY:&lt;/strong&gt; You know what else hit me hard?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONNA:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t care? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary pulled out the book that she’d found at Laurence Tremayne’s house from under her shirt. It seemed that when you went up three sizes, you got a lot of extra space to hide thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARY:&lt;/strong&gt; The character notes on Laurence Tremayne...or should I say...Laurain’t...T’...fake!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONNA:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay? What do you expect me to say, Mary? I honestly couldn’t care less about Tremayne, he’s almost as childish and just.. uncool as you. Besides, if he decides to be fake, he’d only be joining the trillions of other people on the planet doing the same thing. I can guarantee you’ve got a mask on too right now, because for some reason, people like you can’t stand the fact that if you’re just yourself, other equally uncool people are gonna judge you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARY:&lt;/strong&gt; But this, this is like, his creative book for the entire Laurence Tremayne persona. He’s as real as Maccy’s rejection of me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donna considered this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARY:&lt;/strong&gt; That means he isn’t real!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donna then initiated human contact for the first time since her return to Darkplace, grabbing Mary by the hand and pulling her over behind a wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONNA:&lt;/strong&gt; Listen, kid. You’re still young, so there’s still time to save you. You just need to unwind sometime and stop pretending to care about people. It’s done wonders for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Uhm…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONNA:&lt;/strong&gt; Have you ever even fucked anyone, Mary?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, I mean… not strictly speaking, no, but I’ve had this real romantic idea floating in my head for a while where Agent Smoochie and I finally get to spend some quality time alone and, well, you know how those things to, and soon enough we’re getting ready to make passionate, sweaty love but at the last minute I’m filled with total anxiety, like all shaky and stuff, and Maccy asks what’s wrong and I tell him I’m a virgin and I’m just sitting there waiting for him to laugh at me or something but then the unexpected happens. He.. he says he’s also a virgin. And suddenly I don’t feel so nervous, Donna. I ask him, “really?” And you know how he could never tell a lie so goes “no, but I thought it’d make you less nervous.” Isn’t that just the most considerate thing, Donna, isn’t that just so dreamy? I like to think so, anyway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONNA:&lt;/strong&gt; Not really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONNA:&lt;/strong&gt; What you need to do is just go out and find someone to &lt;em&gt;fuck&lt;/em&gt;. It worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe that worked for you, but I’m...I’m a human pork sausage!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONNA:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONNA:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m sure you can come up with something. If you can’t, well, I don’t really give a fuck either way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary realised that this would potentially be her only chance to ask the elder sage Donna (Born 4 months after Mary) about how to best take advantage of her womanly attributes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARY:&lt;/strong&gt; How did you do it, Donna?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONNA:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, if you really care so much about this, I guess I can tell you. It was when I took over Elizabeth’s meals-on-wheels route last Christmas or whenever that was. I remember it was on Maudlin Street because I had two houses there. Anyway, I walked up to the first house and rang the doorbell and this woman named Arabella Chalfont answered and then she invited me in I guess out of kindness or whatever and we talked a bit, just asking questions and shit. At first it was just normal questions like about my family but they kept getting more and more personal until she asked me if I’d ever kissed a girl, and she’d already taken off some of her clothing because it was hot, and I told her I’d never and then I guess it kind of just happened. I mean, it was alright, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She’s lying, Duke! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Uhm..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONNA:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, well, if you want to try it, go ahead. Or don’t, I really don’t care either way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARY:&lt;/strong&gt; But...but...I’m not a lesbian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONNA:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, me either. Who gives a shit, though? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Are you sure…?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONNA:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m entirely comfortable with my own sexuality. If you aren’t, you’re just a loser. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donna then brought her shades back down over her eyes and, reaching into her leather jacket pocket, retrieved her lighter and a cigarette from her pack, which she then lit up in blatant and oh-so-cool disregard for the school’s anti-smoking policy. After taking a few drags of the death-stick, as Agent MacLachlan would call it, Donna looked to her left and saw Mary still standing there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONNA:&lt;/strong&gt; Why are you here? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Donna vocalised what we all surely thought, Mary quickly scurried away from the water fountain, leaving her to get lung cancer in peace, or so she thought. As Mary fucked off, Andromeda Frost fucked in. As you might remember, Andromeda and Donna shared the same parents, but they also had something else in common: they were sisters. The most elite native representative of the Edfolkness in Darkplace (By virtue of Pete and Joan being shit communists) came walking around the corner, holding her skateboard under her left arm. “Based Drom”, as she was for some reason known, seemed surprised to see Donna at the fountain, while Donna was aghast to see her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANDROMEDA:&lt;/strong&gt; Sister mine, before I make mean my inting with you now, I bid you unburden your mouth of that most outlandish thing. You do yourself and indeed the folk a great gaingiving by bearing that windling so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONNA:&lt;/strong&gt; Huh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANDROMEDA:&lt;/strong&gt; The smoke stick, I frain you kindly to unmouth it so I may speak to you unbothered by its unfolkish offgivings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONNA:&lt;/strong&gt; Ugh, fine, whatever. I don’t care enough to argue over it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donna then proceeded to “unmouth” the cigarette, but not before blowing a plume of smoke into Drom’s face in an act of great rebellion, causing the writer for the Folkish Herald to start violently coughing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANDROMEDA:&lt;/strong&gt; A foul - a foul d - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andromeda’s coughing intensified, and in order to deal with it, she pushed past Donna and drank from the fountain, something that she had always tried to avoid due to the trace amounts of lead that she had discovered in the school’s water supply a year or two ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANDROMEDA:&lt;/strong&gt; A foul deed have you done this day, loutish bitch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONNA:&lt;/strong&gt; Whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANDROMEDA:&lt;/strong&gt; Hear me now, she-fiend, this open strongfucking of the meanwealth, of mean rightness, shall not go unstrafed! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONNA:&lt;/strong&gt; ...What?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donna had clearly skipped the mandatory Anglish class that all students had been forced to take in the earlier part of the school year in order to get railed by her lover (At the time, and potentially now) James. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONNA:&lt;/strong&gt; When did you get so fucking weird, Drom? Not that I really give a shit about you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANDROMEDA:&lt;/strong&gt; Have you ever bethunk that haps &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; might be the weird one, Donna? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONNA:&lt;/strong&gt; Honestly, I’m beyond being weird. Maybe you’ll realise that when you grow up. Once you stop caring about what PEOPLE think of you, PEOPLE stop caring about what you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For her part, Andromeda thought that Donna cared far more about what other people thought of her than she ever had before she went off to Cardiff, but didn’t feel particularly bothered to voice this opinion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONNA:&lt;/strong&gt; This isn’t an art gallery, Drom - either move along and quit staring at me or spit it out… or don’t. Yeah. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANDROMEDA:&lt;/strong&gt; I bear with me a weighty fraining of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONNA:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANDROMEDA:&lt;/strong&gt; I bid you tell mother and father that I shall not be back as gewonely early after school today, for I am to meet with the Overlord himself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONNA:&lt;/strong&gt; Alright, got it. Are we done here, or..? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANDROMEDA:&lt;/strong&gt; I shall waste not a mete more of your time, then. Farewell, sister. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, Andromeda headed into the school building, while Donna lit up another unfolkish smokestick, before heading off from the school’s middle courtyard to the back one, which was, as you might suppose, behind it. A popular hangout place for Donna’s classmates at St. Paul’s, the courtyard was naturally filled with many students engaged in various activities ranging from drug use, petty gambling with kooky multi-coloured die, gross displays of PDA, and the odd pair of students actually studenting, er, studying. Donna scanned the mass of students for familiar faces to grace with her presence, before her glance fell upon a very familiar face indeed, that of her boyfriend(????)/one-time rapist James Hightower. James was chasing after a friendly neighborhood cat that had wandered into the school, attempting to poke it up the bum with a big stick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JAMES:&lt;/strong&gt; Come back here, Top Cat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James attempted to pounce on and sodomise the cat, but he was met with thin air, the cat having used one of his or her nine lives to slip away. Matches, one of James’ reject mates in the retard crew known as the Junk Hunks or whatever came running up to him, also holding a stick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MATCHES:&lt;/strong&gt; I really thought you had it this time, boss! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JAMES:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah Matches, I know. How did yours go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MATCHES:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh. Rusty Dan and I couldn’t find that rabbit, so I just stuck it up his ass instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JAMES:&lt;/strong&gt; Rough, man. But he knew what he was getting into. Thems how the dices roll sometimes, innit?????????&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this conversation unfolded, Donna approached two of the men that had been stuffed inside her various orifices the previous day, flicking her ash in their general direction so that they would know that despite what had happened, Donna didn’t give a s*hit about them, or something along those lines of delusion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JAMES:&lt;/strong&gt; Why so cold, babe??!?!?????&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MATCHES:&lt;/strong&gt; I bet it’s because of the horseshoe theory, J-man!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic logic here was that, as they believed Donna was “hot”, she would thus come off as “cold”. It was very fallible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONNA:&lt;/strong&gt; Why the hell do you care about horses, Matches? You know, at the end of the day, they’re just glue. That’s all they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donna wasn’t aware of the fact that in recent decades, synthetic glues had replaced animal glues almost entirely, and she probably also knew nothing about the loyalty, companionship, and overall friendliness of some horses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JAMES:&lt;/strong&gt; You should show Matches some respect, babe!!!! He’s more than earned your tribute in his time!!!!!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donna must have been massively ignorant about the benefits of horses. So ignorant, in fact, that it was probably the crux of her various personality issues. When Donna returned from Cardiff, she somehow managed to sync it up with Cherry Bomb, which, we assume, she believed was a song reflective of her nature. Here’s the thing, bitch: the fox &lt;em&gt;we’re&lt;/em&gt; waiting for wouldn’t turn down a shetland pony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONNA:&lt;/strong&gt; Respect is for losers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donna was one of those herself, so we don’t see the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JAMES:&lt;/strong&gt; Pay tribute to Matches, babe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MATCHES:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s alright, J-man. If Donna doesn’t respect my prestige, there are plenty of people who do -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Were there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MATCHES:&lt;/strong&gt; Like Maxwell. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maxwell didn’t count as a person, so this statement was quite dishonest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONNA:&lt;/strong&gt; Maxwell has a tiny penis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone save us from this unceasing nightmare out of which there appears no possible escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JAMES:&lt;/strong&gt; Maxwell is average sized, babe!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this was going on, Strike Eagle and Smokey came walking around the corner, sans any other members of the East Side Jets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LANTERMAN:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, bro, you know how things are -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strike Eagle took one look at James, and then processed what he’d just heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LANTERMAN:&lt;/strong&gt; What the hell, bro? Why would you know that? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JAMES:&lt;/strong&gt; Just what are you trying to accuse me of, Strike Eagle??!?!?!??!?!! I’ll take you down the highway to -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SMOKEY:&lt;/strong&gt; No, man. Shut up. We don’t care. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DONNA:&lt;/strong&gt; You only think you don’t care. Once you experience -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SMOKEY:&lt;/strong&gt; Shut the fuck up, bitch. I genuinely, man, I &lt;em&gt;genuinely&lt;/em&gt; don’t give a shit about what you’re doing if it’s not some retarded gangbang. Hit her with your line, Strike Eagle, bro!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BASED SMOKEY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LANTERMAN:&lt;/strong&gt; Donna, you suck up air at the same rate as you suck dick!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SMOKEY:&lt;/strong&gt; Not as good as you hyped it up as, man. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JAMES:&lt;/strong&gt; Alright, I’ve gotta lay down the law here. It was one thing for you to diss me, but the minute you brought my girl into that is the minute you bought two fucking one-way tickets down the highway to hell!!!!21!!!!!!1! Yeah, and maybe when they’re through with your a&lt;em&gt;sses there you’ll think twice before FUCKING with my girl… or maybe not since you’re so fuckin’ dumb!!!! You fucking Jets never learn, do you? You never learn not to fuck with the Junk Boys! You never learn not to fuck with me!! Heh, you know it’s kinda funny that even when you’re in the *&lt;/em&gt;LEARNHALL** you punk-ass bitches still can’t learn a damn thing! Maybe you’re just fucking retarded like uh.. Like… uh.. uhhh….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like you, James. Other acceptable answer choices include: Sixtus Rees-Mogg, Andy Smalls, and whoever invented revolving doors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MATCHES:&lt;/strong&gt; Boss, they left. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James opened his eyes for the first time since he began his rant and discovered that Matches spoke true: Smokey and Strike Eagle had promptly fucked off. The two far superior high school seniors had returned to the school building, where Johnny Marr’s official learnhall playlist was blasting, for all Anglish students, the renowned Philip Davies anthem &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coCjlhyFug8""&gt;Death of a Clown&lt;/a&gt;. As they pushed through a set of double-doors near Sister Anne-Marie’s Spanish room, they arrived at the elevator that functioned as the traditional lunch-time hangout of the East Side Jets. The gang was all there, which is to say, Joey, Bueno Excellente, Rudy, and anyone else we decide to retroactively add at a later date. Smokey and Strike Eagle walked up to their fellows, but as they did, they passed the now uniformed Gremlin, who was haphazardly mopping the floor, muttering to himself all the while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GREMLIN:&lt;/strong&gt; Ehhhhhhhhh…..gremlin gremlin gremlin….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashebrooke was sitting on a windowsill when the other two East Side Jets arrived, staring at the Gremlin with much suspicion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOEY:&lt;/strong&gt; That guy definitely rapes, bros. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUENO:&lt;/strong&gt; Weird theory, but what if he’s the breeder, ese? No one knows what he looks like, nawmean? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOEY:&lt;/strong&gt; Are you retarded, bro? I’ve like, literally seen old man Hurley with my own eyes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUENO:&lt;/strong&gt; Ay, tranquilo, man, I wasn’t trying to step on any toes here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOEY:&lt;/strong&gt; You’re stepping on my fuckin’ brain with this retarded shit, man! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strike Eagle and Smokey rejoined the group as Joey told his mexican comrade what he thought of his ethnically-impaired breeding theories. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LANTERMAN&lt;/strong&gt; What’s going on, bro? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOEY:&lt;/strong&gt; Bueno’s trying to say the new janitor’s the goddamn breeder!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LANTERMAN:&lt;/strong&gt; Shit, man, but that’s like...he’d have to have shrunk, bro! Is that even possible??? Shit, man, what if he got his hands on one of Tremayne’s shrinking potions?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RUDY:&lt;/strong&gt; Someone should buy Mary one of those!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone, in unison, shouted “zing!”, because, well, it was Rudy. After zinging, though, Smokey had a lingering question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SMOKEY:&lt;/strong&gt; What do you mean, man?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RUDY:&lt;/strong&gt; Well...she should get a shrinking potion...to...if you’re following me here, hoss, make herself thin again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SMOKEY:&lt;/strong&gt; What do you mean &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUENO:&lt;/strong&gt; Are you blind, holmes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SMOKEY:&lt;/strong&gt; Huh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOEY:&lt;/strong&gt; Mary got big into comfort eating, and now she like, weighs as much as Sixtus, man. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SMOKEY:&lt;/strong&gt; Really?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOEY:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SMOKEY:&lt;/strong&gt; I mean...I guess I haven’t seen her in ages, man. I had no idea. Shit, sometimes things just work out weird. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In actuality, Smokey had seen Mary several times in recent months, and actually even talked to her in passing once, it was just that he didn’t recognise her at all with her new winter padding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SMOKEY:&lt;/strong&gt; What was she eating, Joe? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOEY:&lt;/strong&gt; How should I know, man?...McDonalds or something, I think she like, y’know, stuffs herself with that every day, man. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few seconds after saying this, a realisation simultaneously dawned on Joey and the other Jets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOEY:&lt;/strong&gt; McDonalds, man!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LANTERMAN:&lt;/strong&gt; She’s fat as fuck, bro! She must have gallons of breeder juice in her by now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOEY:&lt;/strong&gt; So what, you think we should like.. Pump her stomach or something?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LANTERMAN:&lt;/strong&gt; Nah, man, that’s just ridiculous. It’s the sauce, man, we need that fucking sauce. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SMOKEY:&lt;/strong&gt; When I was snooping around the back room of that McDonald’s before they threw me out I coulda sworn I saw some of the Breeder’s cum pipelines. I mean, they looked like regular pipes like you’d expect to see back there except these ones were fuckin’ encrusted with something white, and I’m telling you it wasn’t ranch dressing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOEY:&lt;/strong&gt; We gotta check those pipes out, bros. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SMOKEY:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m right there with you, man, I haven’t been able to shake that shit from my head since I saw it. I’ve been dying to get back there again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LANTERMAN:&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe we should try and be a bit stealthier this time though, like with balaclavas and shit. Maybe even grappling hooks, who knows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOEY:&lt;/strong&gt; Man, I like the idea and all but why would we need grappling hooks for a one-story building? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUENO:&lt;/strong&gt; What if we bust in with our gats out, hombre?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOEY:&lt;/strong&gt; That’d just get us arrested, brother. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RUDY:&lt;/strong&gt; You guys could honestly just get a uniform and walk in. McDonalds has a higher turnover rate than the subs here since they got rid of Mr. Long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mr. Long in question was one Jerry Long, a local man whose occupation was best described as professional substitute teacher in the sense that he was Principal Brownman’s go-to sub whenever one of his staff members fell ill (these days it was almost always the plague). No one at the school was quite sure where Mr. Long came from, what he did before subbing for classes, or even who first hired him but it certainly wasn’t Malik Brownman or any of the living former principals of St. Paul’s. What they were sure of, though, was that he gave everyone a serious case of the uncomfies whenever he came in to sub. This was largely because of things that Jerry had no real control over such as his age, his unsettlingly quiet, raspy voice, and his oddly-shaped and groomed eyebrows, which sat on his forehead like two caterpillars. Some of it, however, could be attributed to his own doings. For instance, Long had a habit of being caught staring at some of his female pupils and, because he was, as we mentioned before, Malik Brownman’s go-to sub, would often go up to said female pupils and inquire as to whether he’d “had” them (in class) before (nyeahhh), resulting in uncomfortably drawn-out conversations with them about their post-high school plans and whether they “liked boys” yet. Needless to say, Jerry had developed something of a reputation around St. Paul’s and indeed the wider Darkplace area as an innocently creepy old man at best and a full-blown diddler at worst, and consequently was the subject of numerous complaints by his unwilling female conversation partners and their parents. Jerry’s ways could have feasibly been overlooked by school administration, were it not for the advent of something real wacky. That something was none other than Dr. Alfonso Gomez, the aptly-named “Doctor of Pain and Shame” who terrorised Darkplace and surrounding communities some years ago. The unparalleled child-lusting of Gomez, which affected countless lives and set a high score which not even the Night Stalker looked set to equal, caused the town to enter into a great panic and the school, not wishing to look complicit in Long’s suspected wrongdoings, decided to get ahead of the scandal and fired him, or rather, quit calling him whenever a substitute teacher was needed. Jerry, however, would have the last laugh, as only a week after his sacking, the entire teaching staff would go on strike and the school, now without their main substitute, would be forced to close down for a week. To this day, there is still debate over whether Long, who hasn’t been seen since his firing, was guilty of the things he was accused of. Personally, we think he raped a pile of underaged girls, but we’ll leave it up to the reader to reach their own conclusions. Oh, and he probably tickled them with his eyebrows - but this isn’t Longplace, so who cares?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SMOKEY:&lt;/strong&gt; Good idea, man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wilmington House&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some people in Darkplace were concerned about the arrival of the Night Stalker, and others about the potential return of Bruce Hurley and/or Aquarius Jackson, and a few more about the calamitous press-conference last night that had seen Earl Winston make his presence felt, while Rees-Moggs Jacob and Tommy were most alarmed by the arrival of the First Ambighter, Jeremy Corbyn, and Morrissey, the Overlord of all Anglishmen. The Conservative candidate in the Grant by-election was standing in front of his desk, while his campaign coordinator, manager, door-to-door vote suggester, and entire electoral machine was standing in front of him. To be be clear, those are all the same person, and that person was his brother. In the corner of the room was a television screen, which had been wheeled in by Sixtus, who was taking the day off school thanks to a so-called “stummy hort”. The two Moggs were deep in conversation about the Overlord’s arrival and how to best deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MOGG:&lt;/strong&gt; - I tell you, this is the only way, brother!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOMMY:&lt;/strong&gt; No! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MOGG:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes! The only way to counteract the arrival of that vegetable fascist and defeat Pete is to gain outside support, brother! We must contact Samuel of the Tribe, and regain their patronage!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jacob walked over to the television screen - in actuality a cleverly disguised Audiovisual Israelite Transmitter - and started to hook it up to the electricity socket and try to set the antenna up right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOMMY:&lt;/strong&gt; There has to be another way, Brother Jake! Is winning the election that important??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MOGG:&lt;/strong&gt; Thomas! I expected better of you. You of all people should know how important it is that we defeat this Anglishism once and for all! The House of Commons needs a strong Tory voice once again, or things are going to go from bad to worse in this nation! Why, they don’t even speak English anymore!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mogg flicked the switch, allowing the grainy AVIT to flicker to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MOGG:&lt;/strong&gt; And with Morrissey and that communist Corbyn here in Darkplace, we have great need of the Tribe’s aid. It’s the only way forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samuel’s bearded face soon appeared on the screen. From the sounds in the background, it appeared that the master of tribal propaganda was currently on the set of another one of his blockbuster films.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAMUEL:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve told you a thousand times, Justin, just let the Arabs fuck your froy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Elder narrowed his eyes, taking stock of the people standing on the other end of what was probably his phone’s screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAMUEL:&lt;/strong&gt; Oy gevalt, Jacob, I thought you were someone else. What do you want with me, goy? You fell from our favour months ago!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MOGG:&lt;/strong&gt; I understand that, Lord Samuel, but I speak to you now with hopes of rekindling the strong alliance I once knew with your most esteemed council of elders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAMUEL:&lt;/strong&gt; Alliance? No, Jacob, you were our shabbos goy, and a lousy one at that! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MOGG:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh Lord Samuel, I have been such a foolish goy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mogg fell to his knees in front of the TV, striking a begging pose. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MOGG:&lt;/strong&gt; Lord Samuel, you must know that I never meant to harbour that awful Tremayne in my business! He duplicitously lured me into thinking he was just some harmless, though ultimately homosexual fashionista! Oh, my Tribal overlord, I have been foolish, and now the Folkish Band stand poised to seize my constituency! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAMUEL:&lt;/strong&gt; Quit your kvetching, goy! You opened yourself up to this when you let we Heebs down! Do it yourself, gentile!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MOGG:&lt;/strong&gt; But, master, Morrissey and Corbyn have come to stand against me! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAMUEL:&lt;/strong&gt; Why didn’t you open with that, Jakey? That changes things. An opportunity to show up that pair of mashuganas comes up once in a blue moon. You will have our backing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MOGG:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, glorious!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAMUEL:&lt;/strong&gt; But be warned, Jacob. The price will be steep...very steep indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Samuel closed the connection, the Moggs were left contemplating just how steep he meant. Like, countryside steep (£5 for a pint) or city steep (£12 for a pint)? We can’t say. &lt;/p&gt;

,companies,"**WARNING THIS TOPIC MAY BE CONTROVERSIAL**

I have noticed in recent years that there are a lot of companies pushing towards censorship when they disagree with your opinion, what you have done, etc.

Here is a list of the companies that come to mind when I say this:

* [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/) \(now owned by amazon\)\- New Terms of Service make it so that Twitch can ban you from their platform for saying something ""offensive"" but they give no specific details other than ""it can't be offensive."" In this day and age, everyone takes things offensively no matter on what side of an argument they might be. In this case it seems like Twitch is purposefully making their terms vague so that they can pick and choose who they want to ban on a case by case basis. In addition, they have instituted a policy that, if you violate their terms of service, even if it is off platform \(talking shit on Twitter, YouTube, etc\) they reserve the right to ban you. Saying this is out of their jurisdiction would be a valid point
* [YouTube](https://youtube.com/) \- We all know the shit show that has been going on at YouTube has been good for nobody. Mainstream media quite often paints YouTube as a racist platform, saying that there are advertisements on videos with hate speech, terrorism, etc. What they do not understand is how YouTube's algorithm works. It is humanly impossible to have someone sit there and go through the millions of hours of content posted to the platform on a daily basis. YouTube relies on AI to do the heavy lifting. That being said, YouTube is not without fault. They have instituted a terms of service change almost once a month, and continue to change the TOS in ways that people do not understand. The advertisement issue on YouTube has slowly been on the up and up, but creators are still struggling with trying to get their content monetized. YouTube does not give a specific set of rules for creators to follow, and gives a very vague explanation of what should and should not be done.
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) \- Twitter has always been a place of political debate, but the company does go out of its way to silence opinions they disagree with. They will find any reason to ban an account they don't agree with, while letting others that are doing the same level or worse things on the other side of the spectrum go free with no discipline. I'm not going to name specific cases but if you do some research you will find many examples of Twitter slamming down any right wing opinion that is unpopular down, and banning that user from Twitter, while letting left wing accounts promoting hate speech against other groups of people go by the wayside.
* [Spotify](https://spotify.com/) \- In recent news we are seeing Spotify remove artists from recommended playlists and even have been talking about removing certain artists entirely from the site, if they have violated a new TOS they have put into place that states if they have committed any type of crime, sexual violence, etc. that Spotify doesn't agree with, they reserve the right to remove you from recommended playlists and entirely from the site.

Now assuming you read all that, you can see a common theme here. There is a major push from companies, especially online, to institute terms of service agreements that are intentionally vague so that these companies can play the hand of God in terms of what they like and don't like on their websites. While this is fine in and of itself, and as a company they have the right to do this, that doesn't make it morally correct by any means. Just because you don't agree with an opinion doesn't mean you should censor it, especially on content creation sites like YouTube, and social networks like Twitter.

Also don't talk about boycotting these sites because they have an oligopoly and there is basically no competition to any of these sites that has better features and the same level of content as them, making it impossible to boycott them if you use them as your main source of entertainment or consumption.

It is humanly impossible to have someone sit there and go through the millions of hours of content posted to the platform on a daily basis. YouTube relies on AI to do the heavy lifting. That being said, YouTube is not without fault. They have instituted a terms of service change almost once a month, and continue to change the TOS in ways that people do not understand. The advertisement issue on YouTube has slowly been on the up and up, but creators are still struggling with trying to get their content monetized. YouTube does not give a specific set of rules for creators to follow, and gives a very vague explanation of what should and should not be done. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://Twitter.com""&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; - Twitter has always been a place of political debate, but the company does go out of its way to silence opinions they disagree with. They will find any reason to ban an account they don&amp;#39;t agree with, while letting others that are doing the same level or worse things on the other side of the spectrum go free with no discipline. I&amp;#39;m not going to name specific cases but if you do some research you will find many examples of Twitter slamming down any right wing opinion that is unpopular down, and banning that user from Twitter, while letting left wing accounts promoting hate speech against other groups of people go by the wayside. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://Spotify.com""&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; - In recent news we are seeing Spotify remove artists from recommended playlists and even have been talking about removing certain artists entirely from the site, if they have violated a new TOS they have put into place that states if they have committed any type of crime, sexual violence, etc. that Spotify doesn&amp;#39;t agree with, they reserve the right to remove you from recommended playlists and entirely from the site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now assuming you read all that, you can see a common theme here. There is a major push from companies, especially online, to institute terms of service agreements that are intentionally vague so that these companies can play the hand of God in terms of what they like and don&amp;#39;t like on their websites. While this is fine in and of itself, and as a company they have the right to do this, that doesn&amp;#39;t make it morally correct by any means. Just because you don&amp;#39;t agree with an opinion doesn&amp;#39;t mean you should censor it, especially on content creation sites like YouTube, and social networks like Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also don&amp;#39;t talk about boycotting these sites because they have an oligopoly and there is basically no competition to any of these sites that has better features and the same level of content as them, making it impossible to boycott them if you use them as your main source of entertainment or consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incoming debates in the comments but honestly I think we can all agree that free speech is a beautiful thing and we should do everything we can to preserve it, especially in a digital age such as this, where sites like these are becoming the main mode of communication and content consumption by a lot of people. &lt;/p&gt;

**Spire of the Maintenance Screen**

Your next raiding perks that function similarly to the appropriate team for investigation are going to reset when fully completed.  If you think you're appropriate, you can follow us through the community podcast. The next one is coming months ahead of a player's feedback about this year. We have a finite number of people on the roadmap. Take a look at our table. This is not the only activity going live until the novelty wears off. 

Now that we've gotten closer to releasing players who can't loot for the timeline, you can still melt them from feeling perfect. Both have plenty of room for maintenance. We have dug into this and found that somewhere along the next update to land notes, you have explored the mysteries of feedback. 

&gt;

**Not Bungie Versus You**

Next week, we are firing up the brick moments again. You'll have another pain point to talk about that we want to take advantage of. This won't be a challenge card or a bungie fireteam,  but we are putting together an exclusive twitter to make sure you put the new stuff in the description. 

We've been challenged in the ways of feedback. See you next month for the stars you can kill. We know you think you're anything specific, but no, you can still melt. As always, well be the last exotic tease from the gathering. This is not replacing any activity because the body goes flying too far through the summer. 

Power on the blog whenever their work is ongoing. Each terrible villain that players preferred equally is scheduled to talk about the next big desire from the kitchen. 

Here are the teams that we have decided to push victories for.

&gt;Team Bungie Shed 

1. Dmg04 repetition 

2. Cozmo has become obvious physics 

3. Drang Lights 4 grenades

4. Power Levels dropping like loot 

&gt;Team Josh

1. Josh Hamrick 

2. Josh Dogs

3. Josh Gameplay

4. Josh Speeds

&gt;Team Should Score 

1. Jon Playlist 

2. Jon Weisnewski 

3. Jon Limit 

4. ??? What

This was a poor mobile calendar reminder. The next items on our agenda for the timeline are currently looking back at the same rules. If you missed some context, please watch our most important meta modes and High Altitude Bonus Glory. Valor is a new step we're going into this year. In the future, we are never done iterating masterwork armor. Gameplay experience for players when they take on your device is too much playtime. We have a very rare and powerful sampling of April to earn. 

Have fun in our rearview mirror. We'll be back soon to get your hands.

**Enhanced Capitulation Techniques**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**There will be, [at most, 50 Republican votes](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/09/politics/whip-list-senators-gina-haspel-cia-director/index.html?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) for Gina Haspel, President Trump’s designated CIA director,** and a key player in the Bush administration torture program.     
                         
**In a statement Wednesday, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) [called on the Senate](https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;ID=9BF25289-D798-47B9-A30D-9494C6022EF8) to reject her nomination.** “Ms. Haspel’s role in overseeing the use of torture by Americans is disturbing,"" he said. ""Her refusal to acknowledge torture’s immorality is disqualifying.” H/T to [Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA)](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6j6wte?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) for asking a hard question with an easy answer.                                          
                   
**On Thursday, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) [wrote to Attorney General Jeff Sessions](https://www.flake.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/0c1dec01-7197-4e73-abc7-8dc104a7f27e/05.10.2018-letter-to-ag-sessions.pdf?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) urging him to give senators unfettered access to a Justice Department report** on the CIA’s destruction of torture videotapes, and Haspel’s role in it.                                             
           
**This nomination is only a lock if every Republican other than McCain—including Flake—ultimately falls into line.** If they don’t, then Haspel can only be confirmed with Democratic votes. So far only one Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin (WV), has announced he supports Haspel’s confirmation, but his vote would be decisive if all Republicans other than McCain and Flake rally behind her. Most Trump cabinet nominees have racked up a few Democratic votes, but those votes have always been surplus. It’ll be an enormous failure and a lasting stain if Democrats are given the opportunity to sink a torturer’s nomination but fail to do so.

**On Tuesday, a white Yale graduate student [called the police on a black Yale graduate student](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/09/us/yale-student-napping-black-trnd/index.html?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)** she found napping in a common room in the school’s Hall of Graduate studies. When campus police showed up to interrogate her, she identified herself as Lolade Siyonbola and began streaming the incident on Facebook Live. The officers questioned her for nearly 20 minutes, even after she proved she lived in the building.                                  
                
**A [Yale official said](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/387121-yale-reviewing-response-to-white-student-calling-police-on?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) the university will be “reviewing the call and the response** of the police officers to ensure that the proper protocol was followed and to determine if there was anything we could have done better.” We imagine this won't be hard.                
                        
**One month after the April arrests of Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson in a [Philadelphia Starbucks drew nationwide attention](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/04/19/603917872/they-can-t-be-here-for-us-men-arrested-at-philadelphia-starbucks-speak-out?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),** a very similar story is capturing the country’s imagination, but for many people of color in this country, racial bias is a daily, not monthly problem.

Do I appear angry? Am I walking in front of white people rather than behind them in the street? Do I have cash on me to buy something before I ask the cashier can I use the bathroom?... These are the respectability politics of how black people are often forced to conduct themselves in society. It's not by choice, but by obligation. It could in many ways be the difference between being free or imprisonment, of staying alive or facing death.”                                      
                  
**Lyin' Devin**

They did. They did that. I didn’t."" (The subpoena he sent to the Justice Department literally requested “all documents referring or related to the individual referenced in Chairman Nunes’ April 24, 2018 classified letter to Attorney General Sessions.”) Devin Nunes is bad at lying.                                                 
            
**Though Nunes and DOJ reached an accommodation that allowed him to view documents in a secure setting,** the intelligence community believes Nunes is pushing for these documents from the Mueller investigation so that he can give them to Trump. (No shit!) Having overseen the complete breakdown of trust between intelligence agencies and the intelligence committee, House Speaker Paul Ryan [gave Nunes the green light](https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/994605930959572994) to continue the coverup. Gross!           
                 
**Also, [Vice President Mike Pence](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/10/politics/mike-pence-robert-mueller-investigation/index.html?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) ""would very respectfully encourage the special counsel and his team to bring their work to completion.""** Pence added, ""In the interest of the country, I think it's time to wrap it up."" Earlier this month, Pence also called [Sheriff Joe Arpaio](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-champion-of-the-rule-of-law-pence-praises-pardoned-arizona-sheriff-joe-arpaio/2018/05/02/b8ae812c-4e0d-11e8-84a0-458a1aa9ac0a_story.html?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), whom Trump pardoned for criminal contempt of court, a champion of the rule of law.

Trump will meet with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un [in Singapore on June 12](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/994587349718847489).

Very subtle. Thirty million dollars is only a tiny fraction of the enormous tax cut Ryan gave Adelson. Purchasing Paul Ryan is just good business.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Capitulation Techniques&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There will be, &lt;a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/09/politics/whip-list-senators-gina-haspel-cia-director/index.html?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84""&gt;at most, 50 Republican votes&lt;/a&gt; for Gina Haspel, President Trump’s designated CIA director,&lt;/strong&gt; and a key player in the Bush administration torture program.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a statement Wednesday, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) &lt;a href=""https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;amp;ID=9BF25289-D798-47B9-A30D-9494C6022EF8""&gt;called on the Senate&lt;/a&gt; to reject her nomination.&lt;/strong&gt; “Ms. Haspel’s role in overseeing the use of torture by Americans is disturbing,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Her refusal to acknowledge torture’s immorality is disqualifying.” H/T to &lt;a href=""http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6j6wte?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84""&gt;Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA)&lt;/a&gt; for asking a hard question with an easy answer.                                          &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Thursday, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) &lt;a href=""https://www.flake.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/0c1dec01-7197-4e73-abc7-8dc104a7f27e/05.10.2018-letter-to-ag-sessions.pdf?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84""&gt;wrote to Attorney General Jeff Sessions&lt;/a&gt; urging him to give senators unfettered access to a Justice Department report&lt;/strong&gt; on the CIA’s destruction of torture videotapes, and Haspel’s role in it.                                             &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This nomination is only a lock if every Republican other than McCain—including Flake—ultimately falls into line.&lt;/strong&gt; If they don’t, then Haspel can only be confirmed with Democratic votes. So far only one Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin (WV), has announced he supports Haspel’s confirmation, but his vote would be decisive if all Republicans other than McCain and Flake rally behind her. Most Trump cabinet nominees have racked up a few Democratic votes, but those votes have always been surplus. It’ll be an enormous failure and a lasting stain if Democrats are given the opportunity to sink a torturer’s nomination but fail to do so.                                    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Living Life While Black&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Tuesday, a white Yale graduate student &lt;a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/09/us/yale-student-napping-black-trnd/index.html?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84""&gt;called the police on a black Yale graduate student&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; she found napping in a common room in the school’s Hall of Graduate studies. When campus police showed up to interrogate her, she identified herself as Lolade Siyonbola and began streaming the incident on Facebook Live. The officers questioned her for nearly 20 minutes, even after she proved she lived in the building.                                  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A &lt;a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/387121-yale-reviewing-response-to-white-student-calling-police-on?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84""&gt;Yale official said&lt;/a&gt; the university will be “reviewing the call and the response&lt;/strong&gt; of the police officers to ensure that the proper protocol was followed and to determine if there was anything we could have done better.” We imagine this won&amp;#39;t be hard.                &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One month after the April arrests of Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson in a &lt;a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/04/19/603917872/they-can-t-be-here-for-us-men-arrested-at-philadelphia-starbucks-speak-out?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84""&gt;Philadelphia Starbucks drew nationwide attention&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; a very similar story is capturing the country’s imagination, but for many people of color in this country, racial bias is a daily, not monthly problem.                           &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In between these two incidents,&lt;/strong&gt; people have harassed or called the police on innocent black men and women for:                                &lt;/p&gt;

From &lt;a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/10/opinions/while-black-at-yale-and-starbucks-owens-opinion/index.html?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84""&gt;Ernest Owens&lt;/a&gt;: “As a young black gay man, these are the daily questions I ask myself internally as I walk in public: Are my hands visible? Do I appear angry? Am I walking in front of white people rather than behind them in the street? Do I have cash on me to buy something before I ask the cashier can I use the bathroom?... These are the respectability politics of how black people are often forced to conduct themselves in society. It&amp;#39;s not by choice, but by obligation. It could in many ways be the difference between being free or imprisonment, of staying alive or facing death.”                                      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lyin&amp;#39; Devin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;House Intelligence Committee chairman/midnight avenger Devin Nunes (R-CA) &lt;a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/risk-to-intelligence-source-who-aided-russia-investigation-at-center-of-latest-showdown-between-nunes-and-justice-dept/2018/05/08/d6fb66f8-5223-11e8-abd8-265bd07a9859_story.html?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84""&gt;tried to force the Justice Department to out a CIA and FBI informant&lt;/a&gt; working with Special Counsel Robert Mueller&lt;/strong&gt; (placing lives at risk) to help Trump cover up whatever he&amp;#39;s covering up.                                             &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When &lt;a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nunes-subpoena-to-justice-dept-requested-all-documents-about-individual-described-as-longtime-intelligence-source/2018/05/09/93fbc154-53c2-11e8-9c91-7dab596e8252_story.html?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;amp;utm_term=.1945e1fc4193""&gt;confronted about this&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, Nunes, referring to the Justice Department said,&lt;/strong&gt; “I’ve never referenced an individual. They did. They did that. I didn’t.&amp;quot; (The subpoena he sent to the Justice Department literally requested “all documents referring or related to the individual referenced in Chairman Nunes’ April 24, 2018 classified letter to Attorney General Sessions.”) Devin Nunes is bad at lying.                                                 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Though Nunes and DOJ reached an accommodation that allowed him to view documents in a secure setting,&lt;/strong&gt; the intelligence community believes Nunes is pushing for these documents from the Mueller investigation so that he can give them to Trump. (No shit!) Having overseen the complete breakdown of trust between intelligence agencies and the intelligence committee, House Speaker Paul Ryan &lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/994605930959572994""&gt;gave Nunes the green light&lt;/a&gt; to continue the coverup. Gross!           &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also, &lt;a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/10/politics/mike-pence-robert-mueller-investigation/index.html?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84""&gt;Vice President Mike Pence&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;would very respectfully encourage the special counsel and his team to bring their work to completion.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; Pence added, &amp;quot;In the interest of the country, I think it&amp;#39;s time to wrap it up.&amp;quot; Earlier this month, Pence also called &lt;a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-champion-of-the-rule-of-law-pence-praises-pardoned-arizona-sheriff-joe-arpaio/2018/05/02/b8ae812c-4e0d-11e8-84a0-458a1aa9ac0a_story.html?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84""&gt;Sheriff Joe Arpaio&lt;/a&gt;, whom Trump pardoned for criminal contempt of court, a champion of the rule of law. It’s hard to come up with jokes about Mike Pence because he is just so awful. You’re awful Mike Pence!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Else&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

Trump will meet with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un &lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/994587349718847489""&gt;in Singapore on June 12&lt;/a&gt;.

Assuming all Democrats ultimately join them, they’re only &lt;a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/ryan-aims-to-quash-gop-led-rebellion-trying-to-force-votes-on-immigration/2018/05/10/b2c6b42c-5471-11e8-a551-5b648abe29ef_story.html?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;amp;utm_term=.7f56339eb524""&gt;seven GOP signatures&lt;/a&gt; away from their goal.                             &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&amp;#39;ve Gotta Be Fucking Kidding Me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson &lt;a href=""https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/10/adelson-republicans-midterms-579436?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84""&gt;donated $30 million&lt;/a&gt; to the Republican-aligned Congressional Leadership Fund, in order to help Republicans keep the House in November.&lt;/strong&gt; Paul Ryan met with the billionaire ahead of the donation, but left the room so someone else could technically solicit it, because as a federally elected official, he isn’t permitted to solicit a political donation of that size by law. Very subtle. Thirty million dollars is only a tiny fraction of the enormous tax cut Ryan gave Adelson. Purchasing Paul Ryan is just good business.                                       &lt;/p&gt;

,appdev,"I'm just some artist derp who drew a lot of dicks as you'll see in my history. Not anything close to someone who could call themselves a coder. However, recently I've grown bored of listening to the same old music. Don't we all?

I had an idea and I was wondering how many of you could poke holes in this.

What if there was a music platform with the soul purpose of introducing you to new music with the push of a button?

Now you wouldn't want it to just spew out random who the fuck knows what, would you? Maybe some of you would. I'm not here to judge.

So, let's imagine a world in which this app builds playlists by your friends' suggestions. Your ""friends list"", for a user friendly interface, would be built automatically from the integration of Facebook friends and Google. Plenty of apps do that nowadays, right?

But where would the music come from? Again. Not a coder. However, I imagine there could be a way to pull just audio play from YouTube. The magical land where anyone can upload a video and there are countless lost treasures of old songs. Not always the best quality, but they exist and can be created.

Now on to how the app would be presented to function.

Each user has a very simple interface of two music lists that they get to fill themselves. ""Top Ten"" and ""Six Underground"".

""Top Ten"" would have ten slots for the user to fill with ten songs that have been a hit single at any time. Rap, rock, 90's, whatever.

""Six Underground"", obvious by now, would have six slots for the user to fill with underground, self label artists, that hardly anyone knows about.

When a user opens the app they can choose to listen to Top Ten over Six Underground,(or the other way around) and the app would generate a playlist based on the songs from their friends' Top Ten lists. No videos, just audio.

Name for the app? 10/6, pronounced Ten Over Six. Logo? The card from the Mad Hatter's hat.

Yeah.. That was a long shower thought. Anyways. I don't code. I don't build apps. I don't even know if this shit is practical. So, I'm dumping it here.

Enjoy. My first post without a dick.

,HaloOnline,"About a week ago I [made a rather controversial post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaloOnline/comments/8gcbp9/the_future_of_halo_online_and_microsoft/) regarding my thoughts at the time. Though I didn't get the exact response I was hoping for I am glad I was able to bring the community together and gather the many different opinions people had, and since I've boasted a multitude of times about how we should be trying our best to grow/sustain the community I feel it would be a good idea to get some more conversations going; though this time I'm going to avoid anything *too* controversial. Its all positive vibes from here on out.

I'm going to throw out a few talking points I'd like to hear opinions on, but don't be afraid to start your own discussions.

- The large player drop:-
Before I get called out, I know I said I wasn't going to get too controversial on y'all, but its a good talking point since there's an interesting point I'd like to make on this subject.

Only recently have I noticed how.. 'Diverse' the Halo Online playerbase is. In the sense that there are so many activities within the game itself it creates a divide between the players, for example:
*These are approximations*
On average, 50% of players play customs. 30% play social. 10% play ranked and 10% play forge mode.

This is good and bad, mostly bad since we're sitting at on average 500-700 players. I'm more interested in what happened to the mass majority. Of course people are going to fall off and get bored, that is to be expected, but to go from 4000-7000 to 500-600 is quite insane since its been only a few weeks.

- The meh-tier custom map playlists:-
*Crap, this is really turning out to be a bunch of complaining.*
Maybe its the nostalgia effect making the good old days of Halo 3 customs seem super fun, but from my experience so far a lot of the custom map playlists are full of junk to fill space.

This is understandable since we lost our biggest map hosting website a while back, and hell maybe I'm just being a spoil sport and everyone else is enjoying their customs experience (I mean don't get me wrong, I'm enjoying it too) but if I'm not the only one feeling this way, I'm interested in what custom players want to see in their playlists, and what they don't want to see.

To throw my own input into this, I really miss the garbage man maps. Where you're all put inside this box and the infected pushes in objects to try and splatter you, that shit was so fun and I've not seen it anywhere!

- A lack of Halo 3's Community Files:-
[Prepare yourself for a nostalgia trip](https://halo.bungie.net/online/communityfiles.aspx)
Simply put, we NEED something like this!

- Halo Online limbo:-
At this point I feel like we've come and gone. People have made their videos, memed that Microsoft has come to kill us, and now we're just here twiddling our thumbs.

Before development got 'halted' we had a lot of contact from the dev team, both through reddit and in-game. It was never uncommon for me to speak to multiple staff that were just enjoying the game and excited about the direction they were taking. (Ranked rewards, new cosmetics) Though since that day I've not ran into anyone, I've only heard small things from other people in the community about what may be happening, but that has to be taken with a pinch of salt.
Even if there have been no new developments, it'd be nice to have an official post in regards to what is going on.

*On reflection, it seems there wasn't as many good vibes as I hoped, oops. But hell, I'm sure there will be nothing but good vibes in the comments, right?*

,destiny2,"**HEROIC MODIFIERS: Solar Burn, More Heavy Ammo Drops, Instant-Death Melee Hits from Enemies**

For those who end up in this strike, this can be one of the most annoying ones but also one of the easiest.

This is because of the heroic modifier Blackout - it's like Chaff (no radar), and Lightswitch (if the melee damage from Lightswitch was changed from 'high' to *'oops, you got hit, ya dead'*).

The entire map is littered with wall/floor Taken rifts that push you - and these count as melee damage as well (meaning instant death).

The boss also has a 'push attack' as its main go-to ability, which is also instant death.

Likewise, there's a bug where if the a player is already in the boss' area, a newcomer in the strike would spawn in the area before that, then his screen goes dark, again and again and again - *stuck in an infinite loop*. Even if the players at the boss' area die, the newcomer would still be stuck in the loop and the wipe screen/restart wouldn't occur.

--------------

**Bug workaround**

If you're a newcomer who got stuck that way, simply equip a rocket launcher and blow yourself up. Or kill yourself with a solar grenade if possible.

You should spawn at the boss' area (careful that there's another instant-death Taken rift at your spawn point).

If you're at the boss' area and notice a newcomer got stuck - just message them to suicide. If they cannot, they'll have to log out their character.

------------

**Easy boss kill**

Because Solar burn is active, make sure everyone's using a solar subclass. The best of course would be Gunslinger with Nighthawk plus Sunbreaker (careful when meleeing the boss as his can stomp and one-shot you, that counts for Blackout as well).

Just make sure everyone has their supers ready, pop them when the boss spawns and nuke him + rockets.

When the boss dies within 5 seconds or so, just avoid the adds until they despawn a few seconds later.

---------------

**WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER STRIKES???**

All other strikes are manageable even with the modifiers. The only exception? Exodus Down (Thaviks). This one is really hard.

Getting there is NOT a problem, but the boss fight itself can be unbelievably annoying.

This is due to Thaviks disappearing every now and then; he uses a scorch cannon (remember, Solar burn), and that there are sneaky vandals spawning around that also quickly run up to melee you. I would generally avoid this strike.

,Battlefield,"This is not a leak, merely a deep speculation which I believe could be correct.

The earnings report and the very recent solving of the “room” easter egg *both* have strong statements of “never be the same”. This, combined with the earnings report information about “gaming as a service” indicate a game they want to last for a long time, possibly longer than 2 years. 

This made me skeptical of the next game, because I thought to myself, “how do they intend to draw WWII out into possibly *three to four years* of game?” Then I knew. They didn’t intend to do that at all. 

Battlefield has essentially been backed into the corner of going bigger and more expansive than the Great War, and yes, they could do it by just making “Battlefield V” a clone or BF1 but WWII because it was a bigger war and people would be alright with that occurring because it would be an incredible game in its own right. What about after that though? How could they really get any bigger than WWII? Korea and Vietnam are both smaller conflicts even when put together, which would be a gameplay stretch. A historical modern war game? Unlikely, since again there isn’t much material to work with that can alone top WWII, and with so many fictional modern war games it would just feel stale. 

So, how do all of these pieces fit together? Well, I did the math: 
WWII+Battlefield=great game. Historical Modern War+Battlefield&lt;/=Korea+Vietnam+Battlefield&lt;WWII+Battlefield=bad future of franchise beyond “Battlefield V”.

Solution: Battlefield V= WWII(2018)+Korean War(2020)+Vietnam War(2022)+Gulf Wars and War on Terror (2024)

If the math is too thick for you, they’ll release Battlefield V as the base for further war expansions which go beyond DLC over the course of many years, likely with extensive options for restricting historical accuracy or totally dropping it in server building and custom playlists. They’ll constantly remaster the original game and update it so it doesn’t fall behind industry standards, while possibly adding all the way up in 2026 a remaster/remake of BF1 to complete the historical timeline in the current Frostbite engine of 2026, losing no headway because they’ll have their service gaming fully established with all of their time periods being constantly updated and balanced. 

Alongside these releases, you’ll see the non-historical Battlefield games in alternate years: Bad Company 3 in 2019, Battlefield 2143 in 2021, perhaps a Battlefield Hardline: Prohibition if the world is ready by 2023. These would all be separate releases where they could test out less realistic ideas and focus more on telling new stories without the restrictions history brings. That said, they would also be bringing these games forward as well through time with constant updates, though likely with a bit less haste. You’d probably see Bad Company 1 and 2 remade/remastered at some point as expansions to Bad Company 3, and you’d see the same happen with Battlefield 2142 in relation to its successor. Hardline might not be included for a long time, having few fans, but it would probably get at least an update into the menu software family if not the graphics and engine updates to go with it. BF4 and BF3 would probably get that treatment as well, though there could be a decade anniversary remaster/remake of BF3 released in 2021 since it’s a fan favorite often lauded as the best in the series, pushing 2143 into 2023, which seems somewhat more appropriate. 

Some core features of this system would include a unified menu system in game similar to what we see now with the shoulder menu in the game UI at the main menu of BF1, BF:H, and BF4. Here at the Battlefield Hub you’ll probably be able to launch any of the games and manage your progress, customization, in game awards, etc. There would also probably be regular additions of new war stories to the games alongside the multiplayer content since they’re episodic in nature, and I wouldn’t be surprised if they introduced co-op war stories tailor made for more than one player. You would see Platoons become a central point of the social and competitive aspects of the game, likely bringing XP and cosmetic bonuses along with membership and depending on the age or experience of the platoon. I wouldn’t be surprised if the firing range made a return as the “Gun Club” which would be a public server type you could join and test fire your weapons from any of the supported games, show off your skills, gear, character, etc. not unlike the Headquarters in CoD: WWII. Perhaps there would even be Platoon Clubhouse servers purchasable and with the same purpose but for members only and more heavily customizable, tracking Platoon scores, rivalries, individual member scores, scheduling, trophies, etc. Naturally, Incursions would reach its maturity under this service based system, and there would be a parallel competitive scene linked into the rest of the social system, so expect to see Platoons have a competitive play aspect to them beyond the standard game.

Keep in mind, my speculation is all based on their own statements of gaming as a service being something they want to make Battlefield. I believe that they will *need* to implement many of these things if they want to give this service the longevity they would have to pull off to not be disappointing. This would all be heavily monetized and I cannot predict the manner it which it will be done, but I think some things would be purchasable like cosmetics and the personalized club servers I theorized, but standard game servers would still be rentals. I don’t believe they would have paid content beyond cosmetics and servers considering the Battlefront 2 debacle, and they have also seemingly shunned Premium. Transitioning to a service approach would allow them to make up their money over time in cosmetic purchases etc. while they release updates and DLC, possibly at a slower rate than we’re used to. I think it would be the best move they could make for the franchise and it could be crafted to be more consumer friendly than EA has a reputation for being. 

Again, this is in no way a leak, merely speculation.",,False,,0,False,DICE Has Ambitious Plans for the Next Battlefield (w/ some evidence),"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Other'}]",,False,6.0,other,0.0,,,False,t3_8ie06f,,dark,,,public,24.0,,{},,,False,[],,False,,,{},Other,,24,,,,self,False,,[],,,True,,1525978796.0,richtext,6.0,,,text,self.Battlefield,,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a leak, merely a deep speculation which I believe could be correct.&lt;/p&gt;

,DestinyTheGame,"So a little background on me and my time in Destiny - I am definitely not a hardcore player. While I did every raid in D1, I spent periods of time burnt out and just not playing. The longest period of this was TDB, I just hated the weapon level grind so much after pushing myself to cap in Vanilla D1 that I needed a break.

&amp;nbsp;

Similarly, I took a break for nearly all of CoO. D2 had become basically a treadmill of public events and strikes with very little to show for it - a lackluster raid that had wildly arbitrary differences in difficulty from encounter to encounter and still felt ""blah,"" and an ever-gouging cosmetic system. So I took a break, only returning a couple weeks ago to test the ""go fast"" update and wrap up this Osiris story I had paid for, which in turn felt like a limp follow up to an already lacking game. So then, another, shorter break, and now... Warmind.

&amp;nbsp;

This is probably the closest to D1 that D2 has felt so far, and I'm loving it. The story, though it felt rushed and short, carried a tone that felt like The Taken King, and the story encounters themselves were pretty dang difficult at points (to be fair, at one point I whiffed a ball past a crystal and it landed at an ogre's feet, so that's difficult in its own way). I naturally started finding those lost memory fragments on my own, just by virtue of ""hey, I've seen a few of these now and they seem color coded..."" and god damn, it was such a nice surprise to destroy one and see I found a collectible. It's nice getting my ass kicked by Escalation Protocol and it's nice to be far away from max light before the raid lair is released. While the new ranking systems aren't from D1, they feel really similar to the faction exotic grind, and Zavala's ship having the D1 starter model is more than enough carrot to get me to grind out a strike playlist a few nights a week.

&amp;nbsp;


What I feel is missing, though, is incentive to spend time on planets. I know we have bounties coming up, which is good, but I also miss having a reason to gather planetary materials. **That's right, the same thing I quit D1 over for a bit is what I miss in D2.** But really, I miss the last iteration of item upgrading, where I wasn't building up to light level, but perks. **The triple play of Bounties + Patrols + Material gathering gave meaningful and varied reasons to go to any given planet, daily, and that felt like a good use of my time.** 

&amp;nbsp;

I can only hope we get some similar level of motivation come the september update (or sooner), because I totally think Warmind was a step in the right direction.

While I did every raid in D1, I spent periods of time burnt out and just not playing. The longest period of this was TDB, I just hated the weapon level grind so much after pushing myself to cap in Vanilla D1 that I needed a break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I took a break for nearly all of CoO. D2 had become basically a treadmill of public events and strikes with very little to show for it - a lackluster raid that had wildly arbitrary differences in difficulty from encounter to encounter and still felt &amp;quot;blah,&amp;quot; and an ever-gouging cosmetic system. So I took a break, only returning a couple weeks ago to test the &amp;quot;go fast&amp;quot; update and wrap up this Osiris story I had paid for, which in turn felt like a limp follow up to an already lacking game. So then, another, shorter break, and now... Warmind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably the closest to D1 that D2 has felt so far, and I&amp;#39;m loving it.

,fakemon,"A while back, I began work on a Pokemon fangame. Not a ROM hack, but a game programmed from scratch, designed to take inspiration from Pokemon while addressing some of the main complaints adults have while playing (preventing grinding until you're overleveled and lose the challenge; having a more realistic and dark story; possibly built-in support for Nuzlocke-style rules; etc.).

I began development on Pokemon Gemini, which you can follow in this playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLbI7G4bgaA&amp;list=PLLO-ghHxUA5DGfegmcwwQI8YKrzW5L_nC

Unfortunately, life got in the way; I was hired for a second job, leaving no time for hobbies, and Gemini was pushed into indefinite suspension.

But that second job is over, and I have a little more time to get back into things! I can code just fine, and I can even find plenty of royalty-free music. The main component I'm lacking... is art.

So, who would like to help with the Fakemon battle sprites for Pokemon Gemini? They'd be Gen V style, probably without animation (unless we end up being overachievers? :D ), front and back. 32x32 or 64x64, with the back sprites only needing the top half, not the full body.

The region will be *very loosely* based on New Zealand, with some other non-region-related designs thrown in for plot and Fakemon reasons.

I can't afford to pay anyone, as I'm not getting paid for this, either (no, wait, don't leave! Please come back!), but I'm hoping that you share my love for Pokemon and would love to see your art in a full game designed to be the Pokemon game long-time fans want to play.

If you're interested, please message me or comment here. Thanks.

**Background Info (Optional Reading)**

Like I said, the design is *very loosely* based on New Zealand, with two main islands. Except in this story, one island is kept in poverty by the government, while the other island is rich and lavish. The only way for someone born on the poor island to move to the rich one is to prove themselves worthy, through gym battles and ultimately by defeating the Elite Four (they'll have a different title in this game, but I haven't settled on one yet).

The first half of the game is just that: gym battles and trying to become a new champion (a Gemini Great), so you can move your mother to the rich island where medical treatments are more available, to save her life. There will be whispers of government corruption, but as a child, you can't do anything about it.

The second half of the game is ""post-game"". After being champion for 8-10 years, you come to fully understand the corruption of the government, which includes using a legendary Pokemon's power to make political opponents literally disappear. By keeping people in poverty, the government has indirectly killed thousands, and so you join the resistance to try and fight back. Your goal is to find another legendary Pokemon who can bring back all the ""disappeared"" people, and defeat the one doing the disappearing. Without the ability to remove their dissenters, the government will be forced to give up control to a more balanced system, and you win.

In terms of mechanics, here are a couple of the differences between Gemini and other Pokemon games:

* Gym leaders (and maybe other important trainers?) will automatically level-up their team to match your team's average level, if you're higher than them. This prevents over-leveling and ensures there's always a challenge where there should be. (This can be explained in-universe by fancy temporary leveling tech or something; story to be ironed out later.)
* The champion is actually a pair of champions and a double battle, to encapsulate the Gemini duality theme that will run throughout the game and story.
* Because you can't over-level for gyms, there's a chance the game may be more open-world in the first half, letting you take on gyms in any order. Maybe. I haven't decided yet.
* These will be paired games, with the pair being Pokemon Castor and Pollux. But they will be designed to be playable alone, and as such, there must be a way to get both legends in the game. So here's the idea: depending on the game you're playing, you can only capture one of the two legends. But if you give that legend a Mysterious Orb item (obtained from side exploration) and level them up, the orb will disappear and you'll get an egg, containing a baby Pokemon. That baby evolves into one of the two legends depending on its gender, and it will always be the opposite gender of the Pokemon that ""hatched"" it, thus it will always evolve into the opposite legend from the one you caught, giving you access to both in single-player.
* Built-in settings to enforce various aspects of Nuzlockes separately: the ""1 catchable encounter per region"" rule, the ""fainted Pokemon are perma-boxed"" rule, the ""Pokemon must be nicknamed"" rule, and the ""white-out means game over"" rule. Each of these can be toggled separately, with them all off by default, of course.",,False,,0,False,Pokemon Gemini - Spriters Needed!,[],,False,,,0.0,,,False,t3_8huqm1,,dark,,,public,5.0,,{},,,False,[],,False,,,{},,,5,,,,self,False,,[],,,True,,1525791724.0,text,,,,text,self.fakemon,,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A while back, I began work on a Pokemon fangame.

,headphones,"[I finally did it.](https://imgur.com/a/xmsAmEF) I know the term end game is thrown around a lot but this is mine both due to these headphones and my limit on funds. I was expecting my DT 1990 Pro to have the upper hand in a lot of things, specifically separation, clarity and detail but I'm questioning whether they do at all. The 2C is a wonderful headphone. Maybe the most impressive feature is the size of the sound. Some music just sounds *so big* and roomy, likely from the massive abyss they call pads. It takes normally somewhat narrow pair of open backs and creates this rich soundscapes of sound that fills your head and immerses you into a new world. When you take that and combine it with the excellent imaging that's able to shift sounds in a more 3 dimensional space it's an incredibly unique and captivating experience. Out of all of the headphones I've tried nothing presents sound like these do and for that I'm in love.

---

**Bass**

Here we go, planar bass and Audeze rumble. There's really nothing to dislike, here. The bass is responsive, clean, detailed and deep. Even notes relatively high in frequency nearing mid bass and almost lower mids have this rumble not found on any of my other pairs. The bass itself is fairly neutral but with that said there's more of it than my DT 1990. In a quick comparison, the DT 1990 has a tighter, more textured bass response which I've praised it for and while the 2C doesn't quite have that it's a tough call which presentation I like more. 

**Mids**

Wow. The mids have this flow to them, they just kind of melt their way into your ears. According to all the FR graphs I've seen the mids aren't really pushed forward at all but they sound a bit emphasized to me. Maybe it's just the dips in the highs that brings the mids out more, especially being used to the DT 1990. Either way they're incredible. 


**Highs**

The highs of the 2C is something that concerned me greatly before purchase, between the dark sound and the talk of grain in these frequencies. I'm glad to say the darkness isn't *nearly* and pronounced as expected (I had no idea what to expect, though) and while I can hear the grain sometimes with cymbals I usually forget about it entirely. The way the 2C is tuned in the highs I actually really enjoy. The treble is still there and clear, certain frequencies are dropped though which gives the highs this softness and removes most if not all fatigue and sibilance. They don't really have the sparkle with some instruments and instrumental music but I think the 2C handles all genres pretty damn well. I have no issue using them as an all rounder and daily driver.

---

**Soundstage**

This is where things get kind of weird. It's *technically* more towards narrow and while that's immediately apparent in some songs, in others I could swear these are wider than my K7XX. There's this illusion of width and depth that occasionally masks the narrowness entirely. Now when I call them narrow, they're not very narrow but they do feel a bit more so compared to the DT 1990 which has a decent enough soundstage but nothing too impressive.

**Imaging**

Holy hell the imaging. With imaging I like to not only test songs but run some sounds and samples through a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) and adjust panning to see how accurate the headphone presents the sound across the stereo field. The imaging is stellar. There's a clearly defined value for every increment for even small percentages of panning from far left to far right. There's also the depth which seems mostly to extend in front of you but there's even some for up and down. If you think of normal imaging on a 2d plane from left to right -----, the 2C is more of a widened U shape \ __ / with a bit of a tail reaching behind that extends not only left to right but up and down. It's some weird shit and I love it. 

**Separation, Clarity and Detail**

I was actually really surprised to hear how well these headphones separate. You can very clearly hear everything in its own light but at the same time everything melts together and creates a wonderful cohesiveness to the sound, compared to say the DT 1990 where everything sounds as its own entity and doesn't quite blend together. The clarity was another surprise. Easily the clearest sound I've heard, nothing else I've tried really compares. Lastly there's detail, yet another thing about the 2C that impressed me. The detail in the highs isn't as apparent due to the darker sound but it's definitely still there. I've actually noticed new things in songs *still* even after owning the headphones I do and hearing the songs many many times before. 

**Build**

These headphones are built incredibly well. The built matches the price more than my other headphones, these *really* feel like $800 headphones. The metal is soft and well machined with no blemishes or rough edges, headband is sturdy and just well built and the pleather is soft. The only complaint I have here is the foam behind the outer grill isn't entirely flat and very marginally sticks out through the grill in some areas. Not a big deal but it's the only issue I can find :P. The ""BDSM"" braided/rope cable is also incredbile as are the 1/4"" and mini XLR connectors. This thing as a whole just screams quality. 

**Comfort**

Comfort is an interesting topic with the LCD line. The weight and clamp are a widely discussed issue, if you could call it that, and while both are something I notice I don't necessarily find them a problem. The weight gets to me after awhile but I'm quickly getting used to it. I'm up to a few hours of listening before I start feeling anything. I find it comforting, actually, a similar sensation to wrapping yourself in a heavy blanket, the 2C puts you into a tight and weighted embrace that I find cozy. I can easily see how the clamp and weight can be an issues for some people, though. 

---

**Conclusion**

If it wasn't for some controversial features of these headphones I'd recommend them to everyone. Instead I'll say if you get a chance, try them first. While I don't find them very dark, they might be too dark for your taste or could very well have too much clamp or be too heavy. If you don't think any of those would be an issue for you then I wholly recommend the 2C because it's just an incredible headphone. The way music blends together is like a soft steam of music slowly flowing into your head from more directions than you're used to.

It's a pair I'm proud to call my end game and these will be the last pair of $100+ headphones I'll be buying in years, both due to their excellence and limited funds. The 2C is a more than worthy sidegrade and even a competent upgrade to my DT 1990, couldn't be happier with my purchase.

On a last note I'll gladly answer any questions regarding the 2C or my other gear, I do my best to respond to all responses. I'll also be creating an EQ APO profile to emulate the frequency response using my K7XX (it handles EQ the best, will be tested on my DT 1990 as well) in the future though no amount of EQ or software emulation will let you experience the way these present sound as a whole.

*Disclaimer: I am in no way an expert and have fairly recently started getting into the more technical side of headphones and how they work. I do have a few years experience with analyzing/mixing/producing music, though, so while I'm new to headphones I'm somewhat experienced with sound and what it consists of as a whole.

I was expecting my DT 1990 Pro to have the upper hand in a lot of things, specifically separation, clarity and detail but I&amp;#39;m questioning whether they do at all. The 2C is a wonderful headphone. Maybe the most impressive feature is the size of the sound. Some music just sounds &lt;em&gt;so big&lt;/em&gt; and roomy, likely from the massive abyss they call pads. It takes normally somewhat narrow pair of open backs and creates this rich soundscapes of sound that fills your head and immerses you into a new world. When you take that and combine it with the excellent imaging that&amp;#39;s able to shift sounds in a more 3 dimensional space it&amp;#39;s an incredibly unique and captivating experience. Out of all of the headphones I&amp;#39;ve tried nothing presents sound like these do and for that I&amp;#39;m in love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bass&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we go, planar bass and Audeze rumble. There&amp;#39;s really nothing to dislike, here. The bass is responsive, clean, detailed and deep. Even notes relatively high in frequency nearing mid bass and almost lower mids have this rumble not found on any of my other pairs. The bass itself is fairly neutral but with that said there&amp;#39;s more of it than my DT 1990. In a quick comparison, the DT 1990 has a tighter, more textured bass response which I&amp;#39;ve praised it for and while the 2C doesn&amp;#39;t quite have that it&amp;#39;s a tough call which presentation I like more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow. The mids have this flow to them, they just kind of melt their way into your ears. According to all the FR graphs I&amp;#39;ve seen the mids aren&amp;#39;t really pushed forward at all but they sound a bit emphasized to me. Maybe it&amp;#39;s just the dips in the highs that brings the mids out more, especially being used to the DT 1990. Either way they&amp;#39;re incredible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highs of the 2C is something that concerned me greatly before purchase, between the dark sound and the talk of grain in these frequencies. I&amp;#39;m glad to say the darkness isn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;nearly&lt;/em&gt; and pronounced as expected (I had no idea what to expect, though) and while I can hear the grain sometimes with cymbals I usually forget about it entirely. The way the 2C is tuned in the highs I actually really enjoy. The treble is still there and clear, certain frequencies are dropped though which gives the highs this softness and removes most if not all fatigue and sibilance. They don&amp;#39;t really have the sparkle with some instruments and instrumental music but I think the 2C handles all genres pretty damn well. I have no issue using them as an all rounder and daily driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soundstage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where things get kind of weird. It&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; more towards narrow and while that&amp;#39;s immediately apparent in some songs, in others I could swear these are wider than my K7XX. There&amp;#39;s this illusion of width and depth that occasionally masks the narrowness entirely. Now when I call them narrow, they&amp;#39;re not very narrow but they do feel a bit more so compared to the DT 1990 which has a decent enough soundstage but nothing too impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imaging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy hell the imaging. With imaging I like to not only test songs but run some sounds and samples through a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) and adjust panning to see how accurate the headphone presents the sound across the stereo field. The imaging is stellar. There&amp;#39;s a clearly defined value for every increment for even small percentages of panning from far left to far right. There&amp;#39;s also the depth which seems mostly to extend in front of you but there&amp;#39;s even some for up and down. If you think of normal imaging on a 2d plane from left to right -----, the 2C is more of a widened U shape \ __ / with a bit of a tail reaching behind that extends not only left to right but up and down. It&amp;#39;s some weird shit and I love it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Separation, Clarity and Detail&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was actually really surprised to hear how well these headphones separate. You can very clearly hear everything in its own light but at the same time everything melts together and creates a wonderful cohesiveness to the sound, compared to say the DT 1990 where everything sounds as its own entity and doesn&amp;#39;t quite blend together.

I&amp;#39;ve actually noticed new things in songs &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; even after owning the headphones I do and hearing the songs many many times before. &lt;/p&gt;

Hot Fix and Weapon Tuning. Yesterday, we pushed out a hot fix and weapon tuning changes. Head to our [Reddit thread](https://redd.it/8gt3r5)for more details.

 

Weekly Weapon Contract. In case you missed it, this week’s Weapon Contract is for the [Gewehr 43](https://twitter.com/SHGames/status/991386732137299968) (which we also tuned this week, see above Hot Fix and Weapon Tuning section). Pick it up before 10AM PDT on Tuesday, May 8!

 

Game Update Next Week. On Tuesday, May 8, we’ll have a game update coming. We will post on Reddit once the update goes live, but there will not be our usual list of patch notes, since the update is only for image uploads on the UI front, upcoming Orders and Contracts, HQ map optimizations, Leaderboard filtering and Theater performance improvements, and promotional updates.

Please head to our [dedicated feedback thread on Reddit](https://redd.it/8gvvm2) to leave any info/videos/comments about your experiences with this issue so we can better monitor and determine whether or not a Phase 2 fix will be needed.

 

Requisitions. We’ve heard your feedback and agree that this is worth exploring. We are looking into ways to rework Requisitions that makes sense and is more conducive to a better gameplay experience, especially since the recent Divisions Overhaul we implemented.

- **Lots of questions this week about the financial situation of ECW**. Several recent checks to ECW wrestlers bounced, along with checks to security people and to cover advertising costs. Heyman is now claiming that every check that bounced has since been made good. Regardless, several wrestlers claim to still be owed money and there's rumors that some are owed a large amount. Backstage morale is at an all-time low and a lot of the lower card guys are paranoia and jealousy because they believe top guys like Taz, Tommy Dreamer, and Bubba Ray Dudley aren't having their checks bounce (ECW's bankruptcy filings 2 years later proved otherwise). Apparently there have been issues with checks bouncing for the last several months, although wrestlers were originally told that those cases were mistakes due to ECW switching banks. Heyman held a meeting with the locker room a few weeks ago assuring everyone that he was close to making a major deal for ECW and to bear with him, but admitted some checks may bounce while he's finalizing the deal. Heyman claimed that ECW is bringing in an investor who will buy 10% share of the company and would result in stronger marketing for them. But in order to complete the deal, ECW has to be debt free, so some checks might be affected in the meantime. There's also some other deal that Dave goes into regarding a loan against PPV profits or something. It gets all confusing and number-y.

- **Naturally, some of the ECW wrestlers are skeptical and upset**. As said, many are owed significant sums of money because nobody has gotten their PPV checks for the last several PPVs, but Heyman continues to promise everyone that it's coming. So far, nobody has quit because most of the ECW roster doesn't have many other options and several are locked into contracts anyway. ECW has also been cutting back on flying in some guys who aren't needed and doing other cutbacks with equipment and whatnot. A lot of wrestlers see all these packed shows with thousands of people and merch flying off the shelves and wonder where the money is going. Dave suspects most of it is paying off ECW's enormous television costs, because they buy time on TV in most of the major markets they're in. In New York City alone, they pay $250,000 a year just to be on MSG cable. ECW doesn't like to risk running shows in bigger buildings because Heyman thinks it's important to have the shows look packed but those shows are sometimes money losers in cities like NYC where it costs more to be on TV than what they bring in. Half empty arenas give the impression that it's not a hot product, but Dave thinks they may have outgrown their current level of success and may need to take the risk and start bigger buildings like WWF and WCW. But of course, that comes with its own additional costs and new problems, so it's not that simple. PPV money is what's keeping ECW afloat but the problem is that the PPV money always comes in several months later. They usually need it immediately so they're always a few months behind on bills, waiting for the next PPV check to bail them out. But the new deal Heyman is working on would allegedly secure them a big million dollar loan. But it's not from a bank and it's an 11% interest rate, and Dave says that alone raises even more questions about the financial state of ECW. 

- **In a final note, Dave says there's also concern in ECW about the widespread drug issues**. Heyman has long held the belief that whatever the wrestlers do on their own time isn't his business as long as they show up and are in condition to perform. But he's since admitted that several ECW guys have severe drug problems and he's starting to crack down on it out of concern for his wrestlers. He's reportedly threatened to fire 3 unnamed wrestlers if they don't get their problems under control. Apparently the hot drug in ECW right now is injectable Nubain which wrestlers are using to deal with pain and to sleep.

- **WWF's St. Valentine's Day Massacre PPV is in the books and featured the long-awaited first real Steve Austin vs. Vince McMahon match**. The 53-year-old McMahon had never worked a real match before but he was out there for almost 20 minutes brawling with Austin and took one of the craziest bumps you'll ever see off the cage through a table and was far better than anyone could have expected. Considering his age and that he had major neck surgery just 5 years ago, Dave thinks the Vince bump was insane. The match ended with the WWF debut of The Giant, using his real name Paul Wight, coming up through the ring and throwing Austin through the cage. Commentary was bad because Michael Cole is still struggling to fill J.R.'s shoes while he's still out recovering from Bells Palsy and Jerry Lawler's voice was hoarse and he sounded bad the whole show. The PPV was sold out weeks in advance and broke all Memphis wrestling records. (So yeah...funny story, despite living here in Memphis, I never went to this PPV and in fact have never even watched the whole thing. Back in 1999, a couple of months before this, I had just started dating my first serious girlfriend. Sophomores in high school. And it was one of those high school relationships where we were obnoxiously in love and didn't care about anything else except being around each other and sneaking off to find places to bone. For the next year and a half, I honestly didn't keep up with wrestling nearly as closely as I had before. Ugh. Teenagers.)

- **Other notes from the PPV**: Undercard was terrible. A couple of matches get negative stars and others only get 1 star. Brian Christopher and Scott Taylor beat the Hardyz in a dark match, and the Hardyz were booed out of the building since Christopher is the hometown boy. Dave remains annoyed that they turned Vader into a jobber because he couldn't lose weight, but then hired Viscera and are pushing him. Road Dogg missed the show due to ""injury"" (rehab) and so Al Snow and Bob Holly had a hardcore match that ended with them fighting outside the building and into the Mississippi River. Ken Shamrock's ""sister"" Ryan missed her cue to slap Shamrock, and he had to audibly tell her on camera to slap him. Rock vs. Mankind was a good match with a bullshit finish that the crowd booed the hell out of.

- **Masanori Saito had his retirement ceremony in Japan this week**. Known in the U.S. as Mr. Saito, Dave says he's probably the 2nd most successful Japanese wrestler to ever step foot in American rings (behind Baba). He was a top star for basically every promotion he worked in for more than 2 decades. He also spent 2 years in prison in the U.S. for a brawl he got into with the police in Wisconsin. Dave does a long recap of Saito's career, from his younger days in Japan where he was one of the biggest stars (but still behind guys like Inoki and Baba) and is most famous for his feud with Antonio Inoki leading to the longest wrestling match ever in Japan (over 2 hours, and took place on an island in the jungle). He also recaps the story of Saito and Ken Patera getting arrested for fighting the police, ending with 8 cops injured before they were subdued that led to them both being sent to prison. These days, Saito works backstage with NJPW and since he has lived much of his life in America, he's NJPW's liaison to the U.S. and is responsible for keeping the WCW relationship alive during all the times it almost fell apart (the retirement ended up being legit. Saito never wrestled again. He was diagnosed with Parkinson's a year later but he's still alive today. Not sure what he's up to these days. Anyway, here's the first part of the jungle match with Inoki. The rest of it isn't online far as I can tell. But no big loss: it's a dreadfully boring match).

- **NBC Dateline aired a segment on Vince McMahon this week called Lord of the Ring**. It was a strong piece but didn't really cover any new ground. Mostly just talked about WWF being the new hot thing these days and attributed it to the adult content and talked about how they still heavily market to kids and all the usual stuff. It wasn't necessarily meant to be a positive piece, but it basically buried WCW as being nowhere near WWF's league so Vince was probably pleased. It portrayed Vince as a successful promoter without a social conscience, which Dave says is fairly accurate. McMahon was completely unapologetic about the fact that little kids watch the show. Eric Bischoff and Bret Hart were both interviewed for it and both came off jealous and bitter more than anything (I can't find video of this anywhere).

- **Rey Mysterio is scheduled to face Psicosis in a mask vs. mask match in Mexico**, but a lot of people are upset about it because it's already well known that Mysterio will be losing his mask 5 days earlier at WCW's SuperBrawl. So for him to put it back on and go to Mexico and lose it again there is being called a fraud and people are actually trying to get the athletic commission to prevent the match from happening.

- **Dave got a tape sent to him with over 5 hours of Japanese news coverage of Giant Baba's death from just the first week alone**. Also, AJPW held their first post-Baba house shows this week. In the past, at all AJPW shows, Baba would sit in a chair behind the merch table, watching the shows. At the new shows, they had a symbolic empty chair behind the merch table with a picture of Baba. Fans brought flowers and gifts and left them all around the chair and table.

- **Antonio Inoki has opened up an office in Los Angeles for his UFO promotion**. Inoki feels like there is a niche market in the U.S. for a more realistic fighting style without all the soap opera gimmick stuff of WWF and WCW. Basically, he wants to do something like UFC but have worked matches and guys who know how to entertain while still making the matches look legitimate. Dave doesn't think there's enough of a market in the U.S. for a worked UFC-type promotion to succeed here.

- **Takako Inoue announced she was retiring from All Japan Women** and word is she's leaving to pursue an acting career but may still wrestle on occasion (far as I can tell, the acting thing never really panned out and she still wrestles to this day).

- **Power Pro Wrestling in Memphis had the biggest show in its short history last week** because several WWF wrestlers appeared (they were in town for the WWF PPV). Too Much, Jim Cornette, Giant Silva, Steve Williams, Michael Hayes, and more worked the show.

- **Verne Gagne is suing a guy name Dale Gagner over the use of the AWA name**. Gagner (who has actually dropped the R from his last name and is going by Dale Gagne) claims that Verne failed to keep the trademark when AWA went bankrupt and so now Dale is attempting to run shows using the AWA name. Verne is also pissed that Gagner is misrepresenting himself as a member of the Gagne family (this shit drags on for years. This Gagner guy spends years claiming to be a Gagne family member. Eventually WWE buys the AWA tape library and then they get involved, filing a lawsuit against Gagner in 2007 and eventually getting him to stop using ""AWA"" in 2008. But this Dale Gagner guy sounds like a snake).

- **Paul Heyman has told Chris Candido and Tammy Sytch that they both have to go to rehab and provide him proof that they are actually attending or they would both be fired**. Candido and Sytch run their own website and Heyman also told them they would have to post something on their site admitting that they were dealing with personal issues (they don't have to be specific) and that's why they're not booked for ECW shows. After Sytch was arrested last week, her and Candido went on their website and posted a bunch of lies about how it wasn't true and Sytch saying she missed that week's ECW shows because she was visiting her ill sister, rather than the truth (that she was in jail). But then Sytch's mugshot wound up leaking on to the internet, proving she was lying. Heyman said it was an embarrassment to ECW that they were lying to people about why they were missing shows. Heyman also said that he'd never drug tested anyone before and was adamant that he never would because he didn't think it was his business, but he has informed Candido and Sytch that they will be required to pass drug tests before he'll book them again.

- **Public Enemy have signed a deal with WWF**. They were supposed to finish out the next month of shows with ECW, but Heyman wanted them to put over the Dudleyz on all the shows and WWF apparently had a problem with that, so now they're just flat out gone from ECW and apparently won't be working the March PPV as planned. They debuted on Sunday Night Heat this week.

- **Dave says once again, Super Crazy and Tajiri are facing each other on every ECW show** and every week, they're having the best matches in the U.S. right now.

- **Shane Douglas is back at work after his heart scare last week, but hasn't been wrestling**. Just cutting promos. He's also got heat with Paul Heyman, claiming he's owed a bunch of money and was quitting. At one point, he and Heyman had squashed the issue but a few days later, they were back at it again (yeah, Douglas only lasts another couple of months before he really does quit and goes to WCW).

- **Dave starts his recap of Nitro by screaming in all-caps ""THIS NEW CONCEPT IS A LOSER!"" So we're off to a good start**. You see, WCW has decided to start copying WWF and now they have more backstage acting segments than actual wrestling. Dave is not a fan, clearly. ""I can't express just how screwed up this company is right now. The 2/15 Nitro may have been the worst episode of the show in history,"" he says. The show was held in the 2,500 seat Steinbrenner Pavilion and was done as a favor to George Steinbrenner for some sort of business reasons. Because WCW can usually draw 10,000 or more easily to any Nitro, so by doing the show in front of only 2,500 people, they left hundreds of thousands of dollars in gate money on the table. The show was so bad that Dave says ""I thought I was having nightmares about having been a horrible human being and being sent to Hell, and when I got there, I was sent to this room with all the evil wrestling promoters past and present and they made me sit in the chair next to people like Fritz Von Erich, Herb Abrams and Nick Gulas and forced us to watch Nitro episodes like this 24 hours a day."" And that's just one of MANY sentences where Dave marks snarky comments about how bad the show was. Seriously, I've seen Dave trash shows before that he didn't like but I've read literally every single issue of the Observer throughout the 1990s up to this point and I've never seen him just savagely rip apart a show and a promotion like he does WCW in this issue. It's worth reading in full if you're a subscriber just for the sheer hilarity of it. And it doesn't get much better for WCW from here on out.

- **Something fishy is going on with WCW's deal with NBC**. When the whole thing was initially finalized, WCW went around telling everybody about it, started booking the arenas for it, and began booking ideas for it. But NBC never publicly confirmed the deal. And in fact, WWF even claimed on their website that WCW was lying and that a deal wasn't finalized. And then the NBA lockout ended, so whatever WCW specials may have been planned ended up being cancelled. WCW was under the impression that their NBC specials would air after the NBA season. But there still seems to be no movement on the NBC side of things for any WCW plans, even though WCW still seems to be under the impression that it's happening (nope).

- **Saturn is expected to get some sort of Marilyn Manson-type gimmick, which leads Dave to say, hey, remember Vampiro?** He was supposed to get a Manson gimmick but apparently Vampiro is hanging around with Sandman and Mikey Whipwreck, who all WCW signed MONTHS ago and hasn't used them at all. But they're all still sitting home collecting their weekly guaranteed checks.

- **Telemundo is threatening to sue WCW over the scrapped Lucha Libre show**. After the first taping went poorly, Bischoff decided to nix the whole idea, but Telemundo is claiming that they had already cleared a spot for it in prime time and have been given a 16-week commitment by WCW for the show. They discussed settling out of court, but Ted Turner himself apparently didn't want the bad press that would come with having backed out of a contract with Telemundo. So the pilot episode apparently will air, and after that, they will air edited 1-hour versions of Nitro for the remaining 15 weeks.

- **NFL player and sometimes WCW wrestler Kevin Greene was arrested for impersonating a police officer**. Apparently Greene pulled over another car in some kind of road rage incident and started roughing up the driver. The police showed up and Greene claimed he was a local sheriff. When they realized he wasn't, he was arrested.

- **The Rock won the WWF title from Mankind on Raw in a ladder match** but Dave says title changes have become so frequent that it's barely even news. It's Rock's 3rd world title reign in the last 3 months. That being said, Dave thinks it was the 2nd best match he's seen so far this year (just behind a recent Vader/Kobashi match in AJPW).

- **Other WWF Raw notes**: Paul Wight made his Raw debut, still going by his real name and wearing a shirt that said ""No gimmicks needed."" Shane McMahon won the European title in only his 2nd match ever and Dave says he was horrible and had no business in the ring and says that actor Will Sasso (who wrestled on Nitro the same night) was far better in the ring than Shane, who has no business wrestling. Hey, he eventually turned into a pretty decent worker. And one final note: ""Rock is on his way to being one of the biggest stars this industry has ever seen.""

- **Mankind** will be filming a Chef Boyardee commercial soon.

- **Flash Funk (2 Cold Scorpio) was fired by WWF this week**. Dave says he was basically in trouble nonstop during his WWF tenure. At Wrestlemania two yeas ago, he had a domestic dispute at the hotel leading to the police being called and apparently was constantly in trouble for other stuff ever since. So they finally just cut him loose.

- **Here's the latest on a Winnipeg school district fighting to get WWF moved to a later time slot because kids are imitating it**. WWF sent a letter, offering to send wrestlers to the schools to give speeches about not emulating the language on TV, not doing drugs, etc. But the school board turned it down, saying that unless WWF changes the actual TV product or the show is moved to a later air time, they aren't budging. One of the schools sent letters home to parents saying there has been an alarming increase in students fighting and using wrestling lingo (""suck it!"") and advising parents not to let their kids watch wrestling and that any wrestling magazines, toys, etc. will be confiscated and wrestling shirts are banned from all schools in the district.

- **WWF The Music Vol. 3 has been steadily climbing the Billboard charts** and is at #15 in the top 200 right now (this is actually 2 months after it was released and it eventually peaks at #10 and went platinum).

- **Forbes is planning to do a story about the money generated by wrestling**. Dave thinks it'll be interesting to see what numbers they use, since WWF notoriously lies about this stuff. WWF has been claiming for years that they're a $500 million dollar-per-year company which isn't even close to true. WCW claims to be in the $200 million per year range, which is closer to true. But then WCW has stopped giving that number out because it makes them look minor league next to WWF's false $500 million claims. And WCW is part of Turner and thus is a public company, so they can't lie about their revenue without getting caught the way Vince can, since WWF is privately owned. Recently though, WWF has quietly been admitting to a more realistic $210 million per year figure, which is much closer to the truth.

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lots of questions this week about the financial situation of ECW&lt;/strong&gt;. Several recent checks to ECW wrestlers bounced, along with checks to security people and to cover advertising costs. Heyman is now claiming that every check that bounced has since been made good. Regardless, several wrestlers claim to still be owed money and there&amp;#39;s rumors that some are owed a large amount. Backstage morale is at an all-time low and a lot of the lower card guys are paranoia and jealousy because they believe top guys like Taz, Tommy Dreamer, and Bubba Ray Dudley aren&amp;#39;t having their checks bounce (ECW&amp;#39;s bankruptcy filings 2 years later proved otherwise). Apparently there have been issues with checks bouncing for the last several months, although wrestlers were originally told that those cases were mistakes due to ECW switching banks. Heyman held a meeting with the locker room a few weeks ago assuring everyone that he was close to making a major deal for ECW and to bear with him, but admitted some checks may bounce while he&amp;#39;s finalizing the deal. Heyman claimed that ECW is bringing in an investor who will buy 10% share of the company and would result in stronger marketing for them. But in order to complete the deal, ECW has to be debt free, so some checks might be affected in the meantime. There&amp;#39;s also some other deal that Dave goes into regarding a loan against PPV profits or something. It gets all confusing and number-y.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Naturally, some of the ECW wrestlers are skeptical and upset&lt;/strong&gt;. As said, many are owed significant sums of money because nobody has gotten their PPV checks for the last several PPVs, but Heyman continues to promise everyone that it&amp;#39;s coming. So far, nobody has quit because most of the ECW roster doesn&amp;#39;t have many other options and several are locked into contracts anyway. ECW has also been cutting back on flying in some guys who aren&amp;#39;t needed and doing other cutbacks with equipment and whatnot. A lot of wrestlers see all these packed shows with thousands of people and merch flying off the shelves and wonder where the money is going. Dave suspects most of it is paying off ECW&amp;#39;s enormous television costs, because they buy time on TV in most of the major markets they&amp;#39;re in. In New York City alone, they pay $250,000 a year just to be on MSG cable. ECW doesn&amp;#39;t like to risk running shows in bigger buildings because Heyman thinks it&amp;#39;s important to have the shows look packed but those shows are sometimes money losers in cities like NYC where it costs more to be on TV than what they bring in. Half empty arenas give the impression that it&amp;#39;s not a hot product, but Dave thinks they may have outgrown their current level of success and may need to take the risk and start bigger buildings like WWF and WCW. But of course, that comes with its own additional costs and new problems, so it&amp;#39;s not that simple. PPV money is what&amp;#39;s keeping ECW afloat but the problem is that the PPV money always comes in several months later. They usually need it immediately so they&amp;#39;re always a few months behind on bills, waiting for the next PPV check to bail them out. But the new deal Heyman is working on would allegedly secure them a big million dollar loan. But it&amp;#39;s not from a bank and it&amp;#39;s an 11% interest rate, and Dave says that alone raises even more questions about the financial state of ECW. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a final note, Dave says there&amp;#39;s also concern in ECW about the widespread drug issues&lt;/strong&gt;. Heyman has long held the belief that whatever the wrestlers do on their own time isn&amp;#39;t his business as long as they show up and are in condition to perform. But he&amp;#39;s since admitted that several ECW guys have severe drug problems and he&amp;#39;s starting to crack down on it out of concern for his wrestlers. He&amp;#39;s reportedly threatened to fire 3 unnamed wrestlers if they don&amp;#39;t get their problems under control. Apparently the hot drug in ECW right now is injectable Nubain which wrestlers are using to deal with pain and to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WWF&amp;#39;s St. Valentine&amp;#39;s Day Massacre PPV is in the books and featured the long-awaited first real Steve Austin vs. Vince McMahon match&lt;/strong&gt;. The 53-year-old McMahon had never worked a real match before but he was out there for almost 20 minutes brawling with Austin and took one of the craziest bumps you&amp;#39;ll ever see off the cage through a table and was far better than anyone could have expected. Considering his age and that he had major neck surgery just 5 years ago, Dave thinks the Vince bump was insane. The match ended with the WWF debut of The Giant, using his real name Paul Wight, coming up through the ring and throwing Austin through the cage. Commentary was bad because Michael Cole is still struggling to fill J.R.&amp;#39;s shoes while he&amp;#39;s still out recovering from Bells Palsy and Jerry Lawler&amp;#39;s voice was hoarse and he sounded bad the whole show. The PPV was sold out weeks in advance and broke all Memphis wrestling records. (So yeah...funny story, despite living here in Memphis, I never went to this PPV and in fact have never even watched the whole thing. Back in 1999, a couple of months before this, I had just started dating my first serious girlfriend. Sophomores in high school. And it was one of those high school relationships where we were obnoxiously in love and didn&amp;#39;t care about anything else except being around each other and sneaking off to find places to bone. For the next year and a half, I honestly didn&amp;#39;t keep up with wrestling nearly as closely as I had before. Ugh. Teenagers.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other notes from the PPV&lt;/strong&gt;: Undercard was terrible. A couple of matches get negative stars and others only get 1 star. Brian Christopher and Scott Taylor beat the Hardyz in a dark match, and the Hardyz were booed out of the building since Christopher is the hometown boy. Dave remains annoyed that they turned Vader into a jobber because he couldn&amp;#39;t lose weight, but then hired Viscera and are pushing him. Road Dogg missed the show due to &amp;quot;injury&amp;quot; (rehab) and so Al Snow and Bob Holly had a hardcore match that ended with them fighting outside the building and into the Mississippi River. Ken Shamrock&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;sister&amp;quot; Ryan missed her cue to slap Shamrock, and he had to audibly tell her on camera to slap him. Rock vs. Mankind was a good match with a bullshit finish that the crowd booed the hell out of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Masanori Saito had his retirement ceremony in Japan this week&lt;/strong&gt;. Known in the U.S. as Mr. Saito, Dave says he&amp;#39;s probably the 2nd most successful Japanese wrestler to ever step foot in American rings (behind Baba). He was a top star for basically every promotion he worked in for more than 2 decades. He also spent 2 years in prison in the U.S. for a brawl he got into with the police in Wisconsin. Dave does a long recap of Saito&amp;#39;s career, from his younger days in Japan where he was one of the biggest stars (but still behind guys like Inoki and Baba) and is most famous for his feud with Antonio Inoki leading to the longest wrestling match ever in Japan (over 2 hours, and took place on an island in the jungle). He also recaps the story of Saito and Ken Patera getting arrested for fighting the police, ending with 8 cops injured before they were subdued that led to them both being sent to prison. These days, Saito works backstage with NJPW and since he has lived much of his life in America, he&amp;#39;s NJPW&amp;#39;s liaison to the U.S. and is responsible for keeping the WCW relationship alive during all the times it almost fell apart (the retirement ended up being legit. Saito never wrestled again. He was diagnosed with Parkinson&amp;#39;s a year later but he&amp;#39;s still alive today. Not sure what he&amp;#39;s up to these days. Anyway, here&amp;#39;s the first part of the jungle match with Inoki. The rest of it isn&amp;#39;t online far as I can tell. But no big loss: it&amp;#39;s a dreadfully boring match).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NBC Dateline aired a segment on Vince McMahon this week called Lord of the Ring&lt;/strong&gt;. It was a strong piece but didn&amp;#39;t really cover any new ground. Mostly just talked about WWF being the new hot thing these days and attributed it to the adult content and talked about how they still heavily market to kids and all the usual stuff. It wasn&amp;#39;t necessarily meant to be a positive piece, but it basically buried WCW as being nowhere near WWF&amp;#39;s league so Vince was probably pleased. It portrayed Vince as a successful promoter without a social conscience, which Dave says is fairly accurate. McMahon was completely unapologetic about the fact that little kids watch the show. Eric Bischoff and Bret Hart were both interviewed for it and both came off jealous and bitter more than anything (I can&amp;#39;t find video of this anywhere).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rey Mysterio is scheduled to face Psicosis in a mask vs. mask match in Mexico&lt;/strong&gt;, but a lot of people are upset about it because it&amp;#39;s already well known that Mysterio will be losing his mask 5 days earlier at WCW&amp;#39;s SuperBrawl. So for him to put it back on and go to Mexico and lose it again there is being called a fraud and people are actually trying to get the athletic commission to prevent the match from happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dave got a tape sent to him with over 5 hours of Japanese news coverage of Giant Baba&amp;#39;s death from just the first week alone&lt;/strong&gt;. Also, AJPW held their first post-Baba house shows this week. In the past, at all AJPW shows, Baba would sit in a chair behind the merch table, watching the shows. At the new shows, they had a symbolic empty chair behind the merch table with a picture of Baba. Fans brought flowers and gifts and left them all around the chair and table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antonio Inoki has opened up an office in Los Angeles for his UFO promotion&lt;/strong&gt;. Inoki feels like there is a niche market in the U.S. for a more realistic fighting style without all the soap opera gimmick stuff of WWF and WCW. Basically, he wants to do something like UFC but have worked matches and guys who know how to entertain while still making the matches look legitimate. Dave doesn&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s enough of a market in the U.S. for a worked UFC-type promotion to succeed here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takako Inoue announced she was retiring from All Japan Women&lt;/strong&gt; and word is she&amp;#39;s leaving to pursue an acting career but may still wrestle on occasion (far as I can tell, the acting thing never really panned out and she still wrestles to this day).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power Pro Wrestling in Memphis had the biggest show in its short history last week&lt;/strong&gt; because several WWF wrestlers appeared (they were in town for the WWF PPV). Too Much, Jim Cornette, Giant Silva, Steve Williams, Michael Hayes, and more worked the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verne Gagne is suing a guy name Dale Gagner over the use of the AWA name&lt;/strong&gt;. Gagner (who has actually dropped the R from his last name and is going by Dale Gagne) claims that Verne failed to keep the trademark when AWA went bankrupt and so now Dale is attempting to run shows using the AWA name. Verne is also pissed that Gagner is misrepresenting himself as a member of the Gagne family (this shit drags on for years. This Gagner guy spends years claiming to be a Gagne family member. Eventually WWE buys the AWA tape library and then they get involved, filing a lawsuit against Gagner in 2007 and eventually getting him to stop using &amp;quot;AWA&amp;quot; in 2008. But this Dale Gagner guy sounds like a snake).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Heyman has told Chris Candido and Tammy Sytch that they both have to go to rehab and provide him proof that they are actually attending or they would both be fired&lt;/strong&gt;. Candido and Sytch run their own website and Heyman also told them they would have to post something on their site admitting that they were dealing with personal issues (they don&amp;#39;t have to be specific) and that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re not booked for ECW shows. After Sytch was arrested last week, her and Candido went on their website and posted a bunch of lies about how it wasn&amp;#39;t true and Sytch saying she missed that week&amp;#39;s ECW shows because she was visiting her ill sister, rather than the truth (that she was in jail). But then Sytch&amp;#39;s mugshot wound up leaking on to the internet, proving she was lying. Heyman said it was an embarrassment to ECW that they were lying to people about why they were missing shows. Heyman also said that he&amp;#39;d never drug tested anyone before and was adamant that he never would because he didn&amp;#39;t think it was his business, but he has informed Candido and Sytch that they will be required to pass drug tests before he&amp;#39;ll book them again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

They were supposed to finish out the next month of shows with ECW, but Heyman wanted them to put over the Dudleyz on all the shows and WWF apparently had a problem with that, so now they&amp;#39;re just flat out gone from ECW and apparently won&amp;#39;t be working the March PPV as planned. They debuted on Sunday Night Heat this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dave says once again, Super Crazy and Tajiri are facing each other on every ECW show&lt;/strong&gt; and every week, they&amp;#39;re having the best matches in the U.S. right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shane Douglas is back at work after his heart scare last week, but hasn&amp;#39;t been wrestling&lt;/strong&gt;. Just cutting promos. He&amp;#39;s also got heat with Paul Heyman, claiming he&amp;#39;s owed a bunch of money and was quitting. At one point, he and Heyman had squashed the issue but a few days later, they were back at it again (yeah, Douglas only lasts another couple of months before he really does quit and goes to WCW).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dave starts his recap of Nitro by screaming in all-caps &amp;quot;THIS NEW CONCEPT IS A LOSER!&amp;quot; So we&amp;#39;re off to a good start&lt;/strong&gt;. You see, WCW has decided to start copying WWF and now they have more backstage acting segments than actual wrestling. Dave is not a fan, clearly. &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t express just how screwed up this company is right now. The 2/15 Nitro may have been the worst episode of the show in history,&amp;quot; he says. The show was held in the 2,500 seat Steinbrenner Pavilion and was done as a favor to George Steinbrenner for some sort of business reasons. Because WCW can usually draw 10,000 or more easily to any Nitro, so by doing the show in front of only 2,500 people, they left hundreds of thousands of dollars in gate money on the table. The show was so bad that Dave says &amp;quot;I thought I was having nightmares about having been a horrible human being and being sent to Hell, and when I got there, I was sent to this room with all the evil wrestling promoters past and present and they made me sit in the chair next to people like Fritz Von Erich, Herb Abrams and Nick Gulas and forced us to watch Nitro episodes like this 24 hours a day.&amp;quot; And that&amp;#39;s just one of MANY sentences where Dave marks snarky comments about how bad the show was. Seriously, I&amp;#39;ve seen Dave trash shows before that he didn&amp;#39;t like but I&amp;#39;ve read literally every single issue of the Observer throughout the 1990s up to this point and I&amp;#39;ve never seen him just savagely rip apart a show and a promotion like he does WCW in this issue. It&amp;#39;s worth reading in full if you&amp;#39;re a subscriber just for the sheer hilarity of it. And it doesn&amp;#39;t get much better for WCW from here on out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Something fishy is going on with WCW&amp;#39;s deal with NBC&lt;/strong&gt;. When the whole thing was initially finalized, WCW went around telling everybody about it, started booking the arenas for it, and began booking ideas for it. But NBC never publicly confirmed the deal. And in fact, WWF even claimed on their website that WCW was lying and that a deal wasn&amp;#39;t finalized. And then the NBA lockout ended, so whatever WCW specials may have been planned ended up being cancelled. WCW was under the impression that their NBC specials would air after the NBA season. But there still seems to be no movement on the NBC side of things for any WCW plans, even though WCW still seems to be under the impression that it&amp;#39;s happening (nope).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturn is expected to get some sort of Marilyn Manson-type gimmick, which leads Dave to say, hey, remember Vampiro?&lt;/strong&gt; He was supposed to get a Manson gimmick but apparently Vampiro is hanging around with Sandman and Mikey Whipwreck, who all WCW signed MONTHS ago and hasn&amp;#39;t used them at all. But they&amp;#39;re all still sitting home collecting their weekly guaranteed checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Telemundo is threatening to sue WCW over the scrapped Lucha Libre show&lt;/strong&gt;. After the first taping went poorly, Bischoff decided to nix the whole idea, but Telemundo is claiming that they had already cleared a spot for it in prime time and have been given a 16-week commitment by WCW for the show. They discussed settling out of court, but Ted Turner himself apparently didn&amp;#39;t want the bad press that would come with having backed out of a contract with Telemundo. So the pilot episode apparently will air, and after that, they will air edited 1-hour versions of Nitro for the remaining 15 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NFL player and sometimes WCW wrestler Kevin Greene was arrested for impersonating a police officer&lt;/strong&gt;. Apparently Greene pulled over another car in some kind of road rage incident and started roughing up the driver. The police showed up and Greene claimed he was a local sheriff. When they realized he wasn&amp;#39;t, he was arrested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Rock won the WWF title from Mankind on Raw in a ladder match&lt;/strong&gt; but Dave says title changes have become so frequent that it&amp;#39;s barely even news. It&amp;#39;s Rock&amp;#39;s 3rd world title reign in the last 3 months. That being said, Dave thinks it was the 2nd best match he&amp;#39;s seen so far this year (just behind a recent Vader/Kobashi match in AJPW).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other WWF Raw notes&lt;/strong&gt;: Paul Wight made his Raw debut, still going by his real name and wearing a shirt that said &amp;quot;No gimmicks needed.&amp;quot; Shane McMahon won the European title in only his 2nd match ever and Dave says he was horrible and had no business in the ring and says that actor Will Sasso (who wrestled on Nitro the same night) was far better in the ring than Shane, who has no business wrestling. Hey, he eventually turned into a pretty decent worker. And one final note: &amp;quot;Rock is on his way to being one of the biggest stars this industry has ever seen.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mankind&lt;/strong&gt; will be filming a Chef Boyardee commercial soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flash Funk (2 Cold Scorpio) was fired by WWF this week&lt;/strong&gt;. Dave says he was basically in trouble nonstop during his WWF tenure. At Wrestlemania two yeas ago, he had a domestic dispute at the hotel leading to the police being called and apparently was constantly in trouble for other stuff ever since. So they finally just cut him loose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the latest on a Winnipeg school district fighting to get WWF moved to a later time slot because kids are imitating it&lt;/strong&gt;. WWF sent a letter, offering to send wrestlers to the schools to give speeches about not emulating the language on TV, not doing drugs, etc. But the school board turned it down, saying that unless WWF changes the actual TV product or the show is moved to a later air time, they aren&amp;#39;t budging. One of the schools sent letters home to parents saying there has been an alarming increase in students fighting and using wrestling lingo (&amp;quot;suck it!&amp;quot;) and advising parents not to let their kids watch wrestling and that any wrestling magazines, toys, etc. will be confiscated and wrestling shirts are banned from all schools in the district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WWF The Music Vol. 3 has been steadily climbing the Billboard charts&lt;/strong&gt; and is at #15 in the top 200 right now (this is actually 2 months after it was released and it eventually peaks at #10 and went platinum).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXA5i9nAmSI&amp;amp;list=PL885DCDBAED0FAAC4""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LISTEN: WWF: The Music, Vol. 3 (YouTube playlist)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forbes is planning to do a story about the money generated by wrestling&lt;/strong&gt;. Dave thinks it&amp;#39;ll be interesting to see what numbers they use, since WWF notoriously lies about this stuff. WWF has been claiming for years that they&amp;#39;re a $500 million dollar-per-year company which isn&amp;#39;t even close to true. WCW claims to be in the $200 million per year range, which is closer to true. But then WCW has stopped giving that number out because it makes them look minor league next to WWF&amp;#39;s false $500 million claims. And WCW is part of Turner and thus is a public company, so they can&amp;#39;t lie about their revenue without getting caught the way Vince can, since WWF is privately owned. Recently though, WWF has quietly been admitting to a more realistic $210 million per year figure, which is much closer to the truth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MONDAY:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;WCW becoming desperate, backstage drama and heat with Kevin Nash and other wrestlers, more on ECW financial woes, WCW SuperBrawl fallout, Goldberg challenges Steve Austin, and more...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,spotify,"I need to get this off my chest, it's been too many weeks of pain.

Release Radar, at least for me, has been broken for some time. Sure, I still get new music every Friday but it's really odd how it happens. 

I'll use this week as an example. Dance Gavin Dance released a new song, Son of Robot, today. It didn't appear in my Release Radar, and actually neither did their other new track which debuted a few weeks ago.

Dance Gavin Dance was my most listened to artist on Spotify in 2016. In 2017 Dance Gavin Dance was my second most listened to artist. So I obviously have some sort of love for this band. I also follow them on Spotify. 

Now today instead of getting notified they have a new song, there is a Halsey song in my Release Radar. I listened to her newest album once. Let me repeat that, I've listened to hopeless fountain kingdom only one time since its release on June 2, 2017.  But for some gosh darn reason, every time she releases a new remix I get it in my playlist.

This week alone I listened to a ton of Dance Gavin Dance and I don't get notified of the new song. Maybe it's the record label trying to push her new single, maybe I live in some alternative universe where my play counts don't count or something.

I don't know.

,StarWarsBattlefront,"This is a DLC concept for season two. DICE has alot to prove with this season, but if outer rim taught me anything, its that these guys can make terrible ideas work. This would mainly focus on Solo, but also feature content based on the hutts 

&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;

Maps:
------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;nbsp;

There would be three maps in this DLC, two GA and one SA. The GA maps would be extraction maps placed in the GA playlist, they would also have their own temporary playlist


&amp;nbsp;

Corellia: This would be a city map where the rebels try to push the cart through winding tunnels, allys, and open streets until they reach the harbor. New speeders would be available on this map, hans speeder and the petrol bikes. It would have both day and night settings


&amp;nbsp;

Jabba's Palace: This is the map from the first game ported to BF2. I know that it isnt in the solo dlc, but it fits with the crime theme and we need another extraction map. It is still extraction and would be in the GA playlist. (This time with a fucking rancor)


&amp;nbsp;

Currently Unnamed SA map: This is the cloudy location with the tentacles from the trailer. Low visibility, tendrils, and asteroids make it very easy to crash if you are not careful. Objectives would follow the movie

&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;

Heros and Weapons:
----------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


&amp;nbsp;

Enfys Nest: She would be the first nonforce melee hero in the game (sry grievous). She would use those deployable arm shields instead of blocking and would have a variety of gadgets to choose from.


&amp;nbsp;

Quira: We know next to nothing about Quira, but I have an idea to make her interesting, a cloaking device. nuff said.


&amp;nbsp;

The weapons would be the Mud Trooper Rifle , the T21, the SE14C (can be tap fired, or charged up for a 2- 5 round burst), and Beckett's Sniper Rifle 

&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;

Hutt Contracts and Skins: 
--------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This season would see the return of Hutt contracts. Now, they are challenges that cycle every week. You pay credits to use them just as before, and they can unlock new weapons, star cards, crystals, and legendary peices (explained below). They would be similar to the challenges in COD WWII, but way less greedy. You cant buy the challenges with crystals.

&amp;nbsp;


Legendary Skins: This would bring the first two legendary skins to the game, Gambler Lando and Scoundrel Han. These skins cannot be bought with credits (but can be with crystals). Instead, for each one you will need to complete 4 legendary Hutt contracts. Each of these cost 10k credits and take time to complete. These challenges are not randomized, but their order is. This would encourage you too save credits, (or shill and buy crystals) without feeling like a free to play game with retarded grind.


&amp;nbsp;

Rey's Falcon would be replaced by the new falcon design. There would be a new Epic skin for the default falcon that adds Rey's voice lines


&amp;nbsp;

It would add Solo chewie as a rare skin and maybe a quira skin. Paulron colors for the FO and empire, and colors replacing the red on the droid sniper and heavy. Maybe a few new alien heads

&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;

Other:
------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QOL Changes: Nerfed leia secondary fire, team scramble when you get demolished, toggling holograms, and a new playlist that cycles between extraction, hunt, and cargo (with timers).

&amp;nbsp;

And perhaps an ARG for a certain general and a certain jedi

DICE has alot to prove with this season, but if outer rim taught me anything, its that these guys can make terrible ideas work. This would mainly focus on Solo, but also feature content based on the hutts &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Maps:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There would be three maps in this DLC, two GA and one SA. The GA maps would be extraction maps placed in the GA playlist, they would also have their own temporary playlist&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corellia: This would be a city map where the rebels try to push the cart through winding tunnels, allys, and open streets until they reach the harbor. New speeders would be available on this map, hans speeder and the petrol bikes. It would have both day and night settings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jabba&amp;#39;s Palace: This is the map from the first game ported to BF2. I know that it isnt in the solo dlc, but it fits with the crime theme and we need another extraction map. It is still extraction and would be in the GA playlist. (This time with a fucking rancor)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently Unnamed SA map: This is the cloudy location with the tentacles from the trailer. Low visibility, tendrils, and asteroids make it very easy to crash if you are not careful. Objectives would follow the movie&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Heros and Weapons:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enfys Nest: She would be the first nonforce melee hero in the game (sry grievous). She would use those deployable arm shields instead of blocking and would have a variety of gadgets to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quira: We know next to nothing about Quira, but I have an idea to make her interesting, a cloaking device. nuff said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weapons would be the Mud Trooper Rifle , the T21, the SE14C (can be tap fired, or charged up for a 2- 5 round burst), and Beckett&amp;#39;s Sniper Rifle &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hutt Contracts and Skins: &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This season would see the return of Hutt contracts. Now, they are challenges that cycle every week. You pay credits to use them just as before, and they can unlock new weapons, star cards, crystals, and legendary peices (explained below). They would be similar to the challenges in COD WWII, but way less greedy. You cant buy the challenges with crystals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legendary Skins: This would bring the first two legendary skins to the game, Gambler Lando and Scoundrel Han. These skins cannot be bought with credits (but can be with crystals). Instead, for each one you will need to complete 4 legendary Hutt contracts. Each of these cost 10k credits and take time to complete. These challenges are not randomized, but their order is. This would encourage you too save credits, (or shill and buy crystals) without feeling like a free to play game with retarded grind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rey&amp;#39;s Falcon would be replaced by the new falcon design. There would be a new Epic skin for the default falcon that adds Rey&amp;#39;s voice lines&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would add Solo chewie as a rare skin and maybe a quira skin. Paulron colors for the FO and empire, and colors replacing the red on the droid sniper and heavy. Maybe a few new alien heads&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Other:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QOL Changes: Nerfed leia secondary fire, team scramble when you get demolished, toggling holograms, and a new playlist that cycles between extraction, hunt, and cargo (with timers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And perhaps an ARG for a certain general and a certain jedi&lt;/p&gt;

,unrealtournament,"*This is a long post, but if you're reading this, you're probably pretty passionate about UT at this point in its life cycle. Why don't you stay awhile?*

***Preface***

So, I think it's pretty obvious at this point that UT4 no longer has any resources committed to it. With Paragon shutting down, and Fortnite pushing out content at a seemingly blistering rate, it's apparent that EPIC is going to ride their I.P. that is taking the world by storm (pardon the pun). 

Now, I'm not going to sit here and demand they work on UT or anything. Sure, I've been a fan of the series for nearly 20 years (by the way in November of next year it will have been that long since the release of UT99), but EPIC is going to put $ where the returns are, and that is in UE4 and Fortnite. 

***Doesn't matter. Arena shooters are dead, right?***

Personally, I'm not convinced that the genre itself is dead. If you would have told me 6 years ago that one of the biggest games in the world is Counter Strike, I would have laughed in your face. It's far too hard to play and no one would ever care about it again, I would have said. Of course, I would have also been dead wrong. I fully believe an arena shooter can thrive, especially Unreal Tournament: the weapons, ""lore"", and overall tone of the game is crafted with one goal in mind: to be fun. A flak cannon? Hell yes. A bio goo rifle? Sweet. A literal hammer that blows people to bits? Yes, please. The game is spectacle. More so than Quake. It's more on par with Overwatch with the crazy weapons and environments, but obviously more gore and aggression. There's appeal.

Let's take a look at some of the other games that people point to and say: *""See! Arena shooters are dead!""*

* Toxikk. They *thought* people just wanted a new, re-skinned UT2004. They were wrong. The weapons were boring, the levels were bland, and there wasn't much at all in terms of taking it to the next level. They literally just recreated that 1999 experience, and they were proud of it. That's not going to bring in *new* fans. I already own UT2004. Hell, I own *multiple copies* of UT2004. I don't need it again.
* Ratz Instagib. This is niche as niche can get. Game mode, art style, etc. 
* Reflex Arena. This has got some cool ideas with the level editor and going in the right direction with customizables, but other then that, nothing ground breaking. It looks like it's from a small indie studio, and that's fine, but there isn't a lot of appeal. 
* Doom. This actually could have been great, and is in a pretty OK spot right now. The problem with Doom is that it had to be completely unfucked by ID months after the initial release, and no one really cared about it anymore. It did some interesting things in the space in terms of modes, though, and nailed the customization aspect. In the end though, people have never really gone to Doom since Quake/UT for their multiplayer fix. The brand isn't there. Maybe the next game should have it's multiplayer rebranded to something else?
* Quake Champions. Ok, let's be real, this is the one people point to and proclaim that the arena shooter is dead. First, QC didn't launch as a complete game (and still isn't) and it has had numerous issues since launch that are finally just coming around now. Next, it is an arena shooter draped in class-shooter tropes. It ends up being a lukewarm experience. On top of all of that, there is so much time spent navigating the menus that you'll realize you started the game an hour ago and have played 3 matches. There's some semblance of overall player progression, but it's rather meaningless.
* Lawbreakers. Jesus. Not a terrible game, but the messaging wasn't there. No one knew what the hell it was. People that like Overwatch would not like LawBreakers, and people that liked arena shooters didn't really like lawbreakers. They aimed at an audience that didn't exist! Man..

Looking at the games above, the pitfalls are pretty apparent: broken/poor launches (Doom/QC), not much innovation (Toxikk), or too small of teams coupled with a dearth of features (Reflex/Ratz). Nothing shines or stands out. Where's the innovation? It's like trying to open a movie theater right now and offering nothing new, closing, and stating ""See?! no one just wants to go to the movies anymore!""...all the while the theater across town has kick ass seats, dinner-in-the-theater, and is killing it on a weekly basis.

***Alright, what does UT4/Next need to do then?***

UT4 was always a bit of wait-and-see type of project, and now it seems the further we are from our last update, the closer we are to returning to square one. With that, I want to ask the community: what do you think a future UT needs in order to make it ""click"" with the current gaming landscape? With these suggestions, let's just assume EPIC all of a sudden throws a ton of cash at the project and resources are limitless thanks to their fort-sized cash cow. Scope is unlimited. 

Looking at the current arena shooters, they don't offer anything (other than the gameplay) turly unique. It seems most of them took the old game play, put some customization in there, and threw it out waiting to catch some bites. We all want that gameplay, but we have to make a wider audience want to play it. Once again, not a perfect 1-1, but look at CS. The gameplay is relatively unchanged, but everything else surrounding it has. End result? A whole new generation is learning how to ""awp."" Here are some of my thoughts...

* It has to be quick to get in and play. Look at CS, Overwatch, PUBG, Fortnite -- the menu's are merely there to drive you to get in game. It's easy. Not a lot of waiting. Just click and you're in the action nearly immediately.
* It needs something more than just leaderboards. It needs systems that the user can work within and they know that they are getting better and getting rewarded for it. Let's look at Rocket League for example. The ranking system in that game is...well, it's intoxicating. The sense of accomplishment to move up during a season is bar none. I think UT would benefit from something like this. It needs to allow users to view their progression on a match-by-match, weekly, and seasonal basis and make suggestions on how to keep climbing the ranks. Think of it like a personal trainer. More on this below.
* In addition to the above, I think there needs to be more than just K/D and a readout of weapon stats. Inform the players on their deficiencies and how they can work to become better. For example, you log in and you have a daily quest, but instead of it saying ""Kill 20 people with a flak cannon"" it reads something like this ""Close Proximity: Get 10 kills with a flak cannon after swapping from a different weapon."" and then you hover over it and it says, ""In the past 10 matches, you have lost the most duels with your flak cannon out to enemies beyond 10 meters. Practice switching your weapons to better utilize their advantages."" It could even then link to a knowledge-base in game or something with a gif on how to do that. Or pop up the gif as you hover over. Something cool. Regardless, the game knows how you can get better at a granular level we have yet to witness before.
* I mentioned it above, and it's kind of obvious, but achieving these daily quests would help unlock credits to unlock cosmetics on the shop. 
* A tournament system. An *easy to use* tournament system. Kind of like the current one with Rocket League. You queue up, play in it, and, when you're not playing, you're lumped into a casual achieving that next rank. Hell, you could even dress it up as a ""Last Man Standing!"" mentality, but, in the end, it's just a tournament. Then, at the end of the tournament, a quick montage of your best kills and results are displayed until the final match and there is a grand animation and cool effects with your username or something. 
* A next-gen highlight system. I mean something that we haven't seen in games before. You click on a tab, or maybe it's right on the home screen, and quick (~15second) highlights are displayed. These highlights are chosen by the game itself for their complexity, rarity, and entertainment. They are attributed to the player, and when yours is chosen, you get special rewards that week. Maybe a tag on your name? Who knows. Or maybe a different system entirely. But these types of games can have incredible moments. These moments need to get shown in a way that isn't intrusive, requires zero effort by the player, and allows for recognition.
* Easy-to-select and find playlists. You can prefer certain modes and matches over others. Think Team (TDM/LMS), Solo (DM/LMS), Team Objective (CTF/Other Team Based Modes).
* A brawl-type mode that changes weekly. These are curated by EPIC (with community support if the want, whatever). Think of this mode as an easy, more streamlined mutator. 
* Custom matches, obviously. This is more of a concession I think, than anything. 
* More social elements. The problem with people's current view of arena shooters is that it's very compartmentalized. You're in the menus, then you're in the game. I think when you launch UT, it should feel like a living, breathing competitive community.
* In-game clan/league support. But, if you're not into that, maybe you join a clan and that week you're pitted against other similarly sized/skill level clans with ongoing challenges and then at the end of the week, rewards are doled out. Squeeze competition into every aspect of the game. Imagine signing on Friday night and realizing you're only 5 flag captures behind Clan A for some neat reward or something. Some weeks will be easier, some will be harder -- way it is. 

Those are just a few off the top of my head. You'll notice I focused more on systems and less about the gameplay. I'm not that die hard that if they change the units of my jump I flip out. Whatever. UT is fun. I'm not worried about that. 

**So, What do other people think the next UT needs to succeed?**

**TL;DR: I don't think arena shooters are dead, but I do think they need to adapt and evolve outside of the actual gameplay itself. Arena shooters up to this point haven't tried to introduce anything new or meaningful. I think the next UT needs to be easy to jump in and play, bug free and excellent performance, offer players meaningful progression (based around skill, not just cosmetics), and reward players for their advancement.

,Competitiveoverwatch,"*Lately, I've  noticed a ton of people struggle to get back up to that 'platinum'  rank. They may have achieved this when Overwatch was still young, and  needed time to improve. With the creation of the OWL, new players have  become involved, and many may not know where to start. I wrote this to  hopefully shed some light on the environment of the competitive scene.  Hopefully, new players may learn something, and keep them from losing  interest, or uninstalling the game altogether. Thanks for your time,  Sleepy.*

* Achieving  anything higher than a silver medal in competitive playlists can be a  daunting task. Placing silver in any of the popular competitive scenes  also seems to be fairly common.
* Solo  queuing may appear to be a rather hopeless endeavor, and it doesn't  come without it's disadvantages. You're always going to be better off  playing with a team.
* However,  there will be times when solo queuing can be advantageous, or the only  option. Here is some incite on how to perform better in a solo queue.
* Hopefully,  this will lead you away from uninstalling the game in a common, yet,  inevitable bout of rage. I personally would rip my N64 cartridges out of  the console. I'm sure we've all been there at one point.

**Communication**

* Whether  it's calling out pregame strats, ultimates, or even singling an enemy  out of position with Zenyatta's Orb of Discord, communication is key to  winning games. Communicating with the team may take some getting used  to.
* Negative  energy in group chat \(the most common form of energy, and it will kill  your momentum, if you let it.\) will eventually lead to the team stopping  communication altogether.
* This  bad juju is usually the result of the enemy team capping a point. Don't  let the negative energy bring the team down! Easier said than done.
* The  best way to combatant the bad juju is to build the chemistry with your  team early on. Get to know your team at the start of your match. Look  them up on Facebook, and possibly Twitter. Find out why their  abandonment issues have affected their fear of commitment.
* I  want you to metaphorically jump into your submarine, order the captain  to make a sharp dive, and find the center of your team's personality.

**Hero Selection**

* Picking  a hero you're comfortable with will usually benefit the team the most.  In silver, people will just instalock their favorite heroes.
* These  types of people are waiting for Nintendo to buy Blizzard's company, and  create amiibos for their favorite Overwatch characters.
* They  do this because they need to feel in control. They most likely can't  find a balance in their social and daily lives so they abuse Blizzard's  instalock method, and hopefully, feel a bit more confident.
* However,  branching out will ultimately be advantageous for you in the long run.  Here is an explanation of some solid heroes you can practice with to  kick start your journey through silver and beyond.

**Tank/Offense**

* For  offense, I highly suggest Roadhog. As you know Roadhog is a tank.  Tanks, of course, defend the team from harm. If you didn't know this,  that's okay, I will take care of you.
* In Roadhog's case, he is a great initiator of fights. You can make or break a fight with a well timed Hook Shot.
* What  is nice about his Hook Shot is that after a successful hook, you can  pull an enemy to a direct position by turning \(whatever you use, I don't  care, hopefully it's a flight simulator joystick\) your cursor to either  side of you.
* Hooks are also great for environment kills. These kills involve Roadhog hooking some poor bastard across an open space.
* If  you can manage to get the wave emote signaled, before they fall to  their death, you sir, are a hero. There should be an achievement for  this.
* Just  record all your games until it happens, and send it to Blizzard. If  everybody voices their frustration on the lack of achievement for such a  heroic feat, Blizzard will have to listen.
* Anyways,  Roadhog's Take A Breather ability allows him to possess the highest amount of survivability known to man.
* He can outlive both you and I, and he will likely attend our funerals. Roadhog is just that type of person you can count on.
* When using the Take A Breather ability, timing is crucial. Your best bet is to save it until after the initiation of a fight.
* Think  of it as a Black Jack dealer showing 6/16, and you're showing 13.  You're better off saving your hand and let the dealer bust. Fortunately,  he does, so you can keep the cards rolling.
* Roadhog happens to be one of the biggest hit boxes in the game, next to Reinhardt, and D.Va.
* Without a shield, Roadhog tends to feed enemy ultimates, especially to heroes like Sombra, and Tracer.
* Your  best bet to counter this subtle weakness is to either allow your main  tank \(Reinhardt, Orisa, or D.VA\) to push forward, waddle around enemy  lines, or Hook Shot the enemy into your team.
* With Roadhog's ultimate, Whole Hog, you can really make enough noise to force the enemy team to focus you.
* The aiming takes some time to get down, and if you can tag an enemy, well you've mastered Roadhog.
* I  would do your best to remind everyone that you got a kill or two, it  will really build their confidence in you. Not that you should care,  you're Roadhog.

**DPS/Offense**

* If tanking is not your style, or your teammates have locked in as a tank, the second suggestion is choose a DPS.
* DPS  is crucial to winning rounds \(it's also the most picked, especially in  silver\). It's fine to get as much practice as you can with your favorite  DPS hero in quickplay.
* When it comes time for the competitive grind, you should always be willing to sacrifice a role in order to benefit the team.
* Now  this goes both ways. In the first round of fighting, if you decide that  you will be better off playing DPS than someone else, communicate with  them. Most of the time they will understand.
* As long as you request to become the new DPS with logical reasoning, there is no way for your teammates to argue.
* If  you have a team that is real headstrong, your best bet is to ask who  has the GOLD medal for DPS in the first round. Since the gold medal  doesn't matter too much in the first round, you're better off killing  the trolls with kindness.
* Most  people \(especially in silver\) act defiant when being called out for  misplaying their role. In their brains, it seems to be some sort of  logical fallacy that you are not understanding with their playstyle.
* In  any case, you can always switch to DPS, \(away from the meta\) and still  confidently carry your team. As long as you are up to the task.
* A solid offensive/defensive DPS hero you should master with is Soldier 76. Soldier has wonderful survivability.
* His  Biotic Field, is without a doubt, a crucial team heal. It's perfect for  defending a point, and choke points \(the main entrance for the  attacking team\). It can even be placed on top of the payload. Your  teammates will love you.
* He  isn't necessarily a flank hero, but with some practice, you can out  maneuver most opponents. His Sprint is a great ability, yet, it's almost  a crutch.
* When  you have to switch roles or you decided to play another DPS, because  you can't get Soldier to open up to you emotionally, you'll be lost  without his Sprint.
* Helix Rockets WIN GAMES.
* I  highly suggest you take the time to drop on over to the Custom games  section. Add some easy bots, \(Lucio would be great practice. He's hard  to hit, has an auto heal, and climbs walls.\) and change the settings to  your liking.
* Really  focus on tagging some fools with your Helix Rockets, and follow up by  capping your prey as he/she struggles to get a game of hide n seek  going.
* Since  the beginning of competitive season one, Soldier 76's ultimate ability  has impressed me the most. It has to be coupled with some careful  planning of your route.
* Always  keep moving, let your teammates know you have your ultimate ready. If  the time to strike is now then go for it, although, don't be afraid to  save his ultimate for a better opportunity.
* If teammates start flopping around you like fish and Helix Rockets, then you're better off saving your ultimate.

**Healer/Offense**

* If  healing is your forte, I highly suggest playing Lucio on offense. Lucio  can be a powerhouse when coupled with a single target healer, such as,  Moira, Mercy, or Zenyatta.
* Lucio  excels at gliding around the arena as if he somehow has accumulated  enough knowledge to know where the best hiding spots are. He almost  reminds me of a mosquito, if played correctly. He's a nasty little  bugger.
* I  say this in the sense, that, he's great at defending a point. Utilizing  his Wall Glide, you can expect to dominate the outer rim of any close  quarters arena. He invented parkour, before it was wild.
* It  will take some time, but you will get it. I know you, and how you  think.  His DPS can easily finish off foes, with some practice.
* Let  your teammates melt shields, eat healers, etc., and you take care of  the rest. The team is going on break, so you can handle it, I believe in  you.
* Lucio's Soundwave is another perfect ability that allows you to make those heart\-stopping environmental kills.
* Just  be sure to wave at your enemy in the midst of them falling, and most  likely uninstalling the game. Waving is a rule now, Roadhog started it I  guess.
* The  nice part about the way he heals is that he doesn't have to baby sit  one teammate. Especially one that enjoys running off spawn camping with  Genji.
* His group heal can be crucial to most fights, and when charged with Amp It Up, you can expect a big boost to survivability.
* His healing ring can be switched to a speed boost with Crossfade. Keep in mind, Amp It Up affects both healing, and speed.
* You're  better off using the speed boost for instances such as: propelling your  team towards the objective, allowing your teammates to escape after an  enemy ultimate is unleashed, or after your ultimate has been triggered.
* The  only other character that can hold the point better than Lucio is  Winston. The reason for this is because of Winston's ultimate.
* Although,  Lucio's ultimate, Sound Barrier is very beneficial when it comes to a  last second save, after a major defense, from the opposing team. This  ability acts as an over shield to protect your teammates.
* Throw down some sick speed boost beats, and you can bet your team will have no problem chasing the enemy.
* Just make sure to switch back to healing if your teammates DPS wasn't enough to take care of the job, also fire them.

**Tank/Defense**

* When  it comes to defense, I tend to favor D.Va. She can be a little  emotional at times and you're best bet is to just let her vent and have  her moment.
* You don't want two tons of steel launching at you, and that's just her left hook.
* D.Va  is a great crowd control tank. She excels at flying behind enemy lines  with her Boosters, taking out low health healers/DPS, and returning in a  moments notice.
* D.Va's  Defense Matrix ability can protect you from enough DPS to find cover.  This ability can even hinder a few ultimates. One ultimate that comes to  mind is Reaper's Death Blossom.
* I like to think of Defense Matrix like your playing catch with the enemy.
* The  timing needs to be spot on, however, once you nail the timing, you can  easily relive an innocent game of catch that a young man and his father  would most likely have. Not to say I've ever experienced that.
* D.Va's ace ability is definitely her Micro Missles.
* Countless  victims have seen the incandescent glare emitted from her mech as she  hunts down her prey, ultimately resulting in a few Micro Missles to  their face.
* D.Va  is lucky to have both of her ultimates be apart of her life line. With  D.Va you have her Call Mech, and Self Destruct, and it seems she's ready  to blow up at a moments notice.
* I still can't figure her out if I can be honest, which I always am.
* D.Va's ultimate Self Destruct can be avoided, if an enemy is behind a wall, or the payload.
* The momentum from her Boosters will carry on into Self Destruct.
* Make certain you have a room full of oblivious enemies, before you unleash her Self Destruct.
* Before reaching her Call Mech ultimate, D.Va needs to land shots like it's target practice.
* In fact, her DPS is actually deadly when she is out of her mech. I call that her right hook.

**DPS/Defense**

* DPS  on defense is a bit tricky. If you've mastered some offense style  heroes such as: Soldier 76, Reaper, or Tracer, then I suggest adjusting  your play style to an aggressive front.
* What  I mean by this is having enough confidence and communication with your  team, in order to progressively obtain gradual control of the  battlefield.
* Soldier,  Reaper, and Tracer are all perfect for this mission. Keep in mind that  Reaper and Tracer have somewhat of a higher learning curve. In a way,  the aforementioned heroes are really a beast unmatched if not contained  properly.
* I  suggest practicing with one of your favorite offensive heroes in quick  play. You can then decide whether or not to choose a hero for the  correct situation.
* That  particular awareness will come with time. You may already have such a  strong situational awareness that you don't need help from anyone  because you grew up in Brooklyn.
* Congratulations, Hip/Hop Rap was just developing at the same time you were.
* You  can certainly carry a team on your back like Lebron, Brett Favre, and  Calvin Johnson of the Detroit Lions, without playing a DPS hero.
* On  defense, your main objective is to defend the point and/or payload. We  don't have cool manuals like we did back in the early days of World of  Warcraft.
* I  will have to explicitly state that there are defensive heroes that  comprise the Overwatch roster. You should get to know them, they are  pretty great.
* Unfortunately,  they are frequently misunderstood in a match up. Personally, if I'm  facing an opponent that is stacking shields, I will volunteer or have  someone else switch to a Junkrat.
* This  hero would personally be my first choice due to the fact that he can  not only melt shields with his Frag Launcher, but his other abilities  allow him to be a mobile, ruthless, killing machine.
* His Concussion Mine is the first ability that enables Junkrat into this play style.
* He can launch himself as if he's the football an NFL punter has kicked, and he can really make use of that hang time.
* Junkrat's  Steel Trap ability is great at immobilizing tanks, mainly, and anyone  else that wants to step inside this wicked creation of Junkrat.
* His  ultimate, Rip Tire, excels at disrupting an aggressive push by the  enemy team. The Rip Tire follows along the play style of mobility by  allowing you to directly control it, climb walls, and of course, remote  detonation.
* You're  always better off timing your ultimate with your team. Junkrat's Rip  Tire can be used in a various amount of scenarios that it's definitely  considered a solo ultimate.
* What  I mean by this is that, given the circumstances, \(The enemy healer/DPS  are on their way back to the fight, or you have a chance to single out  an enemy that isn't in vision of the tank, etc.\) you could launch Rip  Tire without the help from your teams ultimate.

**Healer/Defense**

* Defensive  healing starts extremely slow, and eventually snowballs into a  monstrosity that will have you questioning your very existence as a  healer.
* With some mental training, you can easily focus yourself and prioritize your efforts in order to maximize the amount of healing.
* Hopefully,  we can even have the attention span that so many Overwatch players seem  to lack in silver, so that we can actually get some kills too!
* For your hero selection, you can bet that any of the heroes in the support tier will be viable for defensive healing.
* Except Symmetra, who in fact doesn't heal, and should most likely be placed in the defensive tier of the hero selection.
* One  hero that really prospers as a defensive healer is Zenyatta. He has a  higher learning curve, but practice with him can really give you a  greater understanding of defensive healing, situational healing, and a  multitude of other minor intricacies that you will develop as you become  familiar with him.
* For  starters, Zenyatta's Orb of Destruction is your primary arsenal that  will enable you to get those fancy head shots. You can control these  orbs to either fire in rapid succession, or charge them into a fury of  projectiles. His aiming is one of the toughest to master, and this is  one of the reasons why he's so difficult to pick up.
* Zenyatta's abilities Orb of Harmony and Orb of Discord are his methods of healing your allies, and adding a debuff to the enemy.
* I  encourage you to practice the amount of time it takes to heal each  teammate. My reasoning for this suggestion is that in the heat of  battle, you will find yourself struggling to keep your allies out of the  danger zone.
* Luckily, you should have a second healer to make up for it.
* Otherwise it means your team has something personally against you and they lack the confidence to actually tell you in person.
* Zenyatta's Orb of Discord works the exact opposite of his innocent little brother.
* It  adds a debuff that will weaken your foes and make them bow to the sheer  power of it. If your enemies are still talking a big game, go ahead and  finish them off with your Orb of Destruction.
* Zenyatta's  mission is to cycle through the enemies enabling your team to focus on  one. In this instance, you should be communicating with your team to let  them know the enemy you've set your Orb of Discord on.
* Transcendence is Zenyatta's ultimate and it can change the course of the game dramatically.
* Upon  activation, Zenyatta lights up like the Rockefeller Center Christmas  tree supercharged with a 6.2L V8 Engine. Your teammates become  invulnerable when encapsulated in your ball of fun and can steadily move  in for the kill.
* This  will require consistent communication up until you start eliminating  the enemy team. I would turn your mic off after that, your mission is  complete.

**Community**

* There  are many changes to the game itself since competitive season one. First  and foremost, with the establishment of the League, there has been a  huge increase in the player base.
* No  complaints here I can't tell you how many times I've had to give up on a  work of art that nobody plays anymore. No big deal though we have the  latest and greatest.

Another feature that wasn't around season one, yet isn't necessarily provided by Blizzard themselves, is Discord.

* I have found plenty of people to play competitively with through there. You should just check it out for yourself.
* My  opinion doesn't count, or even exist really I'm just a piece of paper.  Yeah you just talked to a piece of paper for the last ten minutes. I  hope you enjoyed it.

*These  tips will need to come with some blood, sweat, and tears. If you can  apply these tips to your daily grind of climbing out of silver you  should see progress. Good luck and keep the cartridge in it's socket.*",,False,,0,False,Climbing Out of Silver,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Advice'}]",,False,6.0,Advice,0.0,,,False,t3_8gjn4f,,dark,,,public,21.0,,{},,,False,[],,False,,,{},Advice,,21,,,,self,1525289853.0,,,,,True,,1525314221.0,richtext,6.0,,,,self.Competitiveoverwatch,,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lately, I&amp;#39;ve  noticed a ton of people struggle to get back up to that &amp;#39;platinum&amp;#39;  rank.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether  it&amp;#39;s calling out pregame strats, ultimates, or even singling an enemy  out of position with Zenyatta&amp;#39;s Orb of Discord, communication is key to  winning games. Communicating with the team may take some getting used  to.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Your  best bet to counter this subtle weakness is to either allow your main  tank (Reinhardt, Orisa, or D.VA) to push forward, waddle around enemy  lines, or Hook Shot the enemy into your team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With Roadhog&amp;#39;s ultimate, Whole Hog, you can really make enough noise to force the enemy team to focus you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The aiming takes some time to get down, and if you can tag an enemy, well you&amp;#39;ve mastered Roadhog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I  would do your best to remind everyone that you got a kill or two, it  will really build their confidence in you. Not that you should care,  you&amp;#39;re Roadhog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DPS/Offense&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If tanking is not your style, or your teammates have locked in as a tank, the second suggestion is choose a DPS.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Now  this goes both ways. In the first round of fighting, if you decide that  you will be better off playing DPS than someone else, communicate with  them. Most of the time they will understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As long as you request to become the new DPS with logical reasoning, there is no way for your teammates to argue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If  you have a team that is real headstrong, your best bet is to ask who  has the GOLD medal for DPS in the first round. Since the gold medal  doesn&amp;#39;t matter too much in the first round, you&amp;#39;re better off killing  the trolls with kindness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most  people (especially in silver) act defiant when being called out for  misplaying their role. In their brains, it seems to be some sort of  logical fallacy that you are not understanding with their playstyle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In  any case, you can always switch to DPS, (away from the meta) and still  confidently carry your team. As long as you are up to the task.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;When  you have to switch roles or you decided to play another DPS, because  you can&amp;#39;t get Soldier to open up to you emotionally, you&amp;#39;ll be lost  without his Sprint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helix Rockets WIN GAMES.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I  highly suggest you take the time to drop on over to the Custom games  section. Add some easy bots, (Lucio would be great practice. He&amp;#39;s hard  to hit, has an auto heal, and climbs walls.) and change the settings to  your liking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Really  focus on tagging some fools with your Helix Rockets, and follow up by  capping your prey as he/she struggles to get a game of hide n seek  going.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since  the beginning of competitive season one, Soldier 76&amp;#39;s ultimate ability  has impressed me the most. It has to be coupled with some careful  planning of your route.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always  keep moving, let your teammates know you have your ultimate ready. If  the time to strike is now then go for it, although, don&amp;#39;t be afraid to  save his ultimate for a better opportunity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If teammates start flopping around you like fish and Helix Rockets, then you&amp;#39;re better off saving your ultimate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healer/Offense&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If  healing is your forte, I highly suggest playing Lucio on offense. Lucio  can be a powerhouse when coupled with a single target healer, such as,  Moira, Mercy, or Zenyatta.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lucio  excels at gliding around the arena as if he somehow has accumulated  enough knowledge to know where the best hiding spots are. He almost  reminds me of a mosquito, if played correctly. He&amp;#39;s a nasty little  bugger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I  say this in the sense, that, he&amp;#39;s great at defending a point. Utilizing  his Wall Glide, you can expect to dominate the outer rim of any close  quarters arena. He invented parkour, before it was wild.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It  will take some time, but you will get it. I know you, and how you  think.  His DPS can easily finish off foes, with some practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let  your teammates melt shields, eat healers, etc., and you take care of  the rest. The team is going on break, so you can handle it, I believe in  you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lucio&amp;#39;s Soundwave is another perfect ability that allows you to make those heart-stopping environmental kills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just  be sure to wave at your enemy in the midst of them falling, and most  likely uninstalling the game. Waving is a rule now, Roadhog started it I  guess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The  nice part about the way he heals is that he doesn&amp;#39;t have to baby sit  one teammate. Especially one that enjoys running off spawn camping with  Genji.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His group heal can be crucial to most fights, and when charged with Amp It Up, you can expect a big boost to survivability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His healing ring can be switched to a speed boost with Crossfade. Keep in mind, Amp It Up affects both healing, and speed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;#39;re  better off using the speed boost for instances such as: propelling your  team towards the objective, allowing your teammates to escape after an  enemy ultimate is unleashed, or after your ultimate has been triggered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The  only other character that can hold the point better than Lucio is  Winston. The reason for this is because of Winston&amp;#39;s ultimate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although,  Lucio&amp;#39;s ultimate, Sound Barrier is very beneficial when it comes to a  last second save, after a major defense, from the opposing team. This  ability acts as an over shield to protect your teammates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throw down some sick speed boost beats, and you can bet your team will have no problem chasing the enemy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just make sure to switch back to healing if your teammates DPS wasn&amp;#39;t enough to take care of the job, also fire them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tank/Defense&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When  it comes to defense, I tend to favor D.Va. She can be a little  emotional at times and you&amp;#39;re best bet is to just let her vent and have  her moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don&amp;#39;t want two tons of steel launching at you, and that&amp;#39;s just her left hook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;D.Va  is a great crowd control tank. She excels at flying behind enemy lines  with her Boosters, taking out low health healers/DPS, and returning in a  moments notice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;D.Va&amp;#39;s  Defense Matrix ability can protect you from enough DPS to find cover.  This ability can even hinder a few ultimates. One ultimate that comes to  mind is Reaper&amp;#39;s Death Blossom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like to think of Defense Matrix like your playing catch with the enemy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The  timing needs to be spot on, however, once you nail the timing, you can  easily relive an innocent game of catch that a young man and his father  would most likely have. Not to say I&amp;#39;ve ever experienced that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;D.Va&amp;#39;s ace ability is definitely her Micro Missles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Countless  victims have seen the incandescent glare emitted from her mech as she  hunts down her prey, ultimately resulting in a few Micro Missles to  their face.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;D.Va  is lucky to have both of her ultimates be apart of her life line. With  D.Va you have her Call Mech, and Self Destruct, and it seems she&amp;#39;s ready  to blow up at a moments notice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I still can&amp;#39;t figure her out if I can be honest, which I always am.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;D.Va&amp;#39;s ultimate Self Destruct can be avoided, if an enemy is behind a wall, or the payload.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The momentum from her Boosters will carry on into Self Destruct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make certain you have a room full of oblivious enemies, before you unleash her Self Destruct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before reaching her Call Mech ultimate, D.Va needs to land shots like it&amp;#39;s target practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In fact, her DPS is actually deadly when she is out of her mech. I call that her right hook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DPS/Defense&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DPS  on defense is a bit tricky. If you&amp;#39;ve mastered some offense style  heroes such as: Soldier 76, Reaper, or Tracer, then I suggest adjusting  your play style to an aggressive front.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What  I mean by this is having enough confidence and communication with your  team, in order to progressively obtain gradual control of the  battlefield.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soldier,  Reaper, and Tracer are all perfect for this mission. Keep in mind that  Reaper and Tracer have somewhat of a higher learning curve. In a way,  the aforementioned heroes are really a beast unmatched if not contained  properly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I  suggest practicing with one of your favorite offensive heroes in quick  play. You can then decide whether or not to choose a hero for the  correct situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That  particular awareness will come with time. You may already have such a  strong situational awareness that you don&amp;#39;t need help from anyone  because you grew up in Brooklyn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Congratulations, Hip/Hop Rap was just developing at the same time you were.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You  can certainly carry a team on your back like Lebron, Brett Favre, and  Calvin Johnson of the Detroit Lions, without playing a DPS hero.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On  defense, your main objective is to defend the point and/or payload. We  don&amp;#39;t have cool manuals like we did back in the early days of World of  Warcraft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I  will have to explicitly state that there are defensive heroes that  comprise the Overwatch roster. You should get to know them, they are  pretty great.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately,  they are frequently misunderstood in a match up. Personally, if I&amp;#39;m  facing an opponent that is stacking shields, I will volunteer or have  someone else switch to a Junkrat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This  hero would personally be my first choice due to the fact that he can  not only melt shields with his Frag Launcher, but his other abilities  allow him to be a mobile, ruthless, killing machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His Concussion Mine is the first ability that enables Junkrat into this play style.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He can launch himself as if he&amp;#39;s the football an NFL punter has kicked, and he can really make use of that hang time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Junkrat&amp;#39;s  Steel Trap ability is great at immobilizing tanks, mainly, and anyone  else that wants to step inside this wicked creation of Junkrat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His  ultimate, Rip Tire, excels at disrupting an aggressive push by the  enemy team. The Rip Tire follows along the play style of mobility by  allowing you to directly control it, climb walls, and of course, remote  detonation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;#39;re  always better off timing your ultimate with your team. Junkrat&amp;#39;s Rip  Tire can be used in a various amount of scenarios that it&amp;#39;s definitely  considered a solo ultimate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What  I mean by this is that, given the circumstances, (The enemy healer/DPS  are on their way back to the fight, or you have a chance to single out  an enemy that isn&amp;#39;t in vision of the tank, etc.) you could launch Rip  Tire without the help from your teams ultimate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healer/Defense&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defensive  healing starts extremely slow, and eventually snowballs into a  monstrosity that will have you questioning your very existence as a  healer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With some mental training, you can easily focus yourself and prioritize your efforts in order to maximize the amount of healing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hopefully,  we can even have the attention span that so many Overwatch players seem  to lack in silver, so that we can actually get some kills too!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For your hero selection, you can bet that any of the heroes in the support tier will be viable for defensive healing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Except Symmetra, who in fact doesn&amp;#39;t heal, and should most likely be placed in the defensive tier of the hero selection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One  hero that really prospers as a defensive healer is Zenyatta. He has a  higher learning curve, but practice with him can really give you a  greater understanding of defensive healing, situational healing, and a  multitude of other minor intricacies that you will develop as you become  familiar with him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For  starters, Zenyatta&amp;#39;s Orb of Destruction is your primary arsenal that  will enable you to get those fancy head shots. You can control these  orbs to either fire in rapid succession, or charge them into a fury of  projectiles. His aiming is one of the toughest to master, and this is  one of the reasons why he&amp;#39;s so difficult to pick up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zenyatta&amp;#39;s abilities Orb of Harmony and Orb of Discord are his methods of healing your allies, and adding a debuff to the enemy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I  encourage you to practice the amount of time it takes to heal each  teammate. My reasoning for this suggestion is that in the heat of  battle, you will find yourself struggling to keep your allies out of the  danger zone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luckily, you should have a second healer to make up for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Otherwise it means your team has something personally against you and they lack the confidence to actually tell you in person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zenyatta&amp;#39;s Orb of Discord works the exact opposite of his innocent little brother.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It  adds a debuff that will weaken your foes and make them bow to the sheer  power of it. If your enemies are still talking a big game, go ahead and  finish them off with your Orb of Destruction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zenyatta&amp;#39;s  mission is to cycle through the enemies enabling your team to focus on  one. In this instance, you should be communicating with your team to let  them know the enemy you&amp;#39;ve set your Orb of Discord on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transcendence is Zenyatta&amp;#39;s ultimate and it can change the course of the game dramatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upon  activation, Zenyatta lights up like the Rockefeller Center Christmas  tree supercharged with a 6.2L V8 Engine. Your teammates become  invulnerable when encapsulated in your ball of fun and can steadily move  in for the kill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This  will require consistent communication up until you start eliminating  the enemy team. I would turn your mic off after that, your mission is  complete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There  are many changes to the game itself since competitive season one. First  and foremost, with the establishment of the League, there has been a  huge increase in the player base.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No  complaints here I can&amp;#39;t tell you how many times I&amp;#39;ve had to give up on a  work of art that nobody plays anymore. No big deal though we have the  latest and greatest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another feature that wasn&amp;#39;t around season one, yet isn&amp;#39;t necessarily provided by Blizzard themselves, is Discord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have found plenty of people to play competitively with through there. You should just check it out for yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My  opinion doesn&amp;#39;t count, or even exist really I&amp;#39;m just a piece of paper.  Yeah you just talked to a piece of paper for the last ten minutes. I  hope you enjoyed it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These  tips will need to come with some blood, sweat, and tears. If you can  apply these tips to your daily grind of climbing out of silver you  should see progress. Good luck and keep the cartridge in it&amp;#39;s socket.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,DDLC,"...and I think it's my favorite one yet.  I was outside my comfort zone with this one, but it was definitely worth it.  I gotta give props to Dan and Team Salvato for making such an incredible game with such memorable characters and great writing.  I think this game is gonna stick with me for a while. I don't think I've ever gotten so emotionally attached to a cast of characters before.  Not because it was a dating simulator or anything...


Before I continue my thoughts, there's something I need to get out of the way first.  DDLC is definitely one of my favorite let's plays I've ever recorded this year, but it's also the one I feel the most self-conscious about.  I'm actually a bit terrified of what people will think of it.  I feel like some recurring things in the series would drive some away, which are a deliberately bad impression of Vin Diesel, to the point when it doesn't remotely sound like him, and (possibly) the voices I gave to the Dokis - I actually wanted to make them sound like regular girls - but that might just be me being insecure.  You seem like a very open-minded community, though.


I'm gonna clean about something.  This let's play is actually the second recording I've done for this game.  What's funny is that it took me two days to record the original take in its entirety, but I wasn't satisfied with how it turned out.  Plus, I wanted an excuse to play it again ^-^.  In the original take, I wasn't trying to go for any specific routes (Day 2 was Natsuki, Day 3 was Sayori,) and I guess that applies to the reshoot as well.  But my first poem appealed to Sayori in take two, so I decided to commit to her route.  I tried appealing to Natsuki in Act 2, but we all know how that turned out.


I think it was back during the planning phase for my channel when I first heard about Doki Doki Literature Club.  I heard about it being a psychological/meta horror game under the facade of a visual novel, and that just made me curious.  It made me so curious, I had decided that I would do a series for this game later in the year.  My original plan was to begin recording for the series in the Fall.  I knew about some of the twists ahead of time (like Sayori's and Yuri's deaths, and Monika's self-awareness), and it didn't make them any less shocking.  It was actually even more so, because I knew what was going to happen.


But I think what ultimately gave me the push to do the series much earlier was finding this subreddit, and spending the past couple months here looking at the fanart, reading the discussions, and...witnessing so many shitposts, and it only made me want to play the game even more.  If it weren't for this community, I don't think I would have gotten the push to start the let's play sooner, and it was definitely worth it.  I really got to thank you for that.


Whenever I do playthroughs, I normally take a comedic approach and try to make my videos as entertaining as possible (I'm one hell of an oddball/trapped in a perpetual state of awkwardness).  But after Act 1, it changes to a more serious playthrough with a few jokes in-between.  If anyone wants to watch the series, I'll share the link to its playlist right [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc6TUnvEu4C1cdOaFBa5PfA2cswHc3BPb).
