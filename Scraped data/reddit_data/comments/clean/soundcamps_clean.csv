k3hn2ww,1696455645.0,LostLandsMusicFest,Yoda70445,"HA! I LOVE THIS! 🥲

So I’m on the USA east coast. Lost Lands 2019 was my first EDM/bass music festival. And lemme tell you what… that opened the door for me to see what’s possible. 80-100K headbangers (lemme say that again) HEADBANGERS who know how to get down and have a good time.

I love Lost Lands and that year will always hold a special place in my heart. I’ve been to LL 19, LL Reunion (during Covid), LL 22, and Shambhala 23 (this year).

Here’s the main differences I can tell you about:
LL:
-merch is a HUGE part of American EDM culture so that makes an impact
-it is commercial so yes Alcohol is overpriced 
-food cost can vary but is generally overpriced for the quality/quantity of food
-they’ve added more and more stages and soundcamps
-more stages allows for more artists. And a bigger budget to book more
-the hardest pill to swallow (not as PLUR as shambs 💔) with MANY new people coming every year without intention of safe raving and desire to lookout for others ( Brads and Chads)
-expensive to book with the price of ticket separate from camping (especially if you don’t have ppl to split the camping cost)
-the security line has always been great and fast(unlike the lifetime of a wait for Shambs as ya know)

Shambhala from my experience:
-20K people or so if I’ve got that right? So the crowd is smaller
- not every person is a headbanger so not really much moshing or neck breaking occurs. ( lack of rails contributes too)
-THE FOOD 😍 so affordable and better IMO
-the stage design IMO is slightly better though X does pour $$ into his production very much so for LL. Just nicer to have only 6 stages to focus on instead of all the extra spaces.
- People aren’t obsessed over getting merch and I LOVE IT. More creative outfits and less gentrification of EDM wear. Plus the wallet can appreciate it too. 
- the river. BLESSED to have it. Legend valley is great but boy it can be rough walking for miles and miles in a weekend without any water to cool off
-general festival size is manageable for most. LL is kinda bigger than ever and absolutely huge.
-the PLUR vibes I got blessed with by my farmily were unmatched. Not that LL doesn’t have any but with the variety of newcomers and others without care for your own existence I have to give it to the farm for this 💪. **Oh yeah I’ve had my phone stolen at Lost Lands, but we won’t get into that**

You can pretty much go as big as you want lol. My group only had about 60 people but there was plenty of space for us in the spot they gave us and was pretty cool to just set up however we pleased. 

All you need to start one is buy the vibe village pass and then you can just start sending people the link to join. You don’t have to have it all planned out right away. Pretty sure you have until like a month before the festival before you need to have your group finalized. So there’s plenty of time for people to join your vibe village. 

I will say that like the other commenter mentioned, you will basically be surrounded by Soundcamps on all sides. And these sound camps will go until 8am the next morning. This past year we were camped in the air village section, and were legit steps away from 3 separate soundcamps. Who would all play at the same time, until sunrise. So be prepared for basically no sleep. It’s doable with noise cancelling headphones but definitely not ideal if you are looking for some good rest. Word to the wise is party so hard you could fall asleep standing up so by the time you actually needed sleep, noise was the last thing you were worried about. 
This past year elements fell short on directions and signage (mostly for the vibe villages) and I heard a lot of people had trouble navigating the camping maps and how to find certain camps. Hoping they will fix that next year. 

Otherwise vibe villages were dope! No need to worry about getting there early to secure a good camp spot bc your spot is already selected for your group a couple weeks before. &amp; that way you don’t gotta try to meet up w various people before the gate if you wanna camp right next to them.

Burners have no problem earning their fun. Elements has always been a festival that didn't just hand shit to you. You gotta come prepared and ready for shit to go wrong. There's people on here pissed that because they spent money for glamping they shouldn't have to hear the soundcamps, for example. A lot of people are expecting forest or coachella, and this is not that and never has been. 

&gt;They specifically put faith in Elements to be the best choice, and I think some of them lost that after this. It's no longer ""oh this went wrong, ah well"" it becomes ""oh this went wrong and maybe this wouldn't have happened if I had picked xyz other fest

You're speaking to someone who went to 2021 and *came back.* this year's festival wasn't even close to how bad 2021 was, and even with all that was bad in 21, it's still my favorite elements.",1.0,1.0,/r/ElementsMusicFestival/comments/15shzkd/festival_rating_b/jwlf2t9/,"> I'd love to know what you think the difference is between burners and regular attendees?

jwbc5eh,1692121703.0,ElementsMusicFestival,amanduhmarie22,"Probably won’t be back again unless they scale capacity back. (Which I know isn’t going to happen bc money). Went for the first time last year and had an absolutely magical time. I can’t even begin to describe how perfect last year was for me. It was like I found the perfect festival lineup/capacity/vibe everything. This year felt a bit lackluster. I still had an amazing time and still felt the amazing vibes but the new set up is just not it. Fire and earth in the gravel is terrible. It’s like those stages lost their entire personality. Plus dancing on gravel was so rough on my feet. don’t get me wrong I love the upscaled production but man the stages in the forest last year felt so much more intimate and magical.  

Pros: the sound quality at all the stages was nice (minus the sound bleed obviously) i loved how far I could be from any of the stages and still hear it perfectly and feel the bass. 
The art is awesome. The air stage was still beautiful as ever and loved just walking around in the forest. The vibes were still awesome, was so pleasantly surprised at how nice people were moving though the crowds. Met so many amazing people. &amp; honestly the bathrooms were very clean all weekend!!! Always had toilet paper &amp; there was always soap and paper towel. 

Cons: 1) no chill spots outside the forest / basically the entire layout outside the forest. Earth stage had the same issue fire had last year. Trying to move in and out was awful. Couldn’t even stand in the back and chill bc that was literally the only spot people could get past. 2) Security/planning. I don’t understand why the hell the people directing traffic were forcing everyone to turn right at will call. Luckily my group just ignored the guy and drove past but like what the hell. It was an entire shit show that could’ve been avoided very easily. Security in/out of the festival grounds. I understand they want to be strict bc of what happened at other festis this year but they were taking it too far. Spending 5+ minutes per person ripping though every pocket and item and being assholes about stuff for no reason. saw a girl in front of me get yelled at for bringing in a flashlight no bigger than my thumb. It was on a key ring (probs just her personal keys) and she was struggling to get it off and the lady was just yelling at her the whole time. The inconsistencies in security really got on my nerves. 
3) Soundcamps. Last year I was camped close to them so I knew to expect the loud music but this year was sooo soooo much worse. There were twice as many and my group camp was surrounded by at least 3. I didn’t get but maybe 8 hours of sleep the entire weekend. I’m not expecting it to be quiet or for people to not play music. I do think the soundcamps are dope. I just wish there was a better way to have the soundcamps located a bit further if they are playing until sunrise every day. Sunday night was awful. It was like every camp turned up their bass to max volume. Was dealing w someone having a panic attack and even sitting in the car it was like we were being rattled by bass haha. Twas a bit much. 4) lastly the vendors. Not sure if this was an elements thing or vendors thing, but fuck that tip screen. I didn’t even know until Saturday night you could skip that screen. I got breakfast one morning and this dude literally slopped some old tater tots &amp; eggs onto a plate and handed it to me and it was like $30 and I’m like why would I tip 18% for that?!?! Everything was entirely way to expensive. I understand festivals will always be stupid expensive but this year was just too much. 

Overall I still had an awesome time but then doubling the capacity kinda ruined the intimate vibe for me.

jrwii12,1689315207.0,makinghiphop,DJGrumbleOfficial,"What's up man. Kinda going backwards with my response, but what you're doing with the playlists is what I'm trying to do right now myself. That's one area I haven't really experimented with much until now. I've created a couple spotify playlists with mostly my production, and I'm working on getting people to save/follow them. I've never ran ads on social media but from what you described it seems like it can be cost effective. What I do is just pin a playlist to my Artist Pick and it picks up a few follows per day. My long-term goal is to get a few playlists with thousands of followers and then monetize them by becoming a playlist curator for PlaylistPush/SubmitHub/etc. As for your specific questions:

(1) I stuck with PlaylistPush just because that's the one I tried first based on reviews, and their playlists seem to be pretty high quality overall - no botted streams. I've made accounts with SubmitHub and SoundCamps but just never committed $$ to them. SoundCamps seemed like I was spending a LOT more to pitch to fewer playlists compared to PP.

(2) I kinda mix what I shop to rappers vs my self-published discography. Most of the stuff I shop for major label placements I keep off Spotify. I haven't run into any pitfalls as far as distributing the same beats that I shop to artists, BUT that's because I also don't use Content ID on anything. I deliberately keep everything out of Google/Meta Content ID because then everyone who uses a beat will start getting copyright strikes on YT/FB/IG etc. One of the main things that helped my beats go viral was YouTubers using my beats off SoundCloud in their videos. I allow all my beats to be downloaded for free and used with credit. I probably wouldn't be where I am today if I didn't have my whole catalog basically free on SoundCloud. When I sell a beat to a local/indie artist what they're essentially paying for is the extended HQ beat + stems.

(3) I think building playlists of your music is a great idea, as I discussed before, that's something I am working on. People tend to have short attention spans and usually can't be bothered to click through your discography and explore all of your releases in-depth. So putting your music in a more digestible format like a playlist I think would definitely improve your engagement and algorithmic scores.

My top-performing tracks on Spotify have popularity scores around 50%. In the last year or so, I've noticed a positive feedback loop occurring where my songs are heavily recommended to users in algorithmic playlists (mainly Radio), then they like/share/playlist the song, which causes the rank to go higher, which causes more engagement, etc. So I think I've finally got the sweet spot of Spotify popularity where the algorithm is recommending me to basically anyone listening to instrumental hip hop. My monthly listeners are going up by several thousand a day, I've never seen anything like it honestly.",2.0,2.0,/r/makinghiphop/comments/14xvfvj/how_much_do_you_need_to_earn_monthly_to_quit_your/jrwii12/,"What's up man.

My long-term goal is to get a few playlists with thousands of followers and then monetize them by becoming a playlist curator for PlaylistPush/SubmitHub/etc. As for your specific questions (1) I stuck with PlaylistPush just because that's the one I tried first based on reviews, and their playlists seem to be pretty high quality overall - no botted streams. I've made accounts with SubmitHub and SoundCamps but just never committed $$ to them. SoundCamps seemed like I was spending a LOT more to pitch to fewer playlists compared to PP. (2) I kinda mix what I shop to rappers vs my self-published discography. Most of the stuff I shop for major label placements I keep off Spotify. I haven't run into any pitfalls as far as distributing the same beats that I shop to artists, BUT that's because I also don't use Content ID on anything. I deliberately keep everything out of Google/Meta Content ID because then everyone who uses a beat will start getting copyright strikes on YT/FB/IG etc. One of the main things that helped my beats go viral was YouTubers using my beats off SoundCloud in their videos. I allow all my beats to be downloaded for free and used with credit. I probably wouldn't be where I am today if I didn't have my whole catalog basically free on SoundCloud. When I sell a beat to a local/indie artist what they're essentially paying for is the extended HQ beat  stems. (3) I think building playlists of your music is a great idea, as I discussed before, that's something I am working on. People tend to have short attention spans and usually can't be bothered to click through your discography and explore all of your releases in-depth. So putting your music in a more digestible format like a playlist I think would definitely improve your engagement and algorithmic scores. My top-performing tracks on Spotify have popularity scores around 50%. In the last year or so, I've noticed a positive feedback loop occurring where my songs are heavily recommended to users in algorithmic playlists (mainly Radio), then they like/share/playlist the song, which causes the rank to go higher, which causes more engagement, etc. So I think I've finally got the sweet spot of Spotify popularity where the algorithm is recommending me to basically anyone listening to instrumental hip hop. My monthly listeners are going up by several thousand a day, I've never seen anything like it honestly.","what's up man. kinda going backwards with my response, but what you're doing with the playlists is what i'm trying to do right now myself. that's one area i haven't really experimented with much until now. i've created a couple spotify playlists with mostly my production, and i'm working on getting people to save/follow them. i've never ran ads on social media but from what you described it seems like it can be cost effective. what i do is just pin a playlist to my artist pick and it picks up a few follows per day. my long-term goal is to get a few playlists with thousands of followers and then monetize them by becoming a playlist curator for playlistpush/submithub/etc. as for your specific questions (1) i stuck with playlistpush just because that's the one i tried first based on reviews, and their playlists seem to be pretty high quality overall - no botted streams. i've made accounts with submithub and soundcamps but just never committed $$ to them. soundcamps seemed like i was spending a lot more to pitch to fewer playlists compared to pp. (2) i kinda mix what i shop to rappers vs my self-published discography. most of the stuff i shop for major label placements i keep off spotify. i haven't run into any pitfalls as far as distributing the same beats that i shop to artists, but that's because i also don't use content id on anything. i deliberately keep everything out of google/meta content id because then everyone who uses a beat will start getting copyright strikes on yt/fb/ig etc. one of the main things that helped my beats go viral was youtubers using my beats off soundcloud in their videos. i allow all my beats to be downloaded for free and used with credit. i probably wouldn't be where i am today if i didn't have my whole catalog basically free on soundcloud. when i sell a beat to a local/indie artist what they're essentially paying for is the extended hq beat  stems.

intog36,1662788821.0,LostLandsMusicFest,Professional-Neck755,"Ok so I think I might be able to help with this one, Lost Lands 2018 was my first festival. I was very nervous as I had no idea what to expect, got to the gates and had to wait for a pretty good while before even getting to my site, but that has improved a lot over the years. All that waiting is worth it the moment you fell that first wave of bass hit your chest, there's nothing else quite like it. Lost Lands is as hyped up as it is for a reason, there's no other place like it on earth. Its my true happy place on this earth so much so that me and my wife got married there in 2019 by wompy woods during a marauda set by a dinosaur statue.

What to expect: Heavy dubstep and bass all weekend long, some of the coolest humans you will ever meet, PLUR is such a good mindset. Also you will see more ass than you have ever seen in your life lol.

What to look forward to: Honestly the same as what to expect, great music and people.

What to be wary of: I've personally never had it happen to me but theft is sometimes a problem from what ive seen on this reddit and heard from people, but if you keep stuff inside your tent and coolers and valuables locked away in vehicles then you should be good, I also wear a fanny pack so no one can take anything out of my pockets.

Trading things: Some people like to trade things, for instance kandi which are the bracelets people make, some people might also trade some other things M for L or something like that if you know what I mean.

What do we do here: Start you mornings by eating breakfast and getting ready for the day like normal then you walk to the festival grounds, once gates open you find the stage the artist you want to see is at and enjoy the show, be it dance, headbang, mosh, sit on the ground (not in the pit I hope) whatever it is as long as you are having fun and youre not hurting anyone then you do you. Main shows go from 2pm-Midnight then soundcamps open from midnight to 4 am

What are sound camps you might ask: sound camps are just smaller stages around the festival with reduced volume due to time and noise ordinance I assume, in my opinion the djs that play these stages are usually lesser known djs but do not let that make it seem like they go any less hard or will be any less heavy.

If you have any questions just ask me also on the website they have checklists of stuff you will need to bring, be prepared for any situation, I hope this helps.

Or you're not happy that others are not taking their spot every year? I feel like this past year was ridiculous with the amount of different artists and X is constantly trying to help new artists that are up and coming. I mean the dude is trying to find you new headliners everyday of his life it seems. The real question is if you're actually listening to the newer ""different"" artists he's bringing into the light. 

Also, I like the repetition. Others may not and that's okay, but it feels like a family that includes the artists. Like I know a few names that will always be there and I love that because it's like I'm going to a family reunion and I'm seeing how these people have changed over just one year. 

Anyways, while I kinda understand your point, I do not agree and I think lost lands is consistently trying to find new music. The crowd is not very accepting of different genres so gotta give it time. But they literally have artist workshops and X does sweepstakes and challenges for new artists. Give credit where it's due.

Favorite: Electric Forest

&amp;#x200B;

Lost Lands: I might get shit for this one, but I went in 2018 and had WAY too many problems - most of which were avoidable. People were dropping because of heat stroke, and the festival had maybe one dinosaur installation's worth of shade for 40,000 people raging in 90+ degree weather. The water station lines were so bad by Day 2 that I bought water and handed it out for the entire weekend. Also saw ambulances driving up to the soundcamps every night, and more overdoses than I had seen at every other festival combined. On the last night, staff told us we all had to get out as soon as possible due to ""bad weather"" that never came. They fucked us over with the shuttle schedules by changing the times last minute out of nowhere, leaving us all less than two hours to pack up everything and get out in the middle of the night with everyone scrambling. I heard someone almost got ran over in their tent because of this. The music was incredible and I had the time of my life, but I would never willingly go through that again.

Electric Forest: Where do I even start. Forest is another world - a sanctuary of love, color, art, freedom, and music. The first place I ever really felt at home. The first place where I learned how to let go. The place where I met the love of my life. There's so much to do and look at that you could really spend the whole weekend exploring if you wanted to. The high fives in the lines, the way the forest glows at night, the hundreds of memories and friends you make every year...it'll forever be worth the trip. The music is just a bonus, but whoever curates the lineup knows exactly what they're doing. This is the kind of festival where you don't really need to have any artists in mind to check out, because you can just wander around and find a new underrated one you like. A lot of them are not very well known or up-and-coming, but extremely talented. The multigenre aspect is great, as well. You can lay in the grass to some jam, headbang to some dubstep, get weird to some experimental bass, then party to house music till the sun comes up. I'm infinitely grateful to have discovered such a beautiful place.",68.0,,/r/festivals/comments/tp3kwy/your_favorite_and_least_favorable_festivals/i291twi/,"Least Favorite Lost Lands Favorite Electric Forest &x200B; Lost Lands I might get shit for this one, but I went in 2018 and had WAY too many problems - most of which were avoidable.

fjky0x8,1583436148.0,BurningMan,wolferton,"Like any city, there are different areas where different things happen. 

It's all dependent on the type of experience you want and how you like your ""home"" life to be. if you were to camp near the soundcamps on the edges of the city (9:30-10, 2-2:30) then things are definitely way louder at night and potentially a little less crazy during the day. 

At night, the areas around 6 o'clock can sometimes feel like when you're in the mall and the stores have all closed but you can still walk around. 

There's no one part of the city that's better than others (although I say the 9 o'clock sector is actually the best!) it's all driven by personal exploration and desires. There are AMAZING camps on the esplanade, and also AMAZING camps out on K in the suburbs. Every year the city is different and every year, visiting a camp is different, even if you've been there before. 

The dynamism of the city is created by the fact that unlike, say, going to a Starbucks anywhere  where the experience is largely similar and undifferentiated, no matter where you are, on playa going from one camp to another can be divergently different and engaging. That's what makes the city unique and engaging. 

The action is not in any one part of the city, the action IS the city. YOU are where all the action happens. At the end of the day, where you camp is just a location where you sleep eventually. There are super fun, interesting, engaging camps and activities in every part of the city, on every block. 

Especially if you've never been before, don't stress it. Some people swear by one side over another, or that like, 3 o'clock is weird but 7:30 is the jam, or whatever.

1. Yes it’s undoubtedly undergoing a cultural shift, though that’s been happening since the 90s. Unfortunately for the culture and event, the shift happening today is leading to some pretty indisputably bad things like more garbage by the roads. From my perspective the shift is mostly a result of the mainstreaming of the event in popular culture. It’s become a checklist item for the music festival crowd, quite unfortunately.

2. If nighttime feels like EDC to you it’s entirely because of how and where you spend your time on the playa. It feels nothing like EDC to me because I don’t really go to soundcamps any more (and I stay well away from Mayan Warrior etc) except to briefly marvel at how their scale increases every year. I spend my time at smaller camps in the city where you get more community than people trying to be part of a scene. One way isn’t better than another or anything, but if you spend your time at EDC-type places out there, that’s the experience you’re going to have.

emgo0gn,1556941881.0,pics,DancinginAshes,"I went in 2015, and the all-night soundcamps do point their speakers at the desert, but individual camps can play music pretty late, and the mutant sound vehicles tend to roam around a lot.  There is one section now that's specifically supposed to be quieter, for people who bring their kids, but it was on the opposite side of the city from us.

Last year I was Tier 3 VIP:  $269.00  +  $67.29  for Service Fees

I was in Dino Den:  $249.00 +  $73.47 .

I also paid  for Thursday Arrival: $49.00 + $12.24 for Service Fees (gets you into Pre-Party)

I don't think Ult covers the camping, but i'll get into that bit in a second.

Versus regular VIP (LAST YEAR, this might change): You're going to get a bunch of merch ($400 worth), and some exclusive merch no one else can buy during or after LL. A meet and greet with Excision, and access to the BBQ backstage on one of the days.  


VIP in the venue vs GA gets: Exclusive viewing areas to the side of both stages, with their own vending and bars, climate controlled bathrooms, and your own VIP lane for getting into the venue (I never waited more than 5 min to get in).  


Camping: Dino Den is closer to the venue, and supposed to have their own water fill stations, bathrooms, and exclusive showers.  On paper, it's grand. For the experience: a lot of things didn't go right, and for some of it, no amount of planning would've been able to fix it. I personally felt screwed over when I was tossed into the overflow dino den 2 area that didn't have any of the amenities of the Dino Den 1 area. I was essentially GA+, with closer access to the venue over the latter half of regular GA (if you look at the map). Doesn't mean that won't be fixed this year, but I bring it up simply because things may not always go exactly right.

&amp;#x200B;

GA WAS closer to the soundcamps, the place to be after the venue closed. RV is right at the front of GA, so just as close to about everything.

&amp;#x200B;

For the venue: at least go VIP imo. The climate control bathrooms were sooooo nice, and never was there a line that took more than 2 min (for guys). I'm hoping for Prehistoric Paradox they add a water filling station, but when water is $2 a bottle, it's not a huge deal to pay for one.

&amp;#x200B;

For Camping: regardless y ou should be buying Thurs arrival.  It'll get you as close as possible to the venue. I'd still recommend DD, because my complaints will likely (and hopefully) have been addressed for this year. I'm going to make an attempt at RV myself, because I want to be smack dab in the middle of Sound Camps and venue walk. Gonna rent one.

ebfljwl,1544371171.0,ElectricForest,kylewhatever,"I went to both last year! Here are my honest thoughts:

I am sure you have heard numerous rumors about things that happened at Lost Lands. Even with all the negativity about last year, I had an absolute blast. If Lost Lands could figure out their security issues and had more amenities for campers, it would have been a damn near perfect festival experience for me. 

The ONE thing that Lost Lands had on Electric Forest was the sound system. My god. Both stages rocked my soul to the core, especially during Kai Wachi and Snails (Bassnectar on a Lost Lands stage would be fucking insane by the way...)

As far as stage production, Lost Lands won that round. Forest obviously has more stages, but LL had suuuuper crispy screens and as I mentioned, the sound was perfect (Bassnectar's sound guy, Kyle, ran the sound booth for LL)

Size was pretty similar. Lost Lands felt like it had a ton more people because they had to increase the size of the venue for the capacity this year. However, getting through security was a breeze going into the venue. A lot faster than Forest (unless you have FitF)

Electric Forest has dope ass RV sets, LL has dope ass Soundcamp sets. The soundcamps at Lost Lands were soooo gnarly. One of the coolest experiences of my life

One thing that makes Electric Forest stand far above any festival is the amount of space you have to fuck around. The Forest is HUGE and full of mysteries that you will never experience everything in one weekend. There weren't any real mysteries at Lost Lands minus some secret sets. Not much to explore. 

If you have the opportunity, I would definitely do both! As long as you can handle heavy ass dubstep for a whole weekend, then you can definitely handle Lost Lands. 

If you had to choose one over the other, I'd choose Forest, of course :]

Food- those buffalo chicken tacos from the avocado place outside the sound camps were so good I almost cried haha. They brought me back to life Sunday morning.

Medical - I had to hail down a cart for someone who passed out coming up on something. They moved incredibly fast and were 100% on top of their shit.

Volunteers and generous neighbors - Even though water wasn’t super accessible the community as a whole made up for it. Everyone was looking out for each other for the most part.

Yeah there are some career criminals that come to these things that are for sure scum bags selling gross things and looking to screw people over... but in my experience that is the 0.01%.

As this year was our first burn, I think myself and lilac_meddow did alright. I live and travel in my RV, and have means to live offgrid (adequate waste tanks, 2 2000w gennys, one of which kicked the dust [temporarily I hope] which meant no AC, but we were still able to run a fan inside and keep the house batteries charged). We did bring waaay too much water (not a bad thing), we drank about 18-20 gallons, had another 20+ gallons of drinking water in large containers, and obviously had the freshwater tank in the RV (50 gallons) full for things like shower, toilet, dishes. 

If you do bring an RV, keep in mind your fridge may not work very well (we used the freezer to keep things cool as the fridge ran 50-60 degrees, yes we had thermometers in each). Cold lemon water became my favorite drink of choice during the hot hours. We had mostly non-perishable foods...throw a can of soup or a packet of indian food out on the sunny playa to heat up. Lavender oil/water in a spraybottle and baby wipes kept us ""fresh"" all week.

One hack we had to make was making sure the RV didn't heat up in the morning hours so we could sleep and because once its hot, its difficult to cool down with the decreased airflow of the addition of filters on the windows and vents.

We used two pop-up canopies, and attached some side-walls between the canopies and the roof of the RV, and secured it all with lag screws and ratchet straps.

ctgsnwq,1437929652.0,BurningMan,sovamind,"Not clear if the title is in reference to Robot Heart (it appears so) but I think that videos like this one are one of the reasons for the rapid shift in perception about what Burning Man is as an event.  If I were to show this video to someone that didn't have any idea of what Burning Man was, I believe they would come away thinking that Burning Man is an electronic music festival.  This isn't necessarily bad, but I believe that as a community we should strive to show the other parts of the Burning Man experience.

What do I mean by this?

Well, I'd love to see a video that shows people of all ages and shapes. I'd also like to see a video that shows more people of color, and with disabilities.  It can show the soundcamps and rave experience but it should also show people sitting in the shade in camps talking.  It should show people filling up and drinking water bottles.  More time should be spent showing not only people having fun, but experience exhaustion, confusion, and even sadness and pain.  I want to see people sweating and swearing as they try and put up that shade structure.  Pictures of rebar going into the ground and blood oozing out of the hand from that fresh cut.  I want to see Rangers and LEO dealing with conflict, and maybe even someone in handcuffs.  The art should be shown in a way that emphasizes the size and interactivity.  Music that isn't electronic should be shown (and part of soundtrack) including some of the places that have live bands or even classical instruments like the person I found playing cello one year. Lastly, more shots of people hugging, sharing, gifting, and building community.

If a video existed that showed all this in a 5 minute piece, I believe that it could have a huge impact on the perception of the event and how Burning Man is more than just a rave and beautiful people having fun. Being a Burner is more than is ever shown in these slick videos and I believe that videos such as this are a disservice to our community and maintaining the ethos of the event.  I also realize that some of these things are not things that BORG would like shown, but I think that things such as LEO interactions do shape the event and are an important part of the experience.

Finally, as a Burner, I come to you not just with this criticism but as someone that is willing help to make such a video.  I believe in all the principals including some of the forgotten ones such as Civic Responsibility, Immediacy, and Self-Reliance.  So I'm offering to help make such a video happen.  Video isn't my medium as I am more of a photographer and writer, but the elements of story telling and a good visual eye are the same.  If you'd like to help me make this happen, please contact me directly.

Thank you!

Story:

I'm sure you've all seen those groups at night following someone with a unique looking glowy-thing on a pole up in the air?

yeah, well one of my friends did this at a regional burn with an extendable pole and a battery-powered LED xmas tree light. she got tired of carrying it around and it was handed to me. AND I LOVED IT. swooping it around, floating it over strangers and generally giving it a personality was SUPER AWESOME.. and because i ""handled"" it in a certain way.. my camp always found it easy to find me/us. 

so for BM 2012 i decided that i needed to build my own. grabbed a SUPER extendy pole and some LED lights from walmart on the way down (in i'm Vancouver), some zipties and BOOM. good to go.

the beacon (aka the pole+LED lights) extends from handy, walking staff length of ~6ft to 25ft of swingy, drift-over-strangers, stick-into-passing-windows, high-five-other-passing-beacons amazingness.

it was a great toy for me at night and all of my campmates loved it as it was so easy to find on playa, on/around art cars and in soundcamps. on burn night we left camp with 21 people and still had 16 together at sunrise. madness.
(i didn't try and ""steer the boat"" though.. just floated along with the concensus of where to go next.. following the general social inertia of the group)

Don't waste your time and your money  
Don't waste your time and your money  
This company has their only curators and they will give you some BS at the beginning just to show that they are working on it  
I created a campaign for 3 songs, 1 in Ingles and 2 in Portuguese  
The Portuguese listeners or curators never got the chance to review and decide if the song are good for them to add to the playlist  
instead, they sent my songs to curators that have music styles that have nothing to do with my style of songs  
I may make a mistake by selecting songs styles when I created the campaign just to give more chance to reach out to more listeners  
But they did not have the music professionalism to listen to the songs and look for the correct curators with the styles of the same song that meet the genre of my songs  
I spend over $ 300.00 for this Campaign which gave me 0 results  
At the same time, I spend $ 15.00 on Spotify Studio gave over 194K Impression, and help to get more listeners  
Out of 3 songs, Portuguese songs 1 got 7 reviews and the other got 6 reviews saying No can do. The other one in Ingles got 5 reviews and 1 curator add to his Hip Hop playlist
